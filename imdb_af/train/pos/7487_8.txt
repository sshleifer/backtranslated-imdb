I really enjoyed this movie because I have a lot of interest in American history ... the Antebellum year and especially the Civil War. I recently bought it from a range of previously viewed videos for sale at the supermarket and I was delighted to add this one to my video collection history. Although not of the caliber Civil War films such as "Glory" or "Gettysburg", it offers much history to the pre-civil war fraternity under cadet at West Point. Perhaps it is the gray uniforms, the youth or the military discipline, but I am fascinated by the story of the Cadet Corps from about 1830 to the edge of the war. I think how it should have been to sit with other young men in a classroom, learn how to make war, and then use the lessons against your own classmates later! <br /> <br /> In fact, there were two classes in 1861: one in May, the other in June. the movie does not make it right, except to call Henry A. DuPont, first graduate of the May class; and George Custer, last grade of the June class. The reason for the two classes was not so much about the war, but it was the result of a switch to a four-year course, after a few years of experimenting with a five-year course (I think the first class has five year, the other for four). As the film portrays, cadets were like brothers and often nicknamed each other ... George "Fanny" or "Autie" Custer; Alonzo "Lon" Cushing; James "Beauty" Stuart (for JEB Stuart, class of 1854), etc. <br /> <br /> I say this movie is "Santa Fe Trail" as it should have been because that 1940 movie, while it's nice, really fudge history. Cadets from different classes are all graduated together. JEB Stuart and George Custer are portrayed as the best friends and are juxtaposed to stop John Brown's resurrection at Harper's Ferry. In fact, Stuart and Custer were never friends, but enemies during the war. They confronted each other in 1863 in Gettysburg (Stuart was at the Harper's Ferry Raid, but Custer was another cadet at the point when it took place.) <br /> <br /> "Fanny" Custer plays a role "Class of '61," although his classmates are chums, Dev O'Neill and Shelby Peyton fiction. I believe they're based on Partick Henry O'Rorke and John Pelham, two people you can look up to. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I really enjoy this movie or any movie that offers a window in the mid-19th century America.
