Let me be the first non-Australian to comment on this :) I got the movie for Hugo Weaving and I watched it to the end. This is one of those "drama of life" movies, as my mom called a movie depicting a real life story with no extraordinary events and it is mostly descriptive. <br /> <br /> I like the light and the girls. The rest was without too much mistake, but not too much merit. I longed for something like The Interview, or at least a matrix villain here and there, but nothing extraordinary. The story teaches one to doubt your own destiny and break the environment that others are building for you, but this happens when the life giving peach plant in the area is close. So it doesn't mean much of an attempt to change things. <br /> <br /> The "smart" American Beauty song in the background could be part of a bigger soundtrack, but only the one who played over and over became annoying after 100 minutes of film. <br /> <br /> In the end, I think it did his job to present a part of Australian life, but it doesn't look specific to my Australian (it could have been placed anywhere) and it doesn't look attractive as a story. <br /> <br /> I think you should be in a mood to keep the movie.
