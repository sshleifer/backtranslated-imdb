Religious despair is prevalent everywhere. Australia is not immune to it. <br /> <br /> A dingo hit a baby and the mother was tried and sent to jail for killing her baby. I don't mean to spoil the story for you, but you need to know the basics before you get deep in the knee causing this woman to find herself in a prison. <br /> <br /> Buying or renting the movie and rent discover how deeply-trapped human hatred of those who differ is still thriving around the world. <br /> <br /> It is a moving movie featuring immense role players. <br /> <br /> Both Meryl Streep (with her well-known Aussie accent) and Sam Neill, whose accent is his verdict, are outstanding. Those with supporting roles are also very good. <br /> <br /> You will remember this movie for many years. <br /> <br /> See it!
