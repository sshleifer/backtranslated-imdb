Michael Stearns plays Mike, a sexually frustrated individual with an interesting moral attitude towards sexuality. He has no problem listening to naked dancers, but when women start sex with men, it is when he loses it. He believes that when women actually have sex, that is when they lose any sense of "innocence" and / or "beauty". So he walks through the Hollywood Hills, who love the couples at a distance, and eventually the men are shooting dead with a high-pitched gun. <br /> <br /> The apparent primary reason for the film's existence is to enjoy sex activity over and over. The "story" comes down as more of an afterthought. This will make many happy heterosexual men very comfortable, as we treat enough elongated facial expressions (the ladies here look very good sense clothes) and sex to serve as a big dose of titillation. Of course, seeing a fair share of it by a magnitude of the creepiness factor significantly illustrates the coercion for voyeurism. (For one thing, Mike's couples walk through the range for minutes at a time before the trigger is finally pulled.) It's all underlined by terrifying as well as somewhat atmospheric music on the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Those with a penchant for lurid trash are bound to enjoy it for some degree. It even includes one lesbian trick that confronts Mike and makes him unclear how to react. It deployed at a very slow pace, but turned up with a most amusing ironic twist. It's a kinky and twisted rarity that, if nothing else, will keep some viewers glued to the screen. <br /> <br /> 7/10
