What can I say that "The Haunting" was not mentioned? It has everything that would make a good picture. Wonderful sets, moody music and sound design to die for were all in place. The script, sometimes, sometimes shocks the mind in such a strange, surreal way. The whole team must have forgotten to read through, perhaps because they were too busy creating and creating gothic sets to see how poor the plot was. Every member of the cast gives a dignified performance, but with little conviction on the material on hand. Lili Taylor has the most to do while the other mostly responds to her. But it's about it. All I can say is that it was a little pleasant two hours, but you will definitely want more. Much more.
