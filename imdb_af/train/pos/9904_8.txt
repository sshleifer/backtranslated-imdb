Slaughter High is about a boy named Marty. He was harassed and picked up in high school. A group of children played several pranks on him, and these pranks were really bad. The last prank ended tragically. <br /> <br /> cue up to 5 years later. The gang of children again meets for a reunion. One of them set it up at the old high school. The school is now deserted and they have to break in. For some reason the Janitor is still there, but he tells them to go ahead and have fun because they give him a beer. <br /> <br /> They start partying and watching their old lockers, and they see something from Marty's. One girl feels sorry for Marty, but another man makes her calm. <br /> <br /> When death starts, it's wonderful. Every death is creative and stingy. We see a figure in a masonry mask and hunt them one by one throughout the school. It looks like Marty is back after the revenge. After the first person was killed, they found out they were locked in the school. They are looking for a way out. <br /> <br /> There are a number of illogical things in this movie. First, I don't know anyone who has a 5 year reunion. Secondly, after the first child dies, a girl gets blood over her. They all run away in panic, but walk to the bathroom and find a bath. Hrr's friend has just been murdered, and she decides to take a bath! More importantly, why is there a bath in a school bathroom? Anyway, the bath doesn't really seem to work .... and she dies a terrible death. It's an 80-year-old movie. it is an abuser. WHO Make sure it contains illogical parts. I don't do one. This movie has very large deaths. The end .... there is a twist. Having recently seen Haute Spanning, I can compare the two. The only way they are similar is that there is a twist, what kind of disappointed me ..... IT just after the turn, comes a good, if not the best, death in the movie. <br /> <br /> After the last murder, watch the killer go to the screen and do something crazy, and that was the perfect way to end the movie. It went to me "wow ..."
