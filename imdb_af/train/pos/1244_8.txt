I only saw the film on television a few years ago and it honestly said. Charles Dance is one of the frightening villains anyone can imagine. His sophistication is such a perfect contrast to the cruel good hero. I've never been so much to an Eddie Murphy fan, but find his annoying portrayal here a winner: a little "Axel Foley Through the Looking Glass". Charlotte Lewis is using a chopped phrase, but the only one appropriate is beautiful. Some scenes have been created wonderfully: the dream sequence, the bird, the foolish fights, and the climatic confrontation. All of this, Murphy is the modern man suddenly in an oriental myth, a stunned and quieter version of Kurt Russell in his eastern fantasy skirt. Like that movie, we have James Hong, the incomparable actor whose scenes, anyway, even increase the quality of Derek. Since 1955, Hong has defined the fine supporting actor, the "class law" of his profession. "The Golden Child" is stupid; it is not perfect; but it has so many redeeming features that it is a pleasant and amusing fantasy, which is worth watching. After four years I saw the Golden Child again. I enjoyed it even more! It's really nice.
