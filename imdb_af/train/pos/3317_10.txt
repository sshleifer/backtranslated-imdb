Bette Midler is again divine! Very humorous. In the love of Burlesque. Able to bring you tears either with old jokes with new dresses or just with old songs with more power and punch than ever. All in all, new ballads are singing, which the good old / perennials like "The Rose" sing; "Stay with me" and yes, even "Wind under my wings". The Best Way to Divine Miss. To appreciate, has always been listened to. Being the next best thing, I highly recommend to anyone with a mix of adult-wide eyes, enchantment and appreciation and a child's ominous desire to push all boundaries!
