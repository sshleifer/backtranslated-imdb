With a minimal budget, a run of eight minutes and a great imagination, Nacho Vigalondo achieved one of the most moving shorts I've ever seen. The subtle of the script is really remarkable, as it does not give the end to the last moment. <br /> <br /> Don't let anyone tell you what's going on, as you'll be able to enjoy it much more. Nacho Vigalondo is the discovery of the year for his one-man show: directing, writing and acting in this formidable short is the most remarkable effort I've seen in years. Also note the performance of Marta Belenguer, her reaction shots are incredible. <br /> <br /> Overall rating: 8/10
