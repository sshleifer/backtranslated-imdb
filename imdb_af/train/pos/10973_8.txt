Excellent movie showing the pathetic lives of two brave old ladies. They couldn't live together, and not apart. Babbel constantly, sometimes at the same time, sharpened and sat down the past; go on and on what coulda shoulda woulda. I sometimes laughed at myself, but mostly I was taken with the utmost sadness and left these two women were. See this one.
