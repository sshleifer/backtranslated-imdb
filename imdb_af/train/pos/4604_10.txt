This movie is without a doubt a perfect 10/10. For all of your people there who lower this movie because it doesn't have a good plot or something like that, it's ridiculous and says a Jackie Chan movie is bad. Because of his plot, it's like saying a porn movie is bad because it doesn't have a plot! you look at Jackie Chan for the screens because the action is not so much focused on a good story or something, as you watch it make movies and compare it to other American movies of that era and even later you will realize that Jackie Chan's movies had top fights and not really good plots, while American movies had good plots, but shitty action scenes compared to what Jackie Chan did at the time. Porn is watched for porn, Jackie Chan is watching for the action, I think you people are bad because there is no plot because you think that's how a clever film critic will judge a good movie, but that way what i see is a good movie is a movie that can entertain me. Probably the middle of the movie was boring, very USED, but put it so, the rest that all the action scenes and stunts are paying a lot for it. It changed the way American action flags were created, they even have screens from this movie. If you want a real man, then a real entertainer is this movie and much more of Jackie Chan's, anyway pure. He literally makes American movies like a walk in the park, and even in TODAYS movies. American movies rely so much on special effects and security threads and stunt doubles and so much more. Police storyline and many other Jackie Chan films are works of a true entertainer who just comes out and is very talented in what he can do. a masterpiece
