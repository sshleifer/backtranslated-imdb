It must be a running joke about Bonanza about how deadly it is that any woman gets involved in any Cartwright man. After all, Ben Cartwright was three times a widow with a son at each marriage. And any woman involved with Adam, Hoss and Little Joe would die because we couldn't get rid of the widow's formula and the three boys who started this classic TV western. <br /> <br /> Perhaps if Bonanza is done today, the authors would have had characters from the rotatable women who came in and out of the Cartwrights. People have relationships, some go well, some are not so good, it's just life. And we are less demanding of our heroes today, so if a relationship with one of them goes to the south, we don't have to end the character to keep the survivors' nobility intact. But that's when Bonanza is done today. <br /> <br /> But we still expected many of our Western heroes and Bonanza, although it took a while to hold on and a change of viewing time from NBC certainly helped, Bonanza's secret success was the noble patriarch Ben Cartwright and his stalwart boys. Ben Cartwright was the ideal TV dad in any genre you want to call. His whole life was spent in the hard work of spreading that great Ponderosa for his three children. The children were all different in personality, but everyone got together in a pinch. <br /> <br /> The Cartwrights have become and remains an American institution. I did care more for this family than the Kennedys. Only the popularity Bonanza has in syndication testifies to this. <br /> <br /> Pernell Roberts as oldest son Adam was written from the show. Rumor has it, he didn't care for the noble Cartwright characters he felt on the saint. Perhaps, if it's done now, he would have been better off the way I described it. <br /> <br /> It was just the start for Michael Landon, how many people get three hit programs for their credit. Landon also has highway to heaven and small house on the Prarie where he had creative control. Little Joe was the youngest, hottest head, but the most romantic of the Cartwrights. <br /> <br /> When Roberts is gone. The show continued with the two younger boys, but when Dan Blocker left, the heart went out of Bonanza. Other characters were added at that time, David Canary, Tim Matheson, and Ben Cartwright adopted the young Mitch Bird. But big, loyal, but a little thick Hoss was easily the favorite of the Cartwrights. His sudden downfall after the operation left too much a hole in the family. <br /> <br /> The Cartwrights of the Ponderosa have thus passed in history. I had a real taste of how America took the Cartwrights to heart when I visited the real Virginia City. It doesn't look like you see in Bonanza. But near Lake Tahoe, just where you see the Ponderosa on the map at the opening credits, the Cartwright House, the set is maintained and open as a tourist attraction. Like 21 Baker Street for Sherlock Holmes fans, the ranchhouse and the Cartwrights are real. <br /> <br /> And if they weren't real, they should have been.
