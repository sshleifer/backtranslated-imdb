I didn't expect to keep this movie as much as I did. I did it just because I saw it on the list of Top 25 most controversial movies of all time. It doesn't look very good. I was pleasantly surprised to find that this is one of the most cleverly composed films of recent memory. <br /> <br /> It's about a twenty-year-old woman wants to know everything. She stores all the information she collects in a huge archive. She is experimenting with experience in sex, political activism and human relationships. Meanwhile, the film's crew is shown to make the film and we see their reactions to the story and to each other. Nudity, explicit sex and controversial politics showed this movie in the US while its Customs seizure was seized. The film is a story, but it is a documentary that shows us the background of the filmmakers during the story, the fourth wall is broken. This movie is the most direct way to make a movie I've ever seen. The film works predominantly as a time capsule of 1960s psychedelic action, freedom fight and sexual liberation. I like to think so much more than that. <br /> <br /> I didn't think I'd waste my time with the blue version of this movie, but I actually do. This movie is a buried treasure. Give it a try.
