Yes, the plot is predictable; Yes, there are some plot holes; Yes, it has made a TV quality; and yes, Britney Spears wrote the book with obvious self-promotion. <br /> <br /> But forget about it all ... this movie is fun. <br /> <br /> Fun in an aftercare Special kind of way, but fun. <br /> <br /> Virginia Madsen if the mom does a good job ... so good that I'm going to watch her movies. She reminded me of Diane Lane for all the good reasons. <br /> <br /> The rest of the team also does a good job. If I were a deciding agent, I would explore some of these young actors. <br /> <br /> The production values ​​are above the regular TV standards and the music was very good ... better than many big-budget movies I've seen. <br /> <br /> If you're in the mood for the German noir, this movie isn't for you. If you want a safe, fun and understated movie, it's a good one. It's one that you can show to your 10 year old daughter, but also enjoy it yourself.
