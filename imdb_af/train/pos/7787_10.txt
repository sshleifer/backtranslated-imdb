This movie captures the essence of growing up in smalltown America for a young girl on her own. Realism and subtle nuances presented to Ashley Judd's character, Ruby, are captured by the storyline that can only be described as a true-to-life environment in Florida's pan trade. From the sharpening of a screen door, the lack of work, the echoes of what life really is to the "neck riviera", it offers rough choices for the young girl. Paradise didn't come easily. But she slowly overcomes obstacles and deceit, and learns to be her own wife, with a force flowing from within. Ashley Judd's winning smile, and contagious gait gives off warmth and commands respect and admiration. The cautious pace of character development resembles the "Ulee's Gold" in 1997, with Peter Fonda, and also Victor Nunez.
