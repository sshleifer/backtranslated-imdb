I caught the last half of this movie one night on the cable and hit by how morbi it was. Even when one of the two victims is getting worse at its best, the camera remains on. The dipping shots of his body are exposed and his concentration camp figure is fitted into a lifting bag, moving as well as depressed. Don't see this movie if you're already depressed. don't look again or your feeling really feels good.
