This movie is great! Brad Pitt will never be able to work out the performances he has given in this movie. Duchovny was, like Forbes and Lewis. The 4 main characters start with a scenic road tour of historic murder sites, in one of the coolest cars ever made, 1960's Lincoln Continental model. Early Grace is a simplification with a taste for dry toothbrushes and carnage. He likes his women not swearing or smoking, and wearing PWT dresses. Duchovny and Forbes are a few artists of the city, while Early and Lewis are outlandish parkers. Although the majority tone in the movie is dark, there are many funny scenes to have. The writing, directing and acting is brilliant. If you like movies, murder, humor and narration, watch this movie. Everybody delivers, and you will want more when the credits roll. One of my all-time favorites. "Hey, shave that dog, learn to hunt!"
