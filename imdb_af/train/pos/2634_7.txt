Lion King 1 1/2 is a fun and addictive sequel. Don't expect the production values ​​of a theater release, but expect the highest quality right after video release. <br /> <br /> It's set up as Timon & Pumba starts watching the original Lion King in a darkened theater and suddenly shovels and begins to tell their own story. This is done with regular comic interruptions. For example, at a particular moment, a retail store for commercial stores is popping up, and a coveted Pumba realizes he is sitting on the remote. These little moments pepper the movie, and whether you find them entertaining or not, will largely depend on your sense of humor. If you are particularly hurt by movies that the viewer reminiscent of, look at a movie if it is not your cup of tea. <br /> <br /> Animation is the best thing they've invested in the Disney DTV line, and is almost seamlessly integrated with the original material. The newer, independent material uses much of the artistic style of the original. The voice talents were all well done, but I couldn't help thinking Marge Simpson every time I heard Julie Kavner. <br /> <br /> Many of the jokes in the film will be well-recognized by viewers, such as re-inventing generations, but being offered more with the familiarity of comfortable aging friends as annoying repetitive. <br /> <br /> The music made me realize how much I enjoyed and missed a good musical integrated with a Disney feature. The tapping feature of 'Dig A Tunnel' is well choreographed and hilarious. Timon and Pumba take on the opening of the Lion King and their introduction to paradise is also amusing. The only problem was the repetition of the 'Dig A Tunnel' at the end of the movie, to change and download his lyrics from the defeatist to lifting. <br /> <br /> Storyline is pretty well done, and the integration of new Plate elements is done almost perfectly, although the final bit during the rushed hyena has stretched the story credibility a bit. The new story doesn't seem to handle saccharine or emotionally charged moments, and it does better than full-fledged comedy. <br /> <br /> Overall, worth buying. If you like all the bonus features that exist with a typical 2-disk kit, go for it. For the penny pincher who is still willing to invest on a good movie, wait for it to drop four or more dollars and start renting it immediately. <br /> <br /> Damion Crowley.
