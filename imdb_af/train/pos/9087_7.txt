Saxophoneist Ronnie Bowers (Dick Powell) wins a studio contract and goes to Hollywood. He stays with Hollywwod Hotel (of course). At the same time, big selfish star Mona Marshall (Lola Lane) has a tantrum and refuses to attend the premiere of her new movie. In a panic, the studio rents Virginia (Rosemary Lane) to personalize her and Bowers took her to the premiere. Not to tell him it's not Marshall. Of course they fall in love. You can find out the rest of the plot itself well. <br /> <br /> The plot is old (to put it beautifully), but Powell and Rosemary Lane make a very pleasant couple and have beautiful singing voices. The score is good (highlighted by "Hooray for Hollywood") and director Busby Berkeley shows off his unique visual art exhibits in a very nice run-in-musical sequence (with Edgar Kennedy making his patented slow burn). Glenda Farrell also has some funny pieces like Mona's sister Jonesie. <br /> <br /> However, the movie is not that good. The rest of the movie is furious and most of the humor is just not funny. Lola Lane is just trying to play Mona for comedy. There is also racism - a stereotypical black girl is playing for the laugh and at one stage there is really terrible racist humor. That's probably what keeps most of the time off TV. I realize it was accepted at the time, but it comes out as a revolt today. <br /> All in all, a so-so movie with serious problems is helped by a good role and some good songs. I give it a 7.
