Most of the Atomic Age monster movies I watched on television as a kid, and some of them, including the BLOB, scared the daylight from me. Films like INVADERS VAN MARS made it all too clear to us, "little braai" that children should not be trusted when it comes to things like the world invaded; The BLOB just repeated the fact. I remember, sad, late-night stays, watching Body Snatchers and Martian Invaders and Blobs sow in an unsuspecting society. In the early 1980s, there was a summer when a local science museum (in Richmond, Virginia) ran an Atomic classic every weekend. These were 16mm movies, and most were black and white (and the projector was noisy) and the "color" print of the BLOB faded into a light pink, but it was nice. I dragged my mom and she enjoyed it as much as I did. It was there at that science museum that I really fell in love with the BLOB. The filmmaker's intention, of course, was to make money - but it was the sincerity of everyone involved, from the filmmakers to the "talent" (the players) that made me fall in love with this movie. Corny? You bet. Wink? They no longer get cheesier. But, man, what a movie!
