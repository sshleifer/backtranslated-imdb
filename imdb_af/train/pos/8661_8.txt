I have enjoyed a series of order and order criminal rights long ago. Kathryn Erbe, Det. Alexandra Eames, the female detective, is pretty hard and looks bitterly bitter in the Criminal Intent Series. See her other side in this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie shows the wonderful soft side of these talented actresses and if you are a Criminal Intent fan, this movie is a fairy tale in her play and you get a nice thing. yarn of family hardship in the south. <br /> <br /> I didn't like Albert Finney's role in this movie because he did such a convincing acting work from the older South African that is difficult and intolerant and unacceptable to change. He reminds me of so many men of my youth and the portrayal is divine, but you will probably find it difficult to find in this movie. <br /> <br /> Katryn Erbe is easy to keep in this movie and why I recommend it as a 10 star for Criminal Intent, law and order fans.
