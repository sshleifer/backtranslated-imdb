One of my favorite "domestic" movies. I don't know if anyone in our country has not seen this movie! It is funny and sad at a few moments ... I don't know how people in the world (who had the opportunity to see it) accept this movie because you need a few moments in our Serbian history and Serbia's character knows the first half of the 20th century to understand it! But as I see here, there is someone from Canada who watched it ... and he liked it. <br /> <br /> I think I'll try to put all the good quotes from the movie on this site, but first to find out how to do it. <br /> <br /> Cheers.
