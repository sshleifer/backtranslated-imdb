My left foot is an epic outstanding film explaining the life and times of Christy Brown, who had cerebral palsy, a severe disability and used his left foot, but he was challenging. He succeeded in becoming an artist and writer against everyone. the chance <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie many times and every time I see it, I find it equally brilliant every time. I wonder how this amazing movie didn't win an Oscer for the best picture, it's a shambles by academy awards. Jim Shirdan is one of the world's greatest directors. The screenplay, music and anything else is great in this movie. As the film is underway, you will almost feel in the brown household. Like MacAnally and Brenda Fricker are wonderful, as Cristie's parents and Fiona Shaw are as brilliant as Dr Eileen Cole, who helps Christy on his battle of challenge. <br /> <br /> The Irish film industry has noticed me a lot before my left foot. My left foot was the start of a wonderful period in the Irish movie. films as powerful and brilliant as the field, the crying game, in the name of the father and Michael Collins followed my left foot. These Irish films were considered so high in the world and were nominated for various Oscers and won some. A wonderful time for Irish film. My left foot is a powerful, outstanding movie. Daniel Day Lewis plays the cripple Christy Brown as well and so brilliantly, as does Hugh o Conner who plays young Christy. Those two performances are two of the best film performances, especially Daniel Day-Lewis's performance, which I consider as high as Antony Hopkins in the silence of the lambs. In his career, Daniel Day-Lewis proved that he was a good actor. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie masterpiece, watch it!
