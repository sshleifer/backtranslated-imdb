This is an excellent movie. The role-play is a good combination of characters and the story is decent. The movie is basically about a well-educated doctor stealing the bodies of dead brides and taking them to his home. Once the bodies are at his home, he removes things (I hate such a general term, but I forget how it was removed) and put it in his wife to keep her youth. Then a reporter, Patricia Hunter, investigates the situation and begins to find answers to why the brides are dying. She takes a trip to the doctor's house and the interesting things start to happen. Definitely this guy, but good if you can.
