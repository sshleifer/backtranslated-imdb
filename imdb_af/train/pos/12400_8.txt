This is the second Animatrix short, and the first of them is what can be called "artistic". It contains many references, metaphors and symbols in the dense amount of material, especially with a running time of 9 minutes. I heard a few complaints that it was "anti-human" or trying to hate people, for their sins against the machine. I don't think that's true; It only uses the robots to show us, that we as humans are not specifically accepted or open to anyone other than ourselves. I'll say it does a good job of it. The plot is good ... it plays as a historical document and tells what led to one of the main conflicts in the trilogy. So it keeps clips of fictitious news reports and the like. The tuner is very good, if not much of it. The animation is nice, and the use of color, despite the usually realistic drawing style, makes it more open to the smooth transitions and other surreal images. It has a few pieces of strong violence and disturbing imagery, as well as some nudity. The disc contains a comment, not in English, but subtitles, and worth listening / reading. There is also a well done and informative, based on both parts, so I would recommend viewing it after seeing the next one as well. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys the Matrix universe and / or science fiction in general. 8/10
