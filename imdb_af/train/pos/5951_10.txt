Stylishly oriented, pleasantly photographed and brilliantly done ?? Crosby's interpretation looks exactly right, Hardwicke has his best role ever, while Bendix is ​​also a treat? This Yankee's appeal is universal and irresistible. <br /> <br /> Of course, one of the most important joys of the movie is the songs. As expected, Bing is in good voice. And though Hardwicke's solo is cut, we can still hear him singing, as he is dancing with Crosby and Bendix in their famous novelty, "Busy Doing Nothing". It is also a surprise to hear Rhonda Fleming, who, although she has had an extensive stage and concert career as a singer, rarely gets a chance to be heard in the theater. She has a beautiful voice that looks more than his mysterious? And she looks very picky in her Mary Kay Dodson costumes. <br /> <br /> Director Tay Garnett makes the most of his cute budget, with all the resources in turn offering each fabulous scene as effectively as possible. (Perhaps the eclipse seems a bit too crazy, but who complains?) In short, as the trailer actually describes, an entertainment thrill begins from beginning to end.
