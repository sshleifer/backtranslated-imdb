This film is one of the best of all time, certainly in the horror genre. The claustrophobic atmosphere is excellent, the music is just as good as the movie and the killer is as dirty as it can be! Actors are fantastic, RIP Donald Pleasance you were fantastic like Dr Loomis, he even made the movie even better. Without him, the film would be missing an important ingredient. Jamie Lee Curtis is also great when our beloved screams queen! Her innocence makes her unaware of the real evil that is going on until she has murdered her friends in the house, which is, of course, one of the best acting games. She gives a tremendous achievement. I loved this movie because it rushed me like hell when I saw it in the early 80's and I still watch it to this day as it is a wonderful movie that only brings you into this world where you like a fish can be. at every turn! The fact that it is a simple format of a crazy man in a mask who has escaped from a spiritual asylum and is ready to kill everyone without having any idea that he is there is just scary and scary give you even more in the movie than the events, although fiction could become easy. We all know that unfortunately unfortunately exists in this world and a crazy man with a knife is definitely not uncommon, a very disturbing deep fear of all this. Death at any turn. Of course, Halloween shows it in the most frightening way. Horror must be credible, and it makes the movie enjoyable. It's just a simple story made in an excellent and frightening atmosphere. As well as Psycho's wonderful story, which I both love, I believe there are formats that offer the best horror. For me, Halloween and Psycho are the best movies I've ever seen and I'll see them all my life and never get tired of them. Halloween is undoubtedly one of the best movies of all time.
