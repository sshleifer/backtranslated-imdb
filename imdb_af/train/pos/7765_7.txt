Douglas Sirk puts this exaggerated drama on the unfortunate wealth. Kyle Hadley (Robert Stack) and Mitch Wayne (Rock Hudson) are young friends with different views on life. Kyle is the female son of an oil magnate; Mitch works for the Hadley Oil Company. Both fall in love with the same woman, Lucy Moore; but it is Kyle who has the means to pull her off her feet and marry her. Sister Marylee (Dorothy Malone) looks after the town's nymphomania and carries a torch for Mitch, who always seems to be cleaning the Hadley's knives. Ambitious with pretense; A little over it, but the stars make it a movie to watch. I was very impressed with Malone. Completion of the cast: Robert Keith, Edward Platt, John Lurch and Robert J. Wilke.
