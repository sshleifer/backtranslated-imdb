I loved October Sky. The thing I loved most was the music. It worked two ways: in the first hour of the movie, it gave the viewer a time frame. This is done by playing songs from the late fifties. In the second hour, an instrumental score takes over. The music fits perfectly into the sphere of the movie. <br /> <br /> I didn't just enjoy the music but also the movie. Jake Gyllenhaal as Homer Hickam was a surprise to me. He delivered a first-rate performance, such as Chris Owen (Quentin) and Chris Cooper (John Hickam). <br /> <br /> I saw this movie about the escape of life that's been explained to you twice, and both times I thoroughly enjoyed myself.
