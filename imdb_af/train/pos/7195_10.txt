I loved this exciting republic! The story was one of the best I've ever seen! Even tough, the picture quality was not the best, but OK. The fence in this series is also a bit bad, but not terrible. They just had to practice even more. As I said, the story is great! You just sit there waiting to find out who Don Del Oro is! The theme music is excellent! It's the same man who beat the music for Walt Disney's version of Zorro, which hits the Fightin Legion music. Costumes and buildings are very good. Zorro is really cool and so are the legions! I recommend this series. Buy it! <br /> <br /> I love Reed Hadley playing Zorro! He is funny, smart and brave! Point: 6.
