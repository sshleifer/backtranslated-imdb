I thought this movie was much better than most film critics give it credit. Although it has its confusing parts of the plot, it doesn't affect your understanding of the movie. If that is said, if you are not open to more liberal political ideas, then it is probably not the movie for you. I thought all the actors in the movie were outstanding. Every character had their funny moments and the audience at the Tribeca Film Festival laughed the whole thing. I thought the satire was a bit on top in one particular area, but it was deliberately done. John Cusack is right that although it is set in the future, it really makes you see the present.
