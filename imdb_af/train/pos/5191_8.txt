Scott is right. The best 2 person sword game ever placed on film in the middle of this movie. The sword fighting with several fighters is not the best, although it is very good. However, the battle in the middle is best, even when compared to Japanese samurai movies. In my opinion, Chinese sword games have never overtaken the Japanese in terms of entertainment value. Especially in scenes where one man has to fight a group of enemies, Japanese movies become excellent, such as the Lone Wolf and Cub series. Although twin in the Japanese movie lasts only seconds or a minute, the sheer intensity of those moments made them better. But this is one example where Chinese sword play exceeds the Japanese. The scene in the middle of this movie was a five-minute battle with the most wonderful choreography ever. The other battles in this movie are also good, but even if they suck, this movie will get a 7 for that one scene. If you haven't seen it, you should. John Woo is the man.
