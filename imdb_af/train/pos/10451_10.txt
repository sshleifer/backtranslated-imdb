"Before Sunrise" is a wonderful love story and should ever be at my Top 5 favorite movies. Dialogue and acting are wonderful. I love the characters and their ideas and thoughts. Of course, the romantic Vienna introduced in the film does not exist (you will not find a poet at the river in the middle of the night) and it is not possible to get to all the places just one night not, or (especially if you are a stranger and this is your first night in Vienna). But that's not the point. The relationship between the two characters is much more important and this part of the story is not at all unrealistic. Although, nothing really happens, the movie never gets boring. The end is really sad without being "Titanic" or something. Even if you don't love love stories, you should see this movie! I'm a little skeptical about the sequel to be released this summer. The first part is perfect as it is, in my opinion.
