really great movie, one of the best I've seen. Touch and simple - just like life, sometimes you cry, you laugh and it's just beautiful. Not too much of anything, just as it is supposed to be. Actually, the idea of ​​the movie is love, nobody is bad or good, everyone or just people, sometimes mistakes are mostly due to the pressure of society, everyone tries to stay strong and some succeed more than others and most importantly you not having reasons to get angry - you can do it, but ultimately the anger goes away and then you must return love again, although it is difficult, lies true happiness. <br /> <br /> Big actors and role players, the movie really gets you in the feel of the movie. <br /> <br /> Deliciously delicious. <br /> <br /> I recommend it, especially if you want to see the lives of the Italians. .
