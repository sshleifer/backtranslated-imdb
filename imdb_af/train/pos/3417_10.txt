Before I saw it, I was subject to the subject, but it's not your average triumph over the contradiction story. Although technical about blind Tibetan children, Mt. Everest, there's so much more to it. This movie shows the very strong, often conflicting personalities of two highly-accomplished blind adults who lead the children, Erik and Sabriye. Erik is an American blind climber / athlete and Sabriye is a blind German academic who started a school in Lhasa Tibet. They are both exceptional in their own ways, but disagree on what will really build trust in the children. Erik wants them to reach the summit, while Sabriye wants them to enjoy Erik as a role model. The nuances are complicated and one step away, not really sure who was right or if the whole climb was a mistake or a good idea. The most in-depth scenes are with the Tibetan children themselves and the hardships they faced before getting their way to school. The most moving for me was the story of Tashi, a frail teenager who grew up in the street after his parents left him. I could watch a whole movie on his life and was fortunate to know it, thanks to the school, he now runs a successful small business with some of his fellow students. If you liked Spellbound or Murderball, you'll like it.
