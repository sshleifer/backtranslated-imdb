good movie, good music, good background and an acceptable plot. But the main point again, as his movies tend to be, is the man's best actor in idia and can change dust into gold. nana patches. This could be his second best performance after parinda (others may disagree). although other movies are not far behind. a man who will never disappoint you. <br /> <br /> Good movie though I think shahrukh was a luxury that this movie could have done without. you can see in his movies, others try very hard to reach his heights and act out of their skins. but this man is really something elase. <br /> <br /> The movie is cool, the music and direction is an excellent plot a bit thin, but the screenplay and dialogue is again very good. a must look.
