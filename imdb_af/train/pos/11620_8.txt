Great little thriller. I was expecting some kind of crazy horror movie, but what I got was a short, short thrill that didn't waste our time. Most of these movies should get us in the backtracks so we feel sympathy for them or hate when people are killed. o such folly here. Yes, you see a few characters, but they really only work with the principals. Like the man's wife at the motel whose room was canceled. We saw them, so we could just how effective the Lisa was and how inefficient the new Hotel clerk was. We see the little girl simply because she will have a very small but important role later in the movie, when everything breaks completely. The Flight Atrendants because we especially need to move the plot ahead. The bad guy in particular needs her at the start of the flight. The rude man at the airport was also important to the movie. The only 2 characters who were only 5 linen that were not used on the plot were the two young guys on the plane. It was clever because I thought they would have something with plot. From the first scene to the last, the women's sign is in control of a young hotel executive company, Lisa. Even when Jackson shows his true colors, she doesn't panic. She thinks what she can do to stop time. Any other movie that will perform the clever executive women like idiots. But not this one. It was a very short movie and I waited for the usual plot devices to kick in, as the movie seemed to have come to its conclusion quickly. Thank you, none of them were used. The new hotel clerk did not call the ordinary and told her what to do, which was panicking, let the phone go and ran out of the hotel without saying anything or asking your boss and telling her to drink too much and just fired her. Craven was more of these types of movies. Also one last comment. Brian Cox is in the movie, but I didn't have one idea who he was. I had to come here to see he was Lisa's dad. He is completely unrecognizable.
