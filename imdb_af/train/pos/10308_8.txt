Well, was Morgan Freeman more unusual than God Burns? This film is surely better than what has been done, "Oh God." I was completely worried and LMAO constantly. Carrey was perfect as a kind of anchorman wannabe, and Aniston performed her part as the frustrated girlfriend in her regular well-played performance. I, for one, do not regard her as ugly or unbeatable. I think my favorite scene was when Carrey opened the file cabinet and thought he could never keep his life history. See if you can see the file in the cabinet that keeps the events of his bathroom humor: I have thrown over this one. Well written and even better played, this comedy goes down as one of the best of the swimmer.
