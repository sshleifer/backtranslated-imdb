I really think this movie is great, personally. But in every movie there is a downer. Now, some of you may not have looked at Hilary Duff's "Raise Your Voice", but if you think of it, these two shows are very similar if you know what I mean. In 'Brave New Girl' Holly wants to be so bad at getting into the Haverty Conservatory. In 'Raise Your Voice', Terri wants a conservatory in L.A. (don't remember the name of the conservatory there). They are both in the music field, and they must both sing at the end of the semester. It's really funny how these two movies looked. I personally like 'Brave New Girl' better than, 'Raise Your Voice' though.
