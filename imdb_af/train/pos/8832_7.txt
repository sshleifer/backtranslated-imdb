"Hey Babu Riba" is a film about a young woman, Mariana (named "Esther" after a famous American movie star) and four young men, Glenn, Sacha, Kicha and Pop, all maybe 15-17 years old in 1953 Belgrade, Yugoslavia. The five are dedicated friends and love jazz, blue jeans, or something that looks American. <br /> <br /> The very close relationship of the teenagers is encouraging and eventually a sacrifice is being prepared to help one of us. the group that had fallen into unexpected problems. In the wake of the changing communist politics, they are reuniting their own ways and reunions in 1985 (the year before the film was made). <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the movie with examples. The subtitles for one thing were difficult. Especially in the beginning, there were a number of dialogues that had no captions at all. Perhaps the talk suit needs it, but I couldn't always read the text and record the scene, which meant I didn't always understand which character was involved. I watched the movie (a video from our public library) with a friend, and neither of us really understood part of the story about obtaining streptomycin for a sick family member. <br /> <br /> This Yugoslav movie is effectively conveyed to the teenagers' sense of invulnerability, idealism and strong and loyal ties to one another. There is a main forerunner, and it was interesting to guess until the end of who these characters were against the 1953 role and what actually happened. <br /> <br /> I'll rate it 7 out of 10, and would like to see other films by director, Jovan Acin (1941-1991).
