My children just stopped at this movie the other night and when things started to play, it sparked my interest a lot. I had to kick out for bowling league, so I recorded them on the DVV so I could watch the rest later. Well, I just did to watch it and the front of my shirt should be soaked after crying buckets. It was an excellent movie, although I could almost feel the pain and anxiety these girls experience. And I would never guess in a million years why Alissia had gone from this beautiful girl to an anti-social goth. That was probably why my shirt was soaked because I experienced the same pain that Alissia felt. I wouldn't have searched for this movie, but I'm sure I saw it. Much move, much touch. Great for those who love a good drama or tear.
