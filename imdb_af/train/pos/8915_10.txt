The BLOB is a great horror movie, not only because of the terrifying images of its almost unstoppable, flesh-soluble title character, but because it contains a real common message. It is in many ways a "feel-good horror movie." The clever storyline is immeasurably helped by solid cast of the entire cast. The two romantic leaders, Steve McQueen and Aneta Corsaut, bring surprising depth and sentimentality to the proceedings. They are misunderstood, but very well-meaning young people, and it is very easy to root for them. <br /> <br /> It's a pro-community movie, and its youthful delinquent characters cause problems mainly from boredom, not out of some malicious character error. Steve McQueen's drag racing rival seems to be an enemy early in the proceedings, but soon joins McQueen's campaign to save the town from the oozing invader as soon as he sees McQueen's seriousness. In this way, a character situation that is initially cartoon-like, suddenly develops depth and human realism. <br /> <br /> The government's initial skepticism of children's wild claims has been proven wrong - and once the threat is acknowledged by all, all conflict within society disappears. This unification of purpose and validation of the "wedding" teenagers becomes official when Aneta Corsaut's father goes to school to get the fire extinguishers needed to freeze the Blob. On any other day, the school's offense would be considered an act of vandalism typical of a juvenile criminal. On this particular day, it is a necessary action performed by an adult figure of authority. At this turning point, it is clear that there are no dividing lines between the young and the old. <br /> <br /> It is an unusual film in that it recognizes the perception of a "generation gap", but suggests that it is more imaginary than real, and which has given a real crisis, of course, people will working together to restore order. "The Blob" is a perfect tonic for the kind of depression that generally comes with a view of "Night of the Living Dead" (1968). <br /> <br /> Much has been made of the movie's cheap but innovative and effective!) visual effects. They are unmistakably smart. Many of the hardships we see are the Blob show, with thumbnails designed to turn around. The camera is typically attached to the sets in a very sturdy "locked" position (the lights should be similarly attached so that the lighting remained stable as the room was turned in this way). These scenes were often photographed one frame at a time, as the room was slowly turning. The silicone bloom took off very slowly and the action had to be accelerated. In a way, it was similar to stop motion photography, but using a blob of silicone rather than an artikulated puppet. Even today, the effects are spectacular and bizarre. <br /> <br /> A very good movie with an exploding audio title, the BLOB is a must-see.
