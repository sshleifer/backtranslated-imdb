The last of the Blonde Bombshells is an entertaining piece of fluff. Judy Dench plays Elizabeth, a new widowed woman at loose points. She spent most of her life as the conscientious wife and mother, but has never been really happy. <br /> <br /> Shortly after her husband's funeral, Elizabeth had her regular lunch with her built-in mud children looking out on a street performer. It haunted memories when she was a member of an all-girl swing band in London during World War II. We soon learn that the band was not exactly all the girls, as the drummer was a man dressed like a woman. Elizabeth took out her sax (practicing his secret through her marriage) and joined forces with the guitar-playing street musician. Elizabeth is much more talented than the guitarist, and the money starts flowing. She does not take money because she is wealthy and does not need it. Her play is strict for artistic fulfillment. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth is seen by Patrick (Ian Holm) one of the band's drummers. Patrick seems to be the only man, and still, and Elisabeth, who was only fifteen, was the only band member who didn't experience Patrick's "talents" except drums. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth is inspired by her granddaughter to get the old group together again to play for the granddaughter's school dance. So start a beautiful journey down memory lanes combined with aspects of a humorous road trip movie - all with a very good swing and blues. I think I'm in the age when I really enjoy older actresses doing their best, and this movie is a treasure trove as it is not just Judi Dench stars, but she is supported by no less than Olympia Dukakis, Leslie Caron, and an army of seasoned British character trades. It's all covered with Cleo Laine's extraordinary voice. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's fluff, but totally delicious and extremely entertaining fluff.
