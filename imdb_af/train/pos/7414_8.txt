It was a very enjoyable movie. A humourous but horrible look at the family, and the commitments associated with it. The story of a man who comes from his life in the city to his fathers' bathhouse in a small Chinese town. There he learns to appreciate, even cherish the things he has left to get away. The film is as visually beautiful as it is emotionally beautiful.
