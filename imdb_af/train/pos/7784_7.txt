It was fantastic! Photography, editing, cinematography, music combined to transport us to the dangerous side of a tourist destination. It was the pleasure of "slumming" without going through the danger. We were there! The dream sequence and the jump-back end ended up fresh. It spoke to me. Keep up the good work! Another of the genre is the city of God. Also - don't laugh! - The comedy, Desperately Seeking Susan. Beautiful ensemble types, with good performances by everyone. Sorry, I think Training Day also fits in with the genre, with fantastic performances by an ensemble cast. I had to switch the channel to some of the rough rows, but all-in-all, a good movie!
