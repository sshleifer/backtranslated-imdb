I love these "Diaper Baby" movies! You can't make such a movie today and it's rich in film history. It's goofy and the movie is made to make you laugh, what it does. How they ever have these children to "act", I will never know. I think they are precious and the kids make me laugh, but so do the others who made this movie, because it shows the naive that existed in the early 30's. You have to remember that this was the case when the film industry was very young, crashing the stock market. The global depression has begun and these films are made to break one's real world. The fact that you can watch movies for five cents is beyond my comprehension, but then dinner is 25 cents as well. It was another time with a totally different attitude.
