A very cute movie with a good background provided by the city of Boston and Fenway Park. As a baseball fan and a light movie addict, it hit me a homerun. Many laughs and lots of authentic baseball scenes with real ballplayers and real references to the past of Bosox failures. And how nice was watching a movie with a baseball theme without enduring overheating, over-the-hill, restraint Kevin Costner, trying to make believers from a critical audience? Jimmy and Drew did a good job as a young love-married couple suffering from Jimmy's Bosox jones. It was a bit whacky and out of the left, but there are really Sox fans who are fanatical and lead their lives through the happiness of their beloved team. The movie sat fast and the end, though predictable, has the charm and sentimentality of so many other popular movies, without being too pretentious. <br /> <br /> The return of Willie Garson to the screen was also enjoyable. I miss Sex & the City's ever-popular "Stanford Blatch". He is always funny, even when he does or says very little. <br /> <br /> Buy yourself two box seats, some popcorn, and get ready for a fun time. "Fever Pitch" is a winner.
