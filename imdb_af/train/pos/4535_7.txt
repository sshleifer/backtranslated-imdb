The first 50 minutes of this movie was rather boring. It focused on the personal issues that Doyle had, including his ill wife, the threat of death by fans, a pushy publisher and guilty feelings about his mentally ill father. Although these subjects had a major impact on Doyle's life, I was more curious about the birth of Sherlock Holmes. The last 40 minutes were excellent. We finally got a look at Doyle's head, how he created Holmes and why he had to kill Holmes. The actors are excellent. Including the intriguing Selden played by Tim McInnerny, Arthur Conan Doyle, played a compelling role by Douglas Henshall and Brian Cox as the "role model" for Sherlock Holmes, dr. Bell. The places are good, especially for a TV movie and the camera work is nice. If the first 50 minutes were so good in the past 40 minutes, it would have been a small masterpiece.
