And I'm not saying this in a bad way. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie at the theater when I was 6 or 7. For me and my cousins ​​it was magical, beautiful and scary at the same time. When we left the theater, Michael was our best friend, although we knew he had no idea. <br /> <br /> Over the years, I've seen this movie broadcast several times, but I've always changed the channel. Even seeing it for a few seconds, it will bring back the feeling of magic and warm my heart. And I kept it that way. <br /> <br /> So I first saw this movie and I believe it was a good decision not to see it again. If I saw it today, I know I can't help criticizing MJ's play, the plot (if there is one) and this and that. For me this is a reminder of childhood, so my feelings about it are that of a child from 20 years ago. <br /> <br /> I see my adult self enter my appreciation and give it an 8 for memories and wonderful music. For that little child who took it into account 20 years ago, it's definitely worth a 10.
