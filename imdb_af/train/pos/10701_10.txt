The critics don't like this movie. It bombed the United States and consequently received only a limited performance in Britain. It was a great shame because it represented British rather than American humor and had to be shown in Britain first. <br /> <br /> Nicole Kidman looks beautiful and is a completely convincing Russian. Ben Chaplin is the Dustin Hoffman character of 'The Graduate', and 'Birthday Girl' has at least 4 scenes reminiscent of the 1960's viewer (despite being a totally different story!). <br /> <br /> Sure, it changes a few times from comedy to black comedy to excitement to adventure - but it's unforgettable, moving and a breathtaking breath of fresh air compared to the average mega-budget blocker. <br /> <br /> See it with an open head!
