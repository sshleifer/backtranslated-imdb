Jeff Wincott is not just a Hunk, he can kick! This movie has some of the best crafts I've seen in a very long time. Okay, so maybe Bridgette Nielson isn't the first person I want to hire to play a relentless politician, she's done a great job! And let's not forget that Wincott played a partner in this movie played by the versatile expert / stuntwoman Karen Sheperd. So she's not Cynthia Rothrock, who cares? She's as good, if not better! (Just look at her battle scene at the end of the movie, one word: OUCH !!). My suggestion would be to buy this movie as soon as possible, because if you haven't seen it, you really miss a great martial arts action.
