This movie is basically a documentary version of the chronologically ordered series of events that took place from April 10, 2002 to April 14, 2002 in the Venezuelan Presidential Palace, Caracas Venezuela. <br /> <br /> The movie's pathos are actually one, and one feels the pain, sadness and joy of the people who lived through this failed coup of President Hugo Chavez. <br /> <br /> One gets away from reading this movie that Hugo Chavez is really a great historical figure. Hugo Chavez's personality hand over the Venezuelan people to overthrow the 3-day-old military-installed junta and establish the democratically installed government of Venezuela. <br /> <br /> It is clear from the film material that George W Bush supported and supported the Venezuelan coup. The fact that mainstream media support and support George W. Bush is not surprising. <br /> <br /> What is surprising is how few people have seen this movie and how few people realize the total corruption of America's mass media. <br /> <br /> It took just 20 years for Ronald Reagan's elimination of the Fairness Doctrine in 1986 to change America into a blind and motionless state. <br /> <br /> May Hugo Chavez open patriotic Americans' eyes to the truth and beauty of the true American vision.
