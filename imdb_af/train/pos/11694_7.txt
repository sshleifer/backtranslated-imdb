Chris Rock stars in this repetition of Warren Beatty's Heavenly Can Wait (himself a repetition of the 1941 film, here comes Jordan), a comedy about a man who dies before his time before he can realize his dreams and his adventures in his new (though temporary) body. In the Beatty version, the lead actor was a back-up for the then Los Angeles Rams. In Rock's Hipper version, our main character is a struggling young - and definitely a low talent-rise comedian. <br /> <br /> Seeing the razor-sharp Rock playing a bad comedian is very funny. It's as if Tom Hanks is playing a bad actor. Lance Barton's dream is to play the legendary Apollo theater on a non-amateur night. But every time he tries his stuff, he gets jerky from the stage - so much so that his nickname becomes Booy. His jokes are lame, his delivery is painful. In short, Lance is all that real Chris Rock is. <br /> <br /> Lance is also a bike messenger, and he is driving down the streets to try out more stuff when BAM! He is hit by a truck. Okay, so maybe he was taken a tenth of a second by a slightly incompetent angel (Eugene Levy) earlier from his body, but hey, anyway, he'll touch. No dice, Lance doesn't seem to be owed in Heaven until 2044. So what should you do? Mr. King (Chazz Palminteri), the "manager" of Heaven, reluctantly agrees to a new body for the non-reasonably deadly man. To find Barton. Trouble is, the looks they find are of a greedy old white man. It turns out this fella (a Wellington) owns all sorts of things - he is the 15th richest man in the country! What luck! You can imagine how Lance turns things around. <br /> <br /> But of course, while in the body of affluent Mr. Wellington falls, Lance falls for a wonderful hospital worker (Regina King). Our men know how hard it is to get a woman who has given our own body, but try to win one while you're a dumpy old guy! And it is even worse when she is not impressed by your money. <br /> <br /> It's Rock's first shot in a lead role and I think he's great. There is still a lot of the rebellious comedian in him - and of course, if he ever wants a variety of roles, he should stop setting up setup routines in the screenplay - but that's not really a bad thing. Rock's personality - his drive, his delivery, his attitude, and his passion - is what fuels this movie. He obviously has a lot of fun in the role, and he seems to make sure you enjoyed him a lot.
