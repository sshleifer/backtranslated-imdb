I rarely came up with a movie with such a warm, happy feeling. I felt like I was out with very good friends and had a wonderful time! I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. The acting was great, although I would mention Bill Nye as an absolutely flawless feat. Bill is an excellent actor and will love to see him in more movies. Timothy Spall and Jimmy Nail are also favorites and are always fond of seeing them as they give such a good performance. And Billy Connolly, as always, absolutely beautiful. It was a wonderful ensemble performance of all involved. Such a refreshing experience to see a well written, beautifully acted and beautiful film.
