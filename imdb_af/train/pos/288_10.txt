This movie was so nice! I am a teenager, and my friends and I all love the series, so it's just to show that these movies are paying attention to all age groups. I recommend it to everyone. My favorite line in this movie is when Logan Bartholomew says "rosy cheeks" when he talks about his baby daughter. He is such a good actor as well as Erin Cottrell. They connect so well and have such good chemistry! I really hope they can work together again. They are so attractive people, and are very good actors. I finally got movies that are good to watch. Lately it has been difficult for me to find movies that are good and show good moral values ​​and Christian values. But at the same time, these movies are not cheesy.
