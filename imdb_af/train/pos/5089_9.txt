True, this does not follow the book very closely, but it is still a very entertaining start to the story. Swayze was much better in the role than I expected. And Doody avoids the "stupid woman from her depth in the desert" image most likely to have expected from us (cf. Indiana Capsaw Jones & The Temple of Doom.) <br /> <br /> Anyway, It's incredibly better than Richard Chamberlain's horrible few Quatermain movies. <br /> <br /> It is very reminiscent of western in many ways. The only thing I didn't pay attention to was all the mysticism, but I think it's part of the genre. Like "how can you have an African adventure story without witch doctors and pretermatural sensible progenitors?" Heh.
