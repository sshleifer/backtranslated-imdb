"The Wrudge" is a remake of Shimizu's own series of popular Japanese horror movies. Shimizu knows he's not doing anything new, so he does what any intelligent person has done in his place: he forgets logic and focuses on giving viewers a fun ride. He uses well-known gossip associated clich√©s, but Shimizu plays imaginatively with these elements. The non-linear story is not only a sympathy but an interesting way to offer rows from different perspectives. In the end, I can only say that if the only purpose of a horror movie is to scare the audience (such as a comedy to make people laugh), this movie has passed flying colors. I watched it in a theater with an audience and it was nice to have viewers go about it. It probably doesn't play in your living room either.
