I loved this movie. In fact, I loved an actress in this movie. I was in the second half of the film as a pregnant teenager. You might remember me more clearly in the classroom scene when the werewolf exposed him to film. I was the woman in the front row with my hands planted on my face in response to what we were watching on the movie projector. In fact, they took me twice a couple times, so it's hard to miss that mistake. Thumbs up to Full Moon High. Wish it comes to the cable soon.
