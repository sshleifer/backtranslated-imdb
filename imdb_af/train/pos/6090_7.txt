emulation is not as funny as I thought it would be initially, but to some of the reviews I read, I found that it was much nicer than people gave it to props. Now it's not a gag a minute movie like zoolander or dodgeball, but I'm quiet and jack black works well with each other and Christopher Walken is as big as ever, so the story is about Jack Black's character squirting develops what makes the dog disappear. I don't want a part of it, but when the product makes Jack Black Rich Ben quieter start to see the envy, it's not good, and both Ben quieter and Jack Black have harder and better movies under their belt. But if you're a fan, I recommend it if it's another funny movie and I've laughed my ass several times because a big fan of Ben Stiller ID has to say it's a quieter one, but still nice, give it a watch
