Time for Hollywood to stand up and notice! If the actors are snooty, just get all the animators who worked on this miracle. Renaissance is probably the first animation movie to let you forget you don't see people. Although the cast is overshadowed by the cast (Craig, McCormack, Pryce, etc.) Of the best I've ever heard, even the emotions portrayed by the cartoons are unpleasant. <br /> <br /> This style of animation is not very new, but the use of light and shadows makes the movie a living painting. Ironically, such technical wizards let you forget that it is actually a very nice movie. The pacing and plot development is wonderful and the dialogues are sharp. Plot: Disappearance of a mega-corporation's leading employee unraveled a story of fraud and corruption with a cold-fortunate hero. Can't say much without giving it all away ... except that while the movie keeps you at the edge of your seat, the climax leaves you speechless. <br /> <br /> a must watch .. also for the "grownups" tearing on 'cartoons'
