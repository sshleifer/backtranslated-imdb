Just because it is based on the most infamous mass-suicide incident of modern times, would have been enough to give this 2-piece 1980s on-TV movie attention. But the fact is that it is a wonderful recreation of the rev. Jim Jones, who built a church in a virtual empire, encouraged it to dissolve into a thin cult in which a congressman and his enthusiasm were murdered. 917 cult followers committed suicide by drinking cabbage help with cyanide. Done very tastefully, but awful enough, unlike the indifferent sadistic CULT OF THE DAMNED, GUYANA TRAGEDY has an all-star cast, including Ned Beatty (like Rep. Leo Ryan), Meg Foster, Randy Quaid, Brad Dourif, Brenda Vaccaro, LeVar Burton and Madge Sinclair. But it is Powers Boothe (in his first big role) who really stands out as Jim Jones. He is actually the man, and his performance is sound and cold. So it is no wonder that this film gets more than twenty years of attention.
