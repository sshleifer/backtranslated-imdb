if you have a chance to see this movie, you see it. it is pretty shocking in parts and really makes you so many important issues, but it is not didactic. In my opinion, this is a piece of art ... beautifully filmed, fine music of many styles, the typically impressive level of acting one expected from BBC Drama. Nathalie Press (photographed as 'Natalie' Press) is convincing in her role as a depressed teenager exploited by a male classmate. Celia Imrie has that beautiful reassuring quality that comforts sometimes unpleasant action stability and the viewer knowing that somebody is actually 'normal', but the right star as always is Timothy Spall - surely one of the best actors of our time. !
