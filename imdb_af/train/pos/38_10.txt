One of the very best Three Stooges shorts ever. A ghostly home full of evil guys and "The Goon" challenge the Alert Detective Agency's best men. Shemp is in top form in the famous in-the-dark scene. Emil Sitka offers excellent support in his mr. Goodrich role, as the target of a murder tort. Before it's over, Shemp's "trusted little shovel" is in great power. This 16-minute jewel moves as fast as any Stooge's short and packs twice the wallet. Highly recommended.
