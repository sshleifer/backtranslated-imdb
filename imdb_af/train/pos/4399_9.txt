The shortest way to describe Ride With The Devil is just one word: authenticity. I will not repeat what has already been said about this wonderful film, but I would like to say how much the historical research and the careful attention to detail that the crew undoubtedly made was appreciated by this filmmaker. <br /> <br /> As a history student familiar with the era and setting up this film, I must say that this production is one of the most accurate fictional films about "bleeding Kansas". Yes, there were freedoms that were taken on real events, as all fiction is capable of doing. But the overall feeling of the film is real. Authentic costumes, authentic attitudes (no PC next door) even those actors look authentic. Even Jewel Kilcher (who has a small role in the film) seemed to have stepped a mid-19th picture. <br /> <br /> A few viewers I talked about expressed their disbelief at the stylized dialogue. They cannot believe that farmers from the 19th century will speak like poets. <br /> <br /> What they don't realize is that the American public of the 19th century at this time of oral slackness is a surprisingly literate and eloquent cluster. These people were raised about Shakespeare and the King James version of the Bible. The scriptwriters have reconstructed the most likely verbal styles of these people, based on time documentation. The stylized dialogue only adds to the magical atmosphere of the movie. <br /> <br /> But in addition to a historical document, this film also works on a visceral level. Beautifully photographed and executed, it rakes back to the days of the great western epics. The attack on Lawrence, Kansas, which has been done so many times in so many other smaller films, is portrayed with a sense of urgency that places the viewer right in the middle of the action. <br /> <br /> Romance, adventure, moral and ethical conflict. This movie has everything a critical filmmaker can have. <br /> <br /> In a year dominated by overcrowded garbage like American Beauty, this great artwork is buried by an indifferent studio system. But I'm sure Ride With The Devil will be given, which is the result in the years to come. Please rent this movie. You won't be disappointed.
