I admit that I had some tension when I saw the previews for this movie first. Was VH-1 here on hollow ground? I mean, Harris and Quinn don't really look like John or Paul. But I have to admit, this movie really surprised me. It's far from the exploitation movie I expected. Instead, it's a character study, a low key, whimsical and ultimately bittersweet look at friendship, and the ultimate lesson we all learn: it's hard, if not impossible, to capture what we once had and what we have passed.
