Colman's performance is helped by the brilliant written writing. The giant Hollywood studios in the 30's and 40's were able to copy some of the German expressionist movie elements and incorporate them into Hollywood movies. very good use of shadows and light and silhouette. I really had the scene where Colman turned off the light in his locker room near the start of the movie, and he started to record Othello while his face was getting dark and angry. Even though the viewer sees the text and the play by Shakespeare, Tony gets a hold and goes on his journey of punishment. I also enjoyed the dramatic death scene in the drama, when he was overwhelmed with emotion and accidentally made his costume slightly difficult for her to wear. her pleadings "Tony stop hurting me" are cool and exciting. You just don't know if he's going to go over the top and kill her. The cat and the mouse rush to reveal the killer, two-thirds of the way through the film was added to add a faster pacing and also added to the narrative element of the movie. Masterful work by George Cukor. He is such a skilled director. Excellent movie. They don't hurt them as they used to.
