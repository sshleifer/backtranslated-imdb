I'm not even sure what to say about this movie. It's one of a handful of movies ever made that I would consider romantic. Trying to speak plot or representation, or technical details about this movie, would be in the words of Frank Zappa "like dance over architecture". It hits the nail right on the head, in the way it captures the fleeting moments of life that we move and then run away from us to never be experienced again. It looks like the movie that wanted to write the character version of Charlie Kaufman in the movie Adaptation. The end is open and ambiguous, no happy ending here, just mystery. no in-depth life lessons, just a few horny and intelligent children who have the ability to feel the most irrational and unrealistic feelings ... romantic love. 10 out of 10 watch it with your special lady and recommend it to a stranger ................
