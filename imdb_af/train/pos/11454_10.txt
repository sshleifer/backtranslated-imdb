As a fan of Andy Goldsworthy's art for a while and owns some of his books, I had some expectations of what I would see. What I got was something quite satisfactory, and more than I expected. Being myself an artist (I work in clay), finds inspiration in our environment to make good art, essential, and that's something Andy Goldsworthy has mastered. In the course of a year, the director follows the spontaneous energy, skill and dedication to the artist connections with nature with a drop of inspirational flair. The music put on the film is embracing and intoxicating. If you are an artist who needs inspiration or someone else who needs an uplifting experience, see this movie. I'm glad to know that Andy is out there somewhere. Create, dance, struggle with the forces of nature to make our world more beautiful.
