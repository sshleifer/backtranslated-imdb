The scene where Sally Field and Whoopi Goldberg go to the mall to revive Sally's flag spirits is enough reason to enjoy this movie, but wait! There's more! It's a creaking good record of TV, movie stars on the road, (and up) and the horrors of love. Robert Downey Jr shows the lighter side of his genius, and Cathy Moriarty is beautiful. The dialogue is witty, and the physical humor is done with complete skill. It is a movie that will appeal to those who really enjoy the arts of acting, directing and writing.
