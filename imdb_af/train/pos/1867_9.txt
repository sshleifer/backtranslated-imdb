It is a movie about life, the triumph over the adversity and the wonders of the human spirit. I am telling anyone not to throw a tear at the end of the movie. It's more than just a tear, it's an impressive, formidable drama with great performances from all cast, but especially Luke and Denzel Washington. 7 years later, I am surprised that Luke is still a virtual unknown and Washington has just directed another film. However, apart from a slow build-up, the story of this foster child's trials and tribulations and how it still affects him in adulthood is the kind of movie that has long been with you. Like many sparkling spotlight photos, it was more of a sleeping place and didn't get the mass critical award it deserves. The scene where Antwone finally met his mother, summed up the movie for me. There were so many ways that could have been done and it could have been skemalties or it could have been unrealistic, but Washington did exactly the right tone. His mother never said. a word and could just throw a tear, while Antowne simply asked why. Her overwhelming debt prevented her from saying anything, what could she say to defend herself? One of the most moving movies I've seen.
