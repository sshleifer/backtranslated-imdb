Friz Freleng's 'Rumor' is an excellent Private Snafu cartoon that warns against the spread of panic-inducing rumors during war. Produced, like all Snafu shorts, to be shown to military audiences as entertaining films, 'Rumor' is extremely imaginative and holds many ideas in its very short lifespan. When Snafu begins with a rumor about a bombing, it is being brought to an ultimate rumor that America has lost the war. It is brilliantly illustrated by a long, rubbery piece of baloney and several strange, fictional creatures coming back to haunt Snafu with even more terrible news about his country's army. "Rumors" are resourceful, quick and funny, helping everything to overshadow the rather difficult, "don't do the military message". It stands out as one of the best of the Private Snafu shorts.
