I really like this movie! Although nothing of the books, it is still the classic Nancy Drew style. I have seen many ads for this movie and since I was really in the Nancy Drew books, I had very high expectations for this movie and they certainly met the expectations. Almost all the characters were exactly how I portrayed them from reading the books. I'm really happy to have seen this movie. All the actors and actresses really acted like they did in the book series. Since I saw this movie, I wanted to read every Nancy Drew book there. All the actors and actresses really got their characters and it certainly showed when the movie was broadcast on the big screen. It certainly looked like all the actors and actresses were really in the positions the characters were. I definitely give this movie a 10 out of 10.
