Many of the comments I saw on the IMDB for this movie really do not do it right. First, just let me say that this movie should not be taken seriously. It's supposed to be a fun, yet stupid movie that no one needs to think, just to enjoy it. If you watch this movie with the intention of watching a masterpiece in film or in humor, you will be very disappointed. Still, if you just want to see a goofy movie with talented actors / actresses and some good catches, you'll enjoy it.
