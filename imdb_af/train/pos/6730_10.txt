I use to comment on IMDb, but I no longer do it. It happens that IMDb has become massive, and consequently subjectivity has destroyed devastated scores. What do I mean? That someone who doesn't really love movies and doesn't have any expertise on the subject, looks at a bit of shit (or the opposite), and if he likes, he delivers a 10, and if he doesn't go , he goes 1. It can of course not measure anything correctly. Now for the movie. I'm really sorry I ever delivered some 10's to a few very few movies, because then I have to record this one with 12 or 13, which is not possible. This documentary has something I don't expect to ever see in any other movie in my life. It's simply fascinating, and it's not just a way of saying; It really is. The last 25 minutes have a load of energy, visual joy and wisdom - the words spoken by the lead roles - it's really ... there's no possible match. I do not like movies, but I will rarely find anything to do, but this one is the kind of movie you have to buy and keep, and watch from time to time, maybe 10 or 20 times as years pass. I have nothing more to say. This is a real goal for me.
