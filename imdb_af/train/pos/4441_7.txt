Well, before we review it, I have to ask: why isn't it listed individually? It might just be a TV item in Italy, but for international Lamberto Bava supporters it's their own FILM. In America, this film is distributed on VHS and DVD as "The Ogre" or "Demons 3". Yes, I know it has nothing to do with "Demons" except one cast member and the crew. But yes, I was personally upset that it was so hard to find on this site that would otherwise be so useful. <br /> <br /> Finally, let's review the "Ogre". I've seen the trailer here on YouTube many times and found it frankly fearful. The movie itself (it's feature length, so it makes a movie) has very many strong parts and can't be scared. I was dissatisfied with the last act, but I am sorry to have bought the DVD before I saw it (available at Shriek Show). I think the film's TV origin explains the last act. I won't spoil. <br /> <br /> The plot is somewhat known: an American horror writer living on an ancient, haunting castle of man and son is just about to find it exactly like the nightmares of her childhood. There are vague echoes of "The Shining", but it is another mark of supernatural horror. The woman (Virginia Bryant) is increasingly proving that this is the true place of life for her nightmares, but her husband won't believe her. Great atmosphere and terror follow. <br /> <br /> The multiple nightmare ranges were pretty freaky. The Ogre cocoon effect was good, it reminded me of Uncle Frank's resurrection of the first "Hellraiser". There are also some good shocks and a well done underwater scene. I give them props that the movie never bumped into imitating American films with similar concepts, namely a nightmare on Elm Street. "The Ogre" is an original. And the monster itself was scary. <br /> <br /> On the Shriek Show DVD there is a Lamberto Bava interview in which he is cautious to mention that it is not part of his classic "Demone" series. He also gives a lot of credit to the real castle in which the film was filmed. Indeed, this institution adds a lot to the movie. The Simon Boswell music also helps. <br /> <br /> There are many good things here. "The Ogre" is not perfect, but it is worth seeing. Taking it is a lesser Lamberto Bava performance.
