The animation was fantastic and the movie funny. The two circus insects, Tuck / Roll, were very funny. If you were waiting for the credits at the end, you saw a very funny series of movies showing the mistakes as if they were doing things wrong as in other movies. It was smart because it made the characters more human and credible.
