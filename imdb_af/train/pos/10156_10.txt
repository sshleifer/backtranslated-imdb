This big movie failed to register a higher score than 5! Why not! It is a good portrayal of the life of Christ without the relentless sensation of the Passion of Christ. Johnny Cash has done great things for God that has been incredibly avoided and neglected. in areas where they are most important, such as our churches. The film itself took less than a month to roll, because Johnny felt the strong presence of God that led him through it. Thank you to everyone involved in this overwhelmingly sincere movie that will always be nurtured. by his fans. At least, the Billy Graham Crusade has highly regarded it as a primary source of education for new Christians. Thanks Fox for making it. Like Walk the Line proved that it was terrible that this man still survived an underestimated masterpiece.Movies are not anonymously voiced because this production proves! In summary, I believe that this film is one of the world's great documentaries as it is straight, honestly portrayed and a great witness of the Christian faith!
