This is one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen. The footage is extraordinary, mesmerizing at times. It also received an Best Photography Oscar, and deserves it. I have lots of movies in my movie collection and many more I've seen next to them, and not many of them are beautiful or even as beautifully shot as this one. <br /> <br /> It's unique and an overall big movie. The cast is great and does a good job of portraying their characters. We follow their lots with dedication and are very emotionally attached to them. Along the way, we also learn about ourselves and our lives. I think a lot about this movie for what it represents and how it is present. I recommend it
