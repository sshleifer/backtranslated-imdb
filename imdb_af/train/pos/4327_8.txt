I like this listing. I read Bleak House and I know it's so hard to read the whole book, and even others like Little Dorrit. I must admit they did a very good performance with the increased Nicholas Nickelby. I love Diana Rigg and I could see the pain of Lady Dedlock, even through the expected arrogance of the aristocracy. I'm sorry, I think she's the best Lady Dedlock. I'm not sure who could have made a better Jarndyce, but I'm right with Mr Elliott. It's not easy to present these long Dickens books - Oliver Twist will be easier - it's a long one, and if you don't care about all the legal situations, you can be boring or boring. I think this listing is enough not to be boring. I have Mr. Smallweed just loved. It can be fun. There is always a child - Jo will break your heart here ... I think we should have the opportunity to judge for ourselves ... <br /> <br /> I must say I loved the show. Maybe if I read the book again, as I usually do, after watching the movie, I might be more critical. Meanwhile, I think it's a good idea.
