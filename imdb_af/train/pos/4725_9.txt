Despite the lack of logic in the storyline, Kill Shot is a very enjoyable movie. Through a moving display, Kasper Van Dien sketches the emotional divide between a hardworking rich father and his wrong son. Each member of the supporting role-players has a solid performance, underlined by the lively actions of a young Asian man whose name I can't remember. A shocking tragic end may disrupt some younger viewers, but as a whole, Kill Shot really delivers a manslaughter.
