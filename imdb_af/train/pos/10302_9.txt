This movie is the best movie ever made by Jim Carrey. Carrey didn't make his usual face in this movie. He was both funny and sad. Carrey played a reporter named Bruce Nolan. Nolan blames God (Morgan Freeman) for everything that goes wrong in his life. Then God comes from heaven and gives Bruce his powers. As I said before, Carrey did an excellent job. I also thought Morgan Freeman and Jennifer Aniston were great as supporting actor / actress. The plot was good because it had many sub-points in the main point. This movie can be funny (Bruce's dog) as well as sadness (the "break-up"). The writing also worked well. I'm glad they made a sequel to this movie. I rate this movie a 9/10.
