The 70s Show is the best TV show ever, period. It's there with the Andy Griffen Show, Saturday Night Live and The Simpsons in my book. This 70-year-old has continued for 8 seasons, all focusing on a group of teenagers / young adults dealing with relationships, separating their parents and their overall future. <br /> <br /> The two main characters, Eric and Donna, two teenagers live together. They live most of their lives side by side, and begin to feel more feelings for each other at the beginning of the first season. A big part of the show revolves around how their relationship works. <br /> <br /> Two other characters, Red and Kitty, are Eric's parents. Red was in the service, so he really pushed Eric. Kitty is just the opposite. Although she is drinking heavily, she treats Eric and his friends with great care. Bob, their neighbor, is of course Donna's dad. Bob giggled around with several different women throughout the rough story. Bob also irritates Red to its fullest extent. <br /> <br /> The remaining character, Hyde, Kelso, Fez and Jackie, are Eric's friends. They also play an important role in the show's story. <br /> <br /> Well, the first season is great. This is when the characters begin to feel new to each other. The first season is original, funny and enjoyable. <br /> <br /> The second season is good, though not as good as the first. This is a basic continuation of the First. Eric and Donna are together, and everything works well. <br /> <br /> The Third Season is my favorite. It returned and caught the first season's feeling and humor. I also think the character chemistry has improved a lot, which makes the performance all the more enjoyable. <br /> <br /> The fourth season is not nearly as good. Eric and Donna don't come together in this one, and make the performance slightly less enjoyable. It's still funny, though I didn't enjoy it so much the previous seasons. <br /> <br /> The fifth season is the last season I enjoyed throughout. This is the gang's Senior Year, so it really helps with the story. The fifth season also ended the best of all seasons. <br /> <br /> The sixth season is good for the most part. It's extremely funny, though it doesn't catch the feeling of the other seasons. The gang is out of high school, so I believe it didn't hit the teenager, feeling the previous seasons did. I also didn't like the last three or four episodes as they felt a great drama. <br /> <br /> The Seventh Season captures the same feeling that the 5th season had somehow, although it didn't do it. I enjoyed the Seventh Season as I did all the others, and the end is wonderful. <br /> <br /> The Last Season sucked. Eric wasn't in it, which ruined it. Kelso wasn't much either, which didn't help. I hated the eighth season until the last episode. I thought the last episode was really good, and an appropriate end to the series. <br /> <br /> Overall, if you enjoy comedy, give it 70's. They stopped making new episodes, but they are still a lot on TV. I also recommend buying Seasons 1-7. It is up to you to buy Season 8.
