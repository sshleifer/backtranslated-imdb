A number of contributors mentioned the age difference between Stewart and Novak. She was 25 and he was 50 when this movie was released. I think the difference didn't matter to a suspicious drama like Vertigo, but it does matter to a romantic comedy. We can easily understand that is why his character will be attracted to hair, but it is less clear why hair will be attracted to her. <br /> <br /> Yet, the film works as a light romantic fantasy. The scene where she stares at him over the cat's head, with her dark painted eyebrows flashing and the sounds of her humming and cat flushing, is true magic. So it is a little frightened when the scene moves to the top of the Flatiron building, and we see the age difference very sharply. As he embraces her, she reaches her fingers through his hair, but stops the movement and gently pounds her fingertips against his toupee.
