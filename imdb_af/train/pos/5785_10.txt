While commenting on what was left for this show, I couldn't help but a large percentage of the reviewers didn't actually watch any episodes of the show, either through or of their own free will. The thing about Kerching! it's a children's show, for kids as natural as your parent looks cheesy, forced, and probably stupid. I even found one person who said the sets were stupid, but I remember as an eight-year-old wondering why Taj Ikaa ice shapes on his wall, and also wondering if my parents left me alone (they not). Yes, it can be annoying, the acting can be better and some characters do very strange things with their hair, but as a children's program I show it 10/10. Compared to the things they are airborne today, we can only say I wish it would be aired again. DVD release, someone?
