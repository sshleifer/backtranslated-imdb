This one is great! Robert De Niro and Cuba Gooding teamed up to make a powerful and very influential film. It is the true story of the first black American navy diver and the obstacles he faces to his certification in the hands of a racist master diver. Along the way, he has to face all his classmates with an ordinary old story. None of them want him in their class. They move out of the barracks when he arrives. Eventually he is certified and will have a good career as a US Navy Diver. Look at this one! It is a wonderful story of courage and honor. As the story unfolds, we see that racism is slowly disappearing and everyone is starting to respect men one at a time.
