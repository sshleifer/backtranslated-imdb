CITY HALL is a somewhat mixed bag. Share vignette of NYC political life, and part moralizing story. Al Pacino, a Dukakis-esque boss with presidential dreams, often gives a foolish or muted performance. There are a few times when he chews the landscape, and in the case of CITY HALL, it's where he shines. John Cusack gives a muted and general flawless performance, without going into the caricature of a New Orleans dialect, or clipping in the melodrama in the movies. Danny Aiello as a political leader is also very good. I also love showtunes. <br /> <br /> The big problem with CITY HALL, which is a good movie in many ways, is the general feeling of lack of momentum. It's more like a documentary than a movie. We see the action or follow the story from a standalone perspective, and of course the viewer is not involved. When the viewer does not engage to a certain extent, they become apathetic to the characters, and eventually the plot. <br /> <br /> It tends to be alienated, and what had to be a resounding, detailed announcement of the final came as a "Hmmm ... oh ... okay." They say you can't fight town hall, as the tread goes clich√©. Still, it still can't stop you thinking what would have been if they just stimulated the script and pacing this movie.
