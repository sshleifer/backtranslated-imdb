It's not an art house movie, it's mainstream entertainment. <br /> <br /> Lot's of beautiful people, T&A, and action. I found it very entertaining. It's not supposed to stimulate intellectually, it's a fun movie to watch! Jesse and Chace are also funny, which is just gravy. Definitely worth the rent. <br /> <br /> In short, I recommend entertaining them for a little Friday night with the boys or even your girlfriend (if she likes to see other girls, get it!) <br /> < The villains are also good. Vinnie, Corey Large, the heroic man of heroes. Very nasty villains.
