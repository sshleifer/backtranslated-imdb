This movie is great fun. What makes it especially good is two things: one is the simple way the characters embrace the stereotypes, with discussions about their costumes and superpowers. There is an engaging seriousness in the parody that is very attractive; The second is the basic sweetness of the characters and the quality of chemistry. Claire Forlani deserves special note as the object of Mr. Furious's desires. Here is a bootloading talent. I realize that some with high expectations may have been disappointed, but this movie is very nice and sweet.
