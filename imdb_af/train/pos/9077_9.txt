I really enjoyed the pilot, it was as amazing as I had hoped it would be, if not better. Patrick Warburton was a riot, although I initially thought I wouldn't be able to stand up for his character. He and Megyn Prize had little chemistry, but hopefully, as the season goes on, they become more comfortable around each other. It must have been strange for Megyn to be the star on her last performance as a co-star. <br /> <br /> Bianca Kajlich and Oliver Hudson are very new to the whole Sitcom scene, but I think they'll be better in time. David Spade's character, to my surprise, was not the entire focus of this pilot. The way he delivers his lines is so different from anyone else I've ever seen on TV, but I think it's just his style. It works for him. <br /> <br /> I think couples, or even individuals, will be able to relate to all the doubts and battles and to be uncertain about your decisions about this show. All the situations that the characters are placed in, just like real life, do not feel sugar-covered like most shows. <br /> <br /> I hope for all actors that CBS gives them a chance. This show has the potential to be one of the best ranges, given the chance and time only.
