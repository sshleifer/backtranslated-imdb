I really thought they did an excellent job, there was nothing wrong, I didn't know how the first commentator said it was terrible, it moved me to tears. ), but I try not to cry in a movie, because it is embarrassing, but this one has me. It was SOOO good! I hope they fix it on DVD, because I will definitely buy a copy! I feel it has renewed my faith and given me a hope that I can't explain, it made me strive to be a better person, they went through so much and we take it for granted, I think. In comparison, I feel that our own trials are nothing. Well, not nothing, but they hardly come up with what they had to go through. I loved it. Who played Emma?
