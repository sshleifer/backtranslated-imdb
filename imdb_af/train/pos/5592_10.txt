Known for the launch of the world to Hedy Lamarr and full frontal nudity, but that's oh much more. In fact, this is one of the highlights of cinema, up there with some of the original works of the 1930s cinema, in the same prestigious group as under the roofs of Paris, Tabu, Olympia and even L'Atalante. It's almost a silence, especially on his miraculous images, and also his fantastic, symphonic score by Giuseppe Becce. It is a masterpiece of cinematography and music, yes, and also of editing, direction, writing and acting. A good 90% of film moves perfectly. Machat√Ω seems to be an expert in using motifs. Perhaps not as subtle as it can be, and maybe a little overused, but the appearance of objects like insects, lights and horses carries the picture beautifully. The small conversations of dialogue are unfortunately unpleasant. They don't crack as much as one might think. The final bit is strange, to say the least. Recalling the Russian silence, we have a montage of workers. It scarcely makes sense in the course of the narrative, but it is so wonderful that I refuse to overburden that error. Ecstasy is a movie desperately needed in rediscovery. It is one of the best films ever made.
