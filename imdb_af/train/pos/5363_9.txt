It is a classic action movie of the 80's with Arnold Schwarzenegger in one of his most memorable roles. Set in a futuristic police state where government controls everything, including television networks. One of their most popular TV shows is "The Running Man", where convicted criminals are pursued and murdered for the entertainment of millions. It's set up like a game show, where the audience votes for their favorite "stalkers", trained killers who kill and kill the show's unfortunate "contestants". Public members also win prizes for the correct prediction of who is to be killed by. And the host is played by none other than Family Feud's Richard Dawson, whose game show experience makes him well-suited to this role. When Ben Richards (Arnold) is falsely accused of mass murder, he is forced to play this sadistic game. <br /> <br /> This movie is full of classic Arnold one-liners, as his well-known "I'll Be Back" just before entering the arena. And he adopts a stalker armed with a flame detector with "How about a light?" I can continue, but I don't want to spoil the movie. It's funny stuff! <br /> <br /> Whether it's meant to be or not, this movie serves as a big parody of today's "Reality TV". Already, there are many programs that show people enduring pain and humiliation for the entertainment of viewers, and even court cases are being broadcast for their "entertainment value". Running Man demonstrates what would happen if reality TV hit rock, and this is a scary photo. One can only hope that the networks have common sense not to leave it that far. <br /> Overall, this is a fun movie and I highly recommend it. 9 out of 10!
