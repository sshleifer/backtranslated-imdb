in one of Neil Simon's best plays. Straight, fiery ex-Vaudeville stars played by Walter Matthau and George Burns are working together for a TV comedy. The problem is that they haven't seen each other for more than a decade. Full zippy one liners and inside showbiz jokes, this story flies with a steady stream of humor. Good work also by Richard Benjamin as married cousin, Rosetta LeNoire as nurse, and Howard Hesseman as TV commercial director. Steve Allen and Phyllis Diller appear as themselves. Trivia note: The opening montage features Hollywood Revue footage of 1929 and shows Marie Dressler, Bessie Love, Polly Moran, Cliff Edwards, Charles King, Gus Edwards and the song Brox Sisters.
