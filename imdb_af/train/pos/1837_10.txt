Simply a great movie. Great story and great performances, be it Amitabh, Akshay, Shefali, Priyanka, Boman or Rajpal. Hindi film industry goes unashamed with Mallika and Co, this movie is completely vulgarity-free and is therefore bound to fail in vulgarity addicting our Indian society. But the message and concept that this movie carries is absolutely fantastic. Anu Malik (boring copying box) could have been avoided and Ismail Darbar or Himmesh Reshmmiya could be used as a musician. I think Vipul Shah also had to touch little Gujarati, especially in music. Anu Malik is the worst musician and he thinks he is popstar, but it is not the movie where presence was needed. He just looks good with Govinda style songs. I had some great music with some good Ghazals or sad songs that made this movie more memorable.
