Out of the blocks I just say I'm a big zombie fan so I don't make statements like the above. Secondly, let me say that this is an Italian zombie movie, and Fulci only 15 minutes before he was handed over to Bruno (Rats, Night of Terror) Mattei. These are not Dawn of the Dead people. <br /> <br /> It says it's easily one of the most entertaining zombie movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The writing is terribly terrible. Just look at the two scientists trying to find an antidote ("Let's try to combine these two molecules"). <br /> <br /> The zombies come in all races. From moaning moans, to ways that move with birds! <br /> <br /> The gore is plentiful. Legs are cut off, arms are amputated, stomachs open. <br /> <br /> The pass is fast, flying from one bumblebee to the next. <br /> <br /> Then there's the head in the fridge. Oh, the head in the fridge! One of the biggest moments in the horror, as Ash owned his hand in Evil Dead 2. <br /> <br /> You should already know if you are the kind of person who likes this kind of movie. Get some friends and beer and you'll be a nice evening. <br /> <br /> Did I call the head in the fridge?!?!?
