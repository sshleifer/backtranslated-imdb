This movie was incredible. I'd recommend it to anyone, much better than I already expected. It was definitely a heartbreaking spectacular movie. It's a wonderful story, with wonderful actors and creators. Definitely another big movie with Denzel Washington. (No one should be surprised) Derek Luke also did a wonderful job.
