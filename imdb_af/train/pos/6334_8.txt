This movie has some great things. First, it is supposed to be based on a true story. It is surprising that several tornadoes would hit the same town in the fall in Nebraska the night. I wonder if the real town's name was near Blainsworth (which is the town's name in the movie). There is an Ainsworth, Nebraska, but there is also a town that starts with Blains something. <br /> <br /> It shows the slowest moving tornadoes on record in seeing where the boys are in the house. On the other hand, the scene where the TV is unclear is actually based. For Doppler radar and weather radio, we were taught that if you changed your TV to a particular channel (not cable) and adjusted the brightness, you might know if there is a tornado. The problem was that you could hear it. <br /> <br /> Knowing something about midwest tornadoes made this movie fun for me. I enjoy it more than Twister. I mean, give me a break. There is no way to get it through and F5 connects yourself to a pipe in a good home.
