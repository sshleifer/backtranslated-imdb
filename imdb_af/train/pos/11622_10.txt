Cillian Murphy and Rachel McAdams star in this action / thriller written and directed by the master of tension, Wes Craven himself. The whole movie starts with a few issues at The Lux Atlantic, a hotel in Miami. The problem is all set by the hotel manager Lisa Reisert. Then she goes to the airport, and that's where all the trouble starts. She meets Jackson Rippner, who is not called Jack because of the name Jack the Ripper, if you know him and I mean. Then they have the plane on board, and crazy enough, Rippner and Reisert sit next to each other. For the next half hour, Lisa is terror, tormented and frightened by Rippner. I will not give anything away. Then we move on to where Jack Lisa is chasing the airport. Then Lisa went to her house to see if her father was good and Rippner was there already. There are nearly twelve minutes of violence and strong intensity throughout that whole scene. A total of 25 minutes of intense action comes in the end. <br /> <br /> Not only was the movie intense but it had a good plan. As I said, I will give away nothing, because it is so shocking and exciting and somewhat disturbing / frightening. And the performance of every single character in the movie, even those with no lines, was all perfect. It was incredible. Everything was fantastic in this movie! The acting, the music, the effects, the makeup, the direction, the editing, the writing, everything was wonderful! Wes Craven is definitely the master of suspension. Red Eye is definitely a must-see and is definitely worth spending your money. You can watch this movie over and over, and it will never be boring. <br /> <br /> Red Eye I must say is better than 10 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> Original MPAA Rating: PG-13: Some Intense Sequences of Violence and Language <br /> <br /> My MPAA Rating: PG-13: Some Very Intense Gender of Violence and Language <br /> <br /> My Canadian Rating: 14A: Violence, Scary Scenes, Disorder
