Since I heard of the Ralph Bakshi version of "The Lord of the Rings", I wondered: What the hell is a rotoscope animation? !!! Well ... I finally found out ... I saw this movie about three years ago without having any idea who Ralph Bakshi is ... And I really enjoyed it ... Very good story line ... it even has a small character development that is great for a cartoon ... See it when you get bored with contemporary animation .... Don't get me wrong ... I don't say it's just a nice cartoon ... This is also a good movie ...
