I'm a big M Lillard fan, so I finally watched this movie. I honestly doubt that if he wasn't in the movie, I enjoyed it or even watched it, but as soon as I watched it, the story realized quite well. I must say a bad end, but I saw it. It's a low budget movie and some of the actors weren't really good, but in general I evaluated this movie 7/10. <br /> <br /> The thrill of wondering what Lillard really was was what really kept me interested in this movie. <br /> <br /> It's a good rental! <br /> <br /> 7/10
