This movie is there with the all-time classic. The music, camera shots, and acting are excellent. The performance of the movie in black and white gave it a much better look and perfectly complemented the music, such as Psycho. It's surprising how few people responded to this movie. My guess is that it's a hard movie to find. I have the movie a 9. See the movie and you will know what I'm talking about.
