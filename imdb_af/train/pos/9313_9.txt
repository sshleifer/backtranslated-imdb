I liked this show very much - we got the first and only, it looks like the series is on the UK on Channel 4. The characterization was right on the money - a bit like the Simpsons in that all the different facets of the small town population. represent. <br /> <br /> There was no lag track - I didn't see it on an American TV comedy, except on Larry Sanders and it worked really well here, and the suggestion that this wacky police was really so , and not just the cameras. <br /> <br /> All in all, a peculiar little number that correlated me is just right: I can't help but think it may have missed its point with some audiences. I think it would have been a cult hit in the UK if it was shown at an acceptable hour. <br /> <br /> I'll turn it off with my default comment: Where can I get hold of it? see it again? Any ideas?
