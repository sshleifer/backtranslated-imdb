I've been looking for the name of this movie for years. I was 14 when I believed it was broadcast on television in 1983. All I can remember was that it was about a teenage girl, only after surviving a plane crash and surviving the Amazon. I remember people looking for her family and knowing how to care for herself --- she tells the story and I remember her alive with the fact that the errors were under her skin. I don't remember much more about this movie, and want to see it again - if it's the same - and if any of you have a copy, can you email me at horsecoach4hire@hotmail.com? I'd like to get a copy to see if it's actually the same movie I remember. It was broadcast on Thanksgiving (USA) in 1983, and I experienced problems myself and this movie has affected me a lot. Thank you in advance!
