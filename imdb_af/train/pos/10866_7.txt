Johnnie To's ELECTION has some cool music on the opening credits and a nice opening credit design, a kaleidoscope of Chinese characters and the Asian soldiers who oath or solemn oath, in fact, the whole movie is recorded nicely. I found Bishop Seraphim Sigrist and was very eager to watch a movie. The one I started with, ELECTION, is exciting and interesting, and only moderately violent by contemporary standards ?? moderate and also materially violent; The story of an Asian godfather's twilight, it uses a puzzle game of elements, violent facts from people's lives, the race for the scepter, real details, and as with Coppola, we are expected to believe that some of the morally glamorous gangs are. right and tasty and delicious. The shows are pretty amusing and colorful. <br /> <br /> ELECTION is made good in the enjoyable, somewhat indifferent style of the Hong Kong Prize; The end is bitter, true, straight and will frighten the children.
