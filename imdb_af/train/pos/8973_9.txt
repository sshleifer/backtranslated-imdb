I watched this movie when I was a young child on television (thank you Canadian broadcasting corporation) and had nightmares years later. <br /> <br /> Trnka was one of the mentors for Bratislav Pojar, one of Canada's National Film Council's best animators. Pojar, in turn, was a mentor and co-worker for the great Drouin. If you like Trnka, you should see "Night Angel". <br /> <br /> Symbolism is obvious, but well used. The opposition of beauty and life (the plant) is placed in opposition to the anonymity of the glove. The poor puppet hero is condemned despite a lack of political agenda. <br /> <br /> What I remembered most was the sense of repression in the decor. The small room where action takes place is the character of the whole world. The invasion by hand is a complete violation of the world. <br /> <br /> Beautiful and haunting movie. I found a copy of this and other wonderful shorts at Trnka at the public library and showed it to my own children. A must see.
