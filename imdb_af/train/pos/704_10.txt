This movie, like low budget as it may be, is one of the best psychic puzzlers I've ever seen. If you assume it's low budget from the beginning, appreciate how good it is, how well it is written, and how good the filmmaker was to produce such a great deal of money. <Br /> <br /> All the elements of a wonderful movie are here. The footage, though shot on the digital, was nice in places. The bizarre, dreamy feeling of the film is particularly well captured in the scene with the talk dog, that scene was just amazing. It is such a trippy piece of work, but not in a pretentious way, and so I have a lot of respect for this movie. It is highly recommended for anyone looking for something unique and engaging, and different from many of the recurring films out there.
