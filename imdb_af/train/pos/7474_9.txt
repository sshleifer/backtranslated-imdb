This is one of those movies that is difficult to review without giving away the plot. That's enough to say there are strange things and unexpected twists, beyond the initial superficial "Tom Cruise screws around with multiple women" plots. <br /> <br /> The quality box elevates this movie above the norm, and all the movies are well suited to their parts: Cruise as the annoying smuggling that a playboy has that has everything - and then loses everything, Diaz as the attractive but slightly confused, beloved lover, Cruz as the exotic new girl on the scene and Russell as the paternal psychologist. The story involves elements of romance, morality, murder mystery, tension and science and is generally an entertaining journey. <br /> <br /> I should add that photography is also uniformly excellent and the insertion of various visual metaphors is beautiful if you realize what is going on. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy a movie with excitement and excitement, and willing to accept a somewhat fantastic Philip K Dick steering solution, then this is a must see. <br /> <br /> 9/10
