Laurence Fishburne is a good actor and deserves to try it, but he is not in a class with the big Shakespeare like Olivier and Welles. and he continues to suffer from Kenneth Branagh. This Irishman, who is always brilliant, cleans the show cleanly. Olivier acknowledged that potential in his production, and Iago could jump up with someone he knew. I have not realized the possibilities of Iago, Shakespeare's most evil character, but Branagh shows us the depths. Nice to see the view of Venice.
