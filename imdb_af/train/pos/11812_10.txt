These movies are the best movie to watch for a comic book. The sets, costumes and color are just as vivid that it is just like a comic book. This is the movie I think the Mob is called, the suits, the hats and the attitudes. <br /> <br /> Hoffman gives comic relief as Mumbles and you can't help but sorry for Madonna as she tries and fails to win Tracy. This movie contains all the classic mob cliches - buried people in concrete, blowing people's cars, tying the good man and trying to blow up his girlfriend's house. <br /> <br /> This movie is a classic in every sense of the word, even camera angel crying combo. It's so nice to go back to an older movie and see that someone knows how to make a cartoon in a movie after seeing such mistakes as Spawn and the Hulk. <br /> <br /> !!! YOU MUST SEE THIS FILIE!
