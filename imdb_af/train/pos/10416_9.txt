Like the Arabian Nights, this movie with storytelling conventions plays to make us feel that there is a plot, plot and plot: it opens up with what apparently is the framework of a blind man telling the story of his life and then in " a jump that takes us to the blind man's present, where we find that about half of the story is still coming. (It should be acknowledged that the second half doesn't fully comply with the promise of the first.) Like the Arab nights, try as many Middle Eastern folk motifs as possible in one work. An enjoyable genius, a beautiful princess, a flying carpet, fantastic mechanical toys, sea voyages, a bustling market, an evil sight, jewels. I don't know why it all works, but it does. Everything is just as beautiful. The sets are beautiful. June Duprez is beautiful. Rozsa's score is especially beautiful. As usual, it sounds Hungarian; but somehow he can convince us that he is a Persian in Hungarian.
