It should be one of the best, if not the best, movie I've seen for a very, very long time. Had enough action to satisfy a fan, and yet the plot was very good. I really enjoyed the movie, and chopped me from start to finish. <br /> <br /> Added blood and gore into it, but had the realistic nature of what happened to the front of the movie, even a tear jerk ended for many people I have to think about. <br /> <br /> It's a must watch for everyone. Many reviews seen, hit the movie, but to be honest, most movies that get bad reviews seem to be the best. it proves this again. <br /> <br /> Rent this movie, buy this movie, just go out and watch this movie. You won't be disappointed.
