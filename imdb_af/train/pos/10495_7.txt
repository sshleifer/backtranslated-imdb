Saving Grace is a nice movie to watch in a boring afternoon, if you are looking for something other than ordinary scripts and would like to have fun. I mean, the whole idea of ​​this movie and all the dagga is such a madness! This was the first movie I watched with this theme (drugs / dagga) that didn't really criticize it, but just made jokes. Grace Trevethyn is a widow who lives in a small town in the UK and has many financial problems because of her dead husband, who committed suicide because he was full of debt. The problem is that Grace, who thought to save money for her, discovered that she had to pay all her husband's pounds in debt not to lose all her stuff, especially her home she loved. She has never worked before and is in a tragic situation until Matthew, her gardener who is very found to smoke, decides to partner with her to sell large-scale marijuana.
