My lasting love for Italian actress Lucianna Paluzzi, who helped me start my puberty performance in 1965's "Thunderball", has led me to some special places. Case in point, this British curiosity of 1959, "Carlton-Browne of the F.O.," which Lucianna knows in one of her previous roles. She plays a princess in this one, although the photo is actually a showcase for the talents of Terry-Thomas and Peter Sellers, both stars are definitely on the rise. In this cute, often very funny movie, we learn about the Madeira-like nation of Gaillardia, which was a British colony until 1916 and then universally forgotten. Forty-three years later, however, it becomes the center of global attention and international spies when valuable cob deposits are discovered there. Her Majesty sends the clumsy Carlton-Browne from the Foreign Office to take control. Terry-Thomas subscribes to this section as well as sellers in his role as prime amphibulos of the small country. (It was Sellers' second 1959 movie about a small country that matches wits with the world, and the other is, of course, "The Mouse That Roared.") Ian Bannen steals the show here almost like Gaillardia's suave king and me girl Lucianna is as attractive as in her minor role. The film shows a lot in the way of very dry humor, although there are a few stomach lambs (the reception at the Gaillard airport, for example, and especially the May Day style Gaillardian power parade). And sellers' seedy premier, with his cracked English and seemingly eternal sweats, is another memorable character in the pope of this great actor. Despite the occasional or two fearless, tight-lips British gibberish, I found this photo to be a gentle, modest entertainment and well-presented at this brilliant Anchor Bay DVD.
