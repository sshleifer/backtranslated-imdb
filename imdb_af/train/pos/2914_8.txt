There are not many movies about the Lighter-Than-Air (LTA) aspect of aviation, but it is one of them and it is a pity. Just a fun movie to watch. <br /> <br /> Most of the movies take place at Navy Blimp operations at NAS Lakehurst (with NAS Tustin playing the role). Wallace Beery plays a nice, but Munchausen-like Senior Chief Ned Trumpet, a designated pilot, whose long stories have become so frequent that nobody really believes him. Half of the fun is near the end of the movie when events begin to prove that most of its more outlandish stories are actually true. <br /> <br /> In World War II, the main plot centered on baby Trumpet just using a local widow to end up with a father-son relationship with the widow's crippled son, Jess. He said he would never go with doctors with crutches, head trunk pulls a few strings and a naval surgeon helps recover the boy's cripple. Jess continues to join the fleet to become a flight officer, flying back at Lakehurst and facing a whole new set of challenges. <br /> <br /> A very well-done movie, though not without a few Corny Hollywood dialogs, doesn't slip past technical advisers, and Beery's apparent inability to step in. Otherwise, this movie gets good grades for technical accuracy, and gives a scarce look at the Navy's LTA operations. The Cash Register Scene, an exchange between Trumpet and Jess's future love interest Cathy, is an absolute must.
