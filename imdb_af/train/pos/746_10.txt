As I reach the "back" of 35, I find my head more and more to the coveted, drug-influenced teenagers of today. It was great to remember that it was just as crazy for me back in my day as it is for teenagers today. This film drives what the core of the house shows. If you're a 70-year-old fan, you'll love the movie. From KISS posters to an Angel concert, this movie rocks! <br /> <br /> Look for a young Laura Dern. Why didn't they have more songs from the Runaways, would I never know? <br /> <br /> I had a problem with Randy Quaid's character who broke a 16-year-old girl. While he was away, she and her friends had a party that destroyed dude's house. The police come and everything but all the minor drinks and how these kids got their hands on these things. <br /> <br /> Foxes are right there with over the edge, fast times, dazed and confused and children As one of the all-time teenage fear flashes. <br /> <br /> I say buy it and watch it with your kids and talk about it all.
