THIS IS IN MY MY FAVORITE MOVIE IN THE WORLD !!!!! I enjoyed it when I was 4 and I still enjoy it at 16 !! This is an absolute masterpiece! No video collection is complete without it !!! I enjoy every second of it and the movie does not only have some special special effects, but it sends a big message to the young people of the audience who may sound sounding, but in reality the movie is really COOLY! Although Michael Jackson is already in the movie, people still don't see him as an actor. In fact, he is the most talented actor I know! He is so talented! He is incredible !!! MOONWALKER IS A MUST SEE !!!!!!
