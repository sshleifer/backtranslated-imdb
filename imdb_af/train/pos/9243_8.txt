Don't listen to the very sharp and critical remarks made on this movie. If you are ninja movies, it puts my friends as good as they are! <br /> <br /> Yes, it's stupid, yes, the acting and writing are absolutely horrific, but with a gum - it's so much fun! In fact, as often happens with B-Movies, the terrible 'acting' (which in the case of the movie in question is really the worst, has always been the joy to watch!) And ridiculous 'plot' does not only serve the elevate pleasure level tenfold. <br /> <br /> Obviously, the fighting scenes are the main attraction in this, but mostly, I'm glad to say that they have been very well choreographed, especially the final revelation (during which we testify that ninja is not apparent through the normal laws of gravity are limited.) <br /> <br /> Trust me if you are a fan of ninja movies and you haven't seen Sakura Killers yet, then you really miss something that I think is one of the true gems in the crown of the genre are.
