It was one of those wonderful rare moments in T.V. what I wanted to have captured on VHS forever. Will it never be air again? <br /> <br /> It was so creative and I remember it was broadcast once a week and the wait for the next episode was alarming. I want to see it all again. I want to buy it. I want what I can't have. Not even on EBAY. <br /> <br /> So, after that was enough, it was by far one of the best ranges the 80s brought out. It should be considered a classic, but is lost in space. At least this site and Wikipedia call it. Sob. <br /> <br /> It was quite attractive, funny, flirtatious and original. Perhaps not like Sherlock Holmes's original, I actually think, Quintin is much more attractive and has a better chance with his leading lady than the stiff and critical Holmes ever.
