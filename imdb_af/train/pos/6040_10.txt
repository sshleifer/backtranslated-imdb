I'm not just tired of watching FREEBIRD. My husband was an extra, so I was involved from the beginning. Contacted Jon and helped promote the movie in both Cinemas and now the DVD release. Even to the extent of distributing promotional postcards on cross channel ferries and various locations in France. FREEBIRD is expertly written and aimed with the perfect combination of fun and serious moments plus choice decisive. Only Phil Daniels could fit Grouch's role. Great privilege to meet Jon and the cast on the party following the Prime Minister in January. Anything else you want to do, Jon just asks, email or phone, you know how to get me. Sue xx
