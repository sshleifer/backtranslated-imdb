This film speaks a universal language; One can relate it to self, community, society or the broader world. It provides a way to not only open up multiple questions, but also to set one to discover and ask the right questions to gain self-judgment / ownership. The portrayal of the stereotypes within the film addresses the archetypes around us that must be recognized as the repetitive cycle of destruction, the opposing force of innovation, creativity and growth. The factors that disturb the natural flow of things must be made clear and tackled. The idea is definitely a movie that is experienced and not just being requested, as it comes in the internal voice / conscience of the human being, it makes one feel, rather than just look.
