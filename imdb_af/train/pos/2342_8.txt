I watched the pie-like last night and the word that comes to mind is "original." It's a word that's not much used in TV, as they all tend to copy what the other network does and you end up with seven nights of crime shows, unfunny comedies and reality crap. <br /> <br /> The first thing that hit me like a brick was the presence of Jim Dale. Those who are not familiar with the British "Carry On ..." series or those who did not listen to a Harry Potter book may not be familiar with Dale. I'm not sure whether his presence as a narrator adds or diverts. I'll have to vote more, but it gives the show a "Harry Potter" atmosphere. Maybe it's a good thing. <br /> <br /> Lee Pace (Infamous, The White Grain) has a gift. It never explains where he got it, but he can bring someone back from death for a moment. He teams up with Chi McBride ("Boston Public," Roll Bounce) to solve murders using this talent. Everything is good and funny until he comes to childhood, Anna Friel (Goal! The Dream Begin, Timeline) and things really get complicated. He can't send her back and he can never touch her. Boy, would it make a relationship difficult. <br /> <br /> I will be agreed to see where this series is expecting it to continue to entertain.
