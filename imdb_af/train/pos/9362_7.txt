Greetings again from the darkness. How scarce it is for a movie to investigate the lost soul of men in pain. Adam Sandler dies as Charlie, a man who lost his family in the 9/11 tragedy and has since lost his career, his reason to live and probably his common sense. Don Cheadle fellow students as Sandler's former dental school roommate who has the perfect life (which Sandler apparently had before 9/11). <br /> <br /> Of course, the parallels in these men's lives are obvious, but it is actually refreshing to see men's on-screen feelings in a movie ... feelings other than lust and revenge, it is. To see how they actually help each other by just being there is painful and sincere. Author / director Mike Binder ("The Upside of Anger" and Sandler's accountant in this movie) really brings a different look to the film. Some of the screens do not work as well as others, but overall it is well written and well-directed. <br /> <br /> Sandler and Cheadle are both excellent. Sandler's character reminds us of his good performance in "Punch Drunk Love", but here he brings much more depth. Cheadle is always good and does a good job of expressing the burden he is carrying. Just by looking at him, a puzzle works. <br /> <br /> Support work is excellent by Jada Pinkett Smith (as Cheadle's wife), Liv Tyler (as a very patient psychiatrist), Saffron Burrows (in an oddly attractive role), Donald Sutherland as an irritant Judge and Melinda Dillon and Robert Klein as Sandler's in-laws. <br /> <br /> The movie really touches on how the tragic events of that day hit one man so deeply that he's actually ruined. In addition to the interesting story and some fantastic photos of NYC, you must love a movie that contains Chrissy Hynde, Bruce Springsteen and Roger Daltrey, as well as Eddie Vedder depicting Daltrey. Not really a flashy movie, but it's a quality movie with an unusual story.
