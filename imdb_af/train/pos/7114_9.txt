Definitely on top five of the best John Garfield films should be Pride of the Marines. This is the true story of Marine Private Al Schmid who, for the sake of his own sight, while injured, sustained a horde of Japanese at Guadalcanal. <br /> <br /> The story is beautiful in three parts, Al Schmid's home life where he is a simple work tool that only gets serious with a woman and doesn't enjoy anything better than his land. Pearl Harbor is bombarded and he is at war, like millions of others. <br /> <br /> The second part is at Guadalcanal and we see part of the action where he is in an isolated machine gun. He loves Japanese troops. His actions prevented Marine positions from being exceeded, but a grenade was in his eyes. <br /> <br /> And of course, the third is sharing its painful adaptation to civilian life and ensuring that people don't just care about him being sorry, mostly, that girl, he saw Eleanor Parker. <br /> <br /> This movie was broadcast on TCM on John Garfield's 95th birthday and there was a documentary at Garfield hosted by his daughter. One of the people questioned said Garfield was the most credible actor in the working class roles to have and hold a trade union. <br /> <br /> In that respect, he was fortunate to have had Warner Brothers in Hollywood. Although in the tradition of that studio in gangster roles in the tradition of that studio, Garfield was terrific in these parts because of the nature of life, with the exception of Garfield's Jewish background. <br /> <br /> In this respect, he was perfect to play the part of a workforce like Al Schmid who took responsibility for defending his country. No superheroes here, just a guy who was in Philadelphia, but a job to do. <br /> <br /> That's a big part for Garfield. It's a movie you shouldn't miss. But I wonder what happened to real Al Schmid.
