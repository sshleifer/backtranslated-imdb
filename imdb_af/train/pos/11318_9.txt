This is a haunting, powerful Italian adaptation of James M. Cain's novel The Postman Always Rings Twice directed by the great Luchino Visconti. What is so interesting about the film is that it in any way exceeds the source material to become something more beautiful and original (interestingly, Camus also gets the Cain novel as the key inspiration for his landmark novel The Stranger). The film has greater power and intensity than the novel because Visconti is able to create the cinematic equivalent of Cain's narrative structure, but offers a more complex gender exploration. Cain's very American novel is also uncritically fascinated with the building of whiteness (the main character Cora is obsessively afraid that she will be identified as a Mexican and shy of being married to a Greek immigrant). It is not relevant to the Italian rural context that Visconti is. work in. This allows the class antagonisms to take the middle stage and dance while striving for the passionate, doomed love affair of the two main characters. This movie is a complex, exciting, rewarding experience.
