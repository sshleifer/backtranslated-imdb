For the first time I saw an example of this DVD at a hi-fi show in November 2006 in London (I wasn't really in the cream so far !!). It was through a high-end Arcam system, it sounded good with dts. I had to get this DVD. And I'll tell you it's by far the most exciting music DVD I've ever watched. The performance of Cream at their age was just thought blowing and sound quality was the best I heard on a music DVD. No matter what type of music you want, this one will definitely grow on you. It's the sheer brilliance of their show that shows you how it looks again and again. Even new musicians don't cut the mustard these days, as these old rockers do.
