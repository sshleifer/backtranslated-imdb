Inspired by Ivy Benson and Her All Girls Orchestra, performed during the war years at the Covent Garden Opera House, the efforts of an elderly saxophone player chronicle the (almost) all-girl band she played with as a schoolgirl the end of World War II. Too short flashbacks to the original band on stage, we bring wonderful music and help fill in the background of the band members, and especially for the girls' relationships with the only male member - their transvestite drummer (who is trying to dodge them) call). <br /> <br /> Ian Holm ("Lord of the Rings", "Cromwell and Fairfax") and Judi Dench turn in amazing front performances like the recent widow Elizabeth, Patrick, the drummer. The late Joan Sims is perfect as the group's leader, now playing piano at sea, and June Whitfield glows as the Trombone player of the Salvation Army. Cameo appearances by other sizes such as Cleo Laine, Leslie Caron, Olympia Dukakis and Billie Whitelaw make it an unforgettable experience. The movie is a skirt-memory track, with an all-star cast of what should be, by all rights, to be a bunch of overhead actresses. All I can say is, I hope I look so good at their age! Leslie Caron, in particular, is still an amazing fox, at the age of 69. She still gets my wrist! As I looked at it, I became mentally-minded because I didn't use the appropriate age women. Then I watched these girls and discovered that each one of them was old enough to perform in the London of 1944 (although it may be a piece for Judi Dench). <br /> <br /> If you like swings, thrive on nostalgia, or just want to see how well a woman can look behind her at almost three quarters of a century, don't miss this movie. <br /> <br />
