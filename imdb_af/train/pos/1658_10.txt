If you saw this movie, you were in Puerto Rico. I have lived all my life in Puerto Rico and have to admit that we (PR) are currently living a real chaos, drugs are the main reason for the shooting and murders we have almost every day. These people shoot anyone, anytime and anywhere, and many innocent lives are lost. We no longer feel safe, and in addition, our so-called "justice" is no longer through truth and justice, but through money, influence and power. "Ladrones y Mentirosos" is based on real, unfortunate facts, and really presents the three main problems of Puerto Rico: drug-related murders, money and powers that manipulate our courtroom, and harm and even harm innocent people and children. Ricardo and his wife Poli, with their real-life plot and their award-winning direction (**), were brave enough to present it so badly: Puerto Rico is a beautiful and friendly country that lives a nightmare that seems not to end !!! ** They recently won the "Copper Wing Award" for the best director in the world cinema competition at the 2006 Phoenix Film Festival.
