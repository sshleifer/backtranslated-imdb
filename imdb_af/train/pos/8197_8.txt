**** Excellent <br /> <br /> *** Good <br /> <br /> ** Justify <br /> <br /> * Poor <br /> <br /> "Go ahead, make my day! ' <br /> <br /> The fourth series in the series is directed by Eastwood himself (who was rumored to target most Magnum Force) and he brings back the violent society of the first two films. However, the film still has no impact and credibility. This film was released in the early 80's, the time of Regan and the young republicans. The assumption that a raped woman is taking revenge on her rapist does not appeal to this time frame. This plot would have been better for the Enforcer, which would really make it a good movie. What Sudden Impact needed was a plot like Wall Street, but with Dirty Harry in the middle. <br /> <br /> RATING: 3 STARS
