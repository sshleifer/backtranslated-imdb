In the 1930s, studios would use short films such as this one of the test ground for new actors, given their relative ease of production compared to full length feature films. It is interesting, therefore, that this one star Shirley temple, which has long been established itself as the best-known child star of all time. Then she was probably not the one tested. I would have thought it would have been Frank Coghlan Jr, who played Shirley's brother Sonny in the movie and delivered a relatively less impressive performance. Then again, a 9-year-old Shirley temple was probably not an easy act to accompany. <br /> <br /> The film opens with an unimportant sight gum that includes a leaky ceiling, which I suspect designed to give Shirley Temple a spectacular look at the ceiling, illustrating the working class status of the family in the movie , and give a clean transition to the next scene, which features Shirley cheerfully relieves the rain. <br /> <br /> It's Sonny's birthday, and his dad occasionally tries to hide the fact he wants to give Sonny a dog he really wants for himself, but Sonny is scared of dogs because he was bitten once and had ever been crawled. since. It's strange that when his father insists on getting a dog, decide to run him away from home rather than having a dog in the house and if he runs away without any destination in sight, it's also curious That film illustrates what seems to be an indifference to homeless people, which even surpasses the astonishing indifference that exists today. <br /> <br /> Sonny succeeds a man who makes bacon in an iron pit on the side of the train tracks (just after a train has flown, since how close the tracks he was to, you would think the man right from the tracks would have blown but no matter). After Sonny turned up to share breakfast because of the sour star who received his happy smile from the guy, he went ahead and the homeless man disappeared from the movie. It's interesting to consider what a longer movie would have done, as this one releases the poor guy. <br /> <br /> Not that it's important, Sonny soon hears a dog falling under a box as he passes by, and jumps to find a dog that is covered. It may seem that he immediately picks up and accepts the dog because he just left home because of his fear of dogs, but it was important to me that he should not be reminded of his power over dogs, but of their lack of power about him. Once he saw a dog in distress, he overcame his fear. <br /> <br /> Hey, if that's all I have to do, I'll find a helpless spider and I'm stuck! <br /> <br /> It's a very comfortable movie in which everything works out as it should, but it's cute enough and nice enough (and short enough, as it was) to be another fun movie. We're not expecting an epic plot in a 19-minute movie, but Pardon My Pups still packs a significant amount of story and character development in its short time. And it also contains a battle scene at the end of the movie that made Charlie Chaplin proud. I'm hardly an expert on Shirley Temple's movies, but it's not hard to see how she's become the best-known child star of all time.
