Fabulous costumes by Edith Head who painted them on Liz Taylor at her best! <br /> <br /> The SFX is great for a movie of its age, and the stunt doubles actually looked like the actors, even to the type of body, a rarity in movies of this vintage. <br /> <br /> An enjoyable movie, with beautiful panoramas - even if it's cut to pan and scan.
