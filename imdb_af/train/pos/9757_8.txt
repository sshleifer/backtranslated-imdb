Richard Willaims is an animation god. He was making this movie difficult by the producer. The final product is a very uneven movie with a very winding story, but some wonderful moments of animation (such as Emery Hawkins's "Greedy"). Joe Raposo's recurring music also doesn't help. It's made in wide screen so the VHS doesn't show it in all its glory, we hope for a letterbox DVD one day. Yet it is worth looking for some eye-catching animations.
