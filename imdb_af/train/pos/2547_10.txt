One cannot often enjoy this jewel, the 1936 invisible Ray. But it can't be forgotten. The story is elegant. Karloff, tight and bitter in his Carpathian mountain access, is Janos Rukh, genius science who reads ancient light ray to determine events in the great geological past, especially the collapse of a powerful radioactive meteorite in Africa. Along with him is the ever-elegant Lugosi (as a rare hero), studying 'astrochemistry'. Frances Drake is the beautiful, unused young woman; Frank Lawton's romantic temptation; and the divine Violet Kemble Cooper is Mother Rukh, in a show worthy of Maria Ospenskya. <br /> <br /> The story moves fast in bold episodes, with special effects still attractive. It also contains some wonderful lines. One Rukh recovers his mother's face, he asks, "Mother, can you see, can you see?" "Yes, I can see, clearer than ever. And what I see scares me." Even better when mom Rukh says, "He broke the first law of science." I am not just under my acquaintance to confuse for many years, exactly what this first law of science is. <br /> <br /> This movie is definitely desert material.
