At first I didn't love it, though I did. They did not include the third Trueba generation, the love between Blanca and Pedro was not well explained and some actors were too different from what I thought. <br /> <br /> Later I realized that, the movie was more loyal to the book, it would have been five hours, and would be so boring. Now I love it a lot because my favorite characters are there as I have portrayed them. Clara really looks like an angel in life, and her introduction to the story at the begging of the movie was fantastic, loyal and short. Glenn Close is Ferula. I pictured her just like that, just not in grief over the whole thing. Esteban finds enough. I never really loved his character, and even though I was interested, I hated him a lot, especially if he hit Clara. As in the book, the last part is the most exciting one, and it also has the right history. <br /> <br /> The movie is really good, especially since it is a gringo movie based on a Latin American book. His wonderful number of famous stars are there, don't you think so?
