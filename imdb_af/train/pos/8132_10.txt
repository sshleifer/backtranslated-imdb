I don't remember when I first heard of this movie, but I rented it six years ago, and it remains one of my favorite comedies. I will admit that you will probably despise this movie if you know nothing about rap music. But if you're a rap fan, even a casual one, you'll love the inside of jokes and references. One of the best lines in the movie is about the difference between a b **** and a h **; I still use this line today and get a lot of laughter with it. One of the best performances comes from Larry Scott, who played a nerd Lamar in a vengeance of the nerds. It is a pity that this movie will probably never get a DVD edition.
