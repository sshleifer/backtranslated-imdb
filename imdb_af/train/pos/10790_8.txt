This incredibly formal movie from the Walker, Texas Ranger group features some of the most amazing scenes ever seen in a TV movie. In addition, one can predict the outcome of the appearance very much. However, it is a fun movie that does the job: it entertaines. This is all it was meant to do and it does. The stunts and explosions are fun and exciting and the plot is not bad. The play is also decent, which is not much of a surprise, because everyone knows that Chuck Norris is not Steven Seagal. If you're a fan of the genre (and of "Walker, Texas Ranger"), you'll definitely love it. If not, don't waste your time. 8/10
