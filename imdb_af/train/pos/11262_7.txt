DEVIL'S PLAYTHING is my second attempt at a Joseph Sarno production - and although I would say it is much nicer than the painfully dull and unrotic Swedish WILDCATS, it is a little slow and unclear to my taste. <br /> <br /> This one focuses on a group of vampires living in a castle who want to revive their previously murdered "leader". To do this, the girls have to dance naked, kiss each other and sing stingy things - and of course also drink blood. When a doctor and her brother's car are broken down and they have to stop at the castle, they offer the ideal blood bank for the horny vampires ... but they may not be as helpless as they seem. <br /> The DEVIL'S PLAYTHING is a good example of the early 70's. Much nudity - including some frontal anchors, a few shrewd undertones - including blood scans and of course lesbo-blood sugar ... but these scenes are still fairly comfortable according to today's standards. Some pretty hot women in this one would have benefited from some more explicit sex, but I don't think you can have it all. Also, it would have benefited from a heavier violence / gore, because it is a vampire movie, but I think the purpose of THE DEVIL'S PLAYTHING was more to show skin, not blood. Still a little slow - and the acting is mostly wood - but it is expected of something of this era and of this budget. A look is to exploit fans - others find it a bit to sow for their taste. 10/07
