I saw this movie with a lot of friends and although only two of us walked out of the theater, think how cool it was, the other just laughed and commented on how stupid it was. Well, it was because it shouldn't be taken seriously, it's actually a movie that mocks horror flicks and does a damn good job. There is apparently another movie coming out ... Scary Movie ?? Well, it's Aussie, and originally !!! Jessica Napier has a surperb show and Sarah Kants has a definite bright future in acting! I hope to see more of them. Molly Ringwald was a good move, and Kylie was a better move. The Impossible Princess was Queen of the Screen !! I recommend watching this movie as you will guess the relationship with Raffy, Hilary and The movie, which has never been completed 20 years ago.
