It's a good movie, but it's not recommended if you don't like intelligent movies. It's about two guys who wish the world was leaving, and that's exactly what they got. The play is wonderful, the end was not predictable and it actually had a good story, unlike most movies. People complain about the movie too simply or to sow. I think they just like movies like The Toxic Avenger (I actually like B movies) or The Grim Adventures or Billy and Mandy. One note: If you see it, it has exactly the same actors of Cube except four actors. Make it two notes: Wait for the credits (Trust me on this one). Enjoy the movie.
