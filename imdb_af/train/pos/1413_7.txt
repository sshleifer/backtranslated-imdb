In 2006, the AMPAS depicted one of the most innovative documentary articles depicting the coldest place on Earth, and the film was March of the Penguins released by the Oscar award, Morgan Freeman. <br /> <br /> Walt Disney Studios has had a monopoly on the animated circuit for decades now. They took their bits of live action film production and hit and miss the board. Disney then created a sub-section called Disney's and released his first feature film, Earth. It's absolutely one of the most beautiful and informative documentaries I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Given by the great James Earl Jones, the Earth does not offer anything new to anyone who has been watching the Discovery Channel for the past five years or following the Global Warming crisis. The earth is deeply concerned about the issue and takes a very liberal approach to the subject. <br /> <br /> It allows an emotional connection to nature that I have not yet experienced. It also shows not only the beauty and mystifying parts of our beautiful planet, but the grounds and disturbing aspects it often entails. It is one thing to watch how "Mufasa" falls from a cliff to a stampede or Bambi's mother is shot by a hunter in the middle of the forest. It's all right, because at the end of the movie we know it's just a movie. It shows penguins, polar bears, elephants, all kinds of families, of all levels of life, living and dying in their natural habitats. These real things make a real movie experience. <br /> <br /> Although the graphic nature of the movie (which many disagree with) is heavy weight, the Earth is a pleasant experience. There are beautiful cinematography works here by a great camera team and a wonderful score by George Fenton. Compared to March of Penguins or Grizzly Man, it doesn't really matter, but it does well on its own. At the end of the day, you become an appreciation for our planet and a little sad. Many of us will probably never visit these places we'll see in the movie. We live here, but it's like we never explore the planet for some reason. The earth is beautiful. <br /> <br /> *** / ****
