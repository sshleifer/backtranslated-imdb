10/10 for this movie. <br /> <br /> I am a British Indian doctor, currently in India. The word Beckham turned me off, 'cos I'm a tough Liverpool fan, and personally Owen thinks it's really cool. As Liverpool and Man Utd are rivals, I was DEAD sure I wouldn't see the movie. <br /> <br /> But then I was in Delhi to meet friends, and I had an early morning flight, so I thought, "What are the heels, let's take the time to watch this movie?" because it was a late night show. <br /> <br /> What a moron I was. I had to watch this movie on the day it was released. I think the use of Beckham's name was to attract audiences (which in my case fired back!), But then I can't really think of a better title for the movie. <br /> <br /> And Nagra, Knightley (drop dead beautiful), and Rhys-Myers did an excellent job. <br /> <br /> If you hate football, don't like Manchester United (or England for that matter) then it's definitely the movie for you. In fact, I'm just 29 years old, a professional psychiatrist, but a child of heart. This movie hit "Star Wars" from my no.1 position. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, there is not so much comment on this movie by India-British as I do. I wonder why? <br /> <br /> 10/10 for this movie.
