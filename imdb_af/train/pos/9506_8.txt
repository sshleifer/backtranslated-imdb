A sober, reflective piece, a small miniature that originates in a wonderful human picture series, which goes beyond mere mere screenplay. This quiet, tiny story keeps you entertaining - if you don't have too much trouble with the various Spanish accents ranging from Mexican to Peruvian, and use Marisa Paredes's more authentic Iberian painting! Garcíadiego has achieved a perfect adaptation of the novel: even the great maestro García Márquez must be proud of her beautiful work. And down to Arturo Ripstein, who made so much effort in jewelry, a ruby, and so refined, so elegant, so sensitive, so touchy. <br /> <br /> El Coronel - Fernando Luján - is waiting to get his pension while still staying in his ramshackle, living deep in the Colombian jungle (filmed elsewhere, NOT in Colombia) with his vegan and his wife (in that order) live. And that's all there is to it. <br /> <br /> But, oh, so much more .... This movie is a rock shot. <br /> <br /> I have to see this poetic little piece again. as soon as possible. Appreciate the high side of 8 out of 10, which is very high on my scale. <br /> <br /> It's not light commercial Hollywood stuff.
