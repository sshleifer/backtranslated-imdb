It makes me proud of British. This is by far the funniest thing on TV. The league consists of Jeremy Dyson, Steve Pemberton, Mark Gatiss and the beautiful Reece Shearsmith. Totally underestimated, this horror comedy is perfection. The characters are iconic and the catches bizarre, "Hello Dave". It's a comedy that everyone should watch. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the league of gentlemen is that it's always fresh and always pushing the boundaries. It doesn't have to rely on catches (other than small Britain) because it's funny. The fact that the league is willing to kill their most famous and iconic characters shows us that they have steel balls.
