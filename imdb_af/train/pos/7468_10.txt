As the one-line summary says, two movies left such a comment about me when I left the theater. One was a "stir of echoes" with Kevin Bacon, and the second was "Vanilla Sky". <br /> <br /> It's one of those movies that you put deep in the theater and stop thinking about someone around you, stop wondering what the end of the movie will be and let the movie leave you quickly where it wants to ... Step out of the theater was a bit strange, as you feel when you are sick and can't think of anything. One of those movies you become one with the man, and feel that nothing else around you than the things in the movie. <br /> <br /> One thing's for sure. The actors are great, the soundtrack is excellent and everything in the movie is 9+. Surely one of the best movies I've ever seen, and the movie that made the best and most shocking thing about my life and purpose in this world.
