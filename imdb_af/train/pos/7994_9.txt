I love this movie a lot. It's dark, it's not a dot dodging, and a pursuit of your brain action movie. Many of the characters' backgrounds and motivation are so vague that the viewer can come to their own conclusions. it is nice to see a movie where the director allows the viewer to make their own thoughts. <br /> <br /> In the end, motivated by love or revenge, or a desire to repent - he does what he feels is "right". "Will God ever forgive us for what we did?" - It is not a question that mortal men can answer - so he does what he feels he must do, what he is good at, what he is trained to do. <br /> <br /> Denzel Washington is a good actor - I honestly can't think of one bad movie he did - and he has a great supporting role. I would thoroughly recommend this movie to everyone.
