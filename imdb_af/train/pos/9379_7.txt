The more I look at Nicholas Cage, the more I value him as an actor. Looking at this movie (in 2005), I can see that it doesn't really fit the genre of movies coming out in the early 90s. I don't really think it can be considered a movie noir, but it is sometimes almost dark, mainly because of the lighting and strange characters of the characters. Typical performances of each of the three major actors, all of which had a good job with their roles. However, I thought that Hopper and Boyle's characters were left undeveloped because it was sometimes difficult to understand what they were doing and why they did it. Hopper loves him or hates him. The plot is really good, and although I found some parts very unrealistic, there were parts where I had to hand it over to the director (that is, when he saw the sheriff first). All in all, this movie is definitely worth watching. *** 1/2
