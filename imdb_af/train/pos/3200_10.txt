This is a great Canadian comedy series. The film tells how stars Jean Paul Tremblay (Julian) and the lead author of the show and his friends Rickie and Bubbles play on top of what is real life, satirical look at trailers and residents of the said trashy hoods. The movie will tell you why Rickie and Julian are starting to do their more advanced forays in the world of crime. WHY and the reasons behind everything will be a spoiler, so I won't give the real reasons behind their brilliant escapades. Their friend and many-time partner (Bubbles) is a brilliant character. The whole show is brilliant and missing the movie won't affect the way you see the sit-com a bit. It is a comedy with a capital C and a brilliant satire on trailer park, lively and small crooks with small ideas, but big dreams. If you've ever had the opportunity to look - buy - this program steals it. You'll be glad you did. And to my American friends --- it will break you too. 10 out of 9. Brilliant. TV how to be TV.
