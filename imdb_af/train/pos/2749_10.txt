A good picture is worth all the words. This film has the most poetic scene that ever dreamed of people with Down's syndrome. And I won't spoil it by telling you. You will want to see it yourself. <br /> <br /> Pasqual Duquenne is a great actor. I didn't need to understand a single word he said to understand his meaning. <br /> <br /> The movie has a magic of its own. Having looked at it, I understood better that we put too much value on performance and not enough on the people we love. Passion and simplicity are all we need.
