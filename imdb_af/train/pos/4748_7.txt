The story will never win awards, but it's not about it. The writing was just entertaining and tense enough to make room for the incredibly choreographed scenes. Who needs a story to fight like that? Really, it's worth looking just for that reason. If you can handle the Gore, of which there is a LOT ..., nothing realistic enough to look difficult. I gave it a 7.
