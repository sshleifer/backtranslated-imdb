The first time I saw this movie, I loved it. It was different. <br /> <br /> I am a Christian (Bible believer). I'm not going with the crowd of right-wing believers. I went out of the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> In my efforts to take over our government, they are doing what Judas is trying to do. I call it the Judas syndrome. <br /> <br /> Judas didn't get it, though Jesus said his kingdom was not of this world. <br /> <br /> This movie definitely showed some of this. <br /> <br /> I also liked that Jesus had the simple pleasure of playing games and jokes with his disciples. <br /> <br /> He was also a very beautiful Jesus. <br /> <br /> This is a watch over and over movie. <br /> <br /> Very satisfying.
