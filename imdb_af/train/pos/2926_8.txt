... It even beats the nasty "raw". Almost twenty years old is this show and I still laughed a lot when I watched it last night. It shows Eddie Murphy dressed in stiff red clothes (Old School) and he jokes with everything from celebertis to his family. He was just 22 years old and it's a must see! <br /> <br /> 8/10
