It is, in my opinion, one of the best action movies of the 1970s. Not only does it have a huge role to play, it is also loaded with wild shooting ranges and explosions that are still impressive today. The story is about a Vietnam veterinarian (Kris Kristofferson) recruited by his brother (Jan-Michael Vincent) to help clear the criminal element in a small town and what happens when Kris benefits from his position and becomes so bad as the criminals he was hired to get rid of. It's great to play Kris against type. Bernadette Peeters and Victoria Principal both offer good support as the respective ladies of the two male stars. Jan-Michael shows real movie star in this movie. I don't think Vigilante Force is on video, but it occasionally comes on TV. It's a good movie for guys who love movies.
