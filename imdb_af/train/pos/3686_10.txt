Diane and I saw this fantastic movie today in Fremantle and we both agreed that the pastiche movies had the head and shoulders above the rest. I say this because, through the short, five to ten minute segments that made up the movie and the fact that this film had a theme each piece was composed and of course the theme of love was in its many forms. <Br /> <br /> The film has apparently occurred in the various Parisian arrondisments, giving each segment a particular flavor. I was just in Paris a few times, and I wasn't good enough to easily recognize the places, but I'm sure Europeans and especially the French people can easily recognize the city's places. In any case, the viewer is immediately caught up in every story because of their excellence in production, so that these city locations fall into consequence. <br /> <br /> The movie is moving fast and the viewer is left to absorb one scenario while the new one is on the screen. The stories themselves are not graphical like a pulp-Hollywood nonsense, they are subtle and thought-provoking and soft as with most of life without the media swat that bury so much of life's beauty under the closest mishap sell, sell. sell ... <br /> <br /> Join someone you care about and let this magical little movie bathe like a spa treatment and if you leave me guessing, you'll feel renewed.
