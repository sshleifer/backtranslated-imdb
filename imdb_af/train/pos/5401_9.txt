It is a testimony to Gosha's incredible filmmaking that he could complete both Hitokiri and his beautiful masterpiece, Goyokin, in the same year 1969. And this is proof of how criminals underestimate his stay to the general public (compared to the media darlings like the great Akira Kurosawa), that Hitokiri and Goyokin received less than 500 votes between them. <br /> <br /> Shintaro Katsu is Okada Izo: a crazy dog ​​killer, loyal to Tosha tribe and their boss Takechi, played by another genre of stalwart, Tatsuya Nakadai. The Tosha group was part of a larger alliance supporting the emperor against the flailing Shogunate. The historical background is fairly accurate - with Japan's increasing political turmoil between imperialists and the Tokugawa and the pressure of the West to end a 300-year social and political seclusion. It helps a lot to know about Japanese history and eventually led to the Meiji recovery and the abolition of the Tokugawa Shogunate, but it is not necessarily necessary. The film is made mainly for a Japanese audience, so certain things are taken for granted, but it also works well for the non-initiated. <br /> <br /> As one would expect from a Hideo Gosha movie in its golden years (the late 60's), the visual palette is breathtaking, using external and internal symbolism that conceals image beauty. However, style is never decorative for Gosha - it is always in service of the story. <br /> <br /> Speaking of speech, Hitokiri is both literally and figuratively dominated by the tortured main character Izo Okada. Like most chambara protagonists, Izo finds himself in a moral double tie, torn between giri (obligation) and ninjo (natural impulse) - though it takes a while to realize exactly what his giri is. In the first half of the movie, Izo tries for social self-promotion. High aspirations of social rank and marriage to an aristocrat's daughter - a major advance for someone coming from the farmer's background in the rigid social caste system of 19th-century Japan. <br /> <br /> The turning point for Izo is when he realizes at what cost self-promotion comes, the loss of identity and, consequently, the loss of self. It was at that stage that he underwent a very symbolic transformation from a well-known Tosha clan swordman to a "nameless" drifter without past or future, Torazo the Vagrant. Although not technically significant and not a genre drifter in Yojimbo's form, it is the loss of its former self and the death of ego, ambition and self-delusion that Izo allows to see things as they really are and themselves to redeem. <br /> <br /> Hitokiri ends (which I won't reveal here) in the best way can end any story: positive and negative with a deeply ironic twist that Izo gives the last laugh, a last sardonic comment the face of death.
