This is my favorite of the three care carrying movies. Again I kept all the songs. The big problem, as most people pointed out, however, was that this story contradicts the original. For those who have seen the first movie, the bears met their "cousins", which they apparently never knew. Of course, this was not to the end when the cousins ​​received their stomach symbols after they proved how much they had taken care of. In this story, however, the cousins ​​grow with the caregivers and have stomach symbols all the time. It's said it's not a bad movie, as long as you say goodbye to the first. I thought the Darkheart character was much more angry than the Nicholas of the first. But at the same time, I felt it added some kind of balance to the sweetness of the caring trees. I also liked the part we end up, although I know other people had mixed feelings about the scene. And of course I loved the songs. My favorites are big and forever young. The care-carrying films have always had such good songs. Ten stars for a great movie.
