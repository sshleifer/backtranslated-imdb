House of Games is a wonderful movie on several levels. It's a fine puzzle and a shocking thriller. It is blessed with great performances by Lindsay Crouse and Joe Montegna, and strong, strong role-playing supporting players. It introduces Ricky Jay, the card sharpener of extraordinary, prestigious, and historian of magic. His dialogue, written by David Mamet, is regarded as an act and gives the film (in which reality is often in question) an extra dimension of unreality. <br /> <br /> On the face of it, House of Games is a convincing look at the unknown world of cheats and men, diametrically differently from The Sting, which has just been played for shine and yuks. At this level it succeeds. <br /> <br /> However, you cannot escape the deeper level examination of a woman's odyssey from self-sufficient professional skills to incredible power and self-fulfillment. The only film I know to treat the theme of the rise of personal strength in a woman in a dignified way is the underrated Private Benjamin. This well-pleasing movie diffuses its focus, jumps under several themes and uses the good performance of Goldie Hawn to chase some easy slats. House of Games sticks to its business. As Poe once said of a good short story, it runs relentlessly to his conclusion. <br /> <br /> There is another series of films about women, by Thelma and Louise, a big commercial moneymaker with the despicable theme of women being condemned, whether they realize their inner strengths or not. Which tripe. <br /> <br /> As usual, you should watch this movie in a movie. It should of course be for film festivals. Nominate it for one near you if you get the chance. <br /> <br /> I bought the original version of House of Games and gave it to my 23 year old daughter. She should see it better on a TV than at all.
