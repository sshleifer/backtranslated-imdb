I thought it was a very charming movie. The story seems to be a thinly veiled John Waters autobiography: Pecker's greatest gift is his ability to find beauty in unexpected places. Edward Furlong is well on the lookout, but the best performances are by his grandmother, Mink Stole (a hilarious cameo) and by all people, Patty Hearst. I think the judges are off the ground on this one. They look like Pecker's worst valuation of his work as a gospel, when I think the picture is pretty clear that he is indeed a promising artist.
