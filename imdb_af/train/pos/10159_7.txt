There are few movies or movies I have considered over the years. The Gospel Road was one of them. I saw it as a young teenager and would like the opportunity to see it again. My favorite parts were the fact that <br /> <br /> 1 / Jesus was blonde <br /> <br /> 2 / Last dinner was a great meal, <br /> <br /> 3 / he <br /> <br /> 4 / Death was for all people and for all time. <br /> <br /> The movie may not be theologically sound or high quality, but it touched my heart at that time. In addition, I'm a Johnny Cash fan and it was a brave business. If ever it comes to DVD, I'll just buy it for sentimental reasons.
