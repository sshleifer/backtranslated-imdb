"The thief of Baghdad" is impressive in the form of the evil wizard Jaffar (Conrad Veidt). He picks up lies and spells to get the kingdom of his rightful ruler, young king Ahmad, and a beautiful princess of her father ... <br /> <br /> He eventually falls victim, as all tyrants do ( in books and legends) to love and embody the ordinary man he ignored here by the small thief (Sabu). <br /> <br /> The armies of good and evil, black and white, are well-known in both visual and literary terms ... <br /> <br /> The writing is poetic, simple and very beautiful. The costumes of the wizard and his men rise and fall like the wings of black birds, suddenly attack at night causing destruction and terror ... <br /> <br /> The radiant hero wears white turbans and clothes, and his princess is dressed in pink and pale blues ... <br /> <br /> For spectacular scenes it fits everything that has gone before, but by using color it has brought a world to life as it wasn't previously possible . <br /> <br /> With flying carpet and flying white horse, With a giant genius (excellently played by Rex Ingram), with evil wizards, and with the good acting of Sabu and Veidt, "The Thief of Baghdad" , the quality and true atmosphere of the Arabian nights are captured. <br /> The 1940 version remains the screen's best fairy tale!
