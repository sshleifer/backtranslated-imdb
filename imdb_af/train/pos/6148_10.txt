IN THE LOVE THOUGHT OF DAVID TOMLINSON (1917-2000) <br /> <br /> When I first watched this movie, I was 4 years old and I was fascinated by this story of World War II witches. The scene that impressed me most was the battle between Nazi soldiers and the medieval army. It was exceptional to see this army without a body walk to fight the devastated song of their march. This movie is fantastic, from the trip to Portobello Road (which has become the most amazing place for me in London) after traveling to Naboomboo. Angela Lansbury and David Tomlinson are really a fantastic couple. She is always good, the good aunt of a family and David with his always astonished face seems to be her great fellow protagonist. we will miss him a lot.
