Funny. Heart broken. Charming. These are all the words that have driven my head while watching this beautiful, simple movie. <br /> <br /> It's hardly a movie that really moves me, but "Will we dance?" Achieve it with grace to save. Soft humor mixed with occasional subtle anxiety makes it one of the best experiences of my movie viewing history. It left me with a quiet sense of glory, but mixed with a little bit of sadness. <br /> <br /> And the dance, oh, the dance. Even if you are not a lover of art, or can not put one foot in front of the other, the steps shown here will leave your breath and enroll you as soon as possible for classes. It was absolutely captivating, even the parts that show Sugiyama's (vividly portrayed by Koji Yakusho) stilted steps when he first learned to dance, was fun in a humorous, childish way. And yet this film was not just about dance, but more about the subtleties of human behavior and feelings. We testify of a shy man who challenges his repressed feelings through dance, a beautiful dance instructor who rediscovered her love for the art and the personal growth of every member of the wonderful supporting role. <br /> <br /> Beauty. Pain. Emotion. All the love and small agonies of life are here, expressed with the delicate feel of a fine Japanese watercolor painting combined with the emotional power and grace of the culture. <br /> <br />
