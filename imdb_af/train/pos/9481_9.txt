Xiao Chen Zhi Chun is a good movie, not only in the year it is shot, but also now. It's an art movie that's not even outdated in the 21st century. The director maintained a good narrative skill and made the story so smooth! <br /> <br /> The film reminds me of the later French new wave movie: Francois Truffaut's "Femme d'a cote" which is similar to the subject.
