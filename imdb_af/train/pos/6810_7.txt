After reading the book, I did this $ 3 for this DVD at Wal-Mart. I thought, what the hell ... I got the DVD and watched last night. When I started watching it, I checked the running time and it was about 90 minutes. I thought, OK cool. It seems to me running slowly, knowing the story and how many of them were there. By the time I got to the real killings, I was like, "how much time did it leave?" Checked. "One minute?! What the hell ?! I was incredibly cheated and thought that the movie had only progressed through a third of the overall story. <br /> <br /> But then I happily noticed that the DVD's playlist included a part 1 and part 2. I still have another hour and a half to go! I then sat very happy and enjoyed the second half of the film, even more than the first. <br /> <br /> I admit I didn't see the original 1967 movie (despite my sincere desire) However, read the novel and feel it is a pretty descent movie, for a two-part TV miniseries, this is. I think Perry's decisive role was totally wrong and some minor inconsistencies jumped at me, but still very well done. The first half pulls a little while the second half is much more gripping. I think they had to have the movie more portrayed as Capote did his book: 1/3 before the murders, 1/3 after and 1/3 after the murderers were arrested. Instead, the movie makes more 1/2 the murders, 1/4 after and 1/4 after the murderers are arrested. Again, this makes the second half more exciting, but at the same time less compelling while the first half is over and over. <br /> <br /> Now I look back and realize I just made the same. mistake to put on things, and so I will close hell. Check out the movie and make your own damn mind! <br /> <br /> Nick Houston
