Peter M. Cohen has a winning satire on the pairing game, turns around and turns inside. The critical bashing of the movie in mainstream media publications as "offensive" and "resting" only serves to emphasize its intensity as a refreshing and concentrated dissection of people's sexual pursuits and passions. It is in the tradition of what I call "reality-based" satire, which follows in the footsteps of "In The Company of Men", "Chasing Amy", "Your Friends and Neighbors" and "Two Girls and a Guy". Cohen's dialogue is hilarious and I was constantly intrigued by how perfectly he captured the real pace of today's talks. Brian Van Holt, Zorie Barber, and Jonathan Abrahams are three distinct, inexorable sex-obsessed predators who, along with the mace of their recently married partner (played by Judah Dom), have their own predator (Amanda Peet) in their own terms . Under the satirical surface, a romantic comedy attracts far more satisfying than most sugar-coated studio products.
