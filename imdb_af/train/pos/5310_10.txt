Pecker is another mainstream movie by John Waters that was performed on a smaller than Serial Mom. The title character of Pecker has a hobby to take pictures of anything he sees. It doesn't matter whether it's dirty or shocking if he takes pictures. He quickly used the photos he took and put them on his work. Pecker lives in a semi-normal middle-class family. His dad works at a drinking beard with a climbing machine, but doesn't make enough money with a lesbian stripper bar across the street. His mother runs a thrift and likes to put on poor people. His older sister, Tina, works at a gay bar where her specialty deals. His younger, Little Chrissy, has a habit of eating sugar, sugar and nothing but sugar. His grandmother, Memama, has a small image of the Virgin Mary and plays ventriloquist. He also has 2 friends. On his friends, Matt is a chronic shop lover and his girlfriend, Shelley, runs a wash mat as if she were a dictator. Soon, a New York tourist buys his photos and shows it at an art gallery. With the photo comes familiarity, but the photos reveal the unusual lifestyle of his friends and family's simple life. For an R-rated movie, Pecker is probably more vocal than most of Waters' previous R-rated movies and even Pink Flamingos. Another 10 out of 10!
