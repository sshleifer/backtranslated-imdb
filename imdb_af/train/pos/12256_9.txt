Kate Beckinsale is excellent as the manipulative and yet irresistible Emma in this TV adaptation of Jane Austen's novel. When I read the novel, I was sometimes disappointed if the protagonist really deserved to see the heroine of the story: Honestly she was so terribly self-righteous and judged that man tempted her to keep her serious. However, Kate Beckinsale's interpretation saves Emma from herself to speak: she is portrayed with all the innocence and generosity of her character in full view, and it cannot help her despite her less sweet qualities. Kate Beckinsale is the most important, but not the only reason why this TV series is so wonderful; Raymond Coulthard is perfect as Mr. Frank Churchill, fully expressing the character of this character's personal magnetism (which is becoming increasingly noticeable, because Ewan McGregor does not handle it very well in Emma's 1996 screen adjustment) Mark Strong, Samantha Morton, Bernard Hepton and Olivia Williams is all as they should be in their respective roles. This production is briefly a great achievement and one to see with increasing pleasure many times.
