This is my kind of movie. I am fascinated by strange psychotic nightmares and this movie is just like that. But it's also a dark comedy. As I mostly see it as a horror / thriller, there will be others who can see it as a black dramatic comedy. <br /> <br /> But it's also a fascinating lineage in madness. The end has caught me, but what is the end! It makes the viewer much to think about. Powerful performances, a complex and detailed plot, a wonderful script full of fear and humor, and a horrible atmosphere make it a worthy movie to watch. <br /> Personally, I think I have to look it up a few times to pick up and understand all the subtleties that are inside. But it is such a movie that it will be a pleasure and not a task to do so.
