Why is this movie not in the 250 best? This movie looks surprisingly fresh for 56 years after its production, but it could only be made in the aftermath of W.WII due to the perception of proximity to death. People were more aware that life could be stopped at one unexpected moment. And what about life? I ended the scene with judgment and all people of all nations gathered. The Phlegmatic judge (Abraham Sofaer-a typical British judge), Doctor Reeves (Roger Livesey), defends Peter Carter (David Niven) and also June (Kim Hunter) against American prosecutor Abraham Farlan (Raymond Massey I-it is a why this is an American). It's so imaginative! Michael Powell wrote, directed and produced this surprising film, which is a true "tour-de-force". The message of the film is clear: in the universe, the law is most important, but on earth nothing goes beyond the love between people. The way this beautiful story is told is much more interesting than any Hollywood movie ever could.
