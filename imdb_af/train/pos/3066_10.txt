Everyone loves or hates this movie. I'm going with love. It was shot so well and performed so well. Pretty. This film is for people who appreciate well-crafted film. If you are not a fan of well-done movies of course you would hate it. But if you like the tops of acting, photography, story and development, look no further than here.
