I was too young to ever get to know a lot of prince, but over the past few years I have seen many Purple Rain Novelty Tea's and I thought they were cool, but I didn't want to buy a shirt. I didn't know anything. So one Saturday it came and I decided to see it. I didn't know what the movie was about before I watched it, but it was nice when I found out. In the movie, Prince was not known as Prince, but as "the child". All the shows I, but my favorite, were Purple Rain, Darling Nicki, and I will die for you. All the songs tied up in the movie as his mother and father always fought the song when pigeons were crying, describing what he was feeling. I also like how smart a prince was with the way he flirted with Apallonia. I liked it when Prins and Appallonia first met in the club and he stood behind her and when she turned, he disappeared! wonderful movie and now i can't find any of the tea shirts :(
