About thirty years ago, author Numa Sadoul published a book-length interview with Belgian comic artist Georges Remi (better known as Herge, the creator of Tintin). This movie is being used today with Sadoul, as he remembers the interview as we listen to the cassettes (Herge was killed in 1983) and saw some old photos and footage of the man himself. Some parts of the interview were not published at the request of Herge in the book, and we now know that it treated his separation from his wife after having had a relationship with one of his associates (who would later become his second wife ). An interesting thing that does not address the movie well is the shift in the Tintin books of the early legal and imperialist books (Tintin in Congo, Tintin in the Soviet Union countries) to fairly anti-imperialist books, just a few years later. Blue Lotus). In general, I come out of this movie and know a few more about Herge and see him a little more unlikely than when I come to the theater.
