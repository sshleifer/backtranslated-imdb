The first series of Lost kicked off with a bang ... literally and slowly paused. This can turn some viewers off and people who are halfway through will be bored or just confused. <br /> <br /> I guess people who are new to the world of Lost are simply looking from the beginning and not getting off the slower episodes. The acting door is excellent, but why did 5 series' plan ... WHY ??? All this means that there will be no answers for at least 4 years. Oh, I'll keep on checking if it stops the tension and dialogue.
