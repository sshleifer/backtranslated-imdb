Unlike many other films, which disturb their mere unpleasantness (Man Bites Dog) or their mere violence (most Peckinpah films), they are satisfactorily shocked by his likelihood. Certainly, the buggery scene is pretty simple in its unpleasantness, but the effect of the movie is far more from its slow build and tangible sense of isolation around the four leads, both before and after everything goes wrong. The moment the canoes under the child go on the bridge, which does not even recognize the men to whom he had previously played music, shows a sign of human love for them, one of the most sinister in the modern film is . The tension goes up throughout the canoe trip, and even persists to the final credits - the end makes the meaning of the characters' trials terribly real. The film's likelihood is strongly supported by playing the lead, especially Ned Beatty and Jon Voight as the victim and reluctant hero respectively. Burt Reynolds has never been better. The film's cultural influence is evidenced by the number of people who will understand a "banjo area". Perhaps only Carter has done such an effective greenhouse in a region's tourism industry. I can only think of a handful of movies that suppressed me so seriously after they were done. The oppressive atmosphere of Se7en is the best comparison I can think of. Although so much of it is excellent by itself, Salvation is especially a classic, because there are not enough points of comparison with it - it is unique.
