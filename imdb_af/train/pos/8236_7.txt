As a result of the invention of the "The Domestication Collar", carnivorous zombies are brought under control and become productive members of society; However, they perform many tasks. The maid died paying attention to those living in gated villages of the 1950s, while untamed zombies were moving in "The Wild Zone". In the town of Willard, pre-teenager K'Sun Ray (like Timmy Robinson) lives with parents Carrie-Anne Moss and Dylan Baker (such as Helen and Bill Robinson). Unfortunately, the Robinsons are the only family on their street who do not own a zombie; their new neighbors, the bottom one, have six. So, to keep, get the Robinsons zombie Billy Connolly (as Fido). <br /> <br /> Connolly's "Domestication Collar" is damaged by an old lady's hiker, and he eats her; then new and hungry zombies become the town. Meanwhile, young Ray attached to Connolly (the boy and his zombie are like Timmy and Lassie from the TV) and the Robinson family finds it difficult to work with the controlling "Zomcom" authorities. <br /> <br /> "Fido" doesn't go far enough in its own intriguing Wild Zone; but it is a colorful, stylish and amusing satirical addition to zombie film lore. Ray and the role play well, individually; with the nubile zombie Sonja Bennett (as Tammy) and owner Tim Blake Nelson (as Theopolis) the most memorable couple. Director Andrew Currie and crew, including Rob Gray (design), Jan Kiesser (photography), Don MacDonald (music) and James Willcock (design), won earnings. <br /> <br /> ****** * Fido (2006) Andrew Currie ~ K'Sun Ray, Carrie-Anne Moss, Billy Connolly, Dylan Baker
