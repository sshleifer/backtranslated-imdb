Farrah Fawcett is beautiful in this powerful 1986 drama, where she plays Marjorie, a woman who manages to escape the claws of a popular rapist. It was well done to be Farrah for a Golden Globe 'Best Actress' nominee. <br /> <br /> When her rapist Joe (terribly played by James Russo) arrives in her home, which she shares with her two roommates (which is convenient!), Marjorie has to play with Joe's scary demands. It makes for some disturbing and shocking images! <br /> <br /> When her roommate comes home, they are amazed by Marjorie's actions and a great show by Alfre Woodard who tries to convince Marjorie desperately. To do the right thing and turn him into the police, the movie makes even more nail. <br /> <br /> I find Diana Scarwid rather annoying, but when Joe finally acknowledged that he had come to kill them all, it did indeed make the movie a very emotional drama. <br /> Overall, Extremities is a brilliant, thoughtful and well-directed film and I had to watch it for hundreds of times! Well done to everyone involved.
