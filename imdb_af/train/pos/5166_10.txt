Indian summer! It was very nostalgic for me. I found it funny, heart-warming and absolutely loved it! Anyone who has used and sometimes wants a child can go back to the "good ole days". For a short time this one really needs to be seen! It starts 20 years later, returning a group of old campers for a "reunion". I will no longer comment on the plot, because you have to see it yourself. The actors were great, and it contained an all-star cast. Everyone in it played a tremendous role. You actually felt you were part of the movie to see it. Alan Arkin was especially good at his role as Uncle Lou. He plays the kind of guy everyone wants them to have in their lives. It is also a good family movie for the most part. I would suggest this one to someone in a heartbeat! Highly recommended!
