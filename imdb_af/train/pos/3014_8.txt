This fantastic whodunit is an early prototype of what has become a popular movie genre soon. I was delighted to see William Powell treat a detective story with charisma and charm, and without the stupidity of his Nick Charles character (from the "Thin Man" series). While the story is good, I think what really makes this movie fun is Michael Curtiz's fantastic imaginative direction. From a visual point of view, it's a rich texture film, with Curtiz showing an incredible medium of medium. From split screen images, strange camera angles and imaginative flashbacks, Curtiz proves he was one of the best Hollywood directors. Highly recommended if you are a fan of this type of movie.
