It was a fantastic adaptation of Jane Eyre. The only problem I had with that was that I didn't like Zelah Clarke. I thought she was too old and made Jane look very scary. In the book, Jane looks like a much stronger character. I was very irritated by this portrayal of her. The part where it was morning after Rochester had asked her to marry him and she ran to him and hugged him, always making me laugh. I think they made a bad choice to throw her. but Dalton was absolutely wonderful like Rochester. He made this version of Jane Eyre worth seeing. Another thing that didn't make this version entirely 100% was the quality of the movie. I know it was made in the eighties for TV. if it were a feature film and better quality, it would have been perfect. My main complaint, however, is that Zelah Clarke was definitely too old.
