This spectacular movie is one of the most wonderful movies I've ever seen. It shows a China I've never seen or imagined, and I believe it shows 1930's China in the most real light ever seen in a movie. It is absolutely sad in so many situations, to see how difficult life was for the characters, and yet the story and the end are very happy. You really see the depths and heights of human existence in this movie. The actors are all perfect, so you feel like you've really entered another world. <br /> <br /> I simply can't recommend this movie highly enough. It can only change forever if you have seen it.
