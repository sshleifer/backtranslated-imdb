After looking at "Guinea Pig", two questions have in mind (except "Am I really a psychopath to see it?"): "Is this a sniff?" The answer is no; although this is the closest thing to a sneak movie I've ever seen. And then, "Where the hell did they find that girl?" Because she is tortured for 45 minutes, without any reasons being given (in fact, there is nothing else in this movie!): Fingernails torn, beaten with hands, feet, tools, torn together, ... and much more to the final scene (I'm still not sure how they did it). Being part of the 'Japanese underground scene', it's clear she didn't get much money. So, what was her (their) motivation? <br /> <br /> I saw it in Japanese without captions, but it's not a problem (no real dialogue, the boys only insult her in a few scenes). I haven't seen the series yet, but the first "Guinea Pig" is not known as the best one. Still, I rated 8, because if the goal is to make people believe it is a sneak, the case is pretty good (actor Charlie Sheen asks). But I think they could have gone further, what they did in the next. <br /> <br /> Another movie I hide from my parents. <br /> <br /> 8/10
