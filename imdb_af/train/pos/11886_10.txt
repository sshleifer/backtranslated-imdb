I loved this movie. First, because it's a family movie. Secondly, it offers a refreshing approach to dealing with HIV news in a family, with far less hysteria than I normally saw in the movies. The brothers are very close but are not judgmental. Their desire to protect the youngest brother is noble, but not necessary. I understand that Leo's choice of how to handle his treatment may not be the most popular with people, but I believed it was the right choice for him. I can't believe it was a French television program. It has large production values. I gave this movie a ten, and I think you will, as soon as you have seen it.
