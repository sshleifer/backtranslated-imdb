This supernatural Peter Weir thriller is truly one of the most haunting and fascinating films ever seen. Richard Chamberlain is doing his best performance here as the Australian lawyer defending a group of young Aborigins accused of murder. As he gets closer to the matter, he discovers more about the principal defendant, Chris, and not least himself. Chris tells him he is a Mulkurul, who appears to be a race of supernatural beings who lived in Australia thousands of years ago. At the same time, the extraordinarily high rainfall seems to confirm the Aboriginal prophecy of the coming of the LAST GOLF, the one who drowns the world. <br /> <br /> The dream series and the supernatural effects reinforce this movie and make it a spectacular experience. Olivia Hamnett and David Gulpilil are firmly in the supporting roles, as well as head with the difficult name Charlie, the old Aboriginal, who can change in an owl. The climax and end do not disappoint, unlike many other supernatural thrillers who fall flat after a promising hour or so. However, it cannot be called a pure thriller. It is also a drama and speaks of spirituality and spiritual identity in the modern world. A masterful work by Peter Weir, the master of visual astonishing dramas.
