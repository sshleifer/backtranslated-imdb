I watched it every night on VH1 this week. It's a fantastic revealing portrait about the drug epidemic and how drugs were shown in the late 60's and through the 70's. Woodstock, Easy Rider, The Beatles, The Death of Morrison, Hendrix, Joplin are all here. Vh1 formed a complete intricate depiction of life and times in the "Drug Years". From the Sanfrancisco Bay Area to Studio 54, this documentary document shows the evolution and advancement of the drug business and death and new life that it injected into American culture. From Marijuana to LSD to Cocaine, this documentary shows the way drugs came in the country, the hippie movement, the conservative resistance, and how drugs brought about the arts (music, movies, etc.). With many fascinating interviews and news roll material. <br /> <br /> Drug Movies: The Trip Easy Rider Up In Smoke Reefer Madness Blow Boogie Nights
