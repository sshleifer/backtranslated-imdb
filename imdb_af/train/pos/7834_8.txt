See also my comments on Die Nibelungen part 1: Siegfried. <br /> <br /> The second part of the UFA studio's gigantic production of the Nibelungen saga continues in the stylized, symphonic and emotional detached way of its predecessor. Although part one was a passionate portrayal of individual acts of heroism, part two is a chaotic representation of large-scale blood loss. <br /> <br /> As in part one, director Fritz Lang maintains a continuous dynamic rhythm, with the pace of action and the complexity of the lap composition rising and falling smoothly as the tone of each scene demands. These photos should only be watched with note-perfect Gottfried Huppertz score, which is fortunately on the Kino DVD. Now, with this focus on mass action, Lang is presented with greater challenges in the stage. The action sequences in its earliest features are often poorly built, but now they are simply part of the rhythmic flow, with the on-screen activity warming like an orchestra. <br /> <br /> But as part one, Siegfried's adventures testify to the fact and without excitement, part two offers warfare as a devastating tragedy. In both pictures there is a deliberate lack of emotional connection to the characters. That's why Lang mostly keeps the camera out of action, so we can never feel like we are there (and that is significant because the audience is usually a distinction from Lang's work). This is also why the performances are unnaturally theatrical, while actors storm around like stubborn sleepers. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, Kriemhild's revenge is constantly dealing with emotions and is in fact deeply humanistic. The one moment of naturalism is when Atilla holds his first baby son for the first time, and Lang actually emphasizes the gentleness of this scene by building it with the wild, winding ride of the dogs. The point is that Lang never manipulates us to take his sides, and in this respect this version has more in common with the original saga than the Wagner opera. The complaint is the antithesis of an exciting battle scene. Why did Hitler and fellow do it. Get so teary-eyed about it, a fact that unfairly strangled the reputation of these movies? Because the Nazi uncompromising racial ideology has automatically regarded them as good guys, even if they kill babies and betray their own family. For Hitler, their demise would always be a nationalist tragedy, not a human being. <br /> <br /> But for our non-Nazi viewers, making this picture enjoyable, is its beautiful sense of imagination and musical rhythm. If you see these fully developed silent photographs of Lang's, it makes you realize how much he wasted in Hollywood. Instead of saturating him with low-budget pot boilers, they had to put him on some of the sword-and-sandal epics, photos that do not have to be credible and we should not move emotionally, where this is the poetic, operational tonality that we draw.
