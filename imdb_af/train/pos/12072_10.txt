What if Marylin Monroe, Albert Einstein, Joe Dimaggio and Senator McCarthy gather in an ingenious night of relativity? <br /> <br /> This beautiful novel key never uses the real names of the characters. veils and mockery just not only for the individuals they should have been, but also for what they represented over time. If you are confused by allegory, or if you want your movies to pretend and serve, you won't like this movie. It's a demanding opus that rewards the viewer with the intelligence to appreciate it at many levels. <br /> <br /> To prevent us from avoiding the right names of the characters, we see Einstein, giving a pacifist speech to a United Nations who is being commanded by Nukes. Marylin Monroe, after filming the notorious Seven Year Itch scene some say, led Joe Dimaggio to the end of her marriage. They have a beautiful interaction in which Einstein stumbles with appropriate professorial clumsiness around the innocence of perhaps the greatest gender symbol of modern times. <br /> <br /> Fill in Senator McCarthy who thinks Einstein is a Red. He is determined to withdraw Einstein's assurance that he will support the activities of the Unamerican activity committee of the House while delivering the ultimate weapon in the name of peace. Add Joe, a surprisingly fragile and potentially unsuccessful person to Gary Busey, who hates Marylin's expressionism and believes that Einstein has become her lover, though Mary Einstein only wants to show that she understands the special theory of relativity. <br /> <br /> But there's more. <br /> <br /> Like each of us, these characters have their deepest fears, revealing them one by one in haunting flashbacks. These are the weaknesses, ultimately, which lend humanity figures, which we cannot help but see almost exclusively in the abstract today. Finally, we see the terrifying fright of Einstein's vision, and the statement of the movie becomes clear. It's a powerful and memorable moment. <br /> <br /> Insignificance is one of my top five movies of all time. It is absolutely wonderful.
