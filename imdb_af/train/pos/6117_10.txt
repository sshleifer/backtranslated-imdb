All I can say about the Necromaniac / Schizophreniac 2 series is ... if you're even a computer or even a "disturbed sense of humor", you probably won't get it. Sick and disgusting like this movie, it's really a comedy and not a horror movie. If you can appreciate someone who pushes the boundaries of good taste and political correctness to the extreme limits imaginable, to the point where it is so out of touch that it is comical, you have to see it to believe it. This movie is so out of control that a large movie studio could not touch it with a 10 foot pole (with a condom at the end). In my opinion, the best, most extreme artworks come from underground. If you don't like the same old formula that people are used to seeing, then they reject it. <br /> <br /> I have seen piles of horrible, boring, z-grade, Indy movies just wasting a perfectly good VHS band or DVD-R. I also saw how piles of stink bombs came from the big named studios that were a total waste of millions of dollars. When a NO BUDGET movie such as these two by Ron Atkins / John Giancaspro comes out and all the other "shock" movies blow out completely out of the water, you'll see the whole Indy movie again. After you see it, you can really see how much freedom an Indy filmmaker can have if they work on their own. <br /> <br /> The funny thing is, even the other people who saw this movie and "hated it" admitted they were laughing at it completely. I don't think it's possible for anyone to get bored, or one of these two. So if you don't see everything you saw in the mainstream media seriously and can laugh at a misanthropic, puppet-like psychopath who eventually crashed, you should see it. You may only see it for the stand-alone, cult-classic, see. Both schizophrenia / schizophrenia 2 is one of the favorites in my collection of over 1000 DVDs.
