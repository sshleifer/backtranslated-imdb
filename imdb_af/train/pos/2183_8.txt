Billy Wilder is co-credited for the story, and his unintentional touch is striking in this original story of ghostwriting songwriters who both work for burnt-out music legend Oliver Courtney. The obvious misunderstandings were quickly eliminated, thank heavens, and what remains is a witty and bitter fusion with a few fine songs (and some more forgotten ones), Crosby at its finest, a great twist by Broadway legend Mary Martin and Basil Rathbone and Oscar Levant providing most of the cynical barbs (Levant is in scarce form and his quips have not dated at all). A wonderful surprise, and recommended for all fans of the genre.
