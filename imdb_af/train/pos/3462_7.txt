It was the first television episode of the Columbo series (though filmed to "Death Lends a Hand") and it included one of the most successful TV series in history. <br /> <br /> Jack Cassidy (who is Ken Franklin's one half of a riddle team that has a comprehensive plan for his partner, Jim Ferris (played by Martin Milner) who decides to end their professional relationship so Franklin is exposed as just a good publicity, rather than a productive writer. <br /> <br /> The initial killing set-up is fantastic and Cassidy's performance facilitates an argumentable acknowledgment that he was the best. Columbo killer in the series. <br /> <br /> Peter Falk has been wonderfully underestimated in his role as Columbo and the character's inherent traits and peculiarities, underlined by an apparent inertia and absence, especially in contrast to Cassidy's character's extreme Smuggling: One of their early scenes together where Ken Franklin produced a motive for the murder of Jim Ferris's non-exact exhibition of identifying hits in the underworld, illustrates it very well. the potential motive to Columbo and Columbo (deliberately or ignorantly) failing to hold on and forcing Franklin to express his disappointment in a remarkably condescending manner and unfavorable to the detective in the books; Compare Melville. <br /> <br /> Also worth noting is the early director contribution of 24-year-old Steven Spielberg. Nevertheless, some elementary inclusions of cameras that shade the actors and actresses, he adds some attractive and elaborate assumptions to maintain the general professionalism of the episode. A particularly sharp image is of Jim Feriss's dead body on the couch, almost dark in the foreground, as Ken Franklin brings a glass to him in the background after finishing a phone call to Ferris's stray wife. I have no doubt that the work of a limiting 10-14 day schedule, Spieberg's efforts should not be underestimated. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the second murder event is needed by a woman's extortion scheme. Franklin's friend (and ironically referred to as "messy" by Columbo in his climatic summary) takes the steam out of the whole thing. The forefront of the plot is in jeopardy and the screen-time between Falk and Cassidy relentlessly diminishes at this point to perhaps help the screenwriter (Stephen Bocho) from a solid angle because he cannot develop the story without any other murder. <br /> <br /> The climax is the most disappointing aspect of this episode. The initial banter and word swapping between Falk and Cassidy is done vigorously and effectively, but it simply advertises the fact that it had to happen more in the episode. The major aggravation lies with the seal ring (if it can be a clue): Cassidy's character so far smugness and arrogance has been surprisingly driven by an idea that really does little to understand his guilt; and as soon as it is mentioned, it capitalizes in a rather unpredictable and uncharacteristic manner. <br /> <br /> All in all, a bold opening for the series, which inevitably advertises and predicts everything that is good about Columbo, and vice versa, the problems associated with such ingenuity, ie maintaining the high standards and especially creating a credible and appropriate intelligent end.
