A fine movie. With everything you want in a movie. Great battle scenes and lots of other action. Suspense, and a romantic love story. <br /> <br /> Kind of like an old swashbuckler movie. Totally entertained from start to finish. <br /> <br /> Editing was fast and you were never bored for a second. The story is like a classic story of problems in the royal household. The actors are beautiful and the sets are beautiful. The costumes are spectacular and the stuntwork is imaginative. The special effects are also wonderful. <br /> <br /> Gary Stretch is really impressive as an actor and beautiful to look at. He looks like a sure bet for Super Stardom. <br /> <br /> John Rhys-Davies is great as usual. He is one of the great actors of our time. <br /> <br /> And Cindy Burbridge, Ex Miss Thailand is great and perfect for the top lady, even an English accent with remarkable success. <br /> <br /> I found out that the movie has won numerous awards and I can see why. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's an incredible independent movie. See it for sure. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it. And give it a TEN + !!!
