First, it doesn't call a remake of the '63 movie. Although this version is more on the play, it is very long. The casting was good with exceptions. Chyna Phillips was not a good deciding choice. She was almost 30 when she did this movie, and it was hard to believe she was a teenager. Jason Alexander was a good choice, but after a while he gave me a headache. Tyne Daly overdo her part as Mae Peterson. George Wendt was funny like Harry McAffee, and showed he could even hold a song. Like the '63 movie, they threw an unknown to play Conrad Birdie. Marc Kudisch had fun with his role as Birdie and it showed. I even have the soundtrack and I like to listen to his song. So what made it a movie rating movie? It was long for one. They put in new songs and scenes. Although some of the new songs were good (like "Let's Settle Down"), was it really necessary? Don't get me wrong, I like it, but I'd rather look at the '63 movie (see my review). It was just a case of some actors performing roles, making some changes, and again LENGTH. Another thing I forgot to mention is Vanessa Williams. She does a good job with the role and the music. Give her lyrics and she can sing them. So here's my advice from someone who did some productions of Bye Bye Birdie: If you want to see an entertaining show, watch the '63 movie. If you want to see a version of the game, watch the '95 version. Just take it in moderation. Don't be a hero and try it all in one.
