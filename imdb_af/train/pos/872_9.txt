Carla works for a property developer where she excels at being unattractive, undiminished and desperate. She is also deaf. <br /> <br /> Her boss offers to hire someone to relieve her heavy workload, allowing her the opportunity to make herself a male company. Help comes in the form of Paul, a tattooed hoodlum fresh out of jail and clearly indifferent to the modernized routine of an office environment. <br /> <br /> An implicit sexual tension develops between the two and Carla is determined to keep him in spite of his reluctance to embrace the work week. When Carla is contracted out of a major contract, she negotiated with a clever colleague, using Paul's delinquency by stealing him back. The colleague soon realizes that she is behind the robbery, but when he confronts her, Paul's willingness to face people also comes in handy - but this error comes at a price. <br /> <br /> Paul gets a 'pass' through a few mill acquaintances as a reminder of an unpaid debt. He formulates a plan that uses Carla's unique lip reading capabilities to rip a gang of violent robbers. It is now Carla's turn to enter a frightening new world. <br /> <br /> The fourth feature of director Jacques Audiard, "READ MY LIPS," begins as a thoroughly engaging romantic drama between two marginalized losers just to move halfway through. an edgy thriller where their symbiotic shortcomings make them winners. The slate is excellent; unnecessarily convinced that this strange couple could really connect. Carla's first encounter with Paul is a pleasant farce in which she attempts to circumvent his eager reticence and jailbird ways to discover that he was a prison bird until recently. Emmanuelle Devos, who plays Carla, has almost exclusive ability to move from dull to beautiful and back into a frame. Vincent Cassel plays Paul as an angular dog that just really looks home if he gets a beating or gets the rip-off that will probably kill him. <br /> <br /> Like many French films, READ MY LIPS seems to be, first and foremost about nothing, until you scratch the surface and find that it's probably all about it. subplot about the missing wife of Paul's parole officer, a device that looks as if it is only used to help hide the thrust of the story into a neat little feel-cellar. <br /> <br /> That was the French 'New Wave' of the 60s that first introduced the concept of 'genre' to film and I have always felt that any medium is slightly compromised when you need to use a labeling system to help define it; It's always a pleasure to discover a movie that looks like genre, or better to defend it.
