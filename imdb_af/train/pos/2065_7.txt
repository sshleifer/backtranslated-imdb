Terrible symmetry is a pleasant episode with some flaws. The first aspect of the episode is that it is near Mountain Home Air Force Base in southwest Idaho. Season's 'Deep Throat' takes place near Ellens Air Base, also in southwest Idaho. I wonder if the air force base is one and the same, but they decided to use the right name in Terrible Symmetry. Mulder and Scully have a good dialogue, always a plus. Ed Meecham, the zoo keeper reminds me of cranky, old school teachers. They had to have children at one time, you just can't imagine how. Just as he had to look after animals at one point. I like the concept of the episode, but I felt it had some contradictions. If strangers are so skilled at kidnapping people and getting them back safely, why can't they bring the animal back to the right place? And the strangers just have trouble returning the animals? I don't buy Mulder's theory of a problem with the space-time continuum. As if he were an expert on it. I also thought Jayne Atkinson's performance as Willa Ambrose was not well done. Besides the nitpicks, I still enjoy this episode because of the intriguing concept of aliens who harvest animal DNA as well as human DNA.
