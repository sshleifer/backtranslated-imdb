I remember it when it was released, in a theater in Palo Alto, and didn't expect much. I mean - an Australian movie? But it finally got me. Here's a scene. Richard Chamberlain puts crossbones on the floor of a comfortable apartment in Sidney, with an Australian native elder named Charlie. <br /> <br /> Chamberlain: "You were outside my house last night. You were scared of my wife. You?" And Charlie deliberately replied, "Who are you? Who are you? Who are you? Who are you? Who are you? Are you a fish? Are you a snake? Are you a man? Who are you? Who are you? Who are you? "This is a beautiful scene, all in shot close-up, with Chamberlain's spectacular, beautiful face filling the screen unlike Charlie's black, broad, bearded visage. <br /> <br /> The two guys could no longer be different and this film is the story of how Chamberlain accidentally stumbles from his humdrum lawyer's existence in the inexplicable, almost unspeakable riddles of Charlie's world. <br /> <br /> I don't think I'm much about the plot. It's kind of an apocalyptic story. But I have to say, whoever did the research on Australian indigenous belief systems must get an A-plus. They have everything in it, from the bone to the dream time, a kind of parallel universe in which dreams really are. It is a very ghostly movie without any musical stems or beautiful special effects. Charly's world simply begins in Chamberlain's dreams because reasons have never been made quite clear. <br /> <br /> If there is a problem with the script, it is. Nothing is ever made clear. Think Chamberlain, who in the last wave has an extraordinary report with the aborigines? Do these aborigines? Did the whole Sidney? The basic premise is a little difficult to accept, although it is granted, it is a fantasy. The aborigines are invested with the kind of spiritual power Americans ascribe to American Indians, while the fact that mythology is more than complex or satisfying - more elegant and beautiful, if you want - mythology is still an endeavor to an ordinary, demanding and sometimes outdone disappointing physical existence. Charlie's mysticism is more convincing that the miracles of Moses in Cecil B. DeMille's "The Ten Commandments", but they are brothers under the skin. <br /> <br /> But I don't care. This film is considered a movie, and it is especially important to mark the well-known personality Peter Weir and the Australian film industry. It was the first of a huge wave of antipodes, some of them raucous, like "Mad Max" and some subtle and dramatic, like "Lantana." I like Weir's stuff, which, like Nicholas Roeg's, seems to be pregnant with subliminal fear. Try 'Picnic at Hanging Rock' for an example of how to make a real cold movie with no drop of blood.
