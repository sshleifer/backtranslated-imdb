I.Q., in my opinion, is a lovely, charming and hilarious romantic comedy about finding the right person for you. If you ask me, James (Stephen Fry) was really a dull guy. To me, Ed (Tim Robbins) was more suited to Catherine (Meg Ryan) than James was. Anyway, everyone involved in this movie did an excellent job. Now, finally, I recommend this lovely, charming and hilarious romantic comedy about finding the right person for any Tim Robbins or Meg Ryan fan who hasn't seen it. You're laughing, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend and watch it.
