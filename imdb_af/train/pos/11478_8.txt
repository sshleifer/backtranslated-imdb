Chris and André are two average, ordinary teenagers. Misunderstood by some and picked up by others. But together they stand and everyone will pay. Together they form "The Army of Two". They plan and plan "Zero Day". The day is when they decide to storm their high school and fatally kill 14 people in cold blood. Telling through the tapes they made "Zero Day", it is hardly a fictional tale of the Columbine tragedy. <br /> <br /> "Zero Day" is one of those movies that will then be messed up with your head. The two main actors (Calvin Robertson and André Keuck) do such a good job that their characters look like almost everyone who walks with a disabled teenager in the street. Their performances were very credible, you loved these guys and it was scary. Shot on video almost completely out of the teenager's perspectives. "Zero Day" feels very real and authentic, as you are there. These kids are trying to rationalize their actions for the viewer and the actors sell it to you. But be warned it follows the tragedy from beginning to end and the end makes some shocking and uncomfortable.
