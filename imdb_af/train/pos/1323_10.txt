A top selling book on homicide in Jordan is withdrawn by its publishers after allegations that the story was made; related to other writer's past claims as a convict. A few years later she contracted and conceded that she had taken a certain amount of dramatic license, but was willing to work with a filmmaker to prove the content of her allegations. What follows is a fascinating insight into a pathological personality, someone who has one's behavior makes no sense, unless she says is true, but that seems impossible to say something that is not surprisingly dramatic but at its best uncertain and mostly verifiable. It's almost impossible to think of what Mrs. Khouri hoped to win by appearing in this movie: justification? celebrity? - Everything she achieves is to produce a certain image of herself as a deeply damaged individual, and even that cannot be taken at face value. Director Anna Broinowski is increasingly appearing on camera as her film progresses, and is increasingly concerned about starting; but she is eventually rewarded with a remarkable but frightening and disturbing story to tell - and one of those films that reminds us of a very strange world in which we live.
