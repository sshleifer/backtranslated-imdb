This movie is intelligent. It's more than most other movies, it exceeds the least common denominator - stupid people are unlikely to appreciate it. The story is also strongly in dialogue. It has some parallels with Lost Translation, although Before Sunrise is much brighter, somehow less abstract, and just a lot better. <br /> <br /> The writing, the characters and even the slightly surrealistic atmosphere feel completely realistic. The actors play absolutely brilliant. Rarely did I see a movie where the writing and the play melted it perfectly. <br /> <br /> The dialogue moves in many personal problems, with the risk of getting a little over. However, it remains almost all the time on the right, although I found a few uncomfortable and embarrassing moments. Balancing on this fine line requires shameful talented actors. Sometimes it produces good results, and overall this movie is just great! Only many, very rarely, are "love" in films portrayed in a way that I find reliable and realistic. Every time this is achieved, the result is fantastic. I think the beautiful and seemingly timeless beauty of the female main actress helped a little in this respect. She is wonderful in this movie for 12 years. <br /> <br /> It's just a jewel of a movie you can't miss. One of the best movies I've seen since the 1990s!
