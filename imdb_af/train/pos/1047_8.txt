It may or may not be interesting that the only reason I really watched this movie was because I wanted to see the show of Humphrey Bogart in his CASABLANCA (10/10 for Best Actor Oscar. would still have given the Oscar to Bogie, but Paul Lukas did well and deserves the nomination, at least.) Well, I'm glad I watched this movie because I really enjoyed it I think the movie has a little preached, but I did not just think, I enjoyed the speeches and was never bored with them. <br /> <br /> The play was excellent in this movie and I especially enjoyed Paul Lukas, Lucile Watson (right nominated for an Oscar), Bette Davis (not unfairly nominated), George Coulouris and odd, Eric Roberts, who plays the middle child, I really enjoyed his character: a strange boy talking like a philosopher. Just break me in. Even the characters' name (Bodo) is funny. <br /> <br /> The endin g, in which Lu The character of the cabinet was forced to do something he considered wrong, although he did it for all the right reasons, also worked for me. I agreed with why he felt he had to do, and I understood why he couldn't explain it. The message this movie makes is good and noble, the scenery (what the house means) is beautiful, and the play is excellent. Watch this movie if you ever get a chance. <br /> <br /> 9/10
