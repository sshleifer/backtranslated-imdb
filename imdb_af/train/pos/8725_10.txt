I love Antz, but loved "A Bug's Life". The animation paid off in this. I'll definitely get it on DVD. By the way, Disney has to make a widescreen version of this movie on tape. (I heard I scratched all the characters in the screen on the standard video format). Most would agree that the end credits were the funniest! I just saw one of the two sets, but I can't see the other one!
