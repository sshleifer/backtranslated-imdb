Remember the early days of Pay Per View? I do, and I can almost remember the number you had to call for the movie actually on your behalf. to rent. As a child we always wanted to rent playboy, but that means I actually call someone from PPV and ask to rent it. And then you get the nerve to do it and look at four hours of soft core, no corner chin. Well, the reason I raised it is because this movie was also on ppv. And I remember almost every scene that was in the addition. Over the past few years, I have been kicking to get all the big movies I used to watch as a kid and that was one of them. It's one that when it's hard to shut down. All star cast tries to commit the perfect bench bust, but nothing goes right. There are many spoof bankers who are good and this one should fall into that category. It has enough action and laughter to maintain it. watch it out if you dare!
