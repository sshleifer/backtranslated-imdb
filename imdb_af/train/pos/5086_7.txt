When I heard Patrick Swayze, he finally returned to his stage with KING SOLOMON'S MINES. I was very excited. I expected a great Indiana Jones-type action adventure. What I got was a 4 hour (with advertising) epic that was very slow. The second and third hours could fall completely and the story would not have suffered. The end was good (no spoilers here), but I wanted more. Well, all that a man can do is prey that Swayze does "RoadHouse 2" so he can return to the action genre that made him known. Until you are a fan of King Solomon's Mines as the book reads or looks at the 1985 version with Richard Chamberlain and Sharon Stone, which is not only good but the only and hour and forty minutes of your life instead of 4 hours.
