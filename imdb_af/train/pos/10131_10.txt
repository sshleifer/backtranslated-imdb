In the first episode of friends, which broadcast September 22, 1994, "The One Where Monica Gets A Room Mate" there is a song that plays like Rachel sits in the window until the end of the show. The rule that plays is: "If you ever have to keep" .... does anyone know the artist singing or the title of the song? It looks like it's a good song .... I'd like a copy of it. Thanks for the help. I'm looking for the album / CD it is so I can buy it. <br /> <br /> I have the shows available for purchase and enjoy this show over and over. It was just credible ... thank you for the hours of entertainment you've provided over the years.
