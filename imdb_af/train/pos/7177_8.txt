I was so excited by this informative documentary, and I waited a while for it to come through the pipes (my local video chain), and it was worth the wait. I like a good documentary / special interest, but it was definitely a warm, honest and nostalgic, if you want, look back at the adolescent life. The imagination of a child is fascinating, and that is where a great story begins. Rent it or buy it if you want a good, humorous, and comprehensive, entertaining documentary. Mr. Stein and the company have certainly come a long way from neighborhood video camcorder productions of bank hold-ups, and gay rings that make people gay at a glance. They all look quite successful in their respectful fields, and it was good to know that they are all still good friends. The DVD has some extra trailers for other good documentaries, and it includes a number of Darren's most notable productions, including Crazy News.
