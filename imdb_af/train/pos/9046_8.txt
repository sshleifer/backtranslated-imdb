I only saw Jake Gyllenhaal in Jarhead (2005) for a while and since then I've been watching one of his movies arriving on my radar screen. Like Clive Owen, he has an intensity (and he even looks Owen slightly) just harvesting from the screen. I feel sure that if he rolls some meat roll, he'll crack an Oscar one day. <br /> <br /> It is not to deny this movie at all. <br /> <br /> It's a fine story, with many credible people (well, it's based on the author's early shenanigans with rocket), a great role to play? Chris Cooper is always good, and Laura Dern is always on my watch list ?? with the appropriate mix of humor, pathos, excitement ... and the good soundtrack with so much rock n roll oldies to make the feet tapping. <br /> <br /> But this movie had a very special meaning to me. : In 1957 I was the same age as Homer Hickham; As I did, I looked at the night stars to look at Sputnik while shaking it over the black; Like Homer, I also experimented with rocket in my backyard and even used exactly the same chemicals for fuel; And like Homer, I have also ended most of my efforts in explosive disaster! What fun it was ... <br /> <br /> I didn't reach its high (metaphorical and physical) heights. But this is what you find out when you see this movie. <br /> <br /> Sure, it's a basic family movie, but it's a dying race today. Take the time to see it, with the kids: you will all have very good laughs.
