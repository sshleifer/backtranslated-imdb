Having become totally addicted to Six Feet Under, I didn't think there would ever be another show that would be close to being as good as this show. Well, I was wrong! Lost is spellbinding !! I absolutely love this show and can't turn it off. The richness of the characters, the intricacies of the plot, the beautiful surroundings are all wonderful. I'm completely and completely addicted. I don't know how the creators do it, but every character gets me deep. I feel their joy, their pain, everything, to the core !!! I didn't have cable, so I rented the series on Netflix. When I turn it on, I watch all the episodes immediately and feel sad when it's over. I can't wait for the next disc to come to my house. This is probably the best TV show I've ever seen !!!
