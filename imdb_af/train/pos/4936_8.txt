When a stiff with a pneumonic pest appears (a variant of bubonic plague), the US public health service official, dr. Clinton Reed (Richard Widmark) immediately quarantined all he knew near the body. Unfortunately, the stiff murdered that way, and there is a good chance that the killer will spread the plague, leading to an epidemic. Enter police captain Tom Warren (Paul Douglas), who is used to detect the killer as soon as possible and prevent a possible national disaster. <br /> <br /> While Panic in the Streets is a quality film, it suffers slightly unfocused and a bit spreadable (my reason for bringing the score to eight). It destroys the genres of noirish gangster to medical disaster, police procedure, thriller and even romance. <br /> <br /> This is not the best job of Elia Kazan's director, but says it's a bit rude. Kazan is the helmet responsible for such masterpieces as a Streetcar Named Desire (1951), On The Waterfront (1954) and East of Eden (1955). This film was predicted, but Kazan said he had already been "untouched" by the studio. By taking freedom too far, the spread can be partly justified. The film is in New Orleans, a city where Kazan "wandered around .... Night and day so I knew it well." He wanted to exploit the environment. "It was so fantastic and colorful. I wanted boats, steam engines, warehouses, jazz joints - all from New Orleans." <br /> <br /> Kazan handles every genre of Panic in the Streets well, but they can be connected. better. The movie would have benefited by just keeping one or two of its moods. The expansion in terms of environment would still have worked. Part of the dilemma can be caused by the fact that Panic in the Streets was trying to put together two stories by writers Edna and Edward Anhalt, "Quarantine" and "Some Like" Em Cold. <br /> <br /> The gangster material, ending in a solid area with an extended background, near the end of the movie, is probably the highlight. Not surprisingly, Kazan said he believed the villains were "more colorful - I never had much love for the good guys. I don't like Puritans". A second second is the only material that approaches the "panic" of the title - the discovery of the plague and the attempts to detect the exposed, contain their inoculation and the disease. Although there is enough tension during these two "moods", much of the movie is also a fairly simple drama, with more typical pacing of that genre. <br /> <br /> The whole dialogue is excellent. The stylistic difference to many modern films can hardly be more pronounced. It is intelligent, quickly delivered and well-explained by every character. Conflict is not created by "stupid" decisions, but cleverly moving; Activities and characters are more like a chess game. When unusual views are taken, such as Reed withholding newspaper plagues, he gives relatively long justifications for his decisions, which other characters argue about. <br /> <br /> In view of this, it is interesting that Kazan believed that "accuracy, religion, ethics and middle class are killing us all". This idea works its way into the film through the changes to the norm, or grants made by the protagonists. For example, Blackie's gangsters (Jack Palance in his first film role) are presented with a "Get Out of Jail Free" card when working with pest control. <br /> <br /> The technical aspects of the movie are good, but nothing extraordinary, but the real reasons to watch are the performances, the intriguing scenario and the well-written dialogue.
