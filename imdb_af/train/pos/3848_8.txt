Gerard is a writer with a somewhat overactive imagination. He is also homosexual and Catholic tends to Catholic guilt and something of a clairvoyant, or so it seems. On a trip to Flushing, Christine is "seduced" by him. When he discovers that Christine's new boyfriend is a little bartering, he thought from far away he decided to hold on. After all, the forced heterosexuality has its rewards. Then he realizes that Christine's previous three men all died of violent deaths. Did Christine kill them and was he or the boyfriend, Herman, "fourth man"? Verhoeven's overheated, excessive melodrama is a delicious blend of Hitchcock and David Lynch, full of OTT eroticism and religious images, and a huge part of the red color. Much of the time it looks and feels like a dream and we can never be sure that what we see is really or a memorial to Gerard's imagination. It's fun to find out. Also, the fact that Christine is an infinitely more pleasant character, meaning either the priggish Gerard or the bullish Herman, is that we almost like to root one of the men over her. In fact, it is fair to say that Gerard's turnout cannot be enough soon. Super performances also from Jeroen Krabbe and Ren√© Soutendijk and easily Verhoeven's best film to his wonderfully subversive piece of sci-fi "Starship Troopers".
