I only saw this movie as a teenager. It was at a time when heavy metal controlled the world. Trick Of Treat has every element for a movie that rocks. With the role of Skippy of Family Ties, Gene Simmons or Kiss and Ozzy Osbourne as Preacher, how can you go wrong? Behind evil are evil messages played on vinyl! Yes that's right, they use records in this movie. In one scene, Eddie (Skippy) listens to a message from the evil rock star on his turntable when things get scary. Samples start coming out of his speakers and his stereo is owned. As a teenager, I tried to record my records in the hope that it would happen to me. Almost 20 years later, Trick or Treat is still one of my favorite movies.
