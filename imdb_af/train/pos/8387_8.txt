This first part of the BRD Trilogy has more passion and density than Lola, but less of the magic of Veronica Voss. The political feelings point out: we see the shortages after the war, how the black markers could control so much of daily life (a wonderful moment when Fassbinder plays a grifter, trying to get a complete set of Kleist to Schygulla, which notes that books do not give much warmth: she really wants wood. <br /> <br /> There are some uncertainties in the first hour, the scene in Maria's room with the black soldier interrupted by Hermann's appearance, The train station when Maria meets Karl Oswald falls flat when she insults the GI - I have been hurt, it was so bad, but as the story evolves and the years pass, I am increasingly drawn into this glamorous cold world .
