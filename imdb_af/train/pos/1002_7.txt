Just two comments .... Seven years apart? Rare evidence of the film's relentless pull! As already mentioned, the low-budget telemovie status of 13 GANTRY ROW is a mitigating factor in its limited appeal. However, it said the thing was not without merit - either as entertainment or as a fright. <br /> <br /> True, the plot at its most basic is a rework of THE AMITYVILLE HORROR - only without much horror. More a matter of intrigue! Gibney may have made a more valuable impression as she played Halifax - finding some seemingly unattached murders with the "house" as the main suspect. The font is better than the average and the production is of a high standard. It fails to involve the viewer especially at key moments. <br /> <br /> After choosing the DVD for just $ 3.95 last week at my regular video store, I can't abuse the expenses. $ 10.95 would be an acceptable price for the movie. Don't just expect fireworks!
