I really enjoyed this adaptation from Emma. I've seen it many times and always see it again to see it again. Although it lasts only 107 minutes, most of the new plot and subplots have been developed satisfactorily. . All the characters are well portrayed. Most of the dialogues come directly from the novel, without silly jokes, as in Emma Thompson's Sin and Sensibility. <br /> <br /> As a stranger, I especially appreciate the perfect diction of the actors. The surroundings and costumes were beautiful. I find this version on an equal footing with the mini-series "Pride and Prejudice" of 1995, but the manufacturer and scriptwriter were the same. Kate Beckinsale did a very good job depicting Emma, ​​whom Jane Austen said would create a heroin, but she would love. She is snobbish but has just enough youth and inexperience to be fun. Mark Strong was also very good at Mr. Picturing Knightley, not an easy part, but he doesn't have the charisma that Colin Firth's mr. Darcy did not have Pride and Prejudice. Even the final scene (the harvest festival) that does not happen in the novel offers an appropriate end, except when it appears that Emma is cold and almost unpleasant with Frank Churchill while reconciling with him in the novel, and even saying that she would have enjoyed the duplication, she was in his situation. A strange deviation from the fidelity that is otherwise shown by the film. I find the costumes more beautiful and expanded than other adaptations from Jane Austen's novels.
