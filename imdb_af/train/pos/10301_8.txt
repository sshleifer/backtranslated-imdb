Bruce Almighty, one of Carrey's best photos since ... well ... a long time. It contains one of the funniest scenes I've seen for a long time. Morgan Freeman plays God well and even chips in some jokes that are surprisingly funny. It contains one or two romantic moments that are a bit boring, but about a big movie with some funny scenes. The best scene in, that's where Jim spills the anchor's voice. <br /> <br /> My rating: 8/10
