Kudos to Cesar Montano for the revival of the Cebuano movie! Panaghoy said Suba is very good - it has the drama, the action, the romance and the scene that makes you laugh. <br /> <br /> While the story is not that original (a love triangle - or make a quadrilateral love, Japanese occupation, rebellion, American as a gentleman), his presentation is something cool, especially it uses original language - bisaya for the Filipino, nipongo for Japanese and English for Americans. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of this year's best Pinoy movies. <br /> <br /> See here!
