I have never met four hours as soon as I saw this movie. This film restores the power and art to Hamlet that it was always meant to have. Even those o-well-known speeches are done in new and inventive ways. And the role is incredible, Brannagh's brightest star. This is his charisma, power and command of the role the film defines. To make it a complete and complete version, fill in so many holes and allow for new appreciation for the tragedy despite its length. Where one would expect the dark, gloomy cliff, we are treated to a wonderful festival. The only gloom comes from Hamlet himself, as it should. Well worth four hours.
