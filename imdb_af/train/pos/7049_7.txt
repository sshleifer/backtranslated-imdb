In this satire of commercialization and "lethargy" of war, John Cusack plays Brand Hauser, an assassin sent to Turaqistan to take Omar Sharif. He is doing an oil business that will cause problems for the former vice president of SU's own company. In addition, Hauser has to revive his fake position as a trade producer, a wedding princess doll Yonica (Hillary Duff), and a nose Liberal journalist, Natalie (Marisa Tomei). <br /> <br /> Assessing the technical aspects: <br /> <br /> - The acting (at least the main characters) was good, as might be expected. John Cusack's dialogue was clearly not written to him, as he was often uncomfortable. . . Perhaps unrealistic is more accurate. Joan produced a large, and often hilarious, performance. Marisa Tomei, while I had never been a big fan of her, was more than suitable for the role and worked well. However, Hillary Duff was pretty terrible. They needed a handsome Middle East (or Russian, or whatever had to be the accent) pop star. Unfortunately, they went with her for 3. <br /> <br /> - As I mentioned above, the writing was a bit tight and mismatched on points, especially John Cusack's dialogue. Not many of them, but some. The story also has a bit ridiculous at points, which is good for a satire to a point, but it has taken on a whole new level here. Luckily, the Cusacks and Tomei keep a relatively cool, calm attitude throughout, making it a nice even mix of the madness of the movie and the levels of the actors. <br /> <br /> - Joshua Seftel, who previously had a drought of real credit after his name, has a good job with a fairly wide spectrum of movies. He handled the small ($ 10m) budget very well, stretching it to make it look much more. Seftel also managed to mix the humor of the story nicely. . . with the painful and difficult to watch parts of the real war (including the battles of civilians, etc.). <br /> <br /> - As far as the general satire is concerned, its exaggerated view of the commercialization of war has been very well done, especially the 'Golden Palace Poker' ads on American tanks. At points it gets a bit too much, but in the end it still looks exactly like a young Mel Brooks style. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is very well made for the scant budget and it is definitely a look worthy. It's not going to be one of the great satires of the theater, but it's certainly not the worst. <br /> <br /> 7/10.
