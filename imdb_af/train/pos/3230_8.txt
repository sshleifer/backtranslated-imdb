OK, so Soldier is not deep and meaningful like Blade Runner or as a big budget as Terminator 2, but overall I found it very enjoyable. <br /> <br /> The fact that Kurt Russell remained in character did not speak and was not nearly emotional, made the moments when his humanity broke through more and more. I found his portrayal of limited emotional development more touching than Arnie's in the T-movies (and before I get any comment, yes, I know Arnie was a cyborg and Kurt was human but the premise that both films were the same) . <Br /> <br /> So for the movie itself, a pretty American / Brit cast is able to spot this little story. Not really sure if Gary Busey and his two deputies were bad or good, so I couldn't decide whether or not I liked them. The colony was a little more realistic, not even a deceived forest peacemaker / believer / cowardly hicks who are getting out of the way or a group of subversive aggressive terrorists are being paranoidly wiped off offenders and one another. <br /> <br /> Kurt Russell is good and different from other comments. I don't feel it will have a negative impact on his career (as opposed to perhaps Escape from LA - prosecution is so capricious!). Sean Pertwee made his old father proud by continuing the family's noble Sci-Fi lineage. And the rest of the role play helped to make this pathetic bond of people making the most of a bad situation and not doing badly. <br /> <br /> If you see it on your TV schedule, I'd recommend giving it a chance. I don't think you'll be disappointed.
