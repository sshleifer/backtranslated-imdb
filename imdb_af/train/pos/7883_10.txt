I saw this movie with my friend and we couldn't stop laughing! I mean there was nothing scary about this movie! It was funny all the lines Freddy said were hilarious! I think they didn't even make a new nightmare and just after Freddy Vs. Jason. Although some parts are coarse (like the head inflates). and any elm street movie of 1-5 sucked. it was the best except number 1. I would not recommend this movie if you want a good horror. But if you have nothing else to rent it, you'll laugh a lot. I want to see the Texas chain murder. I think it will be scary. Freddy's Dead The Final Nightmare Overall Grade: B-
