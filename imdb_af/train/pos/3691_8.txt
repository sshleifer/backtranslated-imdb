The whole doesn't even come close to the sum of the parts. No problem. This film features a series of the most diverse creative directors of our time and some very famous names in the film. The segments are all about the same theme, "Love in Paris", but the similarities end there. Actually, as the approach to the theme of all these different directors takes so many forms, it's great that we can even feel that we're still watching the same movie. No great effort has been made to make it into a comprehensive whole. This buffet has so many good ingredients, I'm glad no one tried to put them all in a single dish.
