I was 15 years old when this film was on television. To be raised in Texas, I understood the boredom and monotony of teenage world there. This movie has touched my impressive teenage heart and I have remembered it for the past 12 years. I saw it recently for the 2nd, 3rd and 4th time, thanks to the LOVE channel. I still cry because the movie comes in and touches my inner confused teenager.
