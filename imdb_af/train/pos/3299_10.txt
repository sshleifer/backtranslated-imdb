A good movie that requires an acquired taste. If you are in action, who are movies and hate serious love stories, then it is not for you. Otherwise, if you would like to sit in front of a good, intelligent movie from time to time, I highly recommend it. Easily the best movie produced in Bollywood this century. <br /> <br /> The only other Indian movie I will give 10/10 is Dil Wale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge. Even then, it comes second to this masterpiece.
