The title has many meanings - the boxing ring, where differences and grievances are challenged, a wedding ring where Mabel is trapped and Jack feels his problems will be over and the cause of trouble, a ring-like bracelet that Bill Mabel gives. as a love sign. <br /> <br /> Former professional boxer, Danish Carl Brisson, gave her in films by Alfred Hitchcock in "The Ring". A very young Ian Hunter, who had such a long career in movies, plays Bob Corby, catching a beautiful girl, Mabel (Lillian Hall Davis) on a fun show. She is engaged to a round Jack Sander (Carl Brisson), but it doesn't stop her with Bob. Bob is persuaded to go with Jack "one round". He is going to win several rounds - he is a professional boxer and he and his manager came to the fair to find out if Jack is as good as a fighter. He offers to take on Jack and Jack, with his great coach (the great Gordon Harker), is prospering with plans to marry Mabel when he goes well. Jack wins his fight and marries Mabel the next day, but the deep appeal she and Bob feel to each other is still there. Jack is suspicious and puts everything in his training so he can fight Bob for his wife. <br /> <br /> Eventually, a boxing movie where the hero doesn't break down the rails. Bob behaves himself and does everything he can to be a champion - if only Mabel did the same! She left him for Bob - and the battle at the end is a mighty one. It is intensely realistic - it covers the last 20 minutes of the movie. The fact that he is racial and enthusiastic, Jack is almost eliminated - then between the rounds, reunited with Mabel, he gives the courage to conquer. The question is why would he even want to get her back - from the beginning she thought nothing of starting a relationship with Bob - why wouldn't she do it again? <br /> <br /> The movie is loaded with symbolism. Jack, hand-held by the promoter, changes to Mabel's hands and accepts Bob's bracelet. When Jack puts the ring on Mabel's finger, Bob's bracelet hits her arm. In the end, Jack Mabel's reflection is reflected in a zipper and it gives him the confidence to continue. It's a great movie that won't disappoint you. <br /> <br /> Highly Recommended.
