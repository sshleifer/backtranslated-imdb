This collection of eleven short stories in one movie is a good idea and offers some big segments, but also disappointing surprises. Based on the tragic event of September 11, 2001 in the United States, eleven directors were invited to give their approach to the US tragedy. The result of most of them is not only an individual sympathy towards the American people, but mainly to the intolerance of the world with different cultures and people. <br /> <br /> Ken Loach (UK) offers the best segment, over September 11, 1973 in Chile, when Salvador Alliende's democratic government was destroyed by dictator Augusto Pinochet with US support. <br /> <br /> The other excellent segments are the one of Youssef Chahine (Egypt) that shows world intolerance and the number of victims US governments in different countries have made in contemporary history; and one of Mira Nair (India), showing a true story of injustice and prejudice against a Pakistani family, whose son was wrongly accused of terrorism in the US, when he was indeed a hero. <br /> <br /> Some segments are beautiful: Samira Makhmalbaf (Iran) shows the innocent Afghan refugee children who are preparing an unforeseen shelter from bombs, while their teacher is trying to explain to them what happened on the other side of the world; the romantic Claude Lelouch (France) shows the life of a couple in New York near the WTC; Danis Tanovic (Bosnia Hersegowina) shows the effects of their war on a small place and the lonely protest of widows; Sean Penn is very poetic, showing that life is going on; and Shohei Imamura's story is probably the most impressive and shows that there is no Holy War, but sadness and shame. <br /> <br /> The Idrissa Quedraogo (Birkina Faso) segment is very naive, but portrays the terrible conditions of this African nation. <br /> <br /> The segment of Amos Gital (Israel) is very boring and manipulative, showing more violence and terrorism. <br /> <br /> The segment of Alejandro González Iñárritu is very disappointing, <br /> <br /> My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "11 de Setembro" ("September 11")
