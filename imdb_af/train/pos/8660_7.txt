It is a racist movie, but worthy of studying and enjoying. First time through this is the natural tendency to focus on Erbe & Dad. They have a quiet, tranquil thing, which is still at home to retire from high school, and retired and kicked back and waited for inspiration to do something. The second time you realize how terribly the sister's husband is being dissolved by her friends in the backwoods blues bar. He takes it, this is the thing to do these days, and pass the critical moment as if they were talking about the weather. In that same scene, the sister's blues song is a real tear if you are the least sensitive and like that kind of music. Her performance feels like the highlight of the story; a blues story with the good guys who are "people of color" in their element in backwoods, SC. In the meantime, all the white people in the movie lead to the fact that they are insufficiently meaningful lives, just to make babies. It's cool, as long as you recognize it as fiction.
