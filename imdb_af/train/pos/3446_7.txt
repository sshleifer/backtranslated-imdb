Yesterday I attended the "Descent" World Prize at the Tribeca Film Festival in NYC. I had a good time. It was sold out and attended by all the big stars, including my fellow spacer Marcus Patrick. <br /> <br /> I give the movie 7.5 a possible 10 stars. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with Maya (Rosario Dawson) at college. You can see the typical college environment with wild parties and flirtations. The photography in this movie was excellent. She meets Jared (Chad Faust) and they are nice. It looks like any other relationship in the beginning. The man is looking for the woman's attention and love and the woman is hard to find. Both played it well. Very innocent flirting between the two. He invites her to his apartment and everything falls apart. <br /> <br /> The apartment is very awful and dark. They eventually end up in the basement which is very dark and lit by numerous candles. It actually reminded me of a dungeon. Here's where he shows his true colors and is going to rape her. It is a very dark and eager rape scene. This scene is not for the young or the weak. The rape scene is a bit long and hard to take, but it is necessary for the rest of the movie to follow. <br /> <br /> Maya is now losing her soul to drugs and sex. She falls into her own abyss. She started attending the wildest parties and woke up one morning in a room without reminding her how to get there. She is told to see Adrian (Marcus Patrick). The first thing I remember about this character is that they say "he is the person who saves anyone who needs to save". He is actually the one who introduces Maya to drugs. They start a relationship of dependence that later plays into the role. The club scenes at this point of the film are photographed with utmost expertise. I thought they were well done and I noticed that at the end of the show, the director of photography was applauded by the audience. <br /> <br /> Maya is back in college as a TA and who's in her class - Jared her rap! You can see the confusion and emotion on Maya's face. What should I do? What do I do next? The shots of her face and emotions are invaluable. <br /> <br /> What follows is not exactly what happens. She is interested in Jared. She seems to be reliving and loving the relationship again. I sat there and said it could really happen. It wasn't. Nothing can come further from the truth. <br /> <br /> She invites him to her apartment and of course he shows up. Now her apartment is dark and eager. She stripped him completely. He thinks he's going to be happy. She then bothered him like any woman could. She caresses him everywhere and he gets excited. Note: for anyone planning to watch this movie, this scene is full of frontal nudity. It may not be right for the younger viewer. <br /> <br /> She turns the situation around and she becomes the animal and continues to rape. him. Again, the scene is dark, eager and very rough. <br /> <br /> If you watch the movie and don't want to know what happens next, skip this paragraph and continue with the last paragraph. <br /> <br /> That's where Adrian repeats the picture. Maya saved Adrian (?) By doing a very rough male sex with Jared. She thinks it's the final revenge. Adrian continues to take Jared's masculinity and strips his dignity into nothing. Marcus, as Adrian, plays this scene as credibly as anyone can. He is a strong actor who plays a strong character and the strength comes across the screen. After the movie, Marcus explained during a Q&A session that this scene required a lot of trust between him and Chad. Maya believes this revenge will save her, but I don't think so. One of the final scenes has a close-up of Mays's face and you see a tear roll under her cheek. It was a wonderful closeup scene and calls for constant discussion of everyone going to see this movie. Did she receive the revenge she wanted? Was it as satisfying as she expected? I think it's not. It just makes matters worse. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie, well maintained, and I recommend it to anyone thinking of seeing it. I would just be a little hesitant than under 17 years old. Rosario, Chad and Marcus must be commended for work done well. Directing and photography should also be commended. It was an evening I enjoyed.
