This movie is very touching. I don't care what people say about this movie, it's a very good movie. The performances by Amitabh Bachchan's role, the dying father is wonderful, because he wants to teach his son how to handle life if something happens to him and Akshay Kumer was wonderful in his role as the spoiled Aditya Thakur. The supporting role of Shefali Shetty, who played the role of Sumitra Thakur, was wonderful. Priyanka Chopra was good at her little role in the movie. Ragpal Yadav as brain-dead servant and Boman Irani as the show father, has a very good connection and the comedy scene was hilarious. The direction is very good.
