This is a Casper the Friendly Spirit short of my childhood, and I watch it again on YouTube (Thanks GOD! For Your Tube); Then I like this short, and this is one of my favorite Casper shorts. <br /> <br /> I love how the ghostly ghost begins with Frank Gallop's haunting story; until we see that Casper is reading his tombstone in the cemetery. As each ghost rose from the graves to "bend" people, Casper decides to look for a friend. But if someone tries to make a friend, Casper walks away. Poor Casper sits on a log and weeps; Up to a small jackal a spray pipe comes up. Casper and the little fox bound fast and he called the little boy Ferdie fast and regarded him as his best friend. <br /> <br /> Casper and Ferdie's relationship is in great danger, but Casper doesn't mind Ferdie while playing a game of Hide and Seek. While Ferdie hides a hunter and arrives two of his hunting dogs, try to kill little Ferdie and Ferdie runs as fast as possible until he breathes and starts panting. While the hunter shoots shooting at Ferdie Casper notifications, they try to kill him and fly in the hunter's direction and plead for the hunter to leave Ferdie alone. And the hunter and dogs are terrified of Casper. Casper shouts to Ferdie that the hunter and the dogs are gone and that everything is fine. But Casper sees Ferdie's body not moving and asking if he's right. When Casper saw that Ferdie was dead, he started to mourn because he lost the "only friend he ever had in his entire life". "Casper returns to the cemetery where he buried Ferdie and made a grave alongside Casper's tombstone. Casper is still struggling with pain until he sees Ferdie himself as a ghost. Ferdie starts Casper on his cheek Casper shouts for joy because he is reunited with Ferdie. <br /> Overall, this is a very good short, though surprisingly disturbing, showing death in a family-oriented cartoon.
