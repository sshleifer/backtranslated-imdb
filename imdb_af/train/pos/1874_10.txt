Everyone should see this movie, because each of us is somehow broken and it can help us realize. 1) My life is not as bad as I thought and 2) How important it is to take a child in need. There are so many out there. To think that the movie was actually based on a real person, we made life think and how the world has and always will be. Corrupt, but corruption should not reach your home. We all have a choice! Definitely recommend this one ... and while you're there, I'd like to throw "The Color Purple" and "Woman, Thou Art Loosed" by TD Jakes. <br /> <br /> These are all movies based on life and give us a glimpse of life.
