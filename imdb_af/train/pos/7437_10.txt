Recently, a friend and I discussed the educational and ethical influences when we grew up in the 1950s. She called Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who wrote The Rime of The Ancient Mariner in 1798. Both of us had to be responded to by the epic poem in high school and in English literature courses in college. My friend said, "His messages can even be called metaphysics in the context of the context." <br /> <br /> We tried to recite it and just remember bits. (I have problems remembering Dr. Seuss.) I said I would get two copies of the poem so that everyone could read it. It was easy enough, but I was very surprised to find it made in a movie. We looked forward to watching the movie to see how it was interpreted. After all, the Rime of the Ancient Mariner is not exactly reading the light. After everyone read the poem, we watched the movie. <br /> <br /> We see the movie as a remarkable achievement, especially since it was made for computers in the 1970s before the so-called Ken Burns effect, "and before special effects are too often compensated for a lack of Particularly noteworthy is the 19th and 20th century illustrations of "lesser-known artists", such as Willy Pogany, the early Hollywood designer. <br /> <br /> The film is told by Sir Michael Redgrave, who taught the poem when he was a schoolmaster, he added a tone of authority and credibility to stay true to the poem. <br /> <br /> His mastery is in the layers of subtle messages, conveyed without 'instructions' or' a repressive and obvious morality story, we found it such a refreshing change of today's "in your face" and knocked them over the head of the mind, most of today's moral messages in film being two-dimensional: extreme violence, The murder and murder indicate the bad Gte is really, really, bad, and good is superheroes. It is as if the human character is lacking in nuance. The Rime of The Ancient Mariner is a celebration of the individual, of character, of appreciation for the celebration of all the wealth that life offers, within the wider context of humanity, that is, man's ability to to give others. <br /> <br /> In spite of ourselves having found this "unknown" jewel, we have learned that he has won the top five in his six-time category by "name" international film festivals. Another surprise was learning the film's director, Raul daSilva, is a recognized authority on early animation and has written six award-winning books on film. <br /> <br /> This movie's message is just as relevant today, if not more so, than when Coleridge wrote the original epic poem and then Raul daSilva translated it to movie. If I were teaching five years of high school, which I did for five years, I would grab this one and show it to all my students. There is a wealth here that obviously leads to the discussion of the big and important issues we all face, whether in 1798, 1978 or today - actually, as long as humanity has a spiritual component. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
