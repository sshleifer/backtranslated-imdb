Super Speedway makes a good demo of your new DVD / bigscreen / 5.1 channel audio system. The IMAX camera puts you right in the race car, where you cross several tracks at high speed, reminiscent of the row sequences in the Grand Prix (if only on DVD!). I enjoy watching again and again. <br /> <br /> The only minus, and why I didn't give it a 10, is some of the row series look suspicious as the movie is faster. The soundtrack also requires a small suspension of unbelief - all you can hear in a real car is the engine. You won't hear hoaxes when you go under the bridges.
