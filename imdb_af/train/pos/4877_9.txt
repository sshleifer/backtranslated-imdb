Actually, one particular person / character is not "right there", but my summary line refers to the power of the movie. And it is all accomplished without any fancy camera moving and / or large production sets, but with a good story and many (credible) and good actors who carry the story (bow). <br /> <br /> It can be a companion piece for big Japanese movies / movies (such as Tokyo Story, etc.), not so much story-like, of course, but more awesome! Great play, nuances in the gigs that are really gems. If you are eager to experience a touch and see a movie that becomes emotional, then it is the one that goes. As you have noticed (as with many of my reviews), I am not in the story. There are places here at IMDb where you can look it up, I'm not the one who ignores the story whatsoever!
