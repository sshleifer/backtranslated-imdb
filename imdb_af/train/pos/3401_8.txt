The pioneering technology filmmaking (Winner of Special Technical Performance Oscar) is indeed mesmerizing. Add an endless variety of glamorous costumes and a romantic movie dream team such as Marlene Dietrich and Charles Boyer, and you have a very pleasant "picture". <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the confronted plot as well as the overblown scene left much to be desired. Yet there have been no more awesome Technicolor movies for this one (1936), and very little since then, which can add to this stunning visual experience of beautiful colors. Cinema fans who have enjoyed the glorious color kinematics in Robin Hood (1938), Jesse James (1939) and Gone With The Wind (1939) will not be disappointed in the fantastic work done here. The garden of Allah will always be synonymous with brilliant color kinematics.
