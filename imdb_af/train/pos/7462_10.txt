Note: These comments are for people who have seen the movie. <br /> <br /> Vanilla Sky is a brilliant, complex and exciting film that explicitly examines exactly what the tagline says: LoveHateDreamsLifeWorkPlayFriends. Perhaps the film may be in focus for confused filmmakers if one sees it from another angle. <br /> <br /> Considering the following: <br /> <br /> Now I have not carefully gone through the movie scene on the scene, so I have to further investigate my allegations (and I welcome your thoughts ), but give it a try to see if the movie is not in place: Where is the debatable split? <br /> <br /> Now I'm not talking about the splits as explained by the LE 'technician', since that series itself can actually be interpreted as a rationalization of David Aames's thoughts / dream / coma state. but the real divide between reality and dream. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that the reality of the car accident, the way it is filmed (for example, no blast) is a likely splice point, and that a specific sequence that has an existential / dream / coma / non-reality contains, feels it is shown on the screen before or after the accident - is actually part of Aames' personal journey to self-realization within his own mind. <br /> <br /> In this regard, we are overlooked with two questions. end (if you know more, let me know): is Aames actually disabled, and where does he wake up? <br /> <br /> If you're not completely wrapped up in the exact sequence of details in the plot, or at what particular point his dreams are being spread everywhere, this movie becomes a fascinating exploration of a person on a journey to find himself and wha it means in today's pop culture society. <br /> <br />
