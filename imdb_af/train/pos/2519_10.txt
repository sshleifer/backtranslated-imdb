This movie is really special. It's a very beautiful movie. What starts with three orphans, Sho, his brother Shinji and their friend Toshi. They are poor children living on the street, but one day they managed to steal a bag of money, and then they could continue to buy. a home, and their life looks much better. They make new friends, friends of life. But something went wrong and they become enemies and it all ends with each other to kill each other. <br /> <br /> In the beginning I was negative about this movie because when singers (Gackt - Solo, ex-singer in Malice Mizer, Hyde - Solo, singer in L'Arc ~ and ~ Ciel, both very famous in Japan and Wang Lee-Hom - Taiwanese singer, trying to become actors, but it's not like the other singers-actors-movies. They do a good job, and with no early experience in movies (except Lee-Hom, who was previously in two movies). <br /> <br /> It's absolutely one of my favorite movies. Maybe it's a bit because I'm a big fan of Hyde, but - it was this movie that made me discover. <br /> <br /> Well, Gackt (the main character - the orphan Sho) was part of the group who wrote the script, and it was he who insisted that Hyde Sho's friend, the vampire Kei, must play. At that time they didn't know each other, at least not like friends. But after the movie, they have become a very good friend, and it also shows us that they have worked really hard on this movie and that they have worked well together. <br /> <br /> The movie has many different feelings that run through the story, Love, Hate, sadness, pain, loneliness, happiness and so on. I think the first hour is the best, it's so beautiful. Then people die, Kei leaves and it changes so much. But it's still a good movie, it's the only movie that ever made me cry. It ends up so sad, but still beautiful. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen this movie, you really should. Because it is wonderful, but sad. You won't regret it. ^^
