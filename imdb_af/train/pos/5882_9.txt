In Mexico, this movie is only broadcast in PayTV. Dietrich Bonhoeffer's life is a true example of good German and especially about a good man. The talks between Tukur's character and the Nazi prosecutor are particularly interesting. A true idea 'war: two different Germans, both believing in it. Bonhoeffer was a very complex person: man, freedom fighter, boyfriend, churchman and a great intellectual; Ulrich Tukur is excellent as Bonhoeffer. I highly recommended this movie, especially in these difficult times for the planet. In Mexico we don't know much about Pastor Bonhoeffer's life and legacy, it's a wonderful job to save a forgotten hero.
