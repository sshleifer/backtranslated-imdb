I only reached thirteen when I first saw and I watch it on DVD thirty years later. The opening credit photos never left me. It influenced my view of the world and the people in it. My parents were with me long enough to see the series with me, and we discussed the program afterwards. It gave me a love to study history and the highest marks I got in our school's public exams! <br /> <br /> Sir Laurence Olivier's voice and delivery is timeless and perfect. I get the feeling that the people who lived through it would feel that it was their version of World War II history. I can't imagine letting myself get bored. Perhaps a similar Cold War series could be considered, but who could replace Sir Laurence is hard to imagine. <br /> <br /> Buy it!
