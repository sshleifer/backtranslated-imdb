Have fun watching this movie. Despite the feeling that I was getting a lot of time, this movie almost made copies of Monsters Inc. There are quite a few things that are very similar between the two, the relationship between an animal / monster and a small child, other animals trying to break that relationship, etc. It made me feel so good in the movie. <br /> <br /> One of the redeeming features, however, is Scrat :) Very funny character, even if he doesn't serve a purpose :)
