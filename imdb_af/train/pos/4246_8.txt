In this movie, made just as the production code was enforced, Jean Harlow is Eadie, and Patsy Kelly is the wisecracking, man-chasing sidekick "Kitty". Meisie from Missouri starts with the girls coming on a train, with Eadie a promise to earn herself to earn money while she is looking for a millionaire man, who stays in the process. It doesn't take long for her to meet Frank Cousins, (Lewis Stone, was the friendly doctor at the Grand Hotel as well as Judge Hardy in the Andy Hardy movies.) But everything doesn't look the same. The censors must have loved Harlow's line. A girl couldn't accept an expensive gift like a man if she wasn't engaged. " Later someone says, "You know we were never alone together" and Eadie replied, "Yes, and we're not going to be!" Lionel Barrymore is T.R. Paige, another rich, cross that comes to her rescue when trouble is searching for Eadie. At one point Paige states: "You have to scrap me off your list - I'm not a ladies man" .... I wonder what that line would have been just a few years earlier before the Hayes code entered the town has. What did he really say? Carol Tevis seems to be the high "Baby Talker", as mentioned in the credits on IMDb. She seemed to be in showbiz only 1931-1939, with the "Munchkin" in Oz's wizard who was the last part she played. Fun, cleancut skirt as the girls hunt men all over the country. Search for Nat Pendleton as the lifeguard, who was an 1920 Wrestler (silver medalist), movie star (he was in much of the Dr Kildares, and would appear in four of Harlow's films.) Wrong identity, plot twitching, " a young Franchot Tone, love stories, even Jean Harlow in a bathing suit in "Palm Beach", although the outdoor scenes of the city center are a backdrop.
