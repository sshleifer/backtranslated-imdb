An underlined addition to the Graham Greene movie gun - the perceived flaws can now be seen as virtues. Director Shumlin, theatrical director, plans his action with an oppressive rigidity appropriate to the material, and the seemingly indifferent compositions indicate discomfort. Both a dark thriller and a story of moral regeneration (for the female character! In a 40-year-old thriller!), The movie has an upright hero who gets angry and murderous (and possibly pedophilia). Brilliantly, the main ideologies of the Spanish Civil War bring a terrible insight into class and capitalism, clever theatrical metaphors, a rare approach to Greene's God and an end that is only happy if you know nothing of history.
