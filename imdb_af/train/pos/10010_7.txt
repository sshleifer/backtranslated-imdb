There are many diseases that are born in the minds of man who has been given life in modern times. Constant vigilance or information in the kingdom of Pyschosis, preserved psychologists, counselors and psychiatrists with enough work to keep their decades. Sometimes some of these mental phenomena are discovered by those who have no knowledge of their means or even their existence. This is the premise of the movie entitled "The Night Listner." It tells the story of a popular radio host called Gabriel Noon (Robin Williams), who spends his evenings surprise his audiences with lively stories about Gay Lifestyle. Maybe it's because his performance loses it, it's authentic veneer that causes Noon to admit he is no longer himself. Feeling left by both his lover Jess (Bobby Cannavale) and his and best friend (Joe Morton), he is seeking shelter in his in-depth despair and isolation. It's here, a mysterious voice at night asking for help. The afternoon must be useful and reach out to the desperate voice belonging to a 14-year-old boy, Peter (Rory Culkin). In reading the boy's sharp manuscript depicting early life and sexual abuse in the hands of his brutal parents, Noon is enchanted and wants to help. But things aren't what they look like and the afternoon soon finds himself in an elusive and bizarre story torn from a medical nightmare. This movie is pure Robin Williams and it wasn't for Toni Collette who plays Donna D. Logand, Sandra Oh as Anna and John Cullum as pop, it can be comical. Instead, it may seem like one of William's more serious appearances. ***
