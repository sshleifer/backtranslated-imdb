I've always liked Johnny Concho and I wish this movie was on VHS and DVD. Frank Sinatra gives one of the most unusual performances in his career in this one. <br /> <br /> Once we meet Frank in the movie's title role, he is the brother of a notorious gun battle that is currently out of town. The brother strikes terror in the heart of the town, and Frank takes full advantage of bullying the townspeople safely and safely in his shadow. Only Phyllis Kirk has any feelings for him. She is the daughter of shopkeeper Wallace Ford and Dorothy Adams. <br /> <br /> Two other armed men arrive at William Conrad and Christopher Dark and Conrad Sinatra's brother appears to have been killed and he comes to his village to take over. They humiliated Sinatra and ran him out of town. Kirk follows him. <br /> <br /> Overnight Sinatra turns from punk to coward and becomes a man looking for some kind of spine. It's a good performance, almost as good as his Oscar nominated role in The Man With a Golden Arm. Sorry for some reason, it hasn't been seen for years. <br /> <br /> Two other performances of the note are Keenan Wynn as former armed warrior who has become minister who helps Sinatra find what he needs to stand up for Conrad and Dark. And then there's Conrad in what I believe was his career role on the screen. He is a villain of incredible malice, pure evil, carnal, and walking on the silver screen. <br /> <br /> But what I like about Johnny Concho is the climax being an unforgettable one where Conrad and Dark are handled. Let's just say I believe Johnny Concho was MGM's answer to High Noon and a primer for what you do when evil causes a break in all law and order.
