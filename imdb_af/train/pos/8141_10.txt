I got the film without cover and didn't even know what it was, but when I saw it, I laughed so hard. It's now one of my favorite movies of all time. Rusty and the guys created a masterpiece. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone with a sense of humor. Thank you Rusty for giving us something to laugh.
