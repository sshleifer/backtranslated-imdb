Pet Semetary (1989) 9/10 The Creed family has just moved into the village of Ludlow. The family consists of a father, Louis, a mother, Rachel, a brother Gage, and a daughter, Ellen. They are greeted with kindness by Judith Crandall. Jud is 89, and can basically tell you about the whole history of Ludlow. <br /> <br /> Behind the Creed's new home there is a path leading to a pet cemetery. When Ellen wants to go see it, Jud deliberately takes the family out. This is the beginning of hell for the Creed family. <br /> <br /> When Rachel and the children are gone, Ellen's cat church dies. Judge felt that Ellen was not ready for the death of her cat, so he suggested that Louis follow him further down the road, past the pet cemetery. <br /> <br /> Jud tells Louis of this cemetery, once used by Micmac Indians. Louis buried the church without Judah's help. A few days later, the church returns alive, but from hell. <br /> <br /> This movie was one of two horror movies that can really scare me, except the "Exorcist". The biggest show will ever be, Zelda, Rachel's sister with spinal meningitis, or Victor Pascow, a ghost trying to help the Creeds bring back the mistakes of death. <br /> <br /> The music in this movie plays an extravagant part. It is at the same time sad and mysterious. It's going great with the movie. <br /> <br /> 9/10
