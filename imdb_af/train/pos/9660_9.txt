Only after a few contemplation did I decide that I liked this movie. And after reading and reflecting on all the other posters here, I decided I loved it. I love American movies - probably because they are so narrative. They usually have a well-defined beginning, middle and end. "Presque rien", on the other hand, doesn't make such an effort. I disagree with other posters saying it is "too artificial". In every way, this movie is meant to remind your mind. So often in the movie you feel like you are there ... you feel the summer, the wind, the heat, the winter cold, the camaraderie, the loneliness, etc. <br /> <br /> In any way, the director draws you into the lives of the characters - so many people feel so strong that the movie has disappointed them. After I looked at it, I felt the same. But to a degree of reflection, I admit that this is how the movie should be: the 'story' is not the narrative, these are the emotions you (the viewer) feel. <br /> <br /> The lighting and camera angles immerse you in the scenes - they are rich, beautiful, and live with detail and nuance. Although I can't normally play movies without a fully developed plot (it's not a movie that is supposed to tell a story), this movie is definitely one of my new favorites.
