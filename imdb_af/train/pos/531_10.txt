This movie has made the most beautiful opening sequence ever. I saw this movie for the first time a week ago. Ever since I saw the opening every day and every time I feel so excited as I first felt, I heard David Niven say the immortal words from Sir Walter Raleigh's The Pilgrimage: <br /> <br / > Give me my scallop silence, My staff of faith to walk up, My scream of joy, immortal diet, My bottle of salvation, My gown of glory, Hope's true gift; And so I will take my pilgrimage (??) <br /> Do you know why it would be a truism to say Michael Powell and Emeric Pressuburger's lives are justified because he made such a wonderful opening ? Because they have been in the Paradise of Poets for a long time, they have made this movie long before they did. <br /> <br /> I suggest that they both be executed during the Day of Judgment and an indifferent God says: I beg you, sir. So, do you want to know what we did during our lifetime? Well, well, you'll see: We wrote and produced: I know where I'm going, colonial blimp, red shoes? Do you think this is enough sir? It is obvious that these two great artists have already fulfilled their duty with God, Nature the Muse or whatever you can call when they shot a life and death case. The fact that other people's lives would be justified for their actions cannot be clear to everyone, although I feel my life would have a meaning if I had never done anything else to see this movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, old timers will be tempted to say: They are no longer doing movies like this one. They will be partially wrong; neither did they make films in recent times. <br /> <br /> I've quoted Keats here, but I'll repeat his words: A beauty is always a joy.
