I couldn't hold back the tears when I looked at this beautiful documentary. It was sad, disturbing and inspired everything in one. I recommend this documentary to anyone looking for something that will make them think about what they do with their own lives. Or simply, something that makes you think. You watch John live through the last few months of his life. You see how he goes through his days with a positive attitude. At one point you begin to see that he is truly a wonderful individual. You begin to understand that he has something to teach us all. His life and struggle will make you cry, laugh and find that life is much easier to live if you take it one at a time.
