A fragment in the life of one of the first female painters to gain historical fame, Artemisia tells the true story of a young Italian woman's passive pursuit of artistic expression and the volatility she meets. The film features sumptuous costumes and sets and a good role and play. However, it is astounded in his attempt to depict the esoteric of art and time and is uninspired in portraying the passion of the artist as painted on canvas and exploring through her involvement with men. A great movie for those interested in renaissance paintings or period films.
