Old people show ???? I'm 15 and watched the show since I was 12. It redistributed me every day from Hallmark and BBC 1. I really wish they hadn't canceled it, they didn't even say goodbye. But what an adventure, all the episodes, I think I saw them all, and not one comes into my mind that I didn't like and enjoy. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that the BBC still varies between Diagnosis and Murder She Wrote-Never watched and does not intend to do so. Anyway, his characters in Diagnoses Murder are so in-depth, and the chemistry between the actors is wonderful. It was really a sad day when they canceled this show ........
