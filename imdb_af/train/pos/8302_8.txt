Guns blasting, buildings exploding, crashing cars, and it's just the first ten minutes. <br /> <br /> This action-packed movie that includes a rogue ex-CIA mercenary who can't seem to die no matter how many times he's shot (so the title) is pretty decent. <br /> <br /> Hard and toothy Gary Busey, who is usually thrown into villain in this type of wing, has his usual crazy charm, but is a little more muted. He's been the whole show. This does not mean that there are not very big supporting roles, including William Smith, Luke Askew, Mills Watson, R.G. Armstrong, Henry Silva, Lincoln Kirkpatrick, Thalmus Rasulala, and several other "forgotten" character actors. <br /> <br /> There are plenty of smaller action ranges to keep the whole story: Busey has to release a group of "kidnapped" US military elites and return a high-tech "super-tank" (an ordinary tank with a cheese-like paste - pasted to the top) back to the states. <br /> <br /> But doesn't America make this murder machine more than the bad guys? Of course, this question is asked, as in any film-centering on the CIA ... but without being preaching.
