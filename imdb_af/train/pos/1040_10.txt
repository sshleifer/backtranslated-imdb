Outstanding 1943 movie with Paul Lukas giving an Oscar-calibrated performance as head of his family brings them back to America from Europe as the Nazi threat deepens. <br /> <br /> Ordinary tremendous Bette Davis retains her reputation here and for a change not named for the best actress for this or any movie of 1943. <br /> <br /> To enter the betrayal, Luke has successfully tackled the situation. He knows he has to return to Europe on a clandestine mission and return he does. <br /> <br /> Davis pulls all the stops again with a Katharine Hepburn-like shedding or tears when they have to share. Resolute, she knows that her older son should follow him on his way to freedom. <br /> <br /> A wonderful movie that highlights American positive propaganda against a wicked enemy.
