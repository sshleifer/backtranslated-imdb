Of course, all those who voted less than 5 are not fans of clean, tongue-in-cheek humor. Keaton is brilliant in this - as in most of his work. It's not a bigger, bigger life relationship. It's camp, slapstick humor was played by some of Hollywood's best (and many versatile) actors. Piscopo was as close to the best dog wannabee, once. <br /> <br /> If you want to see the funniest effort not to be really filmed, see Dimitri doing his piece as Morone. <Br /> <br /> I gave it a 7.
