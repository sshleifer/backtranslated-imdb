Neil Simon has quite a body of work, but it is the strange couple who carry him to celebrity. This movie really works. Jack Lemmon & Walter Matthaw have a good chemistry. The supporting film for this film is also stars. <br /> <br /> There are about 2 men living together who are of opposite planets. The writing brushes with humor from this situation. It was done earlier in some forms. This is the one that brings everything into a very good package. <br /> <br /> Simon did another decent job, but this one is really his best job that made the rest of his work possible. It's hard to imagine Simon ever being this topping.
