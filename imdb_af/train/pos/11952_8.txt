Scoop *** from **** Woody Allen is definitely not my favorite director, but I enjoyed "Match Point". It was an excellent dark romantic thriller that luckily did not play Woody Allen. It had the beautiful Scarlett Johansson in it. <br /> <br /> "Scoop" is Woody Allen's latest movie and although he appears in this one, it's right. It also includes Scarlett Johansson and the two work perfectly together. <br /> <br /> Johansson plays Sondra Pransky, a young college journalist who gets the ghost of a lifetime of the ghost of Joe Strombel (Ian McShane). Joe heard the shoe while on a boat with the grim reaper and a bunch of other souls who took the Reaper. One of the souls is Peter Lyman's secretary (Hugh Jackman.) She tells Joe that Peter may be the ceremony that boasts English streets. Joe, with a lifetime, goes back to life and gives this information to Sondra during a magic. Sondra is on a few tournaments with sorcerer Sid Waterman (Woody Allen). She becomes a volunteer to go into a vanish and while in the box, she gets Joe's visit. She didn't know what to do, but she helped Sid Sideman to help her crack the case. <br /> <br /> This movie has a nice light feel compared to "Match Point" and yet it all works. . Johansson and Allen work well together. Allen's humor perfectly fits this story and role. Hugh Jackman is wonderful as Peter Layman, the "supposed" serial killer. <br /> <br /> It's a fun movie to see if you're ever looking for one to watch. The cast ensemble works well and the story flows and you sometimes forget that you look at Woody Allen himself. I say, give it a chance, because you can just love it.
