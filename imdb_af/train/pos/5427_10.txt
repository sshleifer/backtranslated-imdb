Three sergeants in the British army stationed in India are being sent out to stop an uprising of tribal killers known as the Thuggees. One of the sergeants, Cutter, leads away from the camp looking for a golden temple and is led by the Thuggees by the sinister Guru. Gunga Din, the regiment's water boy, goes back to the camp for help and the other two sergeants go to him, but are also caught. Now the chief sends a full details to the three, but doesn't realize they're in a trap through the Home. However, it is Gunga Din who saves that day. Excellent made girlfriend movie, even though it is politically wrong today. Grant, McLaglen and Fairbanks give very humorous and exciting performances with Jaffe very well in the title role and Cianelli very sinister as Guru. Rating 10 out of 10.
