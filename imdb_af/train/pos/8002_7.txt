I saw Maslin Beach several times, both on free television in Brisbane. I don't care if it's good, bad or otherwise, like others good and really covered it. <br /> <br /> I'll say it's so Australian. Only in Australia can we see a film about relationships among people who are as naked as the day they were born and on free commercial television. <br /> <br /> I have a US friend who is constantly amazed at what we put on our free TV compared to her homeland. Sex and the CIty and Huff are just too examples. <br /> <br /> Despite our government trying to turn us into the 51st US state, it's good to know that at least some things are really Aussie
