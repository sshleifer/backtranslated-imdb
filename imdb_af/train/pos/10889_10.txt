What's with all the negative comments? Having seen this role for the first time tonight, I can only say that it is a good holiday comedy that will surely brighten any lonely person's day. When I saw that Drew (Ben Affleck) could spend the holiday alone, I wanted to cry. You should see the movie if you want to know why. Even though I liked Tom (James Gandolfini) and Alicia (Christina Applegate) after a while, if you asked me, it was real snobs. However, this movie made me smile and felt good. Before I upload it, I'd like to say that Mike Mitchell achieved a pure holiday hit. Now, finally, I recommend this good holiday comedy, which will surely brighten any lonely person's day on any Ben Affleck or Christina Applegate fan who hasn't seen it.
