The energetic young producer of theatrical prologues (the increased performances, usually musical, which has made the film in the bigger theater over time) must deal with curvy competition, fraudulent partners, treacherous lovers and amateur talent to reach his dream , to realize. at the FOOTLIGHT PARADE. <br /> <br /> While watching many other Warner musical shows, especially the GOLDDIGGER movies, this movie had a particular attraction that none of the others had: Jimmy Cagney. He is a wonder, loose joint and light, as adaptable as any tombat - a creature he actually imitates a few times in the movie. Cagney grabs the viewers' attention and never lets go, the fast fire dialogue and the crowny plot drives with its charisma and vibrant charm. <br /> <br /> The rest of the player also gives their best. Joan Blondell is perfect as the clever mouth, whimsical blonde secretary, with Cagney (headquarters - why is she not given a musical number?). Dick Powell & Ruby Keeler are playing lovers again and again; the fact that her singing and acting ability is a bit on the lean, is compensated by her dance; Powell is still pushing boyish enthusiasm into his unusual position as second male head. <br /> <br /> Guy Kibbee and Hugh Herbert are great fun brothers who both plan to cheat Cagney in different ways. Ruth Donnelly counts as Kibbee's rich wife, a woman dedicated to her attractive protégés. Frank McHugh's audience choreographer is a suitable movie for Cagney's whites. Herman Bing is hilarious in his one small scene as a music organizer. Mavens will see little Billy Barty, Jimmy Conlin and maybe even John Garfield in the musical numbers. <br /> <br /> Finally there is Busby Berkeley, choreographer nonpareil. His terpsichorean outfits, sprinkled by the decades of the 1930s, were a prime example of the film escapism that depression audiences wanted to enjoy. Of course, the big joke about Berkeley's creations was that they were meant to be stage productions as part of the plot. But no theater can ever keep these products from the master's imagination. They are perfect illustrations of the type of entertainment made only by the movie camera. <br /> <br /> In general, Berkeley's music presentations have taken one of two different approaches, either telling a story (often rather bizarre) with song and dance; or other beautiful geometrically designed numbers, eyecup, with lots of choruses, overhead camera work and a romantic tune. In a spasm of exuberance, FOTLIGHT PARADE climaxes climb with three Berkeley masterpieces: "Honeymoon Hotel" and its pre-production code that tells of a couple's wedding day; "At a waterfall" - dozens of unfinished females, splash, float and dive into perfect patterns and designs (meticulously and you'll see how the synchronous effects are achieved); And finally, "Shanghai Lil" - a fitting tribute to the talents of both Cagney & Berkeley.
