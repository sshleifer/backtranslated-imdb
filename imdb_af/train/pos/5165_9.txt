This ensemble play on adults returning to the Formative Summer Camp of their youth was a very quiet participant and star in the theater in the fall of 1993. It would be a pity, but then there are some of the better movies ARE. Diane LAne, Kevin Pollack, Elizabeth Perkins, Vincent Spano, Julie Warner, Bill Paxton, Kimberly Williams, Matt Craven and Alan Arkin (who are painful). well here) is the group of actors who cast out these roles as people who have grown old with good, bad and funny memories of past summer. This movie covers the gambit of emotions, mostly pleasing, and the movie never hangs from the viewer to feel what the characters feel, and prefers to allow the viewer to enter the memories himself. As I am a film shoulder who is a slim brush, manipulation of copper in films, it is something I appreciated by author / director Mike Binder. <br /> <br /> This movie is a good cheap rental, good head rent and even a nice sit in a movie theater. You can run this on TV and I will definitely suggest a watch-watch.
