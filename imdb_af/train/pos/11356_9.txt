This is an excellent movie. It's about many things: the hunt for a serial killer, the bureaucracy of Soviet Russia, the management of one man, and the relationship between this man (the chief detective) and his superior. <br /> <br /> The thing about my stick most is the relationship between Durokov (Rea) and Fetisov (Sutherland) (excuse bad spelling, please!). For some reason, it moves to see and work their respect for hostility and offense in respect and comrades. One line in the movie makes me say, "He'll say something funny, but he's overcome with emotion." <br /> <br /> Excellent performance by all the cast, even the smallest parts done with credibility. <br /> <br /> It's not a quick action thriller; In fact, it sometimes moves, like a slow drama, but it's worth it. Very satisfactory and not exploiting the crimes. <br /> <br />
