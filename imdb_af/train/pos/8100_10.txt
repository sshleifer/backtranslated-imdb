This film, in my opinion, despite the mistakes (which I maintain is * little *), a complete masterpiece and a wonderful work of art. <br /> <br /> Bakshi has done here, creating a very beautiful film and showing his enormous talent and versatility as a director of animated films. He does not receive 1 / 100th of the credit he deserves to save the art of animation literally for an adult audience. If it wasn't for Mr Bakshi, I don't believe animation would have survived the Disney attack. He also created not only a beautiful animation film with The Lord of the Rings, but he has created a completely new art form - unfortunately one that has never succeeded. <br /> <br /> Most people will complain about using rotoscope in the movie (using live action images used as background images and often animated about using various techniques of what seems to be small quantities tinting to full blown animation). But I feel that the people complaining about it simply can't accept an art form that is beyond the norm. No, it's not Disney animation. No, it's not live action. No, it's not 'cheated' - it's a new, fascinating and absolutely wonderful art form. Something so fresh, and so new that it feels completely at home in such a fantastic story as "The Lord of the Rings". Bakshi's pioneering use of this technique brings the subtleties of Middle Earth to life, is a very dark and mysterious way. In particular, the darker of Tolkien's creatures, especially the Nazgul, realize that traditional animation or living action was incapable. to reach. <br /> <br /> Peter S. Beagle's script (very little, as I understand it, on an early concept by Chris Conkling) is a very loyal adaptation of Tolkien's works. Where possible, he uses dialogue directly from the novel and feels at home in the world that Bakshi created. There are many tracks made to fit the first book and 3/4 into a single 2 hour 15 minute movie, but there are very few changes to the storyline. There were a few holes it would have been nice to fill: The reform of Narsil, the gifts of Galadriel, the Huorns at the battle of the Hornburg, but again with the time constraints he had (all the longest animated feature in history), it is certainly understandable (although one wonders how they could be explained in a sequel). <br /> <br /> There is also the glorious (one of my favorites) score by Leonard Rosenman (who also scored Barry Lyndon and Star Trek IV (the score clearly based on his LotR work)). It's bombastic and brave and, I dare say, perfect. It stands alone as an orchestral victory, but in combination with the images of the film, it comes in a whole new world of symphonic perfection. So far from the typical Hollywoodland rate that turns many off. <br /> <br /> The voice actors are wonderful. Of particular note is John Hurt as Aragorn who reaps only the essence of Strider. <br /> <br /> The character design is also wonderfully unique, but not often for everyone's taste. But remember that it is the duty of the director of an adjustment to show you what he / she thinks, not what you could think, and so Aragorn is realized with a distinctive Native American feel and Boromir appears in Viking inspired clothes. It may not be what you thought, but I can only complain to Mr Bakshi for showing what he has "seen". It may also be noted that he spent a considerable amount of time with Priscilla Tolkien to develop the character outfit for the film. <br /> <br /> One more word - the Flight to Ford order is, in my opinion, one of the most subtle beautiful rows ever to be captured on celluloid. Bakshi is not afraid to delay the pace for a moment, and his skill is clearly shown by the incredible tension that is capable of building. Bakshi's artistic ability and Tolkien's incredible work blends in this order to a glorious peak that is not yet equal. <br /> <br /> The recent DVD release (2001) by Warner Brothers is lacking. While we can give our everlasting thanks that the movie is finally available in widescreen format, the package is unfortunately short of extras. How glorious it would have been to have a director's commentary was able to see the 20 minutes of extra material released for the theater release. Another beautiful addition could have been to compose the live action footage that was later animated. Also present in the DVD edition is the completely horrible voice story at the end of the film which is a departure from the simple voice that took place in the final frames of the film. This version is plastered and poorly rendered right over the musical climax of the score. <br /> <br /> Of course, the biggest tragedy of all is that the successor was never made. We will never see Bakshi's interpretation of Gondor, Shelob, Faramir, the Cracks of Doom, Eowyn's struggle with the Witch King or Gandalf's confrontation with him. We will never be told with Bakshi's image of Denethor or the Palatir or the Paths of the Dead. It is a pity that we will eventually accept Peter Jackson's glamor and glitter Hollywood action movie version of these later events in Tolkien's masterpiece, but I think even better than not having a movie version. everyone. <br /> <br /> David
