Jim Belushi is great as the "average Joe" she gets 15 minutes in "The Twilight Zone". Michael Cane is the mysterious bar mixer who not only listens to Belushi's "story," but has a "cure" for all of Belushi's middle-class problems: a magical drink to bring about a plethora of changes in Belushi's life. <br /> Flashbacks are terrified by a 15-year-old who has caused Baseball High School's Championship defeat. Belushi continues with his "miserable life", apparently happy, but always wonders "what if ..." For several days, Belushi experiences a "different" life, one of the great success, admired and hated by others equal measure. <br /> <br /> It's not quite "It's a wonderful life", but some elements are similar and very engaging. The "end" is predictable, but still satisfactory. Look for a very young Cortney Cox in a bit like "deadly attraction" - like another woman. A very enjoyable movie!
