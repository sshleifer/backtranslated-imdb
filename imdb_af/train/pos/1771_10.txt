A classic series that should at least be repeated or released on DVD.Billy Toth, after realizing that he was adopted after the death of his parents, began a journey to find his right parents. After several rituals of the course, his quest highlighted the fact that his father's identity was stolen and used by a human trader in Europe! If I remember correctly, the series ends on the Austrian (?) Ski slopes and a rock wall that leaves the death of Billys traitor. filmed on the spot in several destinations across Europe and appeared polished and incredibly well made with some episodes that cross in the area of ​​film noir and crime thriller.The main bow is often obscured by the cuts of life that Billy has gone through his years of struggle find his mother and father's secrets. A class action but underestimated and forgotten.
