Warning: Contains spoilers. <br /> <br /> Open your eyes <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen this movie and are planning on doing so, just stop reading here and take my word for it. You should see this movie. I've seen it four times, and I haven't decided exactly what happened in the movie. That's all I'm going to say, because if you haven't seen this movie, stop reading. <br /> <br /> If you're still reading, I'm going to ask you questions and maybe someone has any answers you can email me and let me know what you think. <br /> <br /> I remember my Grade 11 English teacher very well. His name was Mr. Krisak. For me, he was wise past his years and he always had this critical way of learning what you might not be all too keen on. If we didn't like Shakespeare, he changed the story into a contemporary romance with modern language so we could understand it. Our classroom was never a room, it was a cottage and we were on the lake reading a book in our own free time. It was his own indelible way of marking something in our spongy mind. <br /> <br /> I start this Vanilla Sky review with a description of this brilliant man, because he once gave us an assignment that was firmly etched into my mind, such as the long-lost phone number best friend, and it finally made me feel after watching The Matrix. Now, if I didn't know better, I would have thought Wachowski's brothers were just an alias to my teacher. Krisak. But to give them the benefit of the doubt, we will assume it wasn't him. But this was the first time that this command was nothing more than impeccable. <br /> <br /> He asked us to prove to him and to ourselves what was real. Show me how you can say you're real. It spat the class from all the usual ideas I'm sure you can imagine. Everything from pain, feeling of touch to feeling of loss to famine has been expressed to our teacher to prove to him that we really were. After every scenario we gave him, he would come back with the one answer that would leave us speechless. <br /> <br /> "What if you have nothing but someone else's dream?" <br /> <br /> What if you were someone else's dream? What a mess it is. It was a question / scenario that was put to us about 15 years ago, before the astronomical use of the internet and the rapid advancement of computers. How likely can it look? But if you look at today's technology, ask yourself how it was your part of someone else's dream. <br /> <br /> Another brilliant yet surrealistic film this year explored similar areas of David Lynch's Mulholland Drive. But Vanilla Sky can go deeper than any other movie can hope. In short, this is a movie that will literally (if you allow) think of all the possibilities that surround you. <br /> <br /> Open your eyes. <br /> <br /> Tom Cruise plays David Aames, a young, hot shot, fair, full of himself publisher and owner of various magazines. He inherited it from his father and although he has talent and business skills, his board of directors, the Seven Dwarves, thinks he is a rich one born with a silver spoon in his mouth. They feel that he has done nothing to earn the most of success, each of them believes should go to them. <br /> <br /> Early in the film we meet one of David's beautiful toys, named Julie Gianni, played with Cameron Diaz with harmful but bomb-like perfection. David and Julie play a good game, both claiming they are just there to use each other and are not the least interested in a monogamous, dedicated relationship. This is the kind of relationship that is similar to David's other wings that he had in the sexual first of his life. And although both speak a good game, we can say that only one really tells the truth. <br /> <br /> Next, we meet Brian Shelby, played with a genius stroke by Kevin Smith's good friend, Jason Lee. Brian writes a book that David will publish, but they are also very good friends. It's something David has very little in his life and you can feel a real care for each other early in the film. Brian has one well-known line he tells David time and time again. And it is "the sweet is not so tasty without the bitter." He also tells him that one day he will find true love and not just this part-time status that he seems to have with all the floozies that inhabit his bed for a night or two. <br /> <br /> At David's big birthday bash (so great that Steven Spielberg wishes him a happy birthday), Brian will be playing with his date, Sofia Sorrano, by Penelope Cruz with this year's best performance an actress. It is just an invitation, and David and Sofia only seem to be amazed. And in the typical David mode, despite his best friend out there, he starts flirting with Sofia. To complicate things, Julie appears untouched and begins to spy on David. David spent the night with Sofia, but they talk and draw caricatures from each other. There is no panky panky. The next day, when David leaves Sofia's apartment, he is greeted by Julie, giving him a ride and from there ....... Well, I think we all saw the ads. <br /> <br /> This is all I really will say about the plot, because from here the film is disappointing with what is real and what is faded perception. We are introduced to a character played by Kurt Russel and some other shady characters who all play in this labyrinth like haze. There is a subtext of death and possible panacea-like healing that can create the possibility of eternal life. This is just one of the interesting possibilities the film offers us, but it doesn't end there. <br /> <br /> Like many movies seem to thrive today, this movie has a secret. Sixth Sense may have started this maze, but look further back and you may thank Angel Heart for starting the maze. Regardless of how it originated, Vanilla Sky has one of its own bad breasts. And what makes this one so much fun is that the movie gives you very clear clues along the way, but not enough to give you an apodictic solution to the gauntlet of truth and lies, you've given yourself. I've seen this movie four times and each time because it wants me to see if there's anything more I can pick up, something I can understand more. Making your thoughts work in the theater, to enable it to open up new possibilities, is something rare in a movie. All the ersatz so-called "Best Pictures of the Year" were good, but nothing spectacular. They have no dust. A beautiful Spirit was intriguing but flat, The Royal Tenenbaums were interesting, but uneven. Vanilla Sky is a rarity because it is a movie that leaves you, but you want to guarantee your satisfaction, because the movie and those who care. I know this movie got mixed reviews, but I just think those who don't like it don't understand it well. <br /> <br /> That's what movie making is supposed to be. That's what a movie is supposed to do to you. It's supposed to make you feel something. Most of the other films this year were just empty spaces. This one is not. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 The best movie of the year. I would like to see it voted for the best photo and I'd love to see Cruz for best actress, Diaz for best support, Cruise for best actor and Jason Mewes should be a shoe for the best supporting actor. Cameron Crowe must also be there. None of this may happen, and it is a shame. This is a movie that should not be missed. <br /> <br /> And on a final note, I'm absolutely sure Mr. Krisak wanted this movie and maybe it's the one movie that can answer his question. Can you prove you are real? Or are we just an imagination of someone's imagination? Are we artificially transplanted to someone else's endeavor? It's a movie that raises more questions than it doesn't answer. And I'm sure it's just fine with him. <br /> <br /> Open your eyes
