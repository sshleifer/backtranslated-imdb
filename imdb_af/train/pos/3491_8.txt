The movie is excellent, the acting stuff, the plot interesting, the evolution full of tension ... but it's difficult to collect all the elements in a movie that is nearly 80 minutes long. If more time was taken to develop the plot and subplots, it would have a much better effect. Another 30 minutes of dust would have made it a very good movie, rather than just a good one.
