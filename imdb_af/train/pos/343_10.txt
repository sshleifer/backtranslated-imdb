Katherine Heigl, Marley Shelton, Denise Richards, David Boreanaz. Even before I knew what this movie was about, these names were enough to sign me up. Beautiful, talented and popular, these are artists looking out. <br /> <br /> Okay, where do I start. We already know what the film is about. Five beautiful girls are targeted by a 'romantic' serial slasher, a guy who danced at school 13 years ago. Its brands include subtle death cases disguised as valentine cards, chopped chocolate and a blooming nose. His weapon of choice: Well, take a pick-ax, knife, electric power cord, bow and arrow, hot iron, etc. Okay, so basically it's a horror movie with a nice twist to sexuality. <br /> <br /> Horror movies aren't supposed to be Shakespeare, but I'm not going to go there. I love horror movies, but not all. This one, I adore. It's there with some of my other favorites. It's funny, sexy and scary. The murderer's mask is childishly creepy, and as cupid shoots a bow and arrow at a victim, it's very freaky. The play is top notch: Denise Richards, Marley Shelton and David Boreanaz are great fun. I really wanted to see many, much more of Katherine Heigl. I am one of her biggest supporters and would love to see her do a leading job soon. Jessica Capshaw is a very accomplished actress, and Jessica Cauffiel gets the kind of blonde role she has in Urban Legend 2 perfect. The smaller parts were also good; Hedy Buress was a hoot ("bleedmedry.com") and the younger version of Denise Richards looks terrible like her. <br /> <br /> Highlights: Each mortuary has a special distinction about it. The creepiest is the opening scene in the mortuary. The hot tub scene, while ridiculous, was well done. And the audiovisual maze was sinister. The soundtrack is great, with scary music and some good alternative songs. <br /> <br /> Lowpoint: I felt like the killer was not enough, we hardly saw the mask, and it was not at all during the climax. I also thought the climax was really unfocused but fun. <br /> <br /> The turn at the end was not so great of a surprise, but I am delighted that the filmmakers have decided to save us the whole savings. <br /> <br /> I don't like telling people what movies they should watch, but if anyone asked me to choose a horror movie I thought it was worth seeing, then Valentine. it. <br /> <br /> My rating: 10/10 (Bullseye!)
