Here's another movie from the 80's that most people just don't know. This slow, picturesque (the loving shots of the Montana provinces and reminds me of Costner's recent "Open Range", which also featured Robert Duval) and emotionally satisfying film is the perfect kind of movie to watch one night when you can Do not sleep or on a listless Sunday afternoon. Those in the right mood will be treated with a finely detailed and intimate look at the grief of one family and how they come back together after the youngest boy accidentally shoots the eldest son while hunting. The performances are all over and quietly refurbished. Glenn Close, Robert Duval and Wilford Brimley are perfect in their depictions, as well as all the supporting players and young actors. I especially liked how director Cain (who has unfortunately not made any notes since this except the first "Young Guns") gives us a little glimpse into everyone's personal grief. We see not only how death affects the younger brother or the parents, but also the confused middle sister, the cute uncle, his crazy wife and the daughter's girlfriend. What we get mainly here is the rural Midwest answer to "Ordinary People." There are also shades of David Lynch's "The Straight Story" in some of the Stoics downhome Midwest morality of the people portrayed here, as well as in the lovingly thrilling shots of the agricultural land in which they live. This is one of the better and more realistic "tear-jerkers" of the era, and a great little find for your quality movie hunters out there.
