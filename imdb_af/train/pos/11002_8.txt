Director Vincenzo Natali's Cypher is a complex and imaginative thriller that, while requiring a belief in faith and concentration, manages to be a thoroughly entertaining experience. <br /> <br /> Morgan Sullivan (Jeremy Northam), a resident companion with a remaining wife, decides to add a little spice to his everyday life as an industrial spy at the high end. technology company Digi Corp. His work is to travel to conferences all over the country (under the supposed identity of Jack Thursby) and secretly broadcast the speeches given to his bosses via a fine little electronic pen gizmo. <br /> <br /> In fact, however, speeches are merely a cover for much more ominous activities. Morgan participated with his fellow conference. The dried water they drink puts them in a temporary coma, in which they are told to forget their past and permanently adopt their new identities. Once they are completely convinced that they are someone else, they are told to apply for competing companies for work, where they can relax without any mention of corporate espionage. <br /> <br /> But Digi Corp's plans are being stepped up by Morgan's shadowy Rita Foster (Lucy Liu), who opens Morgan's eyes to what really happens. She gives Morgan an antidote to the idea of ​​changing drugs so that he can withstand brainwashing techniques. She also warns him that if Digi Corp suspects he doesn't quite believe he's Jack Thursby, he'll be "eliminated." Morgan is playing together and applying for a job at Competitive Sunways. <br /> <br /> However, he arrives at his new workplace and gets a polygraphic test and is immediately rolled as a spy. Fortunately, Sunways bosses see it as an ideal opportunity to supply false data to Digi Corp and Morgan becomes a double agent. <br /> <br /> From here on, things are gradually becoming more complicated; the plot turns and turns and poor old Morgan ends up trusting no one. In an exciting finale, everything eventually becomes clear (but only if you followed the events very carefully). <br /> <br /> Director Natali is confident and has a good ability to get a handsome search movie for a relatively low budget. He manages some good performances of his talented cast; Jeremy Northam, in particular, is fantastic? His portrayal of the initially somewhat nervous Morgan is played perfectly. <br /> <br /> Cypher is another fascinating movie by a director willing to take chances and I look forward to his upcoming projects, High Rise and Necropolis.
