This is a short, rough animated series by David Lynch (as it says in the beginning), following the miscarriage of a backwoods, overall wearing big man, with a woman with a stress disorder and a boring boy . Both of these elements are repeatedly recited in the short episodes, and there is no real plot to be seen. It's easier if you think of it as an extraordinarily strange, slightly macabre Looney Tunes with much more gore, curse, bloody violence and occasional hilarious moments. <br /> <br /> I bought the DVD with Eraserhead, with previously seen Eraserhead. Don't look at this series if you want an artistic masterpiece - that's all but. In fact, it seems almost a statement against such things, as its rough style spits in the face of any kind of animation convention you may see. As Lynch says, "If it's funny, it's just funny because we see the absurdity of everything."
