Forget the depth of meaning, leave your logic at the door, and enjoy a wonderful time with this maniacally funny, totally absurd, ultra-campy live action cartoon. Mystery Men is a call from every superhero movie you've ever seen, but its unlikely super-wannabes are so interesting, varied and well-cast that they are memorable characters in their own right. Dark humor, straight silliness, bona fide action, and even a moment or two, combine to make this comic fantasy about sweet losers a real winner. The comic talents of the actors playing the Mystery Men, including one Mystery Woman, are a perfect foil for Wes Studi. It can only be described as a cellar Yoda and Geoffrey Rush as one of the most off-the-wall (and bizarre charms) villains ever to walk from the pages of a Dark Horse cartoon and on the big screen. Get ready to laugh, brave and say "huh?" more than once .... enjoy!
