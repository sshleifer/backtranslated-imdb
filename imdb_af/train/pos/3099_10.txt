Together with "Brothers & Sisters", "Six degrees" was one of my favorite new dramas of the fall of 2006. <br /> <br /> Great roll around, but really enjoyed the work of Campbell Scott (the return photographer ) and Hope Davis (recent widowed journalist killed in Iraq). <br /> <br /> Apart from the acting, the writing was fresh and the acting wonder. The show was also shot in NYC, the real city, not the Warner Bros. or another studio's background, adding a secondary layer or realism. <br /> <br /> I think people are more interested in the latest "Survivor" and other reality stuff. Sorry, it didn't last.
