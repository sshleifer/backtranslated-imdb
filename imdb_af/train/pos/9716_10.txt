To love this movie you must a) be in love (without a marriage) b) recognize English humor about the admiration of gallant and witty living situations and not just running gags. C) Be pretty intelligent because writers have given the opportunity to laugh and cry about every minute of this movie, and only if you meet the requirements of "b" and "c" can recognize the author's input and enjoy. d) To fully enjoy the movie, you must love women like Kirsted Dunst, who are so natural, sweet and irresistible. e) You must admire creative, a little melancholy people with great and remarkable personalities. <br /> <br /> If you meet all these requirements, you will probably rate this movie near 10 points. <br /> <br /> I never laughed half (!) so much to look at this masterpiece. And I even managed to cry while I laughed for a few moments (I always get sensitive, when good things happen to Kirsten Dunst)
