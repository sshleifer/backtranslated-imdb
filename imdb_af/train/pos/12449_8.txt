Finally, a good Modesty Blaise movie was released, not only telling a story, but actually telling the "real" story. I admit it is a bad movie if you expect an action thriller, but if you stop on your job and remove all your expectations. Then you will see that this is a story that comes very close to the original by Peter O'Donnell. You have a cover story just to tell how Modesty has become the wonderful person she is. It's not a movie to attract new fans, but a movie to tell the right story. Some things could have been better, but if you can't forget the terrible movie of '66, it's a great movie. So you're a fan then sit relax and just enjoy the true story there with a cover story, just to tell Modesty about her story.
