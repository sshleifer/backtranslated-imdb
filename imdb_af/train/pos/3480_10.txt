this is the best comedy I've ever seen! but not everyone can understand it, you must be from Georgia to understand this wonderful movie! :) overall one of the best movie I've ever seen ......... Vachtangi (Benjamin) and all the supporting actors who play very well, but acting Kote Daoshvili (Father Germogel) is in my opinion the best in role in the history of movies :)) in this movie many Georgian stars like ipolite xvichia, sergo Zakariadze, sofiko chiaureli, verikoan djafaridze, Sesilia Takaishvili, Dodo Abashidze .... they are all stars in Georgian cinematography :) plus in this movie playing big Russian star Evgeni Leonov and of course Director of the movie Georgy Danelia is one of the best ...... I recommend this movie to everyone, but remember that you need to know good Russian language to watch this movie.
