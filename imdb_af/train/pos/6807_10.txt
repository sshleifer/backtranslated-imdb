I have copies of both these movies the classic where Robert Blake is a mighty fine actor where most of the 1967 movie Blake is shown more by a window in prison telling his childhood where it is made, why he is the Clutter Family murdered. Shows a lot in the classic of what really happened and does not tell us which one really did the murder, but it is a good caretaker if you watch the 1996 movie. In cold blood the classic makes much more sense.
