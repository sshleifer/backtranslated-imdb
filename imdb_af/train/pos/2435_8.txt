I never thought an old cartoon would bring tears into my eyes! When I first bought Casper & Friends: Spooking About Africa, I wanted to see the first Casper cartoon, The Friendly Ghost (1945), but when I saw the next cartoon, Good Boos To-Night (1948) . broke me down! I couldn't believe how sad and tragic it was after I saw Casper's fox! I have never seen anything like this in the other Casper cartoons! This is the saddest of all! It was so depressed, I couldn't see it again. Lassie seems to be dying at the end of a movie. I know it's a classic, but it's too much for our old cartoon fans to handle like me! If I wanted to see something old and classic, I'd rather look at something happy and funny! But if I think of this Casper cartoon, I think of my cats!
