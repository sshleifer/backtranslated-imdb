Such a beautiful movie! Very heart warming. One cannot help falling in love with Gigi's character. He is beautiful as a child and grows in a sensitive artist. The whole movie turns around him. He lives in a wonderful world ?? live all life ?? curiosity, desire and anticipation. There is an older brother trying to steal his glory, but really in his shadow remains his whole life. The father is very stereotypical Italian and so is the mother. I wanted the father to reunite with the mother in the last scene? and let them cry and laugh. I also wish there was at least something about the older brother. His personality seems to clear up completely. Passion and ardor ?? this is the key to life. And look through the camera? focus on small details and enjoy the delicate details of life.
