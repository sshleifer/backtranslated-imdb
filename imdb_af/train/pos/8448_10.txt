I've always been a big fan of "Homicide: Life On The Street". When I heard there was a reunion movie coming, I couldn't wait. <br /> <br /> Let me just say, I was not disappointed. It was one of the most powerful 2 hours of television I've ever seen. It was great to see everyone back, but the biggest pleasure of all was to have Andr√© Braugher back because the relationship between Pembleton and Bayliss was always the strongest part of an all-encompassing big show.
