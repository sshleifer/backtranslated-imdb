THE JIST: See something else. <br /> <br /> This movie is highly rated by Gene Siskel, but after watching it, I can't figure out why. The film is definitely original and different. It even has interesting dialogue at times, some cool moments, and a creepy "noir" feel. But it's just not fun. It also doesn't make much sense, in plot but especially in character motivation. I don't know anyone acting like these characters. <br /> <br /> It's a tough movie to take. I suggest you not accept the challenge.
