Having reviewed this intense martial arts movie for the first time in almost 18 years, I have to say that it has not lost my mysticism, nor of its obvious martial arts action as I remembered from my youth. The story of a dying art instructor sending out his "unfinished" pupil to find the 5 past members of his gifklan, is not looking for a fortune that conceals the master's friend. Fearing that his last pupil did not have enough training, he ordered him to relate one of the five "venoms" to defeat the other four. <br /> <br /> I can't work enough about the choreography or the camera. A fine film in its own right and probably one of the best martial arts movies ever made. A classic !!
