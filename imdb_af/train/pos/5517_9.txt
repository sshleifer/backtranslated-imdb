Che: Part 1 was a fascinating experiment that not only told a very interesting story, but also tried to do something different with the "biopic" genre. The second part is the excellent culmination of this experiment. <br /> <br /> This movie offers both of the same characteristics of the first, from the extraordinary performances (especially from Benicio del Toro) to Steven Soderbergh's brilliant direction, without his intention to break with the conventional rules of the biopics. That's what I admire of Soderbergh's experiments ... they always try to do something different and unusual, and they succeed most of the times. <br /> <br /> The final message of this movie is perfect, and it includes everything we have been told about Che Guervara's life. The only failure I found at Che: Part Two is that some parts felt slightly irrelevant. <br /> <br /> In summary, I give Che: Part Two a very enthusiastic recommendation because, First of all, it is a brave and fascinating expert to challenge the spectator and let us think.
