This movie is a pretty entertaining horror-anthology movie (in the sense of Tales from the Crypt) written by Robert Bloch (author of Psycho). It's great fun for horror fans and has an excellent role. The film must also be required for Doctor Wie fans since Jon Pertwee (the third Doctor) has a wonderful role as a rude and petty horror star!
