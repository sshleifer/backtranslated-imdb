Well, the recent history of Star Trek wasn't good. The next generation has faded in its last few seasons, DS9 has remained freely where no one has lived before, and Voyager has started very badly and has never really fulfilled its promise. So, when they announced a new Star Trek series, I didn't have high expectations. And the first episode, Broken Bow, had some problems. But in general, it was solid Trek material and a good skirt. <br /> <br /> I'll get the nits out of the way. The opening theme is boring and I don't look to sit down regularly, but that's what remote operators are. What was really bad was the completely free lotion rubbing scene my wife drove out of the room. They have to cut that nonsense. <br /> <br /> But the plot was strong and moving well together. The characters, though new, look well-rounded and not always what you would expect. The Vulcans are obviously much different than previously presented, with a slightly dishonest theme. I especially loved the linguist, who is the first Star Trek character not to be proud of the face of death, but rather to do with her phobias and fears. They apparently remain Trek Lore, which was a major issue in the previous series, although they have enough time to bring things like screenshots, the immediate invention of technology that can solve anything and the inevitable abundance of time travel stories. Anyone want to start a swimming pool for how long before Borg comes up? <br /> <br /> All in all, the range has enormous potential. They see the universe with fresh eyes. We have the chance to learn how things like them were in the later series. How did the Klingons go from just offensive to war? How did we meet the Romulans? How has the Federation formed and who has brought the Earth into control? Why is the first directive so important? If they address these things, rather than spraying out time series appointments, it will be an interesting series. <br /> <br /> My favorite line: Zephram Cochran says "where no one has gone before" (not "nobody")
