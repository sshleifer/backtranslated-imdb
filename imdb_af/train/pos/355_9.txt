I, like many horror fans, have been running with the same huge banking cost Hollywood remakes and MTV high school shooters for the past 20 years. Here is finally an original horror genre movie that flashes all the right boxes. <br /> <br /> You want a nice actress, you want vampires, you want cool weapons, you want cool vehicles and you want blood. Much of it, with the bucket load - you got it. <br /> <br /> With excellent combat choreography and a supporting role of the Hammer Horror scream queen, Stephanie Beacham herself, it's really great stuff. <br /> <br /> Despite the low budget, using the 35mm stock option and adding quality CG effects, director James Eaves has created something that feels much bigger. <br /> <br /> A must-have for old school-goers.
