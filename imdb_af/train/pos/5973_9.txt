It's a big, ridiculous horror movie that captures the essence of the mid to late 80's obsession with how evil metal music was supposed to be. I remember freaking with metal bones when I was a kid. It didn't help me to find a desolate grave in my hometown cemetery when I was ten. It seems that this strange child has dug old bodies and used their legs in a strange sacrifice to satan. Perhaps things have scared me off metal for a while, but I love it now, as a 24-year-old. <br /> <br /> I bought this DVD for $ 6 and I expected to suck it because of the lame cover, but to my surprise it certainly did. It's all about the extreme demonic power of metal. And you need to love a scene where a guitar loader shoots and evaporates in the crowd. This movie is great, if you like 80's metal and bad movies, this one is for you. 9/10!
