It's hard for me to award the "fair" number of stars to this movie, but I settled on 8 because of its high production values ​​and what was an innovative approach to the war film in 1968. Also remember that I haven't seen it since 1969. But it made a strong impression. <br /> <br /> The Long Day's Dying must be one of the brightest antiwar movies ever made. It merely achieved this by portraying the events of a handful of soldiers in North-West Europe in 1944-45 extremely realistically. No one movie for this one was at the level of the infantry group, waging war with so much cruel details, and all in a cold dishonest way that made the actions speak for themselves. There is no preaching, no sentimentality, no comic relief, no complicated scenarios. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there is no subtlety either. Partly due to their situation - trying to stay alive - the characters like flat, well-known clichés occur. As 'entertainment', the movie doesn't make it, though clearly not meant to "entertain." It was meant to hit you over the misery and horror of World War II and the modern war in general. It was twenty years before Plato and thirty for Private Ryan, who are both much more "viewable" movies. Here are the flat and generally unpleasant characters, the lack of a real plot and the realistically unpleasant images (including what may be the first scenes in theater history) making the movie difficult to go through, though it is only 95 minutes. <br /> <br /> So, 10 stars for production and realism, 4 stars for the feeling you will have when it's over, a bonus star to have his heart in the right place. Average: 8. <br /> <br /> Like the song by Carl Foreman's underestimated "The Victors", an equally cunning but more interesting and thoughtful movie, the Long Day's Dying doesn't look like DVD. Why not? Both films have been on the cable several times.
