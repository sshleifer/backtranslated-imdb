Romantic comedy is not the right way to describe how to lose friends and alienate people. The underlying romance in the plot is mostly displaced by a much more interesting "staircase to wealth" story. Although the central line of the story is slightly rushed, it has a feeling in several screenshots; to get rid of the "nitty gritty", focusing on the key relationships that make "office politics" and use almost irrelevant scenes, which are purely used for the comic effect. Yet it works so well, especially with Pegg in the front seat. The film is ultimately clever and plays the transatlantic relationship of Pegg shares with its co-stars and mixes the cross between the high and low-life society fairly well and refreshingly in a storyline that is somewhat predictable of a unique journey. The various characters in the film are well presented, and decisive is definitely a plus on the film. Both the relationships between Pegg and Huston and the "love-hate" relationship between Pegg and Dunst work so well in a story that is for a better word, charming. Even Fox, whose main asset is of course sex appeal, seems to be shocking, is quite a dark character and acts as a bimbo role. One of these films where every little detail pays homage to a great piece of work. From transsexual strippers to an incredible soundtrack, it all goes well with what can only be described as clever comedy.
