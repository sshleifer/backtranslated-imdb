This is a simple old haunting ghost story. I showed it to my friends of mine in my movie club, and they've passed it to the end of the game! No blood or gore - just good old-fashioned tension. It starts from the beginning and builds and builds. The end is a real twist that caught me unnecessarily. <br /> <br /> Well directed and well done. It is also a "period piece" - added to the atmosphere in the 1920s. <br /> <br /> I was so impressed. I got the book by Susan Hill from Amazon. The movie follows the book very closely. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that this is not readily available on DVD. My copy is VHS. This with "Haunted" is probably two of the best Ghost Stories I've ever had. What just shows to show that a little bit of creativity is in your face, a day!
