The movie is just nice .... maybe more fun for those who were young and fans of "The Ramones" around the time the movie was made. I watched the movie over and over, by myself and friends, and it's still fresh and funny. With the risk of being too serious, the concept of being a large group is a timeless one. High school students bored with the drunkenness of some classes are just as timeless. <br /> <br /> And the movie has some gem / scenes ..... references to how our "permanent record" in high school will follow us through life. (I assure you that I was off high school for a few years and it does not follow me) ..... the famous "static" rule ("I get static" ..... "Not as much as what you're going to get ", as Principal Togar approaches). The school board member who is so distant is attended by nurses. The Nazi Hall Monitors love a "body search" ...... Principals Togar announcing: "I give you the final solution", and burn the Ramones records (note: records were what came for CDs) ... And of course, Joey Ramone remarked: "Things probably changed since we were kicked off high school," followed by Togar, asking: "Do you know parents are Ramone?" <br /> <br /> Only one piece of advice ..... don't look up where the stars are now ..... Joey Ramone unfortunately died young. Dey Young, who was a big hottie in the movie, reminds us all today. .... PJ Soles' career has never progressed as we expected ... Marla Rosenfield, as one of the other students, apparently appears only in this film (one of my male friends dies about her every time we watch the movie, although I pretend her performance was more than adequate and had more teenage roles. And, does anyone know what happened to DJ Don Steele? <br /> <br /> So, look and enjoy ..... don't think .... just FUN!
