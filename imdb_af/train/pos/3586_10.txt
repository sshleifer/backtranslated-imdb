I only saw it when it performed more than ten years ago. I saw it again today and it still had a huge impact on me. She fought alone about a girl, Caitlin (played by Tiffani Thiessen), raped by Jace (played by David Lipper), a classmate who hurt girls. Caitlin is in a popular high school, but if she is raped, the rape against her, led by Ethan (played by Brian Austin Green) becomes. <br /> <br /> This movie chronicles Caitlin's struggle against a whole town, including a high school that essentially defines athletes the social environment so they get away with whatever they want. <br /> <br /> Thiessen and Green are the best artists, and there is real chemistry between the two of them throughout the film. All the actors in this movie, inspired by real-life events, did a good job. She fought alone, but the essence of what it was like to be in high school (at least in 1995), and with its self-esteem and reputation at stake. Recommended. 10/10
