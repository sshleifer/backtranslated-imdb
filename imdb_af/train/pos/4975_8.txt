It's been a long time since God saw it. Probably about 18 years ago? <br /> <br /> The film tells us (children) everything about human blood and the circulatory system. Very professionally crafted - Disney style animation, plus human actors - directed by Frank Capra for the sake of sin! <br /> <br /> Type of leftover. I wonder if the very high production value is worth the value of a film strip of information about the human body? But the boy will teach the children who see it: even now I can clearly remember that Dr. Baxter is challenged by Hemo himself to name which common material looks most like human blood, after which the doctor immediately answers 'seawater'.
