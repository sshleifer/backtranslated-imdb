I had the privilege to see a preview years ago, and outside the theater I was confronted with a camera team from a local TV station looking for commentary on the film. At that time, the only words that escaped my mouth were "Awesome. Just awesome." I like to think that I can express myself a little better, but at the time I was somewhat impossible to do. <br /> <br /> The story is intriguing and thought-provoking, and the play is for the first time the principals of all. This film was the first one Terry Gilliam directed that he had no hand in the writing credit. Back with Universal after his long, tough battle with "Brazil", Terry achieved what he wanted most; the "final cut". Terry is a master of art, and every shot is like a nicely designed painting carefully built with determination and belief. It is just justice that such an individual should be indifferent in his efforts to convey a concept. Unfortunately, there are still restrictions in such arrangements. <br /> <br /> The Universal Collector's Edition DVD of this movie is simply amazing, although most of the bonus features are not listed on the box. It includes a director / producer audio commentary and an informative and extremely interesting 90 minute documentary on making the movie called "The Hamster Factor and Other Tales of 12 Monkeys". It tells of a few creative pitfalls in movie viewing, including a test of mettle when previews are poorly tested, hitting the team with feelings of confidence and despair. Fortunately, we decided to change the film very little and make it a great success. <br /> <br />
