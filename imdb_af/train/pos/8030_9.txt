It was another great Tom Berenger movie. But some people are right, it was like another SGT BARNES character, but it was pretty cute. Tom Berenger played a big sniper in the jungles of Panama! Billy Zane was initially like Cpl Upham from Private Ryan, but then he got a little more aggressive! Sniper was awsome and action buffs should watch it. I remind you it wouldn't be as much action as a right action flick .. I did this one on DVD too and it's excellent!
