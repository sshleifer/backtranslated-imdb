This show is great! I was a fan since it premiered, and it just keeps me watching ... I've seen some terrible things here, I wish I didn't, BUT, it really shows you how addiction affects everyone, not just the addict. You can see all kinds of addictions, from drugs and alcohol to the addict, or the addict addict. And actually it is very sad to see some of the well-known faces that have come through. We saw full-fledged musicians, an NBA player, and even young people, who really needed the help. And since they started with some successes, it was also fantastic. Now you can see how long it is after their ep is broadcast. If you have not checked this one, please do so. It's on A&E, and it's great! The new eps is on Sunday nights at 10:00 am EST, if I remember correctly ... so set your TiVo!
