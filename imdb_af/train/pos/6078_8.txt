I was especially delighted that Othello himself was in the darkness of the movie and Desdemona almost never had fair hair. The role-play also played very well, and I kept the script as Shakespeare's original text so faithful. But I have to say some scenes are too erotic for such a character as Desdemona. I always thought she was very modest, and that's why it's not proper to show her in bed with Cassio - though it only happens in Othello's imagination. Initially, I was a little surprised, even that a love story between Othello and Desdemona was so openly shown. But as a whole, I liked the movie and especially Desdemona crying in the dying scene.
