I first heard of this movie about 20 years ago when I was a high school child (!) It just happened that one day I was going through the encyclopaedia in the classroom and under the entry for movies (or cinema, I don't remember, were several stills for different movies from mainstream to experimental, and one of those shown on the page was a silence for OffOn. It made me really interesting, as it most often displayed on the page (it was a silence from the scene of the scene with other elements on it). About 18 or so years later, the public library where I live, the entire 4-DVD series "Treasures of American Film Archives" was released by the National Film Preservation Foundation available for completion. When I read the notes on the DVD cases for the set, I was quite pleasantly surprised to see that OffOn was on one of the slides. After all these years I could finally see the movie! After looking at it, it wasn't a bit I expected it to be (it tended to be a more organic film, not a bad thing, but I expected it to have a more electronic aesthetic ), but it was still an impressive film, IMHO, taking into account the techniques Scott Bartlett used to make the film, including the handshake of the film itself, and the use of video equipment for some of the films' plays (filmed from a video monitor), giving it more Disturbed, loose appearance. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong, the techniques used in this movie were pretty groundbreaking for 1972. That's why it's still one of my favorite short / experimental movies, and a creative inspiration for me too ...
