Human Tornado (1976) is in many ways a better movie than its predecessor. The director knew what he had to work for and made provision for Rudy Ray Moore's limitations as an actor. It is a fun movie that is more technically sound and performed. The artists don't take themselves too seriously and it seems that this time around everyone is joking and going with the flow. Rudy Ray Moore looks more relaxed in front of the camera and not as stiff as he was in Dolemite. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the movie and I highly recommend it. Just like his first movie, it is focused on a particular audience (I'm very sure that Mr. Moore has expanded his audience at this stage in his career). Check it out! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
