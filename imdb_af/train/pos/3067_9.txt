What a surprising treat to come over late television. If I had just read a short summary on a television recording before I saw the movie, I would have passed. The idea of ​​a movie about a hit-man-see-a-shrinking-like-the-bag-and-fall-in-love .... sounds like it soon. But the movie works. From the beginning the film is clear that the man wears a weight on his shoulders before even saying a word. The look and feel of the movie is perfect. dark, but not unnecessary. <br /> <br /> Apart from the hit family aspect that offers a touch of surrealism, Macy's character touches on his marriage and his father's control. Macy shows a repressed sadness, and his bedtime conversations with his young son are wonderful. The young boy shows theater skills far beyond his years, and the interaction between father and son is so natural, personal and loving. <br /> <br /> It's one of the best movies I've seen for a while. , and I can't believe I accidentally got it over late night television.
