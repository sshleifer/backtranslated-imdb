William Powell is a doctor who deals with a murder and an ex-wife in "The Ex-Mrs. Bradford," which also starred Jean Arthur, Eric Blore and James Gleason. It seems that Powell has chemistry with just about any woman he's been teaming with. Although he and Myrna Loy were the perfect couple, the actor made some other "Thin Man" movies, one with Ginger Rogers and this one with Arthur, both very good effect. <br /> <br /> Somehow One never gets tired of seeing Powell as a witty, deboner professional, and "The Ex-Mrs Bradford" is no exception. The old lady. B has Mr. B served with a retirement subpoena and then moved back to help him solve a mystery that she had dragged him. And that's not the first time she did it! It seems like there was a Bradford movie before this one or that it was the first of a series of movies. Mr. B complains that his mystery writer is constantly bringing him into business. This time, a jockey riding the beloved horse in a raid falls secretly from the horse and dies before the finish line. <br /> <br /> The solution to the issue is a bit strange, but it is beyond the reach. The point is the banter between the couple and the interference of the former lady. B. Jean Arthur is much more glamorous in her role and very funny. But with an actress coming out as well as Arthur, humor seems deliberate rather than feathers. I suspect the writer had something else in mind - says the shaky side of Carole Lombard. When Arthur heard that the police had arrived, she said, "Oh, it's probably about my interview. I waited for the police to take a hand." It's more of a Powell's rib rather than a serious statement. It still works well, and it shows how a good actress can share herself. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth watching, as William Powell and Jean Arthur were always.
