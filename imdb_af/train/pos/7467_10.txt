David Aames is a rich, good guy living in New York City. When his "dear friend" Julie Gianni gets very jealous after David falls for Spanish beauty Sofia, she gets David in her car and tells him he is the only man she loves and wants to be. But as he falls in love with Sofia, she decides to commit suicide with David in the car with her by driving a bridge. David survives the accident, but is faced with a disfigured face. He is then charged with the murder of July. The thing is, David does not know what is real and what is not as he likes these strange dreams. (Most of them are actually nightmares.) And flashbacks, some of which just don't make sense. Everything will come back to him soon, though he begins to find out the truth. <br /> <br /> Well, there is an all-star cast here, including Tom Cruise, Pen√©lope Cruz, Cameron Diaz, Kurt Russell, Jason Lee and Noah Taylor who all give good performances in the movie. In the movie they all expressed different things about it, characters such as happiness, sadness, evil, etc. Really good. There is also a comedy in the movie by Steven Spielberg. <br /> <br /> Vanilla Sky is a well-made, different, interesting and original movie that will make you talk about it much after it's finished. It's not just a thrill, but it's a real psychological thriller. The trailer for the movie is really good, but the movie is so different than it can be made possible. It is very well aimed and there were also some very good scenes here. All in all, a pleasant movie that also really gets attention. They make sure they are many: "Are they dead recently or not who is dead?"
