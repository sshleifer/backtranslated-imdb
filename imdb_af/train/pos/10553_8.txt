... if that ;-) What would happen if Terry Gilliam and Douglas Adams worked on one movie together? This movie starts with a touch of Brazil ... when the story moves straight into the twilight zone at some point ... nothing new but nothing ... and nothing is nice! When Dave and Andrew start exploring their new environment, the movie is really enjoyable ... reflective heads? Well ... yes ;-) <br /> Anyway ... this movie was, imho, the biggest surprise this year's FantasyFilmFest ... Just like in Cube and Cypher Natali this one has a minimalist, strange but very special design, which makes it difficult to find the place of the story or its time ... timelessly somehow ...
