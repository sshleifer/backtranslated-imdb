"The Fourth Man" (The Fourth Man, 1984) is considered one of the best European piggo thrillers of the eighties. This latest work by Dutch director Paul Verhoeven in his homeland before moving to Hollywood to become a big star with movies like "Total Recall", "Basic Instinct" and "Starship Troopers" is about a psychopathic and disillusioned author (Jeroen Krabbe) goes to the sea to recover. There he meets a mysterious femme fatale (Renee Soultendieck) and begins a fatal love affair with her. He is addicted to her with heart and soul and finds out that her three previous men all died with mysterious circumstances. <br /> <br /> "The fourth man" is heavily influenced by the old Hollywood movie noire and the psychic vibrators of Alfred Hitchcock and Orson Wells. It takes a lot of time to create a dark and pleasant atmosphere, and a few moments of extreme graphics have the right impact to push the story straight ahead. The tension is sometimes unbearable and sometimes reminds of the works of Italian cult director Dario Argento. <br /> <br /> The film is also outstanding, especially Krabbe's performance as a mentally disturbed writer who opened the doors to his international film career ("The Living Daylights", "The Fugitive"). If you get the opportunity to watch this brilliant psycho thriller on TV, video or DVD, don't miss out!
