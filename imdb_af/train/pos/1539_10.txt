I saw it at the Mill Valley Film Festival. Hard to believe, Mrs. Blom's director's debut, it's beautiful and executed. Great characters can be from an Anne Tyler novel, ie they are layered with storytelling and potential future, there are no false notes, surprising bursts of humor amidst self-inflicted anxiety and very real, if not, sprawling dilemmas. If you have seen "the best of youth", you will recognize how well the characters are drawn by small moments, even if the story moves fast. I really hope it is distributed in the US. I live in a fairly sophisticated movie market, but we rarely get Swedish movies of any kind.
