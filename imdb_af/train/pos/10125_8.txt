This movie is the first of Miike's Triad Society Trilogy, and the trilogy kicks off well. The movies in the trilogy are only thematically linked, and these themes are actually clear in all his films, if you look close enough. Shinjuku Triad Society is about a policeman trying to prevent his child's brother from engaging in a bit of extreme gang of outsiders and battling their way to Tokyo's yakuza. The child's brother is a lawyer, and the triad gang is becoming increasingly needed as the film progresses. The film takes place in a very difficult environment and is therefore very violent and difficult. Miike has done worse, but as it is a serious movie, it becomes very difficult. As usual, there are also many distorted sex, mostly homosexual in this one. The movie is a typical gangster movie in many ways, but with a good ride and real greed. If you only saw Miikes out-of-the-box movies (Ichi the killer, Fudoh, and so on), it's worth finding out, as it's a compromise between his aggressive top-style in that movies and his more serious , as seen in the other films of the trilogy. And as always at Miike, there are at least two scenes in this that you will never forget (see it and determine which one for yourself). <br /> <br /> 8/10
