Since the voice average was pretty low and the clerk in the video store thought it was "just OK", I didn't have much expectations for renting this movie. <br /> <br /> But unlike the above, I really enjoyed it. It's a beautiful movie. It didn't need to grow on me, I enjoyed it from the beginning. Mel Brooks gives a good performance as the main character, I think somewhat different from his usual persona in his movies. <br /> <br /> There are not many knockout jokes or anything, but there are some hilarious scenes. And generally it is a very enjoyable and very easy to watch movie. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
