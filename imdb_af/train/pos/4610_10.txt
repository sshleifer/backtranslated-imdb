On a winter day, December 28, 1986, two bored 14-year-olds rent a movie. "Hmmmm, Police Story, looks interesting", "who is this Jackie Chan?", "Never heard of him". Two hours later, after watching the movie, we wanted to know more. 16 years later (and out of the pocket of JC movie collection!) The movie still grabs me like no other. Okay, maybe I have a soft spot for it because it was my "first" (Cannonball Run doesn't count!) JC movie, but it's an excellent movie. It has all the classic JC elements, Action, Humor, Action, Heart and Action! Some comments say it's dated, it's made in 1985, of course it's dated! But then Jaws, Casablanca, Singin 'in the rain and the Godfather !!!!!! Without movies like Police Story, where would Hollywood action be today? PS sets standards, many are stolen for use in other movies. To really appreciate it, you should see it in widescreen, you miss so much of the movie (yes, it really falls off the bus around!). If you don't have one yet, watch this movie now !! <br /> <br />
