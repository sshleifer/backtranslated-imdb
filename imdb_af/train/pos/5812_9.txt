Moonwalker is probably not the movie to see if you're not a Michael Jackson fan. I'm a big fan and enjoy the majority of the movie, the end wasn't great, but the first 50 or so minutes were - if you're a fan. <br /> <br /> I personally believe the first 50 minutes are repeatable many times over. The dance in each video is breathtaking, the music is great to listen to and entertain the dialogue. <br /> <br /> It includes many of his best videos of Bad and Shreds from his previous videos. It also includes some live concert material. <br /> <br /> If you're a big fan of Michael Jackson, it's a must, if you're not a fan, don't like Michael Jackson. <br /> <br /> 9/10
