During this annual pavement sale, I ran into the local video store over this movie. While scanning thousands of videos, hoping to buy some cartoon movies, I got this movie. I read the back of the movie and knew it was the hand of God at work for me to buy this movie. You see, I have a brother or sister group of three foster children (who will soon be adopted) living with my family. Immediately my foster children made a connection with the three children in the film. The movie helped them understand their own circumstances better. For the first time, the eldest of the brothers and sisters (7-year-old / female) decided to open up a little about her past and the trauma she experienced. She fought the whole trust problem. It's also the first time I've seen her cry. After watching the movie, I asked her what it meant to a child being adopted. She replied, "It means being happy." A must see for families who promote and consider children. It certainly opened up the rules of communication with us.
