I'll have to say it's the first quality romantic comedy I've ever seen. it had depth and although you knew from the beginning who would end up together, there was still desire and anticipation. the idea that they might not get together ... it is an indie movie. This movie is well written, directed and performed. The dance on the side of the road scene was wonderful.
