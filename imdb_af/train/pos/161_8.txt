This silly movie is really fun for the younger audiences. His heroes are a few dud detectives whose sophomoric attitudes lead them to some very stupid roads. If you pursue the great murder case, you will see that these detectives are going to solve the crime every time. No nudity, but many sexual implications, slapstick silliness ... all that adolescents go. Low budget but very entertaining. Certain cult classic potential.
