This is what the musical genre was made of. Humor, talent, romance and action all rolled into one. <br /> <br /> Frank Sinatra was wonderful. Nothing else needs to be said. Marlon Brando, although not a singer, won the hearts of many with his portrayal of Sky Masterson. The fact that he couldn't sing his character. The ladies in the movie were good, but the men in the movie definitely stole the show. <br /> <br /> It's a true classic that can be appreciated at any age. It connects to all audiences and lets you smile and laugh. <br /> <br /> Definitely a movie to watch and enjoy!
