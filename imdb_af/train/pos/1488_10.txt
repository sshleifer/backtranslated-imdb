It's the one movie to see if you're getting married or a couple. The film portrays a couple in Italy and deals with such difficult topics as abortion, infidelity, juggling and family. <br /> <br /> The so-called "culture of death" we are experiencing today is terrible and this movie will surely make you think. <br /> <br /> a must see. I hope it is spread as it should. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to the role and director. <br /> <br /> Two thumbs and a 10-star rating from me!
