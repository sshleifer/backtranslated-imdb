Paulie sounds like the most saccharin, lachrymose and sentimental rubbish you can ever find, but it's actually much better than you'd expect. The roof of the plot can easily set the tone for the whole film, but in most other departments the film is charming. <br /> <br /> If you're wondering, Paulie is a parrot. Paulie becomes her best friend for a little girl with speech problems and goes with her everywhere. He even sits on her shoulder during speech therapy lessons, and eventually becomes a super-intelligent speaker himself. However, Paulie is sent by the girl's mother and he spends the rest of the movie trying to get from NYC to LA to reunite with her. <br /> <br /> So why does this terribly sounding movie pass fairly well? First, it boasts interesting and impressive animatronic effects. Secondly (and much more significant), it has the courage to embrace his ridiculous point of departure and tells a real moving, often humorous story without worrying too much about the obvious errors in the storyline. Third, it has several surprisingly strong performances, including Jay Mohr as a fiery rascal, Gena Rowlands as a good old lady, and Cheech Marin (yes, the dope-smoking Cheech Marin!) As a musical immigrant. It may not be a classic, but Paulie is great fun for kids of all ages.
