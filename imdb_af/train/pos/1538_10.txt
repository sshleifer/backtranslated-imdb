This is the best movie I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> Maybe it's because I live just a few miles from the town, where the story takes place, and I know how things work out in this area in Sweden. The movie tells the truth, believe me! It criticizes and respects the lifestyle of Dalarna and the producer wants people who watch the movie to be more open-minded and care for your closest friends and family. <br /> <br /> But if you live in another small town anywhere in Sweden (or another country) you will probably also recognize a lot of this movie. <br /> <br /> Thank you Maria Blom!
