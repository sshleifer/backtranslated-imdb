I never really knew who Robert Wuhl was before I saw it. But after I saw it, I realized how funny he was. These HBO special features he taught "American history" to the University of New York's film students and the man was just phenomenal. He has almost every major historical event not only in the US but also some other parts of the world. This documentary / comedy was a great satire who asked me if I was truly infallible, true truth. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed how Mr. Wuhl has managed to mix useful information with good comedy and make learning much more exciting. I would recommend it to anyone interested in history and willing to ask what his / her beliefs are.
