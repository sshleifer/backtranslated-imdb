SPOILERS ALERT <br /> <br /> Homeward Bound: The incredible journey is an important movie from my life, as it is the first movie I remember seeing in the theater of my hometown as a 4-year-old scamp . The story is based on the Sheila Burnford novel, which is why it is not possible to write this one as a brainless Lassie clone. <br /> <br /> The basic story: Two dogs and a cat live happily in the Seaver family when the new man gets to work with the mother of the three children and they have to move temporarily into inner San Francisco while the animals are being sent to a ranch to stay for a few months. The ties between the animals and the kids they look for are especially strong, and Shadow the golden retriever and Sassy the Himalayan cat are sad as the children are. Although the young and happy American Bulldog, known as Chance, is a little less worried and somewhat cynical (thanks to his voice over, declaring that he is leaving as a puppy, picked up after an animal shelter and door the family is bought), although she grows as a character during the story much of the key storytelling. <br /> <br /> The three pets escape from the farm and walk into the wide and dangerous wilderness (fantastic wilderness settings), fueled by Shadow's instincts of direction. They encounter various hazards along the way, hoping to make it home, while the family and farm hosts are suddenly worried about the disappearance of animals. There are funny moments throughout, a great dialogue between the three animals and hilarious lines (see - memorable quotes), and a pleasant comrade who grows between the main characters in the course of the storytelling, underlined by moments of sadness (like when Sassy Its arrogance to try to cross a river without getting wet, causing it to fall into the river and washing a waterfall, leaves a moment of loss deeply felt by the viewers). <br /> <br /> Somehow, I can't see the inclusion of the girl's salvation in the desert contributing to the story and the journey they take. Somehow it looks like it's a little unnecessary as part of the story. <br /> <br /> The end moves the game higher than shade in a pit into a well and hurts its leg, finds it hard to get out and gives up, exhausted, followed by Chance who joins with him climb to persuade him to get out, tell him how important he is to him and how he pushed them so far that he should not throw it away so easily. <br /> <br /> The way in which this scene (brilliantly done) is not closed, leaves an ambiguity in the final scene when Chance and Sassy return home, but Shadow is nowhere to be seen. Then it seems like everything is lost, he appears slowly, and is reunited with the family. Chance's conclusion at the end speaks of the comrade who developed between him and his fellow travelers on the journey and the realization of which house really is of his long journey to get there, leaves a fine epilogue to prove how much his character grown, but also how the other two have. Hang on for a moment, I think I'm going to cry ... Anyway, I didn't read Sheila Burnford's book, so I don't pretend to know where the differences between book and film are. lie. But this is a movie that the whole family can watch, and while the tots of the talking animals will keep, older viewers will understand the plot line better (as I found when I watched the movie again after a few years) without seeing it). This movie is a masterpiece in the cinema, and I suggest that if you haven't seen it, you go out and get it! <br /> <br /> Please avoid the successor (see my review for Homeward Bound II!)
