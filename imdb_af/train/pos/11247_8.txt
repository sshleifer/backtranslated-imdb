I only saw the movie when it landed on American cable for a year after it came out. It blew my copy, I was only 16 and it was the first new golf music I heard, a strictly complete, classic child who grew up. The music fascinated me, just like Hazel O'Connor's amazing appearance and charismatic vocal performances, and Phil Daniels's tough but soft Cockney driver just stole my heart. But I think my favorite character was Jonathan Pryce's coveted scissors. He was so out of place in the band and so innocent and pathetic, he only begged for sympathy. Favorite scenes, the show when the lights went out, and the love scene on the train. <br /> <br /> Well, so the movie is not the Rose! But it was really great for its limited budget and for the portrayal of Britain of the early 80's, which exploded with rebellious youth, seeking a way out of the dolle queue. I only went to Britain a few years later and found that the movie was very reflective of the atmosphere I found when I was there. <br /> <br /> If you get a chance, see it. It's a great movie, with some great performances, and the music will blow you away. <br /> <br />
