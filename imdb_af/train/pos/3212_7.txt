I watched this movie a second time trying to figure out why it wasn't as successful (commercial or artistic) as it should have been, and discovered considerable artistic merit - which would eventually be its commercial withdrawal. /> <br /> First of all, this movie is trying "serious" science fiction, social commentary, more than action adventure. There's action in it, but it's not really what it's about. If you focus on it, you will end up with (as indicated by others) a bad "Aliens" clone. But that's not what it's about. <br /> <br /> The movie is really about Todd's (Kurt Russell) transformation from man to nearby machine and back to man (mostly * back *). But because it doesn't give you a typical Glib Hollywood style answer, Kurt Russell has to make this transformation without speaking, and largely without broad expressions. And he really does a wonderful job - it can take two views to appreciate it. <br /> <br /> The surrounding "social logic" is flawed and it is never adequately explained whether Todd's ability to hold his own against an army of presumably superior troops comes from his experience in the battlefield or his newly-found humanity or what, but the movie is still a great showcase for Russell's (easy to underestimate) talent.
