I originally reviewed this movie on Amazon about 6 or 7 years ago and exploded it. I believe I called it "miserable" and a "turkey". Well, according to most standards, it's still a turkey. It has virtually no production values, which little plot is almost no sense and the acting is at the level of a third-degree game. That said, it has really grown over the years as a kind of camp classic. In fact, all Todd Sheets directors had this effect. They are almost like Ed Wood in that respect: look them over and over and choose the whistles, continuity errors (same zombie, two different places!) And other mistakes. <br /> <br /> I'll say it: Pages are a very good guy, and while it's one of its first productions, it's not that good, it got better. And I have to add that the only fair actor / actress in the movie is Kasey Rousch, although I can be biased as I attended her school.
