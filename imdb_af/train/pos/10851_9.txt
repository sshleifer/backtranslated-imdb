I found 'More Crazy' to be wonderfully entertaining, and not just for those of us who lived in the early '60s, early' 70s rock. My 15 year old daughter watches it with me every time I break out of the DVD (don't worry, it's just three times) and she also loves. <br /> <br /> It is a very loving, gripping and hilarious nod to the era, and every actor strikes his / her notes with perfection. This was my first introduction to Bill Nighy and I am delighted that she has been paying more attention to 'Love Actually' in a similar turn. Bruce Robinson was incredible like Brian, who made real life that could be a caricature of the drug-damaged rocker stereotype. It was interesting to see that Robinson made another name for himself as a writer. <br /> <br /> I live in Sherman Oaks, California, and after the first time I saw the movie when I was Billy Connolly at the local mall (he lived here at the time) and told him it was one of my five favorite movies of all time. He invited me to sit with him at the Koshof and we have been discussing the movie for some time. We even talked about the idea of ​​an American-oriented remake before declining wisely. Why are you messing with the original? <br /> <br /> My only issue with 'Still Crazy' is that it wasn't very popular in theaters and too many people missed out on a wonderful experience.
