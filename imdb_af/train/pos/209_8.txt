Walter Matthau and George Burns work just as well. The acidity of Willy with the confused amnesic Al is a mixture made in heaven. The scene when they meet again in Willy's apartment is a gem and the final scene makes the movie perfect. Walter Matthau gives an excellent performance as the irascible semi-retired comedian, just as he can, the intonation in the voice and the exaggerated drama along with his general misunderstanding of what constitutes a great characterization. George Burns timing is legendary and nowhere was it better than in this movie, but its calm aplomb with desert dry responses is unforgettable. Watch the scene near the end Al and his daughter ask something from the Spanish caretaker, and Al's response - priceless.
