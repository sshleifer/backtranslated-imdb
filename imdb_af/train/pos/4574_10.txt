Let me first say that I have cerebral palsy and I went into this film to compensate for the main performance. I half convinced the theater that they would cast an actor with cerebral palsy, even though I knew it wasn't. The performances were generally excellent, with a special nod to Brenda Fricker and Hugh O'Conner (I believe it is his name) as young Christy Brown. Christy is talented, brash, arrogant, sometimes vulgar and petulant - in other words, human. This movie, along with Gaby: A True Story and the documentary King Gimp, are excellent portrayals of life with CP. In no way a complete portrait, but fine examples of people with disabilities. Most recommended.
