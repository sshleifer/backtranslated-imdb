Damn straight ..... this show was kicking ass back in the day and continuing to cartoons today. I can't wait to find some of the DVDs to share with my old man and see the same glitter in his eyes. I already introduced him to Voltron (the five lions one, not the 15 vehicles) and I laughed my head one day when he told me: Dad. You've probably watched some great cartoons when you were a kid !! "How cool is it. <br /> <br /> Come on Hollywood, don't repulse this one and give it a lively action effort. Can't be worse if Spiderman was 3 ... Man o man ... 2007 was quite nice for summer movies. <br /> <br /> OK, I'll now shuddup <br /> <br /> Cheers
