This movie was awesome and even with a less convincing end, it's still worth seeing. The film starts when Claudette Colbert is about to marry Robert Ryan. When the minister asks if anyone has any objections, a man jumps up and announces that Colbert cannot marry because she is already married !! Colbert insists that this is not true, but when they investigate, they find that the Empire and many others remember her wedding and there is even a signed wedding license! Slowly it becomes clear that Claudette's thoughts are slipping and people around her seriously doubt her common sense. When the alleged first man is murdered, all evidence and suspicions fall on Colbert. <br /> <br /> The movie is an exciting mystery movie because what I've described so far is just the first half of the movie. . What follows is incredibly intelligent and engaging. Unfortunately, however, the conclusion is a bit of a deviation, as the guiding force behind all of this seems to be "right out of the left field" - and is astounded that it was so unexpected and impossible to guess based on The information on the viewer is given. Nonetheless, the film was so good, I can even write off the slack end. In particular, Robert Ryan did a good job as the "knuckle-busting" fiancee, but apart from him the other performances were also excellent.
