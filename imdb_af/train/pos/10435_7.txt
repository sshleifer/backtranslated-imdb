My watch came a little late, but I'm glad I both looked at this and the successor. It makes me compliment the creators of this movie to give such a pure and basic treatment to the idea of ​​romance ... and very marginally divide it from the idea of ​​relationships! Since much has been written about the movie, it is only appropriate to highlight some parts of the movie I personally loved. <br /> <br /> I think the point where Jesse and Celine phone calls to their respective friends was a very clever way to tell each other what they meant by means of a trip that didn't even extend for 24 hours do not have. The curiosity of two people who both thought the others had an infallible impact on the other was very cleverly handled ... <br /> <br /> On the plot front, it's not an easy task to make a romantic story not working, but it's not easy. <br /> <br /> I believe in romantic movies of such scents, the characters are not clearly designed, even in the writer's and director's minds. What the actors bring is what they become. Right or wrong, even the idea moves will find it difficult to justify ... to become the character, the life the actor gives, must go beyond the instructions and the story ... here both actors do just the right work! Kudos .. !!! And before sunset, another feather makes this one even more beautiful!
