Fear of a black hat is a hilarious spoof of Hip-Hop culture. It's just as funny as This is Spinal Tap, if it's not nicer. The actors are incredible and the documentary style is wonderful. Mark Christopher Lawrence is a tremendous talent that has to be featured in many more films. This movie is a true cult classic!
