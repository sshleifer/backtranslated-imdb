"Hundstage" is Seidl's first fictional film (formerly called great documentary programs as "love" or "models"). Seidl has been working on this project for over 3 years, but it only costs about 2 million dollars. The actors are very good, especially the non-professional actors who almost played themselves. The cinematography is also good. the whole movie is shockingly disturbing and some scenes may be too much for ordinary viewers. The movie shows a lot of sex and violence, but also that people are lonely and cannot communicate with each other. Ultimately, I must say that this is one of the best and most rewarding Austrian films in the past year. Please excuse me bad English. <br /> <br />
