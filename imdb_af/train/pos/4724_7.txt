Trapped: buried alive, we bring us to a newly opened resort, and will soon be near. <br /> <br /> We start with a man in gear that blows up to avoid the possibility of avalanches. Somehow, it doesn't make sense. Anyway, he is blowing away a particularly large one, if he watches the resort is open. Despite his best efforts, higher authority says his day is over. <br /> <br /> As everyone expects, a deluge will be hit. <br /> <br /> Look, I won't reveal anything else, all I can say is a B-channel movie designed for the family channel (which I just saw, and the fact that it doesn't advertising has, prove it is a B-movie), but it's definitely a good movie, but it's partly unreal. <br /> <br /> First, when people are buried by ice and snow, they are buried. not just detected by powder. Or, how about a CD for a screwdriver? It's not possible. And finally, what I can't stress enough is that an explosion can't stop an avalanche that is guaranteed. <br /> <br /> It is worthwhile to appreciate a rental or a TV view but not own it. 7/10. <br /> <br /> The movie is rated PG, but perhaps it should have received something slightly stronger. A boy almost loses his foot in an elevator, but his leg is cut around the ankle, a man is stolen by electricity and diesel and in the weight room people are dead. <br /> <br /> Enjoy.
