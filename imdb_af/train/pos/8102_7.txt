Things to come is a historical movie. Along with Metropolis (1927), it stands as one of the first major science fiction glasses. It is also one of the first doomsday movies. It is remarkable how the filmmakers predict the beginning of World War II within a year and even subtly the year it will end in the real world. But then the film of reality, which is a world devastated by the war (only substitute poison gas for nuclear weapons of course, did not exist in 1936). <br /> <br /> The last half hour of the movie is an incredible sight, making the groundbreaking use of models and carpet paintings - later stapling the science fiction genre. It is sad that Sci-Fi will be identified at its discretion with cheaply made b-movies, a stereotype that will not be broken until 2001: a Space Odyssey more than 30 years later. If they were holding onto the quality of the effects in this movie, things in Hollywood would have been very different. <br /> <br /> Raymond Massey and some of his fellow stars play various roles in this movie, to good effect. Massey plays a big "Doctor Who" role as a pilot of an advanced (1970s) civilization trying to rule over the population of a devastated country ruled by a simple soldier (a very effective show by Ralph Richardson). Eventually, the storyline covers 100 years. But this is a big problem with this movie. There is actually no coherent story. <br /> <br /> Perhaps in such an episodic movie - somewhat reminiscent of intolerance - it is difficult to have a conventional plot. but I felt that more of the material could be made and although the pictures in the last third of the picture are indeed stunning and the price of admission is worth, the plot is inconsistent and the movie itself ends just as it is become interesting. Perhaps the producers think of another future scientific innovation: a successor? <br /> <br /> Things to come are a movie that every serious science buff should see at least once. However, unlike Metropolis, it cannot carry repeated views.
