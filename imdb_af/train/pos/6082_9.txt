I always enjoyed Kenneth Branagh's versions of the Shakespeare classic, because he always does a very good job, but in this movie the one who is the whole movie is nothing but the "always-great actor" Laurence Fishburne no. . Surely he made some poor choices in movies, although he is a wonderful actor, but in this one we are really given the right Othello: the passion, the intensity of jealousy, as it gets stronger, with Fishburne's stuff pictured paranoia and beyond, we finally get a black othello! <br /> <br /> I don't think they could have picked a better Othello. Who else could have had the combination of sympathy / antipathy, love / hate, and not the fiery eyes ...? Branagh is good as always, but not at his peak, Ir√©ne Jacob's Desdemona is pretty good, but a little pale, while Laurence Fishburne really makes it a very interesting and enjoyable movie. Look at it.
