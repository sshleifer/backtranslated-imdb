Okay, like many other such films, came from a SNL shit. But Tim Meadows does a pretty fantastic job making a 3-minute one-dimensional character in a moderately viable comic movie character. He almost consistently drops drained-one liners with reasonable frequency, Billy Dee Williams is in there, though his Lando days are over and the whole thing is shot well. True, this is not a good art, but if you went to Wayne's world, you did something wrong. Enjoyable for what it is ......
