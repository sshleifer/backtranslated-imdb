It's hard to judge movies like this because you rate it on production or just fun? <br /> <br /> I saw this movie back in about 1988/89 or so when I was a boy and I'm sorry to say it has a lifelong fascination with ninjas. The plot is pretty bad and the acting is of course awful, but there is a certain mystique around the ninjas in this movie that creates a fairly good atmosphere. What matters is the battle scenes, while a 'small' sparce is really good. <br /> <br /> I must say it was better if I was a boy, and now I can see the bright points of incredible nonsense in the movie, but as a "beer art movie" I can't fault it It delivers and is much better than the "American Ninja" style mess that was cut out by hundreds in the 80's. of guys in black suits, but really not very good fighting scenes. <br /> <br /> In an interesting note, Dusty Nelson, the author and director of Sakura Killers, is another ninja movie under the Bonaire movie flag called "White Phantom" I have no idea if it's a successor of Sakura Killers would not be ", but the Sakura clan is once again a major feature, including the same logo and similar story only this time, including a White Ninja, has a small sense of atmosphere, but the battle scenes are even more Saving and being honest is pretty awful. <br /> <br /> So, if you're a martial arts fan then it's giving a blast to kill a few hours!
