RKO has had a reputation for making a nice slice of Americana. <br /> <br /> Anne Shirley (as Dawn O'Day) was in movies since being a toddler. By 1933 she was in limbo - played with Ann Dvorak as a child in 'Three on a Match' (1932) and a flower show in both "This Side of Heaven" and "The Key", both in 1934. George Nicholls Jnr remember Anne's work from a previous movie and that's how she got this part. She also adopted Anne Shirley as her stage name. The unforgettable stories are there - Lady of Shallot in a leaking boat, the "stolen" pants, the "red hair" incident. Anne was so right for the role of the chatty, heartwarming. She was sad in her intensity, her eagerness to please and also her fiery temper. O. P. Heggie was wonderful as Matthew Cuthbert and Helen Westley were good at Marilla. Tom Brown was an excellent Gilbert Blythe. Gertrude Messinger, who was also in smaller films, was good as Diana Barry. Sara Haden proved she could play someone other than Tannie Millie in the Andy Hardy series, was Mrs. Barry.
