Wow. I saw it last night and I'm still hearing how good it was. Every character felt so genuine (although most of them were small, selfish and ** holes) and the bizarre story - the middle-aged widow started scouring her daughter's fearless boyfriend - feeling completely convincing. The best performances are everywhere, but go out to Anne Reid and our friends in the north's Daniel Craig. The latter comes over as the next David Thewlis. <br /> <br /> A director Roger Michell? It is so far from Notting Hill as possible. Thank you. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie !!!
