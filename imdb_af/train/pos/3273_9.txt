I give it only 9 out of 10, because I have to see it again, in a more current mind map to have a fresh perspective. What I remember is a wonderful psychological thriller that blinded my brain and eyes when I watched it. I will see it every time it comes back to HBO (probably 1990 or so). I might even have recorded it, but the recording has long gone, I'm sure. <br /> <br /> I wrote to GreenCine to try this title, but it doesn't. I hope I can find it at a local video store. <br /> <br /> I would highly recommend trying it out somewhere. This is at least interesting. If you enjoy movies like Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice, Gummo, or something strange and along the lines, try this one out.
