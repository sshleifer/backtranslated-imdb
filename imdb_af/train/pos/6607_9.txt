I'll give almost 10 out of 10. However, there are a few confusing parts as well as headlines that have hurt the film's flow / continuity. The story line is large and well composed; You will definitely want to see it fully to understand it. The characters are complicated and so is the story line, expecting to get just enough information to stop scratching your head. It's a movie where everything is finally explained. The animation is great and the combination of femme deadly and film noir leads to a good movie that is different from what I saw in animation. It's a black and white movie and is quiet in a few scenes, so it's worth watching it on a good T.V or plasma. The character voices save this film in his English version, but it would have been more convincing if there were a few French accents to emphasize that it was Paris, I enjoyed it more in French with English subtitles. One whole thing is worth buying on DVD or BlueRay if they have it! And personally, if you enjoyed this movie, you can love it too; Waking Life & Ghost in a Shell 2 Innocence, it's just a personal suggestion.
