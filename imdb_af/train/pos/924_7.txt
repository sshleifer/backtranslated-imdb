Father of pride is a pleasant surprise: It's funny, witty and has some good voice work. The show is about the family of a Lion acting as the attraction of Siegfried & Roy. Indeed, everyone is stereotyped, but it makes them so funny. PHOTP is not a kiddie cartoon, it contains some rough adult humor but in a very soft way. It's full of pop culture references and celebrity cameos and most of them are very well executed. I will say I will give the exhibition a 7 out of 10 because it is pretty well done but not very original. I've seen most stereotypes many times before, even in that order!
