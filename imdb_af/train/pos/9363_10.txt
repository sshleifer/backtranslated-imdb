This movie was incredible, it's the kind of movie you watch it, rather than watching other movies by an actor watching other movies by director / writer. Sandler did a good job outside his comfort zone and the always good Cheadle also did a good job. This movie is ideal for a mature, intelligent audience. The acting was fantastic and can only be surpassed by writing and directing the film. This film focuses on the right Americans, the past generation, no stereotypes or racism, but only people who came together and realized the true meaning of life. This movie is about loss and handling. Instead of choosing psychiatry, it does not define it, but rather as someone who heals your magic, but rather by the fact that you do not judge your feelings for an impartial person you can trust, but rather thoughts will lead. This movie is fantastic!
