This is one of the best Bollywood movies I've seen so far. Family and friends feel the same way. This movie is really romantic and dramatic at the same time. In my opinion, we need more movies or movies like this to keep South Asian culture alive. Shahid Kapoor and Amrita Rao dealt very well with this, and their couple also attracted many people to the movies. It's a movie to watch, it's a family and romantic movie. This film is also from the makers of Hum Saath Saath Hain and Hum Apke Hain Kon. This movie is now their best ... the setting of the movie was beautiful, which is also a great attraction. This movie has to see ... recommended for everyone !!
