SOLDIER is not as bad as many people made it out. I found the movie to have the sacred, cynical humor like that in Paul Verhoven's Starship Troopers. The lack of dialogue and action is deliberate and adds to the comic-book atmosphere. <br /> <br /> One particular trivia bit stands out in front of me - Todd has the names of several space war campaigns tattooed on his chest and one of these battles is TANNHAUSER GATE. For the unconscious out there, Tannhauser Gate is mentioned in Roy Batty's elegant last lines in Blade Runner. To imagine that Todd fought with Android troops, like Roy, is wise to say the least. Perhaps the writer David Peoples is nostalgic? <br /> <br /> I'll give this one 3 out of 5.
