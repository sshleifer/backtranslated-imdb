My family watched Arthur Bach stumble and dumb since the movie came out for the first time. We memorized most of the lines. I watched it two weeks ago and still got tickled by the simple humor and performance that Dudley Moore portrays. Liza Minelli did a wonderful job as the side team - although I'm not her biggest fan. This movie just makes me watch movies. My favorite scene is when Arthur visits his fiance's home. His conversation with the butler and Susan's dad is spitting. The line from the butler, "Would you like to wait in the library", followed by Arthur's reply, "Yes, I'll be out of the bathroom" is my NEWMAIL notification on my computer. "Arthur is really" funny "!
