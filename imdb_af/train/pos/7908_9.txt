I recently received a $ 5 copy at a videobook and it was eagerly set up. While music and (of course) graphics do not meet the standards of my favorite of the series, Beyond the Mind's Eye, I'm still captivated by one segment: <br /> <br /> Stanley and Stella in "Breaking the Ys ". The music is brilliant, and the emotions really feel. Unfortunately, the clip on Odyssey's website does not have the story or the music.
