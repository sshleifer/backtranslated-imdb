I think if a movie has magic, I don't have to be fluid or seamless. It can save background information, in some places go too fast, too slow in others, etc. Magic in this movie: the scene in the library. There are many minor mistakes in Stanley & Iris, but it does not detract from the overall positive impact of people helping each other in areas that are incomprehensible, the hardest to fix. Both characters are clever. Yet Stanley cannot understand enough to function, because he cannot read; he can't read because he had too much adventure in his childhood. Iris, although well-educated, didn't have enough adventure and therefore can't understand how to move past the U-turn that took her life. In both their mistakes and strengths, the characters compliment each other. It may be a bit to assume that an Iris would work in a factory year after year, or that a Stanley never hid his illiteracy to work in construction or other better-paying jobs. And while these "mysteries" are being explained in the course of the story, their unfolding looks somewhat confronted. I assume no one took the time to reconsider the text. Still, is this a good movie? Imagine what De Niro, Fonda and Plimpton would do on the screen if anyone had it!
