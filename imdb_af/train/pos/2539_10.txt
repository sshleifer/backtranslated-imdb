For real movie people, this film is a must, because it works as a perfect little allegory for the movies themselves. Janos Rukh / Boris Karloff's science has to do with the recording and protrusion of light from cosmic phenomena. This light can do damage or it can be used to do good. On the one hand, his mother blinded, on the other hand it was used to heal blindness ("I can see!" Shouts a young girl whose eyes this light is projected). When Rukh / Karloff himself was poisoned by the incredible power of this light, we see that he radiates a ghostly glow on his hands and face, like a poorly developed negative, paying attention to the fact that the man we look at is a projection, an entity seen on film (only visible, as in a movie theater, when the lights are off). <br /> <br /> There is a wonderful section near the beginning where Karloff / Rukh explains his research by knowing that everything that happens is caught up in the light that rolls through millions of years since the light from Andromeda from the Galaxy emitted at a time when the earth was still melted stone. <br /> <br /> There are sections in the film when this new science is placed against older culture vehicles: that of the author, in the person of Beulah Bondi / Arabella Stevens; and religion, in the sculpture figures at the local cathedral Karloff storms with its projector / jet gun. <br /> <br /> One should wonder if this film was meant to look at what happened in Germany at that time, and especially at Riefenstall's use of film the previous year to promote a regime that would definitely continue To do much harm: Triumph of the Will. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, Mother (Violet Kemble Cooper) enters Janos Rukh of the first science rule. <br /> <br /> If only more movies have been made, you want to get up in the theater and shout: "I can see!"
