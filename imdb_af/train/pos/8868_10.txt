I have to say that higher learning is one of the top 3 movies I've ever watched. It has a brilliant cast, and an equally brilliant director. Singleton shows how life in the University can be. There are 3 main story lines, the skinheads, the African Americans, and the gay. I was inspired by all the stories, but the one that got me the most was the story of Kristen and struggling her feelings towards another girl. The end was wonderful. Having seen the movie 25 times more, I still cry. I would have given this movie an 11, but I need to fix 10/10.
