This movie is much underestimated. It is highly imaginative, creative and clever. It's just nice and I think this movie is the first one. But the movie was forgotten when it first came out and even more overlooked when the years passed. "Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey" also bombed at the cashier's office while the first one was a very good hit and very popular. <br /> <br /> I think the problem may be that this movie was released just a few years ago. In 1991 Bill and Ted were already "so 80's". Although the 80's were just a few years back, the landscape of music and style for children has changed so radically with gangsta rap, hip hop, Pearl Jam, Nirvana, Grunge and the Seattle sound. Bill and Ted with their Ozzy Osbourne, Van Halen and Guns N 'Roses music along with their 80s style look so out of place and very outdated in '91, and I think this is one big reason why the movie bombarded at the box office. No one, but surfers were still saying things like "excellent". and "fake!" In 1991. "Gremlins 2", which also came out in the early 90's, had the same fate to be a good movie bombarded at the box office, as it was also associated with the 80's. The transition from the 80's to the 90's was a much faster change than now with the '90s and 00s. 1991 was nothing like 1988 or 1989, while 2002 and 2001 still looks or looks like 1995 or 1996. <br /> <br /> The year was released only as "Excellent Adventure" made in 1988. instead of 1989, and "Bogus Journey" was made quick and released in 1989, it would probably be as popular as the first.
