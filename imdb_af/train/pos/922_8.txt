At least half an hour a week. I haven't been interested in the big 3 networks (ABC / CBS / NBC) in years. All the lions are interesting, although Larry can sometimes get worse. I really like the Middle Earth figures they bring to Hunter. Most of the other characters are also interesting. The sideshow of Siegfried and Roy are sometimes entertained. What's more, the animation is definitely the best CG done on a weekly TV show. Usually when they record big names to die in a show, they try to hide a poor script or characters. Not quite true in this show. There are a few characters that are weak and improved by the voice acting, but overall the characters stand on their own. <br /> <br /> It's definitely 16 and higher. There is nothing here that most children have not heard before, and most of the jokes will probably just fly over their heads. It is definitely not as rough and edgy as South Park, but it does bring a bit of the same "Bash everyone" to it. One example of this is that at the same time in one episode make fun of both Dick Cheney and Barbara Streisand. <br /> <br /> Father of the Pride and other Dreamworks productions such as Shrek also feel like the spiritual successors of Animaniacs, Pinky and the Brain, and Freakazoid. It is the same kind of humor grown up. It may not be as dirty as Spielberg's classic TV series, but it's still good. <br /> <br /> I hope it ends well this season and is renewed for future seasons. Otherwise, I can never find a reason to look at the big 3 again.
