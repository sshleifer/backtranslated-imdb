I think it's probably the funniest movie I've ever seen. Robert Harling's script is almost perfect, just look at the "quotes" section; Without the thought, just rent the DVD, because it's the delivery that really makes the lines sing. <br /> <br /> Sally Field gives a comical, exaggerated performance as you have never seen her elsewhere. , and Kevin Kline is effortlessly hilarious. Robert Downey, Jr. is typically brilliant, and in a very small role, Kathy Najimy is a riot than the beleaguered client. I was never much of a Elisabeth Shue fan, but she is wonderful here as the one * real person surrounded by a crowd of cartoon characters on The Sun Also Sets set. It boasts that you feel Hemingway rolls over in his grave. Either this, or he laughs very hard. <br /> <br /> Five stars. Funny, funny, funny.
