Carla is a secretary who is actually deaf without her hearing aids. When she overloads herself at work, she can help Paul help her. Paul is just out of jail, and his past is not completely behind him. To say too much about the story, which has many twists and turns, will be a mistake. <br /> <br /> The most interesting thing about this movie for me is how sound is used to indicate when Carla can hear and when she can - a kind of "point of hearing" (such as point of view). The early scenes it set up, as well as the early character development of Carla and Paul, were more interesting to me than the turn and later turned, some of which were difficult to follow and / or extend credibility. There is also some unpleasant violence. Back to the positive side, cinematography was very good. <br /> <br /> The movie is worth seeing, but maybe not to look for. Seen at the San Francisco International Film Festival on 4/28/2002.
