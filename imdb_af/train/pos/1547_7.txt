As almost everyone who communicated on this movie, I can only wonder why it has never appeared on video. <br /> <br /> At about the age of 12, I recall the "The Late Show", circa 1972. I also remember the poison gas attack and the strange hewn horses. (I don't remember the more horrific bits I've seen here, they're probably cut out for the TV audience.) But the scenes I really liked were those that killed Lord Kitchener aboard the HMS Hampshire almost 90 years ago. The scenes of the doomed cruiser approaching the minefield in the storm were very cold, as I remember. <br /> <br /> Don't remember the musical score, but the comments of the others have made me curious. Get this one on video!
