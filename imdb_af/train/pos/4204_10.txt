And anyone watching this movie agrees. This film was directed in the days when plot, character credibility and theme actually mattered. <br /> <br /> Jean Peters, Widmark and Thelma Ritter steal the spotlight. Ritter is in the best shape as informant "Moe", which she survives in NY's Bowery division, which serves as a chair pigeon for the NYC police. <br /> <br /> The only other movie I saw Peters is "Niagara" and she shows her acting ability here, complete with Brooklyn accent. Widmark is appropriately threatening as the anti-hero who has to distinguish what is the right thing, despite his need for cash. <br /> <br /> Photography is brilliant. The neon, the metro station (though it looks cleaner than the right thing!) The harbor cabin where Widmark lives as a transition. Excellent use made of the city, with 'Lightning Louie' in Chinatown; The many flavors and appetites of the city are addressed here; The political climate of the time is a haunting background. 10/10.
