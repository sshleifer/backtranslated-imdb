From the opening actors of the main actor we get an early view of how many people live, are driven by them in women, and the humor that comes with everything that goes on in everyday normal life. <br /> <br /> The director, Eric Lartigau, quotes how many European men feel that they have complete control of their lives, but without the help / support of the women around them, it doesn't seem to work. . The use of facial image through the film is excellent, and its clever positioning of the senior relative (mother) is on the point. <br /> <br /> While there is more than enough in the film, it's still about single parents / adoption and the strength of family in society. It is really rewarding to look, and again one who is only able to make the French seam. <br /> <br /> So far one of the top 50 or so movies I've seen this year, and worth a five start rating. I look forward to adding this one to the DVD collection when it is released and recommending it to all ages.
