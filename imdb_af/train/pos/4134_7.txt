Laurence Olivier, Merle Oberon, Ralph Richardson and Binnie Barnes star in "The Divorce of Lady X", a 1938 play comedy. Olivier plays a young barrister, Everard Logan, who allows Oberon to spend the night in his hotel room, when London's fog is too heavy for guests at a costume ball to go home. The next day, a friend of his master, Lord Mere (Richardson), announces that his wife (Barnes) spent the night with another man at the same hotel, and he wants to divorce her. Believe the woman to be Oberon, Olivier panic. Oberon, who is alone and the granddaughter of a judge, suggests she is the lady, Lady Mere, when she is really Leslie Steele. <br /> <br /> We've seen this plot or variations of it for decades. With this cast, it's great. I mean, Richardson and Olivier? Olivier and Oberon, that big team in Wuthering Heights? Very special. Olivier is devastatingly handsome and does a good job with the comedy, as he portrays the incessant, nervous barrister. Oberon gives her role the right light contact. She looks very young here, fuller in the face, with Jean Harlow eyebrows and a whole different hair for her. She wears some beautiful street clothes, though her first gown looks like a birthday cake, and in one gown she tries with those hair, she is ready to play Snow White. Binnie Barnes is beautiful like the real Lady Mere. <br /> <br /> The color in this one is a mess, and as others have said, it can really use a recovery. Definitely worth seeing.
