This movie is a half-documentary ... and it's pretty interesting .... <br /> <br /> It's a good movie ... based on the true story of how a lot of Norwegian saboteurs in it managed to stop the heavy water production in Rukjan, Norway and the delivery of the rest of the heavy water to Germany. <br /> <br /> This movie is not perfect and it could have been a bit better ... the best part of The movie is that some of the saboteurs are played themselves. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in the history of World War II and film, it's a worthwhile movie!
