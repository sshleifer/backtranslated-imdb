It's a funny business, reviewing movies. In these days when "individualized emotions" and "emotional debauchery" on the simple sentimentality benefit, it must be difficult to remain true to your true feelings. <br /> <br /> Shortly after jury commitments at the 58th Berlin, I managed to catch Yoji Yamada's Kabei. <br /> <br /> After the show, I watched people's dreams be watched from the theater hall, watery eyes, men, women and judges. Even the director of the Berlin, of course, a hard-hired spectator of cinema, admitted that he had been firmly captured and found himself in fifteen minutes away in this impudent sentimental experience. <br /> <br /> But what really surprised me was the reviews that came after that. Despite moving relentlessly through the film, many judges chose to be lukewarm and emotionally relentless in their writing. Apparently, after they cried, they tackled their "thinking cap" and, therefore, missed what I felt, was the genius about Kabei. <br /> <br /> Let me explain. <br /> <br /> In pre-war Japan, Kabei's story turns to one writer's family and their fate in it, after being detained in prison for what was described as "thought crimes" against the imperial will. Through a series of elaborate emotional scenes, Yamada acquainted us with the man, his loyal wife and two daughters, as well as three characters. The man's pretty young sister, a clumsy ex-student and an uncle of an uncle? ? everyone comes to help the family deal with their fate, in the absence of the man of the house. <br /> <br /> The story moves slowly and slowly with a slow pace, and heart attacks find exactly the moments that everyone is able to predict. This, of course, makes it impossible for anyone in the audience to be emotionally upset by any dramatic event. <br /> <br /> In other words, although you learn to love the family and their helpers, and sympathize with their unhappy situation, you are so moved by the certainty of the plot that you expect yourself to be a particular kind of expectation to expect. <br /> <br /> But two hours in the movie (don't worry, Yamada offers the viewer enough moments of gravity and lifetime to tide you), he saves you with what I can do just as the "sting" describe. All you were supposed to be about the story? An innocent man was cruel to his faithful wife and daughters? Now suddenly one of the family helpers shows up. Someone you have taken for granted so far is thrown into an unexpected turn of fate. <br /> <br /> At this stage, something new was happening in the theater I was in. Everyone started sobbing with little or no inhibition. /> <br /> "My word!" I mumbled under my breath. It struck me that "in the final analysis," Kabei "was more than a movie about a family torn apart by an empire on the edge of the war. This was actually a cunning investigation of one common human gimmick: How little have we dealt with the secret feelings of people closest to us. <br /> <br /> Now the most common criticism of the film is made. that it was technically solid, but did not have the innovation. That's what happens when judges place their proverbial thinking, I think. With Kabei I believe Yoji Yamada knew exactly what trick he would use to touch on one unique aspect of humanity. An evil old trick that he applied so seamlessly in the Tora-san series, and later in Tasogare Sebei. <br /> <br /> Having flung the audience into a kind of comforting comfort zone, it throws us into an emotional level <br /> <br /> It's rarely the most effective movie instrument for me. One who avoids detection, but touches you deeply. And proof of its effectiveness was a thousand wet pieces of Kleenex, which were thrown in a trash can just outside that thousand-seat theater hall. <br /> <br /> Now, just as some reviewers would resist getting so stuck that they were smart to forget what the cinema really is going to do. Human emotions. Pure and simple.
