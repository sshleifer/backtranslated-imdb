I loved this movie since the first time it came out. I was about nine years old and now I'm 27. I remember playing the video game on Sega Genisis. I had so much fun, I'd like to show my son this movie. He also loves Michael Jackson and I know he will love this movie just as I did when I was a kid. Even though he was much younger than I was when I first saw it. I can't wait for it to come out on DVD! I hope it comes out on DVD! Please leave it on DVD! I die to see it again !!! Well, that's my comment. I hope one day I will see this movie again. I love all the videos in this movie. My favorite mini-video is Badder!
