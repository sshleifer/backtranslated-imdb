SERIES OF THREE BLACKADDER THIRD "If you did something properly, kill Baldrick before you start." Hot on the heels of the second series, the show returned with the current owner of the famous name after his luck and served as a butler to Prince Regent, a vain and thin foil for Blackadders poison, played by Hugh Laurie . Baldrick is still dragging as the other piece of the comic jigsaw. The format is similar to the previous show, and now they've got the winning formula why things change. We see Blackadder trying to get rich from the back of the believer in much more ingenious ways, and try to make Bladrick try a M.P.or to weigh a suitable bride for the prince. In many ways, this is one of the most accurate of the series historically. The prince regent took control of the throne during his fathers and some of the characters told a lot about the times. Samuel Johnson, William Pit and Wellington are all going through the events and everyone is studying their scenes, not an easy thing with such a star cast.
