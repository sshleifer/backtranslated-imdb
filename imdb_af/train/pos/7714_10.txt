There were lots of 50's sci-fi movies. They were great for the Drive-in theaters. Many of them were crappy again. This movie and 'The Day the Earth Stoud Still' stand out, and both are good at their own age. From the beginning with his unhappy theremin musical score (which still sounds strange, as theremins are almost never used). Forbidden Planet takes you where no one has gone before. Speaking of Star Trek there is so much material in this movie that came in Star Trek TOS, it's like a pilot for the series; from the interactive captain / first mate / doctor, the mad scientist, alien creatures, baby in short dress, computer intelligence; It's all right now, but it was the first of its kind. In addition, it has good acting and well-done artwork that even causes a certain awe on the images today. Consider how the great Krell machine with real depth is portrayed successfully. I saw it as a kid (at a queue in: 0) when it was a new movie and it scared me. Of course, any movie that was even terrifying at that time did, but I remember being really worried about the invisible monster. Forbidden Planet is a movie that can watch a sci-fi fan a few times and find something new with each look.
