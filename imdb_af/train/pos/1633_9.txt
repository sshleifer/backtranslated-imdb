I loved this movie when it came out in the 80's and still! I still pick up classic lines like "say it again" and "you said you will rip my balls from my sir". Ron Leibman was warm and very funny! Although it is underestimated and denied by MAD, I have to say that this jeweler will always be a treasure of mine and a movie I would take with me if sent to a deserted island! I just want someone to release the DVD because my VHS tape is exhausted! If you want a comedy out of stock, it's definitely for you and should be considered a cult class! This is military humor at its best and worse! Rent it if you can't own it!
