I saw this movie in the worst possible situation. I missed 15 minutes when I woke up on an international flight between Sydney and Seoul. I didn't know what I was looking at, I thought it might be a movie of the week, but quickly got hit by the performance of the main actor a young woman playing kid kidnapped. The prospect started to turn and I didn't see it, and by the end of the credits I was looking through the in-flight guide to find out what I just looked at. It seems that I discovered Do-yeon Jeon, who won the best actress in Cannes for the role. I don't know if secret sunshine is typical of Korean cinema, but I'm going to the DVD store to discover more.
