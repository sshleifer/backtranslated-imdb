Looking at some of the negative posts, you really have to wonder what some people do for pleasure. <br /> <br /> I was fortunate to see the movie during its all too short stage. The audience laughed at its heads. I watch a strap of it while I type and it is still dang funny! <br /> <br /> It also has a lovely side, with unexpected turns of real pathos. The late, big Royal Dano is especially effective as the lonely, up-side-happy farmer Wrenchmuller. Ariana Richards and J.J. Anderson is wonderful as the main children. And the actors in the March Packs, though limited to mime, do a good job. <br /> <br /> Another thing to look at is the background details. The film is full of tributes, pasties, and references to other SF and fantasy films. Look at the Mars costumes again. One of them wears a Marty McFly costume, another is a Ghostbuster, a third is in a House Atreides uniform, and a fourth is wearing a Last Starfighter pilot.
