This movie has everything that makes a bad movie worth watching - messy editing, little or no continuity, insane dialogue, bad (you can even say it doesn't exist) acting, useless story lines, shots that are too long expensive. It's perfect for MST3K style riffing, not called the "Corpse Eaters Drinking Game": Writing on forms ... taking a shot - Drawing your name ... taking a shot - Catching a bad Foley change. .. take many, many shots. <br /> <br /> The only reason I didn't rate it higher than 8 is because there is not enough unnecessary nudity and because it is just an hour long, despite its insane badness. was at least 20-30 minutes longer!
