This is one of the better classic Edgar Wallace movies from the German series. It contains all the basics for a very enjoyable Wallace crime movie, back from the 60's. Although his majesty, Mr. Kinski, missing, you have another young Joachim 'Blacky' Fuchsberger, who is again the typical smart American 'womanizer', you young Eddi Arendt in his best (and just as typical) role ever - the cool, sophisticated British butler - and you have (not so young). Lowitz as the melancholic but still "dry" ironic (and therefore highly entertaining) police investigator. Furthermore, you get a freaky and very campy 'evil man' behind a frog mask (hence the movie's title!), Get a crazy swing soundtrack, classic b-roll action scenes, partially filmed from the wildest perspectives (reminiscent of the time of its origin!), shouting queens, and again and again ... All the ingredients are well shaken in a deliciously tasty cocktail of pure German Edgar Wallace campaign.
