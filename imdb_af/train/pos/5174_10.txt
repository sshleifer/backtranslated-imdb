I swear I can watch this movie every weekend of my life and never get sick! Every aspect of human emotion is so captivated by the acting, the writing, the direction and the general feeling of this movie. It's been a long time since I saw a movie that actually made me laugh, reflecting on sadness, and feeling every intended feeling in this most outstanding work! We need more movies like this !!! Mike Binder: Do you listen ???
