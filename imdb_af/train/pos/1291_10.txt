It's a good movie. Something nice to watch money is blown at a super pace, especially from a child's point of view. Take it for what it is, a fun little movie about a child's dream that is true and what a child can do with $ 1 million. Don't like it, don't look at it. They make movies for the viewers, not the people who have nothing better to do, then complain in their lives.
