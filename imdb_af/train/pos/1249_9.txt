I thought it was a great showcase for Mandy's bodacious bid. If you do not expect anything else, such as clever plots and credible character development, you will not be disappointed. Consider a sports-illustrated shoot whose character is going to kill people, especially those who threaten to come between her and her "mommy" (Suzanna Arquette, who obviously doesn't want to play the sex kitty - she leaves it to her daughter behind). <br /> <br /> Mandy's face is a bit too perfect, but her body is a complete 5-alarm fire, there in the ranks of Sophia Loren when it comes to natural bustle, a perfect 7th -10 ratio of waist to hips, and beautifully configured legs to her feet. (There must be an ideal configuration of thighs to knees to calves, to quite eye-pleasing ankles. Mandy is definitely the model for this ideal relationship.) <br /> <br /> And no flat buttocks to Not starting, which seems to be the withdrawal of many a busty babe with curves everywhere except in the 'near hemisphere'. Mandy may have had a body double in the back of her and lost her towel when she was in the candlelight bath with her blindfolded German Guy victim no. 2 falls, but from everything I could see from her bikini shots, she has the buttocks for it and does not need a double to prove it. <br /> <br /> Mandy's acting abilities had little to do with her impression of a psychic 'Mama's Girl', with the obvious erotic lesbian overtones. Her bisexual nature (which allows herself to be in the hot tub, after a long flirtation with German Guy No. 2, who has also become her mother's lover) added an additional dimension to an otherwise one-dimensional caricature of adolescent female horn. pathological murderous impulses (always through water with the men - the ultimate fate of the Latina housekeeper has been worked out in the television version for some clear reasons). <br /> <br /> Mandy's Uber-Nordic views together with her Uber-Voluptuous body can be either a blessing or a curse. If Mandy really wants to promote her career as an actress, I would recommend her to fully immerse herself in the Romanesque languages, especially Italian and Spanish - and perhaps French, although I do not know if they are going for her. But that will enable her to reconcile her Bo Derek face with her Vida Guerra body - but perhaps her face is just a little too Nordic, and she has shown too much of her extraordinary body in a cheese film to her. to enable any more celebrity that Michelle Johnson enjoyed in the 1980s, whose early fame in Blame it on Rio was followed by a series of skin chicks that did not shed it off the ground. <br /> <br /> Vambo Drule.
