To some extent, I liked this movie better than the original VAMPIRES. I found the movie to be very misogynistic. As a woman and a horror fan, I am accustomed to women in danger being a staple of the genre. But they just hit Sheryl Lee too much. In this movie Natasha Wagner is a more perfect character, and the most important bad guy is a gal! Arly Jover (who played a sidekick vampire in BLADE) is very out of the world and deadly. Jon Bon Jovi ... okay, no good actor, but he does it well. At least he didn't start singing. Catch it on cable if you can. It's on Encore Action this month.
