I like these movies. This is another Yash raj movie you know will look good on the screen. All the character is always nice or very nice with one exception you know will eventually be covered to be nice. Another rule of Yash Raj's movie is that or hero or heroine; s have only one or no parent. Think back to all the movies. MPK Suman doesn't have a mother, HMAPK Salman doesn't have parents. And FINAL rule is that you will probably see 90% Alock Nath cry ... <br /> <br /> The movie is also good. It is slow, but keep you entertained. There is almost no comedy, but it often makes you smile. The little one (hero's cousin) is well placed and delivers very good one linen. The actress is very nice, but ashamed you will not get it in real life. This movie doesn't have big happy families living in BIG home, and I was a good idea and allowed the film to be distinguished from other movies. There will be many women crying at the end of the movie. There isn't a strong message from this movie, but it's a good look. If you are married (arranged marriage), the movie will remind you of what you went through. And if you are not, it will inform you and you may be scared. <br /> <br /> Overall a very good movie. No big sites or twists, but a very soft movie, much like Bollywood classic.
