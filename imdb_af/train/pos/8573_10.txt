In 1996's "101 Dalmatians", Cruella De Vil was arrested by the London Metropolitan Police (God blesses them) to steal and kill 101 puppies-Dalmatians. Everyone covered in mud and hay, she spent the next 4 years in the "tin". Now, 4 years later, she was unfortunately released from prison. I say it's about 28 years - in dogs years !!!!! <br /> <br /> In 2000, Disney decided to release a sequel to the successful live-action version of the classic movie, and it was named "102 Dalmatians." There, a 102 Dalmatian was added to the family (Oddball is the name, I think; I need to know it, as it has just been shown on TV recently), and the puppy had no spots !!!!! Also, while Cruella (again played by Glenn Close) escaped again, she wanted to make a bigger, better dress - out of the puppies !!!!! <br /> <br /> I especially had the theme song - I'm sure everyone loves the "Atomic Dog" song from the 70's or so. And now we hear a bit of it in this movie !!!!! <br /> <br /> "102 Dalmatians" is such a wonderful movie I keep wondering - WHEN WILL BE A 103 DALMATIANS ?? ??? "LOL <br /> <br /> 10 stars
