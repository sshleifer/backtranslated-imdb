Overall, the movie is right. I think it's better than Sepet and much better than Gubra in terms of its story, its sentimental value. <br /> <br /> There are a few scenes that let me down. Yes, I agree that the boy (Mukhsin) did his play very well. Brilliant. However, I can say that his play is almost natural. <br /> <br /> But Nina Simone's song 'Ne Me Quitte Pas' is really' 'menu item' my 'bulu' 'roma'. <br /> <br /> I love the song. Both the song. "Ne Me Quitte Pas" and "Hujan". I just downloaded the song. Beautiful. <br /> <br /> And greeting Yasmin. The film's final credit makes me touch again. We can see how Yasmin has greatly appreciated her parents. <br /> <br /> I think the movie deserves the Grand Prix or International Jury at the Berlin Film Festival. <br /> <br /> I give 8.5 out of 1 stars.
