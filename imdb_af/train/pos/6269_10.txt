A pleasant surprise! I expected a further downgrade along the line: The Rock (9) -> Con Air (7) -> Armaggeddon (4). Especially for such an overhead movie. Perhaps this is why so little has been approved of this new type of Bruckheimer prize. Smart dialogue instead of snappy one-liners, decent background / motivation instead of shake-n-bak stereotypes, and when the chase came, you were thirsty. Fanboys expects an Armageddon roller coaster: stay away. This is one for the more intelligent action supporters. It didn't even bother me. Jolie appeared so little.
