It's amazing that so many people I know haven't seen this jeweler. everyone I turned on came back with the same reaction: WHAT A GREAT ENVIRONMENT !! <br /> <br /> I've never cared much for Brad Pitt (although his turn in 12 monkeys and Fight Club shows improved), but his performance in this movie as a psycho is unpleasant, dark and right on the target. <br /> <br /> Everybody in the film performs excellently and the movie's slow and deliberate pacing greatly enhances the performance. the sense of fear of the characters continues to grow as they realize what really happened. <br /> <br /> The only thing that keeps it from a 10 in my book is that compared to what has come before, the end is a bit too long and blown. but this is the only mistake I could find in this cult classic. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie, try to get the letterboxed unrated director's cut for the best performance. <br /> <br /> rating: 9
