I can only agree with taximeter that this is a fantastic movie and should be seen by a wide audience. The imagination on the screen, the visual interpretation of the writing, is the constant surprise. The two leads are great and really carry the movie. My advice would be to not even look at a trailer, just rent the movie and watch without expectation. I hired from blockbuster, so it's readily available in brisbane, not everyone will enjoy it, but I think most people will have an opinion and it's always good unless it's just "it's stupid". I loved this movie, you just don't see ginger like this every day. It should become a cult favorite. Give it a try, you may just feel the same way about it.
