There must be more movies about our Native Americans. I especially think the use of real real Native Americans would be the right thing. I know this Archie Belaney, played by Pierce Brosnan, did an excellent job of portraying that character as he was Englishman. But my suggestion to Hollywood is to put more American Indians in the roles and never use anyone else. The Sioux Nation has been on the back burner for too long. Their poverty is a disgrace to our country. It is my firm belief that our country must bring back the Black Hills to the Sioux. We ask Israel to return their lands to the Arabs, but we do not bother to do the same, we must be ashamed. We must practice what we preach!
