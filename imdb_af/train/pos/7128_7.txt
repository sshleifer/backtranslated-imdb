This is probably John Thaw's best performance, successfully switching off any features of his Inspector Morse character and bringing a perfect adaptation of Tom from the pages of the book to the TV screen. It is a well-crafted production that retains its family performance despite some very mature themes such as the outbreak of the Second World War and the physical abuse suffered by the child. <br /> <br /> However, the relationship between Tom and Young Willie is the heart and soul of this story. It is touching and beautiful to see this bond between the young boy who was evacuated from London and the grumpy old man he was developing - a real grandfather / grandson. It is a pity that this story was not with a larger budget with a more established director as it is on the big screen, and is not shown once or twice every ten years on a Sunday afternoon. Given the right direction, John Thaw will be celebrated worldwide and will be donated with many awards for his brilliant performance in this movie. A great actor and a great role that should have been more honored than it was at the time.
