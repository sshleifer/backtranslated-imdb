Deathtrap is like a play in a movie about who has what to do, as it happens mainly on one set. The assumption is that a completed playwright, whose star falls, receives a beautiful manuscript from a former student and therefore plans to practice his protege and adapt his drama to his wife's (hard) protest. Or you think, for the first half of the movie. Beyond the half point, Deathtrap begins to turn into twists and turns that turn its prospect on its head, then right and then turn into a mad, keeping its title right all the time. It is an excellent, mysterious film, soaked in white. <br /> <br /> Michael Caine, as a senior playwright, plays himself in this movie - a slightly rewarding and very dramatic Briton. No surprises here - he does his usual good job. He gets the best line from Deathtrap, which he perfectly performs: "What is your definition of success, broken in a state official?" <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Christopher Reeve plays comedy and drama in a surprisingly strong performance that the ambitious (and psychopathic) playwright plays. He also gets his very colored body that he has kept from the Superman movies. <br /> <br /> Caine and Reeve worked together in another movie that is one of my favorite comedies - Noises Off. It's also a play, although this time Caine is the director and Reeve is an actor. They are joined by comic veterans Carol Burnett, John Ritter, Marilu Henner (Taxi) and Mark Linn-Baker (Perfect Strangers). Together they demonstrate the calamities that hit the bed-hopping cast and crew of a play. On the surface, the movie usually looks mostly slapstick, but after watching, you find that they are very subtle jokes that require more than one viewer to catch. Wish this underrated movie was available on DVD.
