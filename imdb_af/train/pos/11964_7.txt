I went to the movie this afternoon and expected to be underneath Scoop. Fortunately, the film exceeded expectations, at least a little. It's nothing heavy, nothing deep - and not as good as any real Allen masterpiece, but it's also quite enjoyable as a lightweight, handling comedy. There is something so simple and sweet about it. "Cute" was the word I heard from people in the audience as they walked out to the show. It doesn't feel as though Allen wants to create a masterpiece here, it feels like he wants to make a little comedy and enjoy it. Compared to just about anything Hollywood produces, Allen's stuff has a tendency to charm. Even the soft stuff. Nowadays, it's just refreshing to go to a movie made by a real person.
