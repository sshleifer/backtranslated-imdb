I rented this Netflix movie for two reasons. I was in the mood for what I thought would be a bad 50-year-old sci-fi asco and it's the first Superman movie. Needless to say, after about 15 minutes I got myself engaged and very pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> A test oil well penetrated into the ground about six miles and is locked by the surety. Lois and Clark appear to get the kick, but are disappointed that the deepest drill ever born will no longer be in operation. A day later, strange happenings at the well make a story more suited to Superman and Clark Kent. The radioactive Mole Men seems to have invaded their six-mile deep house near the Earth's core. <br /> <br /> Men and Men are a simplistic but well-made social realism. Released in 1951, starring a major actor serving in World War II, the moral of the story shows that Americans are just as capable of becoming as others. To manage this point in a typical simple Superman way at home, Reeves even accuses the lynch mob of hunting the Mole Men at one point after 'Nazis'. <br /> <br /> Even in the 1950s, the science underlying this movie was non-existent. Six miles of continental crust drill would not even have penetrated the upper mantle, leaving the "earth's cavity" - which in any case did not exist. Ineffective - keep in mind that this movie is based on a golden magazine book. <br /> <br /> The movie is a bit uneven. Although the Molemen is interesting, a bit spectacular and beautifully depicted, there are several Corman esquire scenes that show too much time to us. The writing is intelligent and economical. At today's standards, the costumes are poor to fair, but for the time being, this movie's special effects and costumes were pretty good. The cinematography is also generally good, and the acting is much better than expected. I was especially impressed with Reeves, Jeff Corey and Walter Reed.
