Since 30 years ago I saw this movie as a child, never tired of seeing it. From the opening styles in the horn factory, to the car engine driving from the back seat, to Ollie's phone answering and accidentally pushing through the window, I think it might be their best last movie. Then they moved to the 20th century Fox, and while those movies were not terrible, they lacked the comic timing of this movie. Jimmy Finnlayson, their long-time reel, in his last appearance with the boys, emerging as the doctor is super! quotation: "I said goat's milk", his answer to Stan asked him how are you going to ghost milk! Charlie Hall and even Ben Turpin show up! I want to say everything one of my favorite L&H comedies.
