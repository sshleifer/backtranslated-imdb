This independent, B&W, DV feature is constantly shocking, surprised and amused with its ability to create the most insane situations and then find humor and interest in them. These are all hilarious and ridiculous things, but just as absurd as so much of the movie, there is a heart and a reality that keeps the film grounded, keeps the whole lot of folly and the right message in it. This film is about how we all survive in a world that is angry. It seems to be the heart of the movie. For as insane and from the wall as things get, Leon, the 30 yr. old paperboy protagonist, always try to keep it together. He is like a child forever to catch the balloon that swings away so that everything will work for the best so that everyone can have what they want. <br /> <br /> The play in the movie may have gone far over the top, but the exceptional throw really keeps the piece coherent. Van Meter is perhaps the best of the bunch here with a show shining through her absurdly ill tics. Just like the characters in the movie, we look at her sudden outbursts to see the right person. <br /> <br /> Majkowski is a true genius here. He takes the most ridiculous plots and really keeps them. It's his writing and his role that helps keep the whole thing on the right track. It's a true proof of Majkowski's skill and everyone involved is that this movie, with its mystery and characters, never works our nerves. Majkowski took a film that was slim and repulsive and somehow gave it heart and humor. It's a unique movie. Not to be missed. <br /> <br />
