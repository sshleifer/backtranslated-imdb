George Lopez never caught my interest in his rising comedy and he hasn't got it yet. But this show is a work of art. It never shows where the jokes make you laugh every time you remember it (and jokes that stay memorable). This show has only an exciting look at it and the characters range from an old, short-drunk to a dislike teen. I don't know who is writing this show, but that person does a good job. If they just continued the show, I'm sure it will get a positive response from the critics of this wonderful country. If you are looking for a good, traditional comedy then George Lopez is the show for you! The one bad thing is the title. George Lopez? Really? Imagine Bel-Air's Spring Prince being "Will Smith". Come on, man! But otherwise this show is genius! 10/10
