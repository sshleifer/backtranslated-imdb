In addition to the excellent direction, production, acting and the predictable drama are an essential message in the writing: <br /> <br /> "Listen all the way". To make the voice flourish, listen. To harmonize with other voices, listen. To approach yourself, listen. To discover the needs of any situation or others, listen. It seems that the writing writers transport a "life's secret". Pilot leads to an awareness of your self. It awakens the other senses, especially vision and expands the horizon. The soul of man can also be discovered. The artwork of this film, as it is in heaven, has shown the unfolding of life, not just its joy and sadness, but ultimately the hope of life. All this through the main character's first instruction to the choir; <br /> <br /> "Just listen, it leads the whole way"
