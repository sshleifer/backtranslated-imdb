Whoever said that horror wasn't an educational movie genre? Thanks to this wonderful Hammer short movie, I NEVER know to offer a strange visitor any wine and a piece of bread with salt in my own home, because he can only be a hypnotist and this combination will give him the power to control me. thoughts and thoughts forever! Thanks Hammer! The tenth episode in the House of Horror series is another one I have been looking forward to seeing, mainly because the man was in the Don Sharp director's seat; one of Britain's best filmmakers, but still unhappy. Sharp was responsible for some very cool Hammer movies, such as "Kiss of the Vampire" and "Rasputin: The Mad Monk", as well as some independent productions such as Dark Places and Psychomania. His contribution to House of Horror is easily one of the finest in the series, with a complex but fascinating plot surrounding it and turning to glorious occult themes. The plot centers on two antique dealers who stumble upon a strange object that looks like a mirror, but it's actually an old writing device that can be used to call Choronzhon; the demonic guardian of the abyss. The mirror is highly demanded by a satanic cult because they need it for their ceremonies, but Michael is reluctant to sell it before the true value of the device is known. When he picks up a clearly petrified girl who runs off the cult to avoid being sacrificed, Michael is drawn even deeper into an occult conspiracy. Satanic cults and the carnal sacrifice of young women are typical British horror topics, but David Fischer's script is never boring and offers many neat plot twits, including a highly inventive climax. There is also enough tension to admire, the windows are white and the appearances are wonderful (especially John Carson, as the leader of the cult is actually honest). Recommended!
