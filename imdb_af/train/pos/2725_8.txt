"In Cold Blood", adapted by director Richard Brooks of Truman Capote's famous novel, deals with the brutal and senseless killing of a family of four by some unfortunate criminals. The film excels as a character study by the killers, especially the quick-hit Perry Smith (Robert Blake). <br /> <br /> The movie includes few recognizable names, but they bring the story to the limit with ease. Robert Blake and Scott Wilson are excellent as two criminals with diverse personalities. They play effortlessly, while Blake also has many opportunities to explore his character's idiosyncrasies. The rest of the roll is just average and is not worth mentioning. <br /> <br /> Richard Brooks received Oscar nominations for both his screenplay and his direction. In my opinion, both were excellent, although the manuscript was not misunderstood in the late stages. Oscar-nominated cinematography by Conrad Hall is also top-notch, just like editing. Also worthy of note is the jazz-like quincy Jones score, which ensures the last of the film's four Oscar nominations. <br /> <br /> Unlike many other crime films, this violence is not laid. Brooks changes the killers into spicy characters rather than condemning them. Whether you agree with that sentiment, the film offers an interesting alternative to the ordinary Hollywood approach. I recommend the movie for this reason and also the expertise with which the technical aspects are handled.
