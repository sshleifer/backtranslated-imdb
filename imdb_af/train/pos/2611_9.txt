It is commonly seen in Australia as one of the best cop dramas ever produced here ... and for my money, anywhere. It's raw, eager, the characters are real, the situations are credible and it's not shy of the dark side of life that is confronted by policemen and criminals, victims, lawyers and other people in their different jobs every day. <Br /> <br /> This show ran for 2 seasons and stopped because the show didn't sell well overseas. We're all sorry for his loss. But like Fawlty Towers, we can respect it as a limited length range of uniform high quality.
