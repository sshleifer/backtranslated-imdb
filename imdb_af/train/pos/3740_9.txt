Filmed on a Florida National Guard site, "Tigerland" reminds me of Fort Polk, LA, fire ranges, maneuver areas, waist and everything. The movie was pretty authentic and the characters were similar to those of my AIT in 1974. The difference between the Tigerland year 1971 and me of 1974 is all the drillers and instructors knew they didn't go back to Vietnam. It was pretty much over, so training was very relaxed - not a challenge at all. This was the forerunner of all our problems in the 70s and 80s, which I know for a fact as I stayed until 2004. I never heard anyone call "Tigerland", but the army has realistic Vietnam training villages on different bases across the US Vietnam Vets tell me that up to 1972 Basic & AIT can be fairly rough and robust, because the coaches were there and had a mandate to train Vietnamese men to do so, although not always was not the case. Both a police officer at Polk and later one of my Vietnam Vet NCOs, when we became instructors at a basic training brigade at Fort Bliss, I said there was nothing they could do to get someone right and people just had to find out and figure out for themselves. This movie is high.
