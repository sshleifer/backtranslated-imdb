Virile, but naive, big Joe Buck leaves his home in Big Spring, Texas, and pushes down to the Big Apple in search of women and big money. In NYC, JB meets frustration, and with 'Ratso' Rizzo, a scruffy but cordial artist. Somehow, this mismatching pair succeeds in surviving, which in turn helps them cope with an angry, sometimes cruel, urban America, heading for a gripping end. <br /> <br /> Both funny and depressed, our "Midnight Cowboy" rides on the vortex of cyclonic cultural change and thus confirms 1969 viewers that they themselves have been swept away from the 1950s, and Dorothy and Toto abandoned in the 1960s. Waterman. <br /> <br /> The film's direction is masterful; the casting is perfect; in addition, the acting is; the writing is sharp and affectionate; cinematography is tempting; and the music enhances all of the above. Surely it won the best Oscar of 1969, and I will vote for it as one of the best films of the cyclonic decade.
