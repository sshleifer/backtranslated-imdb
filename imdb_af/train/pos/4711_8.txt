Oh, what's fun here! <br /> <br /> Amy Heckerling has a flair for directing comedy (Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Look Who's Talking), but here she seems to have told the actors to go out and have fun . Micheal Keaton blows through Johnny's role, easily his best screen performance. Joe Piscopo is wonderful as the appropriate name Danny Vermin, who did not pick up a shameful director on this. And I even called Richard Dimitri called Moronie and the character's unique vocabulary. I don't think it's an accident that most of the character's name is MORON spelled out. <br /> <br /> Good lines are sprinkled by the movie, with Peter Boyle, Griffit Dunne. Merilu Hennett, Merilu Henner gave good lines. . Even actors with small roles like Dick Butkus and Alan Hale get good benefits. <br /> <br /> Recommend it to a friend.
