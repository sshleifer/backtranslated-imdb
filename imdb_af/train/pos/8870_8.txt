When John Singleton is on, he is * on * !! And this is one of his better films. Not quite as strict as Boyz-n-the-Hood, but close to it (and many of the same stars cast). This film was very well written, very well composed, and very well shot. There is very little to criticize, and most of my complaints are superficial (for example: where did Fudge have the money for 6 years of college and very expensive things? No mention of a rich background. And why didn't Professor Phibbs a professor of his form * must have one ... And while we are on it, for an engineering student, or not, Remy is a pretty stupid character - I think he has a little more in the way of basic intelligence - He speaks and acts like a total buffoon. <br /> <br /> But it was aside, the movie was very sharp. A good variety of characters and views; and Singleton does not take its side in the story - many of the characters are unsympathetic and he does a good job of joining the pragher and supremacist scenes to show the folly on both sides. Much of the cinematography was excellent; I especially loved the scene where Kirsty Swanson gets intimate with Taryn and Wayne, every scene that is well-fused. The Malik / Deja screens were also well shot. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was a bit at times; this film has had a tendency to get some preaching sometimes and it is also likely to hammer the points that make it over your head when the points were just as clear with the bluntness (we don't need the American flag with "UNLEARN" typed on it, give credit, we are not morons.). And moreover, although most of the time Singleton uses melodrama, it's sometimes good, sometimes it gets too good. (Like Deja's death, it's good until she shouts "WHY !!!" which has ruined the whole whole effect and scene). <br /> <br /> But the acting was generally at the top of the line. Fabulous performances by Omar Epps (perhaps the best I've ever seen), Kirsty Swanson (who knew Buffy could act?), Michael Rapaport (surprised me from hell ... to True Romance and Beautiful Girls, though he was a one-roll factor, and of course Ice Cube and Laurence Fishburne are * always * outstanding. <br /> <br /> Upside down? Jennifer Connelly was flat; although it is not entirely her fault: her role was stereotypical and one-dimensional. Generic to the highest grade. And Tyra Banks, who had the role, was nothing less. She was crying and knocking and knocking. Another one in the long line of models-turning actresses that failed (although there are some that prove the exception to this rule). <br /> <br /> Finally, the soundtrack! Wow! A wonderful soundtrack (which is definitely worth buying!) That fits the movie like a glove. Every scene has a twin song (though the Tori Amos songs started to really annoy me ... not her best work). Liz Phair, Rage Against The Machine, Ice Cube ... How can one go wrong? <br /> <br /> All in all: a very good look, a very strong role, great screenplay, good movie. 8/10.
