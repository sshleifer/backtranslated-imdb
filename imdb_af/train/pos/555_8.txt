My comments would be added to the DIRECTION DATE, but I couldn't find a place for it. I was really surprised to see that this movie was released in the US in February 1955. I saw it in a "first time" theater in Washington, DC in March 1958. Wondering if it was released again or a problem? In my opinion, this movie is very light entertainment, but has some classic characters. John McIntyre is doing a refurbishment as a corrupt judge / entrepreneur / thief. Walter Brennan basically does the same role he did in Red River years ago. And in my opinion, James Stewart gives as well a performance as he ever did. I saw this movie half a dozen times or more, and don't get tired of seeing parts of it again. Photography and landscapes are wonderful, offering a remarkable amount of entertainment in one hour and thirty-six minutes.
