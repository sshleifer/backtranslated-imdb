I watched the movie while recovering from major surgery. While I knew it was just a "B" movie, a space western, I loved it. It may lack the flash of high dollar productions, but it kept my imagination and provided great escape. Unfortunately, our society is so much available, discounting small efforts is too easy. In the same way that I can enjoy an equal school performance of Shakespeare, I can appreciate many levels of performance for the sake of the arts. I am a police spokesman and found affinity with the retired LAPD. Dreams like she haunt me that I will not be able to respond in the moment of crisis to save someone's life (or my own). while it was a romantic ending where Farnsworth exhausted the bad guy (predictable), I needed a little happy romance where good could be overcome. My world is actually too cynical.
