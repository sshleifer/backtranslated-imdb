I believe many people rated the movie, not because of the lack of quality. But it didn't follow the standard Hollywood formula. Some of the conflicts are not resolved. The end is just a little too real for others, but the journey of rich characters and the long list of supporters is both thoughtful and very entertaining. Even cinematography is excellent given the urban environment, directing is also excellent and innovative. <br /> <br /> This is a 10 in my book. This movie won't put you in the normal and anticipated Hollywood writing. They took some risks and did a few things differently. I think it worked well, I deliberately try to avoid any direct reference to the movie because it is the best answer for yourself and does not accept anyone else's interpretation.
