A very cool flick. A must for any music snob. You don't really need to know the bands to enjoy the movie. Before the movie, I only heard two songs from the Dandy Warhols. The only thing needed is an open mind. <br /> <br /> The movie centers around the Brian Jonestown massacre. The Dandy Warhols play a role in the film, like the 'rival', but they are the second fiction for the BJM. The Dandy Warhols do not play as much of a role in the movie as I originally guessed, but then they did not have the element of excitement and unpredictability of the BJM. You can't help but are fascinated by the band and its very charismatic foreman, Anton Newcombe. In itself, it is an informative film and is studying about the music industry. Just look at this movie and enjoy.
