If you are amused by straight face, which is logical within a given illogical situation, you will enjoy this whimsical 8 minute Spanish film. <br /> <br /> A woman enters a small cafe. The scene looks ordinary, but the opponent, clients and two musicians somehow seem strangely muted. <br /> <br /> Suddenly the musicians play and one man starts to sing the title song and dance over table tops with musical comedy gestures. The customers, for the first time immobile, at intervals (bad but old) with phrases from the song, read from paper slips in their palms. Up and down they jump up and dance (uncomfortable but serious) into choreographic movements, such as Friends singers. <br /> <br /> But why ??? the woman is wondering. The answer is revealed when the soloist's jacket opens and she sees what has been stripped of his chest - just before the explosive climax ... Although you do not catch the song (probably ironically) songs, The situation-perfect performances should give you a smile and give a chuckle ... I'd love to see it again!
