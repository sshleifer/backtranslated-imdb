Alexandr "Sascha" Luzhin (John Turturro) is a former leading chess player who is returning to a tournament in Italy. His brilliance is indisputable, but his obsession with chess amazed his growth in all other aspects of his life. Natalia (Emily Watson) is a beautiful heir who, along with her mother, Vera (Geraldine James), came to the same resort to reach out to potential partners. Vera leans towards an attractive score, but surprisingly, Natalia is more fascinated by Sascha, whom she met on a walk. Sascha is also taken to Natalia and represents the marriage at the second meeting. But, with the concentration that Sascha must give to the chess games, and with other past events that still cause problems, will he win Natalia's heart? Oh and can he also become the chess champion? It's a beautiful film based on a novel by Nabokov. The acting is wonderful, with Watson very good as the beautiful little rich girl and Turturro perfect perfection as the shy, uncomfortable chess enthusiast. James gives a good turn, as the excessive mom and the other members are great too. As for the appearance of the movie, it can't be any better. The view is on the view, the vintages are beautiful and the cinematography is very appealing. Yes, the story is unusual and tells with the use of flashbacks, sometimes it makes a movie that everyone won't appreciate. Then the end is also bitter. However, if you love romance, periodic pieces, great acting, knockout scenery, or the fine art of movie creation, don't miss this one. You will be defenseless to withstand his multitude of charms.
