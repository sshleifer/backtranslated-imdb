Hidden Frontier is a fan show, in the world of Star Trek. The story takes place after Voyager returned from the Delta quadrant. It has a few characters from the official Star Trek shows, but most of them are original for the show. The show takes place on the star base Deep Space 12 and on various space ships, offering the opportunities that the official performances do not have. The characters have the opportunity to rise in the hierarchy, which characters in shows with only one ship have. The show has a good computer animation of spacecraft, but the play takes place before the green screen and it gives a green glow to the actors. Not all actors are equally good, but most do well. The episodes are character-driven and the characters evolve over many episodes. It's a bit more like in Babel 5, than in most official Star Trek performances. Hidden Frontier taboo even the official series has shrunk to use. All in all, I enjoyed seeing it.
