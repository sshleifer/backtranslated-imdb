No one understands the logic behind the number of Italian zombie flicks, but? honest ?? why would we bother? Every single movie in the Zombi "series" delivers a lot of fun, nasty gore and gratuitous shocks and "Zombi 3" is no exception to this, despite all the production problems that occurred during shooting. This film began as an interesting Lucio Fulci project, which had to be further expanded to its "Zombi 2" success, but it was eventually a typical Bruno Mattei product with more flawed and stolen ideas from previous films. The script is hopelessly inactive and ignores all forms of continuity. Every genius idea of ​​George A. Romero's "Night of the Living Dead" and "The Crazies" is scandalized here and the acting performances are truly miserable and painful to watch. Still, it didn't upset me for a moment, because the sublime top gears compensate for everything! On a secret army base at the Philippines, scientists completed the bacterial war virus "Death One" and prepared it for transportation. After a failed attempt to steal the virus, the infected body of a terrorist is cremated and the zombie axis infects the entire population of a nearby tourist town. The last group of survivors must fight hyperactive and inhuman strong zombies and soldiers in white overalls who received instructions to kill everything moving in the infected area. This movie is comparable to Umberto Lenzi's Nightmare City. Actually Bad ... but incredibly entertaining with fast-paced action ranges and several very creative zombie-madness situations. For example, the undead were original, and the entire birth order of the zombie at the abandoned hospital was also pretty cool. The notorious head-headline is not nearly as terrific as it is and it is perfect in this cute and well-pleasing Italian zombie movie. Recommended to the fans; don't care about the negative reviews.
