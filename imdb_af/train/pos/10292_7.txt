Let me start by saying I'm a great Carrey fan. Although I will admit that I have not seen all his movies * cough * the mighty * cough *. Bruce Almighty was pleasant. Neither of the other reviews really went into how cute it came to the end, I don't know what the authors think. Somehow I couldn't help but feel that this movie was a poor effort to re-create Liar Liar. <br /> <br /> The Daily Show's Steve Correl is positive and so is the rest of the movie. See Bruce Almighty if you're a big Jim Carrey fan, or if you just want to see a light-hearted soft music competition, it's a little funny comedy.
