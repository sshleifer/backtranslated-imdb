Never realized that Charles Boyer, (Luis Denard) and Lauren Bacall (Rose Cullen) worked together in a movie and enjoyed their big play together. Even Peter Lorre (Contreras) had a role in this movie and had a bad accident in his bathroom which made him weaken. This story is about a Republican courier, Luis Denard, who visits England during the Spanish Civil War and is trying to disrupt a coal mining contract that will cause great damage to other nations. Lauren Bacall, (Rose Cullen) comes to the aid of Luis Denard by picking him up and at the same time falling in love with him and then continuing to help him escape from a fierce crowd of English miners threatening his life. The real bad man in this movie is Victor Francen, (Licata) "Beast with Five Fingers" who delivers an outstanding performance. Great Classic 1945 movie without Humphrey Bogart.
