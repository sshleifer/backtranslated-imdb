When I first saw it, I was really impressed. The director made such a mysterious atmosphere, especially in the end. Throughout the story, spectators can expect Richard Thomas to kill, or he'll do it first. But the main point was not conflict, but. FRIENDLY! Older and adult ones prayed to save the younger ones who had all their lives. life. It is wonderful. Every time I see it, I enjoy it! Of course it is very violent like every action movie, but I think it's acceptable. Thank you Louis Liosa and Tom Berenger! Wonderful movie! I advise everyone to see it. I'm sure people won't regret it and will really have a good time.
