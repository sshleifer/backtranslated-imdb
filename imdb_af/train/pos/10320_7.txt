*** Possible spoilers *** <br /> <br /> I recently watched this movie with my 11-year-old son and was delighted to see that he laughed in the right places and was excited about the action sequences. Ron Ely is just like Doc. Cool, calm, almost always in control (and occasionally flashing in his eye). What can you ask for? I've never read a Doc Savage book, so I don't know if it's true to the source, but I enjoyed the light tone and finishing touch. Many people have compared this movie to Raiders of the Lost Ark, which I don't think is fair. The difference in budget is amazing (Raiders must have at least 10 times the budget). Doc Savage does not have the extensive place Raiders has. Special effects are also at a minimum, but come on people, the story is fun and the humor is just right. The Sousa music is striking (love the theme song. Every time I watch the movie, I end up with the theme for days). The best way to approach this movie is to just relax and enjoy. Highlights include the exciting opening series where the fantastic five and Doc the Indian sniper chase throughout the rooftops of New York and the VERY funny battle series between Doc and Captain Seas. Not so good is the villain who sleeps in a giant manger (really!). Overall a great movie to watch on a rainy day. I give it 7 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Doc Savage, Doc Savage ... thank God he is here!
