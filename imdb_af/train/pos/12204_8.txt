One can only get the film mr. Welles may imagine without the intervention of the studio! This film is a defective Welles, but worth every minute of it because it can see the greatness of perhaps America's best movie director of all time! <br /> <br /> We can see the toll taken on Orson Welles' filming of this movie. The story has many holes in it, perhaps because of the demands of the studio managers who didn't trust the director. <br /> <br /> It is curious to read some of the opinions submitted to IMDB that compare Orson Welles with Coen brothers, Roman Polanski, even Woody Allen, when it comes to all the directors what as followers of the great master himself. No one was more original and creative in the history of the American film than Mr. Welles not. Fortunately, we are still his legacy in retrospective appearance, such as the one that just ended the Film Forum in New York, or its films on tape or DVD. <br /> <br /> Rita Hayworth has never been lovingly photographed again. than here. If she was a beauty with her red hair, as a blonde, she was just too amazing for words. Everett Sloan and Glenn Anders made an excellent contribution to the movie. <br /> <br /> The only thing that made this movie a masterpiece to be added to Orson Welles' body of work was his own appearance. Concentrating on directing and starring another actor Michael O'Hara, another movie could be completely accomplished. Orson Welles must be credited for being a pioneer to take the camera away from the street studio. The footage in this movie is so wonderful that we leave the theater after we really impressed this movie for the work, the vision and the talent he gave us.
