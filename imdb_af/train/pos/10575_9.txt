Fast, funny, sexy and spectacular. Cagney is always great. Blondel charms you with her white and energy. Obviously, this is a pre-censorship movie by the innuendo in the screenplay, the costumes and the way they touch each other. And bikinis for there were bikinis! It's not a grip on everyone. But I don't understand John Garfield's problem. Does it matter whether he is in this movie or not? If he is, the screen is so short that he is basically a strut. You should look for framework to even find him there. I'm a big Cagney fan, but I've never seen this one. I found it on Turner Classics. I found it by a wonderful accident. Sit back and enjoy the ride!
