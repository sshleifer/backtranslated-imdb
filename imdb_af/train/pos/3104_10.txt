This movie was excellent. I didn't expect it to meet all the hype, but it did. Like all Bourne movies, the action is fast, realistic and intense. If you liked the other two movies in the trilogy, you will also love this one. The movie's plot is straight and there are no plot links that are too unrealistic. OK, Julia Stiles character who appeared in the Italian safe house, was especially far-fetched after what happened in Supremacy, but it makes sense that she is the only character in "Treadstone" that Bourne knows, it doesn't want to die and he may trust and be the only person to lead him in the right direction. The action is managed by characters and their reactions to what happens around them. The thing I always loved about the Bourne movies is that Bourne can kick kicks, but when it comes to people's battles, the battles are struggling and he does a lot of damage to them. They never treat the audience like idiots. <br /> <br /> All the actors were firm in their performances. I believe Damon Bourne can play in his sleep and receive excellent support from Joan Allen, who repeats her role as Supremacy, David Strathairn and Scott Glenn. I recommend this movie and the trilogy. But I miss Franka Potente.
