Wonderful film about the trials and tribulations of World War II England. What makes this movie so good is the touch of the human element. This film is definitely in the tradition of such British classics as "Mrs. Miniver" and "Hope and Glory." As in the case of the film, we see the despair of people at the time of war. <br /> <br /> The performances are excellent here, especially by the bitter John Thaw, who was assigned to a kid who was evacuated from the London bombing. <br /> <br /> We soon see how this child makes his bed law. He comes from a lean mother who has abused him terribly. <br /> <br /> The old man takes to the child and brings happiness into his sad life. When the child returns to his mother, the old man goes to London and just searches for tragedy. He literally kidnapped the boy and convinced the child to be better with him than to be in a boy's house. <br /> <br /> The picture is so good because it trades and builds on engaging relationships.
