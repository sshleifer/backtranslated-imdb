Poor geeky Marty (Simon Scuddamore) is terribly burned due to a cruel April Fool's daylight, went very wrong. Flashing a decade and those involved (including Caroline Monroe, known for horror fans for her innings in Maniac, Faceless & the Last Horror Film) in the prank is psyched for the next 10 years high school reunion not aware of a court garbage killer is hiding in school (now closed) and out of revenge. <br /> <br /> Breaking this one into a guilty pleasure, I knew it was a bad movie. It has all the features of one. Yet there is just something about it that makes me feel from time to time (preferably with beer in hand). I am even willing to ignore the absolutely terrible end (which I must say, I hate). I think I like it because it has a fun atmosphere about it and kills a little cool. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy (for the men): Josephine Scandi & Donna Yeager both get topless <br /> <br /> Eye Candy (for the ladies): A greedy cock shot by Simon Scuddamore at the start of the movie <br /> My Degree: B- <br /> <br /> Lionsgate DVD Extras: Optional trivia track; trailer for this movie; and trailers for My Bloody Valentine (1981), Monster Squad, Dirty Dancing
