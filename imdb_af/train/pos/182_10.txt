If you are unimpeded for the Gundam world, this is a good place to start. If you are burned out on Star Wars or Star Trek, this is a compelling, realistic sci-fi series that can be immersed in. Not the simplistic boy-save-world-in-the-big robot story you might have expected, but rather a complex, emotional compelling space-war drama where the line between "good" and "bad" guys certainly is less than separate is. <br /> <br /> Gundam 0080 focuses on the story of Al Izuruha, a young, naive boy living in a neutral space colony. He spends his days daydreaming on Mobile Suits and playing war with his friends. In the course of this series, Al's befriended an "enemy" soldier, Bernie Wiseman. By the end, Little teaches some hard lessons about the reality of the war and the suffering and sacrifice. <br /> <br /> I loved this OAV series, with its cool mecha designs, which include story and similar characters. I recommend this series to anyone who likes realistic SF anime, or to those who think anime is just stupid or sexy entertainment.
