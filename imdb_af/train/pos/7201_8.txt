Very good dramatic comedy about a playwright trying to figure out how to keep his head above water after not running out of ideas. Can't say much about this movie without giving away the story. I can say the little one was as if you were looking at the picture. Everyone has his or her own agenda. Nice surprise at the end - after all the other surprises. Well written with good performances by everyone.
