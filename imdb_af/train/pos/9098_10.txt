Domestic imports were a good movie. I laughed all the time. It was funny at so many levels of crazy outfits to the hilarious situations. The acting was wonderful. Alla Korot, Larry Dorf, Howard Hesseman, and all others did a wonderful job. Being an independent film written by a first-time author, it doesn't have the clich√©s that are expected of other comedies, which was such a relief. It was a unique and interesting one and you fall in love with the characters and the heartwarming story. I heard it was based on a real story? If so, then it is hilarious (and amazing!). I recommend this movie.
