If people didn't know who Barbra Streisand was before, ... (is it POSSIBLE?) ... they knew who she was after! <br /> <br /> This show has won five Emmys, and stands out as one of the best things Streisand ever did. <br /> <br /> It consists of 3 acts .... <br /> <br /> WORK I ... Barbra sings room to room standards, filled with musicians, including a segment where she again is a little girl, ending with a beautiful version of her signature song, (then) ... "People". <br /> <br /> WORK II .... A musical tour of Bergdoff-Goodman, while Barbra sings poverty songs. It's better than it sounds ... ACT III ..... The best part, Just Barbra, musicians, and some good songs, like ..... "Happy Days Are Here Again", and a "Funny Girl" medley .... All in all, a big part of television history, made by one of the greatest artists in the world!
