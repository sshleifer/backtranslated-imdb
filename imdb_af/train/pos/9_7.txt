Workshop romantic drama by director Martin Ritt is as incredible as they come, but there are moments of pleasure, mainly to the charisma of star Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro (both fantastic). She is a widow who cannot move, he is illiterate and a cabinet inventor - you can probably guess the rest. Adapting Pat Barker's novel "Union Street" (better title!) Is so laid-back, it's rude, and the performance of the movie is a mess, but it's still nice. a rosy blue collar fantasy. There are no violations for serious issues (even the illiteracy corner is just a plot tool for the subsequent love story) and no real fireworks, although the characters are deliberately a bit colorless and the leads are shown to an interesting extent. The final is pure fluff - and cynics find it hard to swallow - although these two characters deserve a happy ending and the picture won't really satisfy any other way. *** of ****
