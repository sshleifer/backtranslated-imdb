<br /> <br /> So, not being a poet myself, I have no right way to convey the beauty and simplicity of this documentary. The effortless movement of Goldsworthy, as he forms nature's beauty in his own work, is fascinating. Hold it together in a web hanging from a tree in a close-up for a few minutes while talking about its work and then receiving the payout when the camera cuts to the wide shot. Be amazed at the ease with which he works and then realize the futility when a little blows down the entire web. <br /> <br /> The genius of Goldsworthy seems to know no boundaries, as his inspiration is nature itself. It is in the essential change of nature where its work, although completed in its own sphere, is entirely made.
