For anyone who may think this show, it's not for them, please try it. Network television has degenerated into shows that are clones of clones or on reality-based shows with some often unreal people. This show is a return to family-oriented TV, with the emphasis on learning lessons, learning where real friends and family go, and perhaps even learning about our national pastime. Jeremy Sumpter is today one of the most enjoyable young actors in show business, and he has been perfectly cast as the young, slightly naive new batboy for the fictional New York Empires (big name!). Dean Cain, Christopher Lloyd, Mare Winningham, and Kirsten Storms star in, and they are all exceptional. This show deserves a chance to catch up and be seen. Hopefully it will stay for a few seasons and we can see how Pete Young (Sumpter's character) learns and grows.
