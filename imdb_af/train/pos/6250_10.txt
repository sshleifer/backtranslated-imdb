There is something special about the Austrian movies, not only by Seidl, but also by Spielmann and other directors. It is the pervasive sense of reality that the viewer never leaves throughout the movie. Dog training is no exception. This effect is achieved not only by the depicted stories, but also by actors playing. In Hundstage I have never felt like playing actors, but real people instead. So real is the visceral feeling of the viewer ... Almost as if the grumpy pensioner or lonely woman in the movie is living in your block. <br /> <br /> Anyone living in Vienna can undoubtedly recognize the people in the movie with their meckern / sudern (complaining), their hidden sexual urges and the prolo macho guys. This is further enhanced by the Viennese dialect, which, according to many, is made to complain as a way of life. A special parochialism and arrogance typical of Vienna is also well portrayed. <br /> <br /> The Viennese suburbs have a lively presence in the movie with their stupor and sleepiness where nothing happens. In addition, they have turned into a celebration of materialism with shopping malls and large departments. In between are the homes of the people where they enjoy themselves in what they believe are fun activities, which remain in contact with their human self, but in vain. The examples are the sexual game of the old lady with the men based on rape, the prolo man losing his nerves and hitting his girlfriend and the young woman who instigates and irritates her drivers. <br /> <br /> The film has no soundtrack, as it only focuses on the normality / abnormality of its images. Another distinctive feature of Seidl (and other Austrian directors) is his display of disturbing sexual images. This includes stripping the old woman for her husband, the sexual scenes in the bath, the sexual game of the woman with the two men in her apartment, etc. <br /> <br /> The Hundstage Seild portrayed the lives of people who could ultimately be as many Viennese as their citizens of Paris, New York or Madrid. The viewers should not be despised or sorry for the Viennese in the movie, because they themselves can become victims of the same human alienation and alienation, even in different circumstances. In the end, I believe Seidl's film is a warning to us about the terrible state of human relationships revealed so cruelly in Hundstage. And if the viewer does not submit to the reasons for this evil transformation, Seidl has achieved its purpose.
