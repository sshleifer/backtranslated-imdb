Robert De Niro, Cuba Gooding Jr., Hal Holbrook, and all the other actors and actresses in "Men of Honor" have combined to make it a fine movie. Mark Isham wrote the film choir so you know the music is really good. <br /> <br /> But: After seeing a whole bunch of goofs, loopholes, and overly dramatic strings, I had to make a vow from the start to ignore and put back to enjoy the movie . If you can do that, it's really good. <br /> <br /> The story of Carl Brashear, a real-life hero, is inspiring enough to last a lifetime. Watch him on the internet ... The whole story is more amazing than the movie, as the director acknowledged in his comment. There were only three African-American American Navy divers in World War II. However, no one has reached the status of the US Navy Diver. Carl Brashear was the first African American Navy Diver in the US. AND he was the first amputees diver to ever be certified as a US navy diver. (Sounding Applause). <br /> <br /> On the negative side of the movie's ledger: Should I just tell you about one of the many "loopholes"? Yes, I'll mark this comment as "spoilers" and do it ... The early turning point where the helicopter hits the radio mast and sinks into the sea: They would never have had the time to get a full suit Mark V diver, even though he was the legendary master chief Billy Sunday, in time to just save a few minutes. <br /> <br /> So, for loopholes, goofs and about dramatization, I have "Men of Honor "from a perfect 10 to a 7. Will Hollywood NEVER realize that the unparalleled truth is so much better than their excessive approach to storytelling? I doubt it.
