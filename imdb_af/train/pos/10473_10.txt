I was in a bad mood when I first saw this movie. For some reason it clicked on all my levels, tensions in a family, loneliness and the will of someone to share your life. It didn't hurt that someone who was living with you was such a beautiful girl as Claire (Cyndy Preston). I also bought the soundtrack to this movie (very hard to get). I loved it and hope it will one day come to DV
