It's a unique and bold movie. It is energetic, with highly developed characters. Very good performances. <br /> <br /> I like directors who aren't afraid to ask the audience to think. <br /> <br /> Bret Carr dares to look inside, ask questions and dig under the surface. By virtue of the nature of the film, it requires virtually the viewer to look inside. It can be brave to do this. I can see how some closest people may find it very disturbing. However, I thought it was much more than just entertainment. <br /> <br /> Bret Carr is truly an original filmmaker, with vision. I'm curious to see what he's doing next. <br /> <br /> See him.
