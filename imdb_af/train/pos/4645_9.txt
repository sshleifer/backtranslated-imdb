This movie is very interesting. I saw it twice, and Glover seems to hit the nail on the head with what he claims he wants to achieve. I can argue with the indignation that the film producer is expressing itself against the current mindless corporate drive that attacks our every media center and the things we should not think of as a culture because of corporate media control. The indignation that Glover expresses through the "outrageous" elements in the films is both evident in its visceral aggressiveness and beautiful in its poetic strength. I am glad that I have seen this movie and it is even clearer that Glover makes something interesting with part two of what a trilogy will be. That's right! EVERYTHING IS REG. See it too. People who dismiss this movie as "unthinkable" or "pretentious" really miss the boat. It's an intelligent movie. If you can see it with his live show, he presents with his books, which is also very angry. The way you go into his mindset is really something. You'll have an experience!
