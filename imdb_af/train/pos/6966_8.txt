Overall, I was quite impressed with the pilot. The initial first fifteen minutes was worrying, as it felt that the creators were trying to create a science fiction version of The OC, but this fear was rectified when a terrorist incident took place and from then on the performance in themes and situations that I rarely see television approach. <br /> <br /> BSG dealt with themes such as monotheism, existentialism, reality, death and terrorism, but they were mainly sub-text, there for the viewer to consider or ignore if they so choose. On the other hand, these subjects are the focus of the show and I found myself like such works as Ghost In The Shell and The Matrix as reference points while I watched and surprised how well the themes were discussed. I think if you're a fan of the two I just mentioned or other movies / television shows dealing with the subjects I referred to, I think you'll find something here at least. <br /> <br /> In terms of a point of departure explaining how the situation we know in BSG happened. I believe they have handled it in a very interesting way. I especially liked how they explained where the Cylon's faith came from in one God and the creation of Caprica just enough advanced and contemporary technology to make it appear in the future, but not quite for us as viewers. <br /> <br /> The only real weakness I noticed was the relationship between the Greystone parents and the actress playing Lacy Rand. . While I love Eric Stoltz and Paula Malcomson individually, their screens have uncovered their chemicals. At this stage it can be simple to develop their characters, but this is something I think work needs. I also found Magda Apanowicz in her role unconvincing. It may be time to experience and time to develop, but throughout the episode her acting has forced and not quite confident. <br /> <br /> Based on the pilot I very much like to see where 'Caprica' goes The future and hopefully it will become the bulk that SCC has ever done.
