It's a pity this movie is so hard to get your hands in the US. I found it through a rare video dealer, and it was definitely worth it. This is without a doubt the best film made during the pre-code era, and the best movie of the 1930s. Masters director Frank Borzage made wonderful films about the Depression, and with MAN'S CASTLE he created a fairy tale in the trouble of the era. Loretta Young and Spencer Tracy have a wonderful chemistry between them and help make this movie a great romance. Young's Trina is sweet and hopeful, while Tracy's bill is horrific and closed. The dynamic character between the characters creates one of the most difficult but ultimately rewarding relationships on film. <br /> <br /> MAN'S CASTLE is the most soft-focused pre-code movie I've seen. Borzage uses the dull and dreamy technique to turn the squatter camp where Bill and Trina live in a palace. The hardship of the Depression is never ignored, in fact, it is an integral part of the film. But like Borzage's film as a soft focus fairy tale craft, the love between the characters is less challenging. It makes the movie warm and loving. <br /> <br /> MAN'S CASTLE is the crown performance of the pre-code era. If only more people could see it.
