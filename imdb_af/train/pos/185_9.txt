I finally bought a copy of "Show People" and added it to my collection. I can no longer comment as previous viewers have said and the characters, plot and overall quality of this movie without repeating their own words. To see the cameo, the appearance of so many M-G-M silent stars is in and of itself. I really like the scene where Marion Davies plays herself and is experienced playing the main character of the film, Patricia Pepoire. Make sure you read her lips as there is no title card indicating what she says when she sees Marion Davies, but that is something that is the result of "I don't think I like her!" Pop the wheat, squeeze in the band and get ready to go back to movie history more than three quarters of a century. Enjoy it!
