I really like this movie. Bozz is an ultra-cool, not intimidated soldier who doesn't want to go to war. His persona is similar in a way to Yossarian in Catch-22, Joseph Heller's classic novel about men and war. However, this film is not in a war zone, but in a pre-war prep exercise. This wonderful film is about the sickening realization that the Vietnam War was a mistake and the men held to be sacrificed for a cause of loss. <br /> <br /> Colin Farrell is brilliant as Bozz, a soldier who is very true love and compassion for his fellow soldier, as he despised contempt and dissatisfaction with the business that tried to kill him. Bozz is completely cool and non-plussed, testing and tweaking his military superiors, getting their goats at every opportunity. He is a Jesus Christ figure with a psychology degree, "saving his fellow soldiers" and showing people in real need, the way out of the man's army. <br /> <br /> The acting and action are sharp and credible and As a "Sleeper", Tigerland goes down with Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket as one of the top three Vietnam movies in my opinion. <br /> <br /> FIVE STARS, a highlight.
