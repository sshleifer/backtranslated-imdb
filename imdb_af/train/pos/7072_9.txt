Twelve Monkeys is a crazy traveling, action-packed movie starring Bruce Willis, who gathers James Cole, a man who was sent back in time, to gather information about the devastating plague that takes place in November 1996. Unfortunately, he is also sent back. far until the year 1990 where everyone believes he is mad. <br /> <br /> This movie is exciting and has great plays by Bruce Willis, Brad Pitt and Madeleine Stowe. Twelve monkeys are one of the greatest time to travel movies that I believe anyone can enjoy. Terry Gilliam has created a true masterpiece <br /> <br /> 10/10
