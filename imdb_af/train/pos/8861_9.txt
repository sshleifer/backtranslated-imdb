Says Andy: "No one is hurt, everyone wins." Before he says it, we know the opposite is true: Everyone gets hurt, nobody wins. It's a new string in American movies, or maybe an old string has finally brought back. Think 'East Promises', 'There Will Be Blood', 'No Old Men'. These movies are dark, serious, well made, and don't care for happy ends. I love them. "Before the devil knows you are dead" fit the general description, but create an atmosphere of its own. Kelly Masterson's debut script will come as close to a Hollywood movie as a Greek tragedy. Tribute to fellow veteran director Stanley Donen, Sidney Lumet, makes expert and sober the bad story in an outstanding old school character drama. The opening shot, though of an obese accountant doggy-styling his trophy wife, has the look and feel of a Dutch master's painting. In contrast, the drug dealer's apartment looks more like a string of Mondrians. Great performances around the world. Only Albert Finney's character Charles feels a little exaggerated, eyes wide and tall, almost all the time. But then he is deep in trouble, deeper than any of the problems most of us will ever know. For compensation, Marisa Tomei is super warm. But of course you don't have to tell me this. Why her character, Gina, wants to be with a guy like Andy, we're never told, but that's right. After all, action is character. The unique and magical touch of Carter Burwell's music makes this fine movie a masterpiece. Don't miss it.
