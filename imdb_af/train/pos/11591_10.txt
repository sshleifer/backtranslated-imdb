I've been trying to find this movie for quite some time, and how good it would be to get it on DVD ... <br /> <br /> I watched this movie when I was about 6 years old , in the Netherlands. And I was very impressed. This was shown before Walt Disney's JUNGLE BOOK! <br /> <br /> What I remember about this movie is fragmented. I remember an Indian boy was friends with an eagle. It impressed me a lot. For some reason he was thrown out of his village (did not understand why). When other boys threw stones at him, he climbed a rock and jumped. At that time he became an eagle and flew away with his eagle friend. As an eagle he still wore his turquoise necklace. <br /> <br /> CB
