Okay, I know India is not in good light. But the overall theme of the movie is not India, it's Shakti. The power of a warrior, and the power of a mother. The relationship between Nandini and her husband and son swallows you in their warmth. Then things go awfully wrong. The interaction between Nandini and her father-in-law - the power of their dysfunctional relationship - and their lives changing, are the strengths of this movie. Shah Rukh Khan's performance seems to be a mere cameo compared to the credible despair of Karisma Kapoor. It's easy to get caught up in the love, violence, and deliverance of life in this movie, and find yourself a sigh of relief and sadness in the climax. The musical interludes are strong, credible and well done.
