Q.E.D. was a brilliant TV show and it was actually one of the few valuable schedules! I suspect in this era of TIVO and recording devices that it would go much better than it did in 1982. I eagerly await its availability on DVD! <br /> <br /> Whilst it is true that it has in common with other television shows like The Wild, Wild West, The Bearcats and The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr., of which I am a big fan of QED. had a much more intellectual quality to it. However, it didn't suffer for that - the dialogue was witty and the action was high. The show ran in the UK as Mastermind, and it felt something of the BBC, but with better production values ​​than the BBC had in that era. <br /> <br /> I was a nineteen-year-old boy when This series initially ran out and had too much in my life to make time for television. I remember my dear mom, but call me to remind me that Q.E.D. was on, and we would sit on the phone and watch it together. Wonderful memories. <br /> <br /> Truly, Q.E.D. is a sad loss and if it can be done with the same quality and values ​​today, I would like to see it earn a return.
