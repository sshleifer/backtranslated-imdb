Adam Jones has a brilliant sense of humor. There's nothing I didn't like about this movie. Cross Eyed was beautifully shot. Adam does a good job of not only developing the main characters but also the minor characters. <br /> <br /> Cross Eyed gives hope to every low budget movie out there. That you don't have to spend much to create something that is worth looking at. There is something for everyone. If you had a terrible roommate. if you've ever picked a dork in high school. if you've ever parked in the city. If you have any sense of humor, you will love this movie. This is the kind of movie that will be long ago and eventually pop up again if Adam makes a bigger name for himself. I look forward to Adam's future projects.
