Good action and interesting plot. Having seen the original, I have to say it was an interesting improvement and showed more of the movie. Good cast .. meaningful acting. Although it would be nice to see more expansion in the action scenes rather than the background story. Fun movie to watch and keep you all the time aware 7/10 is a real voice I think!
