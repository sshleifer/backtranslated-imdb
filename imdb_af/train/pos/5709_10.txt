In 1931, this foreign film was regularly seen and enjoyed. <br /> <br /> We open up in a quiet, small, French village that explores the roof of the sleeping residents. Then we hear something that sounds like a party. When investigating the riot, two neighboring men are told of the story of two men, presumably friends, who chose two numbers for the lottery. <br /> <br /> Our star of the photo has his number and his friend she. When he asks his friend, he will share half of the dough, if his ticket is the winning number, his friend says no. In fact, H.E. double hockey sticks no! is the way he deals with it. <br /> <br /> So when our husband discovers he has won the winning ticket and that it has been lost, without his own fault, he is frantic. Everyone is out for themselves, looking for this ticket, in something like a forerunner of "The Great Race." Although it's all a backlash, I've been in the knot all the time and get so upset about every thing in this all-for-my-money cash-in-the-bank movie. See Le Million today!
