When the US entered World War I, the government forced Hollywood to eradicate propaganda films. The little American is probably the best of the lot because it dies Mary Pickford. <br /> <br /> Pickford plays a young woman torn between two men: Jack Holt (German) and Raymond Hatton (French), but her decision was delayed because of the war, as both men engaged. <br /> <br /> When the ship sails Pickford, it was sunk by the Germans (think Lusitania) because it carries ammunition, Pickford has a wonderful scene like she on the lifeboat and shouts at the German commander. Later, of course, she walks in Holt and Hatton when she is held as a prison in a castle. <br /> <br /> Director Cecil B. DeMille offers a really good scene in this movie as Pickford and Holt wanders through a bombed village. They pass a destroyed church of which only one wall remains. Against the wall is a very large crucifix. As they watched, the wall collapsed, but the Jesus figure was suspended in the middle of the sky. It's a very surreal moment in a movie that is otherwise very simple and unbeatable. <br /> <br /> Pickford is always a pleasure to watch. She was always a very natural actress who avoided the arm-moving histrionics of many other actors of the day. She is also very beautiful. Holt is very good here in a leading role. Hatton is OK. Under the list of names actors in "extra" parts are Wallace Beery, Ramon Novarro, Colleen Moore, Ben Alexander, Hobart Bosworth, Norman Kerry, Walter Long, James Neill and Edythe Chapman. <br /> <br /> Not a big movie, but interesting to see American propaganda at work.
