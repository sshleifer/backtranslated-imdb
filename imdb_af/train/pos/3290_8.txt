Anna (Charlotte Burke), who is just on the brink of puberty, starts with strange dreams that affect her in real life - especially with a boy named Mark (Elliott Spiers) she meets in her dreams. <br /> <br /> Very unusual fantasy with some terrifying moments. Despite being a teenage girl and having a PG-13 rating, it's NOT for kids. Also, if you hate, fantasies stay far away. But if you're a game for something else, apply it to the account. <br /> <br /> Well directed by Bernard Rose with just a beautiful music party and some nice, anything scary. The only thing that prevents it from being a very good movie is Burke. She's not a very good actress (it's not surprising that it's her only movie) and it hurts the movie. However, all others are just as good. <br /> <br /> Muscles are very good as Mark; Glenne Headley is also very good, as Anna's mother and Ben Cross are both frightening and sympathetic to Anna's father. <br /> <br /> A sleeper got rid of in 1988, and has since faded. It's too bad - it's really good.
