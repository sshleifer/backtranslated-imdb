It was lovely, but still has nightmares over the hotel manager. The film is well presented, with the choice of actors who carry their roles to the reality of writing. Many scenes captured the imagination and created a nail bit. The progression of situations is cleverly written, and I believe the story was just one way to find a new twist on what I thought was the obvious one. Bad must be commercial. I have told many friends to look for further shows and of course I will see again. I enjoyed the painting of the movie and added it to the plot and intrigue. Husband and wife interviewed (or should I say fighting?) Very realistic. The initial situation is a common one, but the escalation in the story is happy. I would like to thank everyone involved in this great entertainment film. Thank you! Looking forward to the following movies --- when? Whidbey
