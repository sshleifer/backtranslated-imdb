I decided to see it because of the recommendations of this site. I should say it was worth it. However, please note that this movie is for 210 minutes. If you don't have the remaining power, get it on the tape and watch it in a few nights. <br /> <br /> Now after the movie, which I say, "spoilers" will contain and if you don't mind, go here: <br /> <br /> Alexandre is a runaway bum, a woman and a gigolo. He lives with an older woman named Marie. Marie owns a retail store and she cares for Alex. Alex spends his days at cafes and restaurants. The story shows that Alex had previously satisfied Gilberte with whom he lived. Gilberte threw him to a less attractive man she did not love because Alex abused and murdered her. At this point, Alex was willing to get a job and to help raise their child before finding out. Gilberte broke it down and planned to marry someone else. <br /> <br /> By chance Alexandre meets a nurse nymph called Veronika and they have a relationship. Veronika fell in love with Alex for the first time after all the sordid sex she had with men in the past. Marie and Veronika struggle for Alex's love and have a ménage à trois to start. Finally at the end, it was revealed Veronika was pregnant with Alex's child and Alex asked her to marry him. We accept (as before with Gilberte's situation), Alexandre will even get a job and be the provider for his new love and family. There is hope! <br /> <br /> With the title "La Maman et la putain", I realized that Jean Eustache was related to Françoise Lebrun's character from Veronika. She was a whore and then she became the mother. So, the mother and whore are the same person? Anyway, what do I know! French films are mostly (not all) very chatty, purposeful politics, preaching, theatrical, indifferent, sad and full of quotes. Lebrun and Leaud played their obdurate characters well and kept the movie together as some of the script was lost. <br /> <br /> Not a bad attempt. 10/07.
