Given the nature and origin of the 11 film producers, it is not surprising that this film is at best neutral in its attitude towards America. Probably the most 'anti' segment comes from Ken Loach, who certainly doesn't drag the British New Labor party line. Although the events of a year ago were shocking and painful for most Americans and most spectators they saw, they developed through CNN. The majority of writers and directors choose to show that the tragedy is not a US monopoly. Should anyone be surprised that these 3,000 deaths are given the same weight elsewhere, as the West gives thousands of Tutsi, Tamil, Bosnian, Chilies, Kurds (need) to victims. If it was a wake-up call for the states, it is equally tragic that the Israeli / Palestinian impasse comes further in the next 12 months while George Bush Jnr. would rather make revenge than to make the world a safer place. I think many of the contributors wonder where the idealism of the founding members went, and why America, built as a bastion of freedom, justice and tolerance, now sees its self-interest, while the Third World is wondering where the next drink, meal or bullet comes from.
