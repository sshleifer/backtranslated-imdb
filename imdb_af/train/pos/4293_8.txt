Alain Chabat is a fine actor, writer and director, but perhaps a little thing to get an idea of ​​a story they probably walked in when Aristophanes still learn that it is "I" before "e" except 'c. But, as I said, Chabat is a good actor and he can do charm if he needs it. I also gradually accelerate an aversion to Charlotte Gainsbourg who also changes in a decent performance. If you absolutely insist on knowing, the 'plot' is the one about the man good in his forties and more than the content to be single. It does not fit well with his mother and five sisters and gets them off his back. He made arrangements with a colleague's sister. For fifteen thousand euros, his new friend, let the romance come. fruit with a wedding and then wipe it up and get it out of the hook. Of course they come together, but along the way there is a sub-Benedek and Beatrice dueling and everything is thought to be a painless ninety minutes long and performing so well at the French cash register that a sequel might not be question need not be.
