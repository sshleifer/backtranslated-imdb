The industry dropped the ball over this. The trailer didn't do the movie rights and when it opened it was on a handful of screens. If people had the opportunity to see it, the work of the mouth would have made it very successful. The 2 main characters each give great emotional performances that really appeal to the story and especially the characters. I checked it out on the rave recommendation Richard Roeper or (Ebert and Roeper) in his book. An example of a wonderful movie that has never been released, except on a few screens. It had no chance of being seen. Some movies quickly go to the video because they are not that good. It is worthy of Oscar and it is a tragedy on many levels that most will never hear. Perhaps, via mouth-to-mouth, it will get on DVD or cable. If you haven't seen this movie, you should do it. Great performances of the 2 main characters make this movie. It might just have been another formal teenage movie to school, but instead it looks good on other worthy movies. Girl interrupted occurs. If you like it, you'll like it. <br /> <br /> Both girls are in one wonderful emotional scene after another without coming down melodramatically. Although Alicia is angry and Deanna cries through most of the movies it does, it's such a real way that they don't come across as stereotypical characters or melodramatic. The movie will move you in many scenes and if you are an aspiring actor, use these real performances as your school. Erica is even better in this than in Traffic. I hope both of these actors get more roles that use their talent and make them shine. See this movie and, if you like, recommend to friends so it won't get lost under all the naughty crap that comes out every year. This movie was buried while Spiderman recorded 2 tops. What kind of word do we live in? AGHhh. To fix the world, see it and recommend it.
