To call it a romantic comedy is accurate, but nowadays misleading. The genre has, unfortunately, deteriorated in cliches, focused on the main pair and with very little room for atmosphere and other stories, which make it formulable and too predictable. <br /> <br /> The corner shop does not suffer from these diseases: it manages a recognizable Middle Eastern European atmosphere and has a strong roll except the (also strong) nominal leads; I avoid the words 'support cast', such as Mr. Matuschek (Frank Morgan) plays a central role in the film and his story is as important as the romance. <br /> <br /> The 1998 movie You have borrowed Mail the 'anonymous pen' idea from this movie and was therefore billed as a remake. It is not correct and actually unfair for the new movie - it shares the genre and lends a plotement, but that's all.
