<br /> <br /> Filmed just after the war, this story was made to highlight Anglo-American relations after the war. It was finally honored to be the first Royal Premiere after World War II. <br /> <br /> Noteworthy is the film by the Royal Air Force, Sigmund Freud Psychology, the founders of America and several others along the long stairs (special effects in his infancy) and beyond the heavenly gates without any of lose its integrity. <br /> <br /> Although it sounds absurd, this powerful script leads the dancer between heaven and earth with the skill of a mountain goat and dances a beautiful ease that rarely fits in the cinema. <br /> <br /> Be prepared to warm your heart through this lovely, innocent and sweet love story. Roger Livesey acts like a man stealing the show! <br /> <br /> British Cinema must cry when it remembers how good it was in those early post-war years. <br /> <br />
