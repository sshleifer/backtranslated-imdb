Based on actual historical events, Reportedy keeps this disturbingly violent, bloody and shocking period of interest epic to the viewer by creating a verity lacking in most of the movies that take place in a remote era. Mrs. Bolkan's portrayal of the rebellious nun is a tour of power. Her gradual transformation in the character of an obedient as reluctant complicator in her social injustices of her day is proved by sequencing: her witness of the hated local Duke's accidental rape activity, her forbidden love affair with a Jew, her criminal apostasy to the intriguing Muslim forces of sensual Prince Ahmed (Anthony Corlan) There are some painfully realistic stingy rows (human flaying) in this movie that are not for the sick, but viewers with strong stomachs and interest in medieval history have a lot of interest to find. Earn to be seen, if only as an antidote to Hollywood images of the medieval world.
