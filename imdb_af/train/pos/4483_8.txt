Everything that should be a musical comedy. Gene Kelly (like Joe Brady) doesn't miss a walk, and Frank Sinatra (like Clarence Doolittle) doesn't miss a note. Screens with them are very good and show how much talent can contribute to a somewhat uneven plot. Sinatra's "I'm too easily in love" is an indication of his best and then best. Kelly's "Mexican Hat Dance" with a young Mexican girl is delicious. Kelly definitely earned his nomination as best actor. And there is a bushel of really funny lines, like: "You think the navy is dope?"; "You think someone is singing a sailor to sleep?"; And, "We got into a little trouble, we picked up a little child." An enjoyable movie, just the thing to shake off the dust of a recently closed World War II.
