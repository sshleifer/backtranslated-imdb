I grew up with H.R. Pufnstuff and the dashingly talented Jack Wild and now my girls also support Jack Wild fans. This movie is exactly what movies should be: fun and entertainment. This movie is also not limited to children. Much of the dialogue is aimed at adults and Witchiepoo's performance is something you don't want to miss. The music in this movie has beautifully adapted Jack Wild and Mama Cass. And as a Jack Wild fan, I'll never miss the chance to see him dance or hear him sing. Knowing the hard life Jack made now makes this movie even more wonderful, especially when he sings the opening song "As I Could". It pauses me in loving worship for him to give me wonderful childhood that I am now giving to my children. Let's all go to Living Island, where there is friendship and fun! And keep Jack Wild's memory alive by giving Pufnstuff to others.
