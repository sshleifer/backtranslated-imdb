An MGM-MINIATURE short topic. <br /> <br /> The editor of the Cole County Clarion has to decide what the right IMPORTANT NEWS are for his readers: a threatening ripe that can spell disasters for their crops, or the sensational shootings of a notorious gangster on their capital's main street. <br /> <br /> It's a nice little one-reel, with a good performance by the comic Charles Chic. Today's viewers may be more interested in the appearance of unknown James Stewart, as Sale's cousin / assistant. Slowly speaking and somewhat goofy, Stewart shows many of the features that would make him a big star in a very short time. <br /> <br /> Often overlooked or neglected, the one- and two-line short subjects were useful to the studios as important training grounds for new or emerging talents, both in front and behind the camera. The dynamics of creating a successful short topic were completely different from those of a movie with a function, such as writing a short short story rather than a novel. Economical to produce in terms of both budget and schedule and able to portray a wide variety of materials, short subjects were the perfect complement to the studio's feature films.
