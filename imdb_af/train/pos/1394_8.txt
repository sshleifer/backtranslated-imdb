I watched SHORE LEAVE the other day. I've seen it so many times, and I never get tired of it. Strangely, every time I watch it, it takes me the first time I saw it. Including this time. Must be the sense of mystery and "What's going on here?" it. <br /> <br /> Oddly, the one part of the story that ALWAYS felt uncomfortable and uncomfortable for me, had a huge impact on me this time. Ruth. I think a lot of it was Gerald Fried's score. A true masterpiece, this! The romantic part is reused - much more comprehensive - in this part of paradise. But of course it is debating here. I get the impression that out of all the girls Kirk knew over the years, she could have been the "dearest". When she said, "Do you have to go?" Combined with the music, I couldn't feel the pain she had to leave. <br /> <br /> Someone noticed online that Ruth looked older than he was, but she shouldn't be in 15 years of age. What makes me think ... MAY be one of the teachers at the academy. Kirk had a relationship with an older woman! (Perhaps he thought in MIRI when he told Janice: "I never get involved with older women." Maybe he meant, "... more." <br /> <br /> Read ST judge Other day, I see where someone compares WHAT IS a little girl with "I, MUDD. But SHORE LEAVE looks as well. What are all the people, if not androids? And can the Caretaker be related?" old episode of the previous episode, who he is, seems to be one of the RARE cases in ST, where you have a race that is actually "better" than just thinking they are. <br /> <Yeoman Barrows to fill in for Yeoman Rand, due to how much attention Dr McCoy has plunged on her, it's just another frustrating example of a potentially good character that appears once and then never pops up! Sheesh. /> <br /> One thing missing from the last few I've seen here, Spock smiled. He was! I saw him. I really prefer that there are 2 sides to go. yd, rather than this "submerged" business. When he said, "Enjoy yourself, sir." near the start, you can see it was not just her address to his superior officer but to talk to his friend. And in the end, when he says unnecessarily, "Totally illogical!", I can't help but think he's just doing it to challenge a reaction. He may not smile or laugh, but I think he likes his fellow crew members to see him happy.
