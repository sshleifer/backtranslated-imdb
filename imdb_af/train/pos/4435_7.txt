It's a neat little crime drama that runs a lot in its 65 minutes. It has all the right ingredients - a mysterious corpse, a weary middle-aged cop Corrigan (Walter Kinsella) and his newcomer sidekick Tobin (John Miles), a shadow killer on the loose and even love of the Tobin in the form of a female botanist Mary (Patricia Wright) who helps solve the crime. There is also a great shoot-out finale that takes place in a stone-cutter's yard. <br /> <br /> Watch out for a tremendous goof near the start of this movie where Lt. Corrigan refers to the dead woman as "Tattooed Tilly" BEFORE the suspect reveals that she has a tattoo (confusing, huh?). Later, when Tobin chases the murderer over the backyard, he is suddenly pointed in the wrong direction - no wonder he doesn't catch him!
