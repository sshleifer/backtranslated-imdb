This is the kind of movie for a snow Sunday afternoon when the rest of the world can continue with its own business while sitting down in a large armchair for a few hours. Beautiful performances by Cher and Nicolas Cage (as always) drive the plot softly. There are no rapids to cross, no dangerous waters, just a hot and witty paddle through New York's life at its best. A family movie in every way and one that deserves the praise it received.
