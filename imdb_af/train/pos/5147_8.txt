The first week of May brings back the memories of the Holocaust every year, through films on television. Of the movies they showed, it was the one I didn't see. <br /> <br /> The story is about Hilter's life and how he came to power. It starts with his childhood and ends with the fact that he has the best position in Germany. <br /> <br /> The movie was previously presented as a TV series and later converted into a movie format. Scottish actor Robert Carlyle plays Adolf Hitler with great fool, conviction and flare to give a true portrayal of this man. <br /> <br /> It's a good script and narrative that educates the audience about the key events that Hitler leads. in power, and also tries to show the probable psychological composition of Hitler. The movie is a biased view of director Christian Duguay? who shows Hitler as a one-track, threatening, angry and screaming person ?? who had such a strong grip on the Germans and people around him. Hitler is not shown as someone with charishma and attraction, and there the movie is not convinced by Hitler's portrayal. <br /> <br /> Although the business was for TV, all the ingredients of production are first class and on par with any mainstream movie. The production value, sets, costumes, etc. Was perfect. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of criticism on this movie, in the authenticity of the historical events being offered. But still the movie is going on, every engaging and entertaining. Robert Carlyle dominates and dominates the screen as nobody else does. He's incredibly good? brilliant! I would have liked to have a more balanced view of Hitler's life, because Hitler could bring out the dormant feelings of millions of Germans and it is not just he who should be blamed for the Holocaust. As I have said several times, very sad - our society loves a wreath or a person persecuted, as a representative of society's good or evil respectively.
