Absolutely fantastic garbage .... this one has everything: nudity, good fighting scenes, gore, action, explosions, etc. It also looks at the wonderful Belinda Mayne as Ingrid - not Olga as the other reviewer pointed out - although Olga changes in Ingrid Later in the movie (you have to see it to see what I mean). <br /> <br /> I won't go into the story because it's too long winds and not very interesting. The relationship between Ingrid and her brother Bo (Robert Ginty) is interesting. Look at the towel stealing scene to see what I mean. <br /> <br /> Immediately the fighting scenes were pretty good and then spoiled by some very scary gore effects that seem to have been done by the team that killed the City of Step (ie a strange colored blood grabbing from the neck wounds). <br /> <br /> I'll advise low budget waste supporters to check it out if they can find a copy - it's scarce and I can never see anyone bothering to let it go again, so It will be rare in a few years. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I only recommend it for Belinda Mayne's great naaktonele! That lady is a fox!
