Hamlet is by far my favorite of all Shakespeare's works. Branaugh is one of those actors. His portrayal of this was just wonderful. His soliloquy was breathtaking. For as long as it was, it's hardly a movie that interests me, but I was busy in this piece. I recommend it to anyone as well as fan of Shakespeare and those not so much. It has everything the modern world is looking for in its films: murder, betrayal and fraud. Not to beat Mel Gibson's version, but Branaughs gets the job done. It leaves no stone untouched. When you finish the movie, it will feel like you are reading the play itself. Um how you say "two inches up".
