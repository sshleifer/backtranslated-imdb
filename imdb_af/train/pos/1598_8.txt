Or, I love the suspension of any formal plot in this movie. I visited it many times and it always sticks. A little too stylized for some, but I feel that any opera lover will love it. Norman Jewison, a fellow Canadian, takes great chances with his movies and his decisions and it almost always pays into movies that are off-center and somehow enjoyable, like this one. I often wondered about the scarcity of Cher's acting roles, or she chose to reduce this part of her life or she didn't get enough good roles to chew. I found her to be a wonderful actress who can fall back into a role, like in this particular or hard and daring as in "Mask". I sometimes found the comic strips (a hair salon called "Cinderella"), but it was the whole intention of both the writer and director. Nicolas Page plays the anxiety-hidden tenor of opera, all exorbitant gestures, at one point that requires a knife to slit its own throat. The Brooklyn scenes are magical, it's a Brooklyn under moonlight, romantic and dramatic, just like opera. All in all, a very satisfying movie, not for everyone's taste through a long shot, I loved the end. Everyone brought it along like a Greek choir. Each part has subtly refined and merges with the other, the camera pulls away in the hall and leaves the players. talk. 8 out of 10.
