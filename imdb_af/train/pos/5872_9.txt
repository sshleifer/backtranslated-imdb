Who votes in these ratings? "Jacknife" is a beautifully activated, brilliantly observable piece of work, with actors on top of their game, especially Ed Harris and the inexorable Robert DeNiro (please do not mention Marlon Brando in the same breath of this man.) For confirmation of this point Is it an 'everyday' movie because it doesn't have sex / meaningless action / nudity in it.This movie is about the complexity of the characters involved.Ed Harris lets you feel with him every moment and his emotional eruption to the end The part where he ordered a young man in a bar to pull out his army clothes is a wonderful sight of how fashion and movies exploit tragic situations and how frustrated real men feel about a young sporty military Seeing on this topic, "Casino" 7.8 out of 10, one of the best movies of all time, one of the greatest directors, starring The Greatest Movie Actor of All Time, With The Awful to movie-psychic gangster ever, just guarantees above average? Come on !!!!!
