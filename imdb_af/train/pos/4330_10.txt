<br /> <br /> "Bleak House" is the best fit of a Charles Dickens novel ever created on the screen. Both of my favorite novels, I was extremely pleased with this Television Mini series. The late, big Denholm Elliot was perfectly thrown like the noble John Jardyce and Diana Rigg was pure perfection as the doomed Ladty Dedlock. The film captures the essence of Dickens era and is extremely faithful to the book, and no matter what the story brings. about all a brilliant, moving and atmospheric film.
