The movie is a bit "thin" after reading the book, but it is still one of the best movies ever made. Sheryl Lee is beautiful and Nick Nolte is really "vonneguty". He does good work to express the feelings from the book to the film. Not many movies involve the feel of the book, as well as Mother Night.
