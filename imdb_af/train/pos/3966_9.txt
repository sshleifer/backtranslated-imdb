JAMES STEWART plays an FBI agent who started working with the agency before calling it the FBI. The story involves dealing with the Ku Klux Klan, the gangsters of the Prohibition Era, World War II German and Japanese spies, etc. years of history; much better than any movies made these days. <br /> <br /> Special interest for older viewers familiar with Washington, DC. In a scene about 20 minutes in the movie --- where James Stewart from Vera Miles finds herself expecting their first child --- the scene in Herzog's Seafood Restaurant on the former Washington waterfront was filmed, the only movie in which this historical location appears. Shortly after his office, President Kennedy decided that Southwest Washington, a 99% black environment, was an eye and had to be broken down. In deciding on its position of undisputed royalty, the entire area, including the popular waterfront restaurant district, but excluding 3 historic churches; has been reduced to rubble. Black residents evicted from their homes moved best, and without federal assistance; Likewise, businesses were simply put out of business, little re-determination. Restaurant Row has been transformed into a sidewalk, and Washington has no waterfront (restaurants, seafood stalls, boats, etc.) for about 10 years. As a resident, the Herzog Restaurant scene was our # 1 reason to see this fine movie again.
