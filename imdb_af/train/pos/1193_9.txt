The memory of "The Last Hunt" held me, as I saw it in 1956 when I was 13. This is a movie that was far from others at the time, because it was treating the natives, the environment, and the ever-present contrast between the short and long-term effects of greed. It is as important today as in 1956, a biographical discussion of depth and relevance. To captivate it, the environment is beautiful and cinematography is excellent. The memory of this movie will be with me at the end of my days.
