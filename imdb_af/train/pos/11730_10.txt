What can one say about Elvira who has not been told in the world's press? The classic comedienne that Elvira delivers is presented in her first big-big comedy masterpiece. <br /> <br /> From the very first movie frame thing Elvira tackles a play that clearly says Film Great .... eat your heart, Bette Davis! See an abandoned Elvira, see an exciting Elvira, see a jealous Elvira, see a murderous Elvira. You can do nothing if we are astonished at her acting ability! <br /> <br /> At the heart of this comedy masterpiece is Elvira's desire for the Las Vegas galaxy. Although Elvira finds "the boob back in the boobtube" as a horror host (with the mostest), find the small screen emotionally .... and PHYSICAL! Nuff said, she grabbed her fast food and heads East ... A cool drink in one hand and a letter from her aunt's lawyer describing her legacy "windfall" in the other. <br /> <br /> I saw it. movie so many times, I can prescribe it verbatim. (Words will just show.) <br /> <br /> Grab a copy, laugh yourself, learn the lines .... <br /> <br /> Why didn't she win the best actress Oscar, for this role is beyond me.
