A comedy gem. Lots of laughter, the shop and bar screens laughed at me uncontrollably. The characters are recognizable and the dialogue is well observed - I know people like this! The humor is surprisingly soft and the film (which may sound strange) puts me in the mind of an Ealing Comedy. It's a beautiful little movie with lots of detail. It definitely takes a number of views. I've been watching it a couple of times (I've shown all my friends!) And every time I see something new - a little dialogue, something visual that I haven't picked up yet. I can get very picky and find some shortcomings in the movie, but I'm not going, because overall it is a fun, good-looking movie that is really worth a watch and that everyone should enjoy with a sense of humor. It's a movie she'll find friends and I hope there are a lot of them out there. Oh .... and it has a good soundtrack.
