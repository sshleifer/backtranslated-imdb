It comes from the left field, and it really isn't what you expect. But I love it. The most memorable movie experiences come as a surprise if you ask me. If you're not drawn to the mysterious "thing," which makes these brothers so strange ... you're getting a surprise. <br /> <br /> The role-play is fantastic but not so stretching it is tangible. The special effects come out nowhere (seriously, it's like a strange dark romantic comedy until they do it - then WOW) and they're great. The overall cinematography is easy on the eye, the editing and sound are very good quality, and the twisted story unfolds without clicking. Although none of these aspects individually make it an obstacle, the "what hell?" factor ALL makes it a movie treasure. <br /> <br /> The people who use this movie don't make sense. This is one of those often narrated flashes of the 90's that you have never heard of, or as much as you love the title of the title. <br /> <br /> I'm in the latter group.
