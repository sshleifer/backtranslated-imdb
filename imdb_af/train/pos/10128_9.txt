Here it is .. the first EVER episode of friends, where we are introduced to Control Freak Monica Gellar (Courtney Cox), new divorced Ross Gellar (David Schimmer), Hippy Pheobe Buffay (Lisa Kudrow), unknown actor and ladies (Matt Le Blanc and many sarcastic Chandler Bing (Matthew Perry), this is how the scene begins until we are introduced to the 6th and last friend Spoiled kid Rachel Green (Jennifer Aniston). <br /> <br /> The episode is better if most people give credit, like any new sitcom, the first episode is not always fantastic, the play in this episode is not good, because the cast can't really identify in their new characters (except Kudrow and Perry - what shines). <br /> <br /> Matt Le Blanc-Man, his acting was frighteningly right, because until later he becomes more confident, but I think he's trying to be funny, but most fail. > <br /> David Schimmer - Why does he speak every word? Not talking normally, but he has become one of the funniest characters in later seasons, but he is not confident. and I can't agree with him Jennifer Aniston's body is hot, and does a good job as Rachel Green, but we first see the real Rachel later in the 1st season. Courtney Cox-Look in this episode quite anorexic, it's alarming, she looks completely different now (more healthy), his acting a bit sketchy, but everyone is in this 20 minute pilot! Lisa Kudrow and Matthew Perry - I do these two together because their comic timing and acting quality were excellent, and Lisa was one of her first roles and she is as natural as Pheobe (Pheebs) and Matthew Perry is just Matthew Perry Hemself basically! The episode quality improves later, "like the Sets, they look dark and creepy in this episode and make them look unfriendly, the acting is OK, the characters get confident with every new scene and I'm proud it is the pilot! I hope we see the Friends reunited, because they will always be there for us!
