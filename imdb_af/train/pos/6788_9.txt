The story and the characters were the best I've ever seen. the graphics were good for the PS and the cuts and voices were great. I beat the game at least three times and loved it every second. I felt the problems faced by the protagonist were credible and realistic and I believe it deserves a successor. or at least a remake. If they made it for the ps3, I would buy the system for just that game and maybe mgs4 its wonderful also the idea and execution of the dragon system is enough to justify a rental and in addition to that advertisement on the inventory, it is sometimes false (stupid buster wall) battle supplement system and the plot makes this game a definite buy.
