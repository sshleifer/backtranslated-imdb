This movie is about style, atmosphere and acting. Truly, I didn't believe all the plot developments, but it didn't matter - the wonderful acting, the unexpected plots and the wonderful atmosphere set me up for the ride. good time. Kenneth Branagh is not only a good actor, but a master of accents, and he proves it again with a flawless Georgia accent. He was surrounded by so much talent in supporting roles (Robert Downey, Jr., Schindler's List and Fallen Embeth Davidtz, Tom Berenger, Daryl Hannah, and Robert Duvall) that I was simply blown away. I recently bought a copy of this movie, and I never like to watch it. One of the best exciters of the year. If you ignored this movie (and chances are you), then I suggest you choose it.
