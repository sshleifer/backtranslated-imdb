"Panic in the streets" is a fairly unknown little film by director Elia Kazan and was made before his classic masterpieces such as a Streetcar Named Desire, "On the Waterfront" and "East of Eden". Kazan won an Oscar in 1947, before this movie, so he was not completely unknown at the time. Still, 'Panic in the Streets' is usually a movie that has passed under the radar. <br /> <br /> The major aspect of this movie is the Oscar winner. It has a very good concept and its excellent tense material with a sniff of crime / film noir elements. The dialogue in this movie is also absolutely beautiful and gives the film a sense of reality and credibility. <br /> <br /> The cast is fairly unknown (especially when released), but it still contains Zero Mostel and Jack Palance in one of their first films. Especially Palance impressed as the tough gangster boss, with a very powerful face. <br /> <br /> However, the movie remains a bit on some points. The movie starts out very well, but after the start, the film slows down and does not always make the right decisions in terms of fit and the point of view of the story. <br /> <br /> Yet, "Panic in the streets" remains a perfectly viewable movie, mainly due to its solid writing and powerful dialogue that makes the movie a credible one to watch. For fans of the thriller genre, it's a good movie to watch. <br /> <br /> 8/10
