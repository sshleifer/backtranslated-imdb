This movie brings many memories to the classic theater of the guy, where the actors did not have to turn off their clothes to watch viewers of their movie. <br /> <br /> First, I think the main plus of this movie is The Wonderful Chemistry between Shahid and Amrita, it's definitely making the movie. <br /> <br /> I have seen a lot of comment on the movie which is sickly sweet and too slack. In response to this, I think it is to some extent a correct analysis, but it is a Barjatya movie. I think this has decreased significantly compared to MPK, HAHK, HSSH and MPKDH. HSSH was almost unbearable in some places. <br /> <br /> In this movie, when the sentimental moments come together, you find yourself smiling, wish the budding couple the best and hope nothing goes bad for them <br /> <br /> Another key benefits are the performances of Shahid and Amrita. Both performed very well, especially Shahid, who looks good in the movie. Amrita just looks stunning and needs to be taken seriously as a future big star. <br /> <br /> Although I enjoyed the movie as a whole, I felt it was too long. The drug could have been cut off and it could have made even more of an impact. I also think the music, although it fits in the movie if you see the situations are slightly old-fashioned and the movie could have benefited if a more up-to-date soundtrack was available. Although the picture of the songs Mujhe Haq Hain and Hamari Shaadi Mein is wonderful. <br /> <br /> All in all, I definitely recommend this movie, it is romantic, looks beautiful and has a dramatic climax (I'm not going into details, just if you haven't seen it. <br / > <br /> PS If you tend to cry, take a tissue! (I need some)
