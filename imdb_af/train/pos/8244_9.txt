Love it! What you don't want? You have your suburbs, you have your zombies, you have your family issues, you have your social dilemmas, you have yourself one fine Retro-1950s style Meat eat under class held at the bay by an awkward worry About Whether they have the next meal upper crust is. You can't ask anymore. <br /> <br /> Cast is great. Carrie Ann Moss is absolute perfection as a debutant social climber. She is both illegal and criminal conspiracy. Everybody's dream. K'sun is really great, because the boy is trying to survive in this nightmare as normal as possible, and somehow succeed. He is a true screen presence. Many photogen, and of course. Without calling them all, the rest of the cast is wonderful. Henry Czerny plays a suspicious policeman with dog instincts and a little squeamness as if it were his everyday person. Billy Connolly is great as Fido. A good actor: I wish he played the title role in "Braveheart", directed by Gibson. My sense is that she would be closer to the real character of William Wallace. His Fido is contained, yet accessible. A good touch. In short, a great and wonderful satirical pussy on moral values, social tensions, feelings, growth, uncertainty in the difficult times and compensating adjustments to impossible conditions. A true reality show.
