Part of what was so nice about the classic Looney Tunes cartoons was their relentlessness and how they were not afraid to do anything they wanted. In this case, Marvin the Martian has a command to bring back a ground. Sure enough, he comes across Bugs Bunny, who warns of a mutiny of Marvin's dog. After Marvin finally caught Bugs - through an Acme-beating jacket protruding bazooka! - Bugs have been planning more things for the trip back to Mars. What I mean, if you thought it was a big change in the Solar System when they uncovered Pluto from its planet state, you see nothing yet! Yes, "The Hasty Hare" goes all out. How they buy Acme products in outer space is probably outside most people, but the point here - I mean "hurry" - is having fun. And believe me, you will definitely. After all, a little space-out doesn't hurt anyone.
