Surprisingly not terrible and well animated for one of Disney's straight to video discarding sequels. Like the previous successor (The Lion King 2), I was delighted that Disney had brought back most of the original voice actors, which made a huge difference and kept a good level of traditional animation. The plot wanders around for a while, but we are distracted by an everlasting series of jokes ranging from hilarious to boring. To break the standalone plot and jokes, they gave us some dull musical sequences, much like jokes, from entertainment to a quick trip to the fridge. For the most part, the MST3K-like moments are vague and full of untapped potential and do not add much to the movie, except to serve as a vehicle for an hour-long flashback. The new characters are at least nice, and the old characters are doing their thing so I can't blame them there. Overall this movie is not bad and it makes for a nice frivolous filling between the more serious Lion King titles.
