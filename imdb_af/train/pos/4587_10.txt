Although John Woo's Hard Boiled is my number 1 favorite movie. But I have to say police story is my number 2 favorite movie. I say this because the stunts, the battles and the action are my favorite part of the movie when Jackie Chan grabs the track on top of the esculator at the mall, grabbing a pole surrounded by Chrismas lights and sliding down the poles through a roof and finally on his back on the hard marble floor. Ouch! Buy it at amazon.com for 14:98. (Or something in $ 14.) VHS new line home video. any questions or comments please feel free to reply. (I'm only 14 but I know where to find any movie ever made.) If you're watching a movie anywhere and can't find it, please reply to me. Thanks and good night!
