Hi: <br /> <br /> I heard of a co-worker who had clear differences of opinion about entertainment, he loved it. Well, I watched an episode or 2 in the early seasons and was bored, so I worked it out. After a few years I stumbled; bored with the current sci-fi price. Wow I was surprised. Can you say gravity, damn I sucked. The pass and mini-dissertation are very good, some of the flash forward / back are so with the lame characters, but about everything good. My favorite characters are Ben, Locke, Jacob, Richard Alpert, Sayid Jarrah, Sawyer, Hurley, Daniel Faraday, Jin & Wife, Walt, Charlie, Desmond and Jack's dad. Jack and Michael are definitely immature asshats, very spoiled and immature. Kate 1 step above them, Juliet was much nicer than Kate. Mr. Eco-way under-estimated and at Charlie's level, if not more, bad, they both died. The black-dressed man talking to Jacob (back) is a real curiosity. As a very large, very low range: look for more. <br /> <br /> greetings
