When Braveheart first came out, I was surprised, and surely one of the fastest fans of the movie. When Rob Roy came out, I was intrigued, and although I enjoyed the movie, I didn't think it was a good movie. However, as time goes by, my appreciation for Rob Roy has grown, and my enthusiasm for Braveheart has dropped. Braveheart is a good entertainment, certainly, but there are also mistakes. The most significant, in my opinion, is the striking representation of Robert the Bruce, who was without a doubt Scotland's greatest king. Another is the historical inaccuracy of the film, which affects the film in relation to the many historical distortions. I also find it hard to see in the movie, which I first saw (at least through me), that the beginning of Mel Gibson's egoism can be seen for the first time. In contrast, Rob Roy has grown over the years. Partly because it largely avoids the mistakes, I think most in Braveheart. But also because Rob Roy is like good wine, grows more mature and complex with every viewer.
