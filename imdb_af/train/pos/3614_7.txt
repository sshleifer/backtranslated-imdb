Girlfight is like your grandmother's cooking: the same old recipe you've tried a million times before, but somehow transformed into something fresh and new. Try the story to people who haven't seen it before: A young women on the wrong side of the track is trying to improve her situation by taking up box while bitter, obstructive father and her growing appeal to a male competitor. Watch them roll their eyes on the rope cliches, and they are right: this is * clich√©d. Yet, I was hypnotized by how well this film works, because of the often excellent acting and dialogue, and sensitive direction that makes it 'new'. I avoided it at the theater because it looked like a complete crap, but didn't make the same mistake I did. Definitely worth a look.
