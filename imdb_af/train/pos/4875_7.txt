"Father is still away from business" was the head of a review after "Promise Me This" premiere in Cannes. I understand why many think the same, but the unique expression of Kusturica is still in its new movie and is why critics cannot touch it. I had two hours of pure energy without rest. Even when Kusturica suffers from a lack of concentration or fear of empty space, it is still unique and untouched. Surprisingly good performance by Stribor Kusturica. Many more close-ups and fewer landscapes than in life are a miracle. Marija Petronijevic has five times deadly world-class potential, don't spoil it. Certainly, I recommend everyone to watch this movie.
