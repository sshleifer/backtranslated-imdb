Given how corny these movies are, you need to find out they had to have fun making them. The film focuses on a house that strangely accommodates who lives there. The residents were: writer Charles Hillyer (Denholm Elliott (with her!)), Played by one of his own creations; Philip Grayson (Peter Cushing), who gets a little too close to a wax picture; John Reid (Christopher Lee), whose daughter's gift is apparently a facade; and actor Paul Henderson (Jon Pertwee), about to get a little too much in character. <br /> <br /> The house that has dropped blood is actually worth seeing (well, it's stars Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee). Aside from just neat, there may be some undertones: it may be the issue of real horror vs. disregarding disgusted terror. As in "The Shining", we can wonder if the home / hotel itself has some remembrance of past events. And if absolutely nothing else, Ingrid Pitt (like Paul's co-star) is warm, hot, hot! Around the time it came out, she also died in "Countess Dracula" and "The Vampire Lovers" (also with Peter Cushing). Maybe she, just like Barbara Steele, is just known as a screaming queen, but notice my words: She's a hot screen dream! I would like to see Ingrid Pitt and Barbara Steele in a fellow star. <br /> <br /> I think the only strange scene (so to speak) is where Denholm Elliott wears a pink shirt and soft jacket. You read it right. What kind of a name is "Denholm" anyway? Oh good. A very cool movie.
