I only saw it at a foreign film festival. It's a beautiful nail bitter about a plot to relieve the Estonian treasury of a billion or so in gold. It's all shot in an eager, graceful style that seldom uses Hollywood - but it captures the atmosphere of the newly populated Baltic states in a beautiful way. (Note: Tallinn was actually much less grim in 2003 when I was there). <Br /> <br /> There's also a lot of humor and a little romance. I do not want to spoil quite a few surprising but logical surprises, so I will just say this heist movie starts with a great script, and the directing and performing are also. DARKNESS IN TALLIN is simply the fastest and most nervous example of its genre --- I will set it against RAFIFI, TOPKAPI, and it is miles ahead of the new OCEAN's 11, though (deliberately) not so shiny. RENT OR BUY NOW.
