This film has a clear story, which is quite unusual for the music genre. Cats, Phantom of the Opera and Andrew Lloyd Webber's musicals can be considered metaphorical as they use literary works as their framework. The storyline of Biarkan Bintang Menari (BBM) is at the heart of human relations, especially those of Indonesian people. Despite the fact that the film was based on a "supposed" fairy tale, it is actually a fantasy of the "child" in Indonesian adults. The dance series are not perfect, but the songs represent how Indonesians express themselves. I think the choreographer should explore Indonesian way of dancing by not upset the fact that Indonesia's dance development tends to be more westernized. The dance sequences seem uncomfortable in some ways and not synchronized with the songs and / or music. Still, I still love this movie and consider it a new wave of Indonesian movie genre that I hope to improve in the future.
