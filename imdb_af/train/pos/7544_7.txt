Japanese animators have a unique freedom with animation. Therefore, they tend to come out with such movies, movies that eventually end up on anime fans hard drives and students' floors, but are completely ignored by anyone outside his country of origin. Cat Soup is one of those films that are supposed to be analyzed on drugs or deeply from Western eyes. Really, it's just a beautifully detailed surreal journey. <br /> <br /> There is no real dialogue that makes it easy to pass on to other stakeholders who are not interested in things like subtitles. A cat and its half-dead (brain death?) Sister travel through different landscapes of imagination and association. There is a general theme of water or lack thereof (possibly due to the cat who drowned in the beginning? Possibly due to the title?). There are some interesting types of Genesis tasks. There is a pig that will eat themselves. An elephant made of water. And it is beautiful, compelling, exciting and fun - provided you don't look around the druggs, which can't experience something visually unique without comparing it with an acidic journey. Eventually, the movie turns off and adds another compelling self-reflective level to the proceedings. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
