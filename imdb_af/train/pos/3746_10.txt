I love this movie / short thing. Jason Steele is wonderful! My favorite parts are The French Song and in the opening title when the spatulas "SPOONS!" Shout. Every time I turn up. I would recommend this movie to Knox Klaymation fans and people who enjoy Jason Steele's other movies. His style of animation is very original. It takes a few views to see the detailed backgrounds. His humor is also hilarious, and is definitely not something you would have heard before. Like Max, the distorted Spatula, which has a sound and light system in its head, radiating colorful lights and happy music when talking about his unhappy life. It's a great animation to watch anywhere.
