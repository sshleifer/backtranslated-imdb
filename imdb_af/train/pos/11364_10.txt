Rea, Sutherland, DeMunn, and von Sydow (in a small role) are all brilliant in their performances. Sutherland is particularly knowledgeable about this kind of role, where he must portray a character whose morality is, first and foremost, unsure of the audience. As is so often the case with Sutherland's characters, we must ask: "Is he a villian [in this case a minor] or a hero?" <br /> <br /> It is a disturbing story that is intelligently told, about the incompetence and terrible bureaucracy in the old Soviet Union that hampered the efforts of highly skilled people. As Sutherland's character sharply points out: "The degree of bureaucracy is its ability not to make special exceptions". The "committee meeting" (between Rea and Sutherland's characters) after perestroika is enforced, with its revelations, having a tremendous emotional impact. You can experience the suffering of the dedicated people working in that system. <br /> <br /> The handful of dramatic scenes depicting victims' relatives add emotional resonance to the impact of the story. It is rarely a feature of a movie with this sickly subject, but effectively reminds us that the victims were alive and beloved. <br /> <br /> It is a sad but very important movie that earned its showcase. on Canada's History Television.
