When I first heard of the title, I thought of 'The Simpsons', just like many other reviewers, but when I saw the movie, I was completely amazed that so many great character actors were actually in it! First, we have Christopher Walken (Deer Hunter, Pulp Fiction), who plays the title character, McBain. He is rescued by some of his friends from a Vietnam POW camp. One is Santos (Chick Vennera, Yanks), who shares a HUNDRED DOLLAR BILL with McBain (Vietnam soldiers were apparently loaded with cash) and told him he could do the favor if he ever got into trouble. <br /> <br /> When 18 years later, Santos and his sister Christina (Maria Conchita Alonso, The Running Man, Predator 2) joined the rebels. In Colombia, trying to get rid of their evil dictator, El Presidente (Victor Argo, Taxi driver, King of New York), and when Santos misses the mission, Christina goes to McBain for help. <br /> <br /> McBain then asks his good o 'Vietnam friends to help him. Firstly, the token-tough black man, Eastland, played by Steve James, an American American, who was also in director James Glickenhaus's previous film, The Exterminator, where the explorer's real name was also Eastland coincidental. I do not think so. There are also many other references to The Exterminator, including the most remarkable one that McBain himself wears a welding mask when Christina sees him for the first time when working on a welding on top of a bridge! <br /> <br /> The other guys in the Vietnam suit are: The rich man who can afford all kinds of equipment for the team, Frank Bruce (Michael Ironside, Total Recall, Starship Troopers) and then there is the doc, Dalton (played by Jay Patterson, who doesn't look like the man with whom the IMDb links, and I didn't see him in other movies, who knows), and last but not least, there's the policeman, Gill. having had enough of his unsatisfactory work, he was played by Thomas G. Waites, who may remember some of us from The Warriors and The Thing. <br /> <br /> And in other major roles, we find Luis Guzm√°n Boogie Nights, Carlito's Way, as a retailer who can't find a decent job. There is also Dick Boccelli as the drug-dealing Kingpin who is hanged in a tap on a roof at the McBain gang. Almost exactly like John Eastland in the Exterminator movie! Now, I haven't seen Glickenhaus "Shakedown / Blue Jean Cop" yet, but I'm almost ready to enter a hundred dollar bill that Boccelli is also hanging in that movie! <br /> <br /> Back to the plot of this movie. They go down to Colombia and save the day, yay! But whoever cares about the plot anyway, the role is great, and the action screens are very well done, and you are never bored while watching this movie! Highly recommended to all action lovers!
