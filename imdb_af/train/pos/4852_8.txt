Now it's one of Big's Best, Jack Hulbert's single role in 1931 split into two for Band Waggon radio team Askey & Murdoch. It boasts a large stable black throw, which fixes the game for everything they are worth, especially Askey of course. Histrionics is supplied by Linden Travers, melodramatic by Herbert Lomas, and pragmatics by Richard Murdoch. <br /> <br /> The group of railroad passengers stranded at the lonely station finds more than they bargained for, haunting trains, spectral porters, hairy sausages and Arthur trying to entertain them all. His repartee with everyone falls between his fragmentation and terribly boring. When the formula works, it is very good, but it is sometimes very confronted and forced to make the movie look more dated than it is. But those damn treacherous fifth columnists - thank you that no God has Britain yet today! <br /> <br /> Ultimately, a nice innocent movie, to return to the TV screen as an old friend, but if you expected to be shaved out of your wood, you'll probably be very disappointed!
