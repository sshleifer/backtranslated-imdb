A beautiful film that thoroughly touches the simple but divine aspects of humanity. <br /> <br /> This movie was almost perfect, and since nothing in this world can really be perfect, it's pretty good. The only small thing I objectively object to is pacing on some points in the middle of the story. The acting is also very good, and all the actors can easily top the actors in high-profile films. The real guidelines seem to be well thought out, and the writing must have been wonderful. There are a few breathtaking moments of shadow and a rather beautiful, continuous circular composition of the story. <br /> <br /> The moment in the movie, when the main character reaches the feel of heaven, is the perfect ending to a truly brilliant yarn.
