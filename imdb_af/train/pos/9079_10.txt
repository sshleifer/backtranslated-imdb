This performance will succeed as it appeals to all adults, no matter where they are in their relationship. As a 26-year-old man, I empathize with Patrick Warburton's character: he loves his wife, but he assumes she knows it. I also enjoy his monotonous delivery; never get too excited or too low. A nice ensemble characters. It will be a great addition to the Monday night game. <br /> <br /> I don't know how David Spade will be in his role. He enjoys the best in small doses. He also looks a little old to still meet for women. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the pilot and I'm looking forward to seeing the series evolve.
