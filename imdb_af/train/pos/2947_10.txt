If you haven't seen it, you don't know what you're missing out on. The first time you do this, you'll be in the pain on the floor, and you'll be so hard to laugh. <br /> <br /> It's so funny. There wasn't a single comedy show up to this date, because I saw the tops or even got close. So much classic one linen, stories and segways. <br /> <br /> The drunk uncle at the BBQ, Gi Joe, Mr. T, goony goo goo, ice cream man, you say any of these to anyone who saw this show and I will pay your money to donuts. They will not be able to hold a straight face and will burst out laughing or dismiss the rest of the dialogue. <br /> <br /> Pure classic !! Shame, you can't get it on DVD. <br /> <br /> Rating 10+ out of 10
