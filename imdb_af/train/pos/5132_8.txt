Jazz aficionados will treasure this classic brief and some of the best jazz men just do their thing. It's like watching another music video today. <br /> <br /> The jazz men give us an extra surprise in the person of Marie Bryant singing a classic version of On The Sunny Side Of The Street. I've never heard her, Bryant sounds remarkable like Billie Holliday. It is a complimentary people. <br /> <br /> Their instrumental work is also tops. With the black cinema of his time fed many white stereotypes, this film has to be watched and appreciated. No great production values, just a very good music.
