- SMALL SPOILER HERE! - <br /> <br /> Looking at the votes for "Creep" today, I was amazed at so many IMDb users judging this movie "1". I wonder: What do people expect from such a movie? Are there so many people watching a movie without knowing about it? <br /> <br /> "Creep" is a HORROR movie and it's a good thing! It automatically means: it has an absurd story full of holes, outrageous dangers and simple one-sided characters. So why complain about it? Just take popcorn and coke, make yourself comfortable in your seat and then ... ... enjoy scaring death! The first 60 minutes when there is almost nothing but Kate and a lonely metro station are incredibly scary. There is tension and fear in every corner of the screen and you will give some jerks due to the sudden sound of a shimmering neon lamp in the back of you. (In my opinion, the audio editor did the best work in this movie.) <br /> <br /> When Kate meets her pursuer, the quality of the movie falls, but it does not become a bad movie. The second part of the movie is not scary at all, but the gore effects are well done and the story is quite well developed. (... as long as you keep in mind that it's a horror movie you're watching and not the Discovery channel!) So, if you want to make yourself a very, very scary hour. Just look at the first hour of "Creep" and then turn off the cinema or turn off your TV. You know the rest of the story anyway or not? The bad man will die and Kate will be the only survivor. But even if you watch this movie to the end, you won't be disappointed. <br /> <br /> ... and if you want to push anxiety to the next level, do what I did after watching this movie: leave the theater at dark night, go to the next subway station and take the last train home ...
