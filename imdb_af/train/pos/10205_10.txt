I accidentally chose this one, it was behind the movie box of what I thought I was renting, didn't find out before I got home. Absolutely FANTASTIC! a wonderful movie, and one of my best three favorites of all time, I recommend it to everyone! <br /> <br /> The story is enjoyable and easy to follow. It could have been easy, but the actors and director do a good job of keeping it together. <br /> <br /> The actors themselves are fantastic, show great character and do a great job. <br /> <br /> I need somewhere to get a copy ...........
