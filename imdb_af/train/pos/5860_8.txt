An enjoyable game that offers fun and easy gameplay and a fair gameplay. Staying at the comic book and providing a low learning curve gives this game something not seen in most action patterns today. Also the narrative and animated scenes used (although long animations are replaced with slideshows on the Nintendo 64 version), take full advantage of the capabilities of the platforms.
