Quite simply, the funniest and brightest movie comedy of all time ... it's definitely on my personal top ten list. This one also gets a solid ten on the voting scale. Millionaire heir, Arthur Bach (Moore), is a middle-aged 'child' who refuses to take on the adult path and avoids all necessary responsibilities. He also refuses to leave the bottle. One day, he and his personal farmer Hobson (Gielgud) will be shopping at Bergdorf Goodman's and running in grandchild, Linda (Minnelli). Arthur and Linda's chemistry adds electricity to the rest of the film. There is a spectacular set. In one such scene, Arthur (drunk most of the story) knocks on the wrong door and receives overcrowding threats from a human siren '("My husband has a gun!) Properly noted: Geraldine Fitzgerald plays Arthur His loving but relentless grandmother Sir John Gielgud steals the whole show with his sour droll isms (he recorded the Oscar for this one), and Christopher Cross provides the main theme song (Oscar winner The best you can do. ) It is a pity that late Dudley Moore passed away last month (March 2002).
