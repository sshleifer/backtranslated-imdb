I only saw the movie when I was a little kid and immediately fell in love. The sets are breathing and some of the writing is sorry, it's hilarious: "You boys of a thousand fleas." <br /> <br /> It is always shown late in the evening on television or really early in the morning I woke up around 3am once and it just started. TV companies need to show a little more respect and place it on the leading Sunday so everyone gets a chance to see this fine work. <br /> <br /> 10/10
