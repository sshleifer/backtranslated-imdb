I know I want to keep this movie, and for the most part I do, but as others have said, it is a bit long in the tooth. I also found the angry hormones of the entire male crew to be a little annoying. It's a wonder they didn't even bend and cry at the moons. I also have to say it all, the movie makes me cold. It is a very sterile atmosphere that permeates the film. On the positive side, the effects are huge (except the cartoon), as well as the effects, props, costumes and of course Robbie. If the robot wasn't in this movie, I don't think it would have been as popular as it was. The second half of the movie is steaming as we start exploring the forgotten Krell gadgets. As many times as I saw this movie, the Krell still made me scratch my head over exactly who or what they were. Based on what was produced at that time, the Forbidden Planet, in addition to "This Island Earth", is above average Sci-Fi movies of the time. To be filmed also adds to the enjoyment. Certainly a classic in its own right, mistakes and all, and deservingly so.
