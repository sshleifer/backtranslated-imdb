Farrah Fawcett spent the better part of her post-Angel career, with an occasional remarkable performance between her Playboy French and Letterman escapades. But when it comes to it, it's not denied that this girl can act. Far from a story of epic relationships, this well-done TV movie is soft, quiet and sometimes moving. Fawcett plays the brave black sheep daughter alone at home to find that she has missed the last days of her mother's life as well as the funeral, to the chagrin of her more stable and presumably more sensible sister. Brad Johnson plays the love interest, and a story unfolds with all the typical elements of the phone frame - but then there is always that confusing Farrah to look at, and she is indeed equally watchable. (And yes, I admit it, I went back to that Farrah poster on my wall). Silk Hope gets three and a half stars (out of five) on the Corkymeter. Bosley will be proud.
