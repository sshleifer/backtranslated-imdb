You have never seen anything like this. Once the coup starts, it's the most astounding, upbeat thing you'll ever see - even if you know the outcome. And that's all really, because it's a documentary - amazing. <br /> <br /> By the time it was over, it was on my Top 10 list of All Time Great Movies. <br /> <br /> Remember the Slobbing-right fanatics. Everyone I know who saw this movie gives it the 4-star rating. Even if you don't care about politics or Venezuelan politics, you'll find yourself on the edge of your chair. It's a rollercoaster ride.
