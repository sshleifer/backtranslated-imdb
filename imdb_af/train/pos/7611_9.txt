"I watched the eye of this island, and what I saw was beautiful," one of the main characters in ABC's award-winning television series "Lost" proclaims. The series can be summed up as a drama story about a group of plane crash survivors stranded on an unknown island, but it will do the show unseen. "Lost" follows a large group of characters who are in conflict with the island, and eventually find themselves struggling with their new way of life and their dependence on one another. The situation becomes more complicated when it becomes clear, it is not an ordinary island, nor can it be alone. <br /> <br /> My initial fear of the concept of this series was the lack of new stories they could tell after a certain period, but it was unfounded. Of course, the narrative flows, the dialogue is scary, the characters are unforgettable and the performance is excellent. The island is a character of its own, and to understand these comments, you need to see the series for yourself, which just indicates its originality and greatness. <br /> <br /> When writing this review, only the first two seasons broadcast, and they are filled with strong episodes. My only slight criticism is that the second season slows down a little halfway, but then fortunately comes in admirable form for the last episodes. <br /> <br /> If I can recommend one TV series, you should follow right now, it will definitely be this one. If you like excitement, adventure, character-driven stories, an extremely strong pot and crew, beautiful places, and an island that is more spiritual than natural, it's "lost" to you. Be sure you start at the beginning.
