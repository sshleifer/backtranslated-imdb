In Arlington Heights, IL we never had a cafeteria in any of the primary schools (1961), so I drove my bike home from school for lunch and always watched this game. True, I was 11, but I thought it was the biggest thing! I'll draw hidden pictures on my blackboard and see if my family or friends could find it. I also remember winning great cars (Pontiac or Oldsmobile) if the participant has the final hidden picture. I even had the home version! <br /> <br /> I wonder why this game lasted so short. I enjoyed the music and the hidden pictures - the only thing I could ever find was the lemon hidden as part of a bridge over a garden stream. <br /> <br /> Very good memories are associated with Camouflage.
