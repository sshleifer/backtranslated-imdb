I saw this independent movie when it was in Philadelphia and it was a pleasant surprise. I left the theater with a smile on my face. One of the things that made it so funny was that it was based on a real story - hilarious! It also has some good character features. Mindy Sterling is in it and is very good. I loved her in Austin Powers. Howard Hesseman is also fantastic. I remember him from the head of the class. I'm tired of all the dark edgy movies still being made. It's fun and light, and I can see it with my family and not be ashamed. I keep seeing when it will appear on DVD. I'll definitely buy it.
