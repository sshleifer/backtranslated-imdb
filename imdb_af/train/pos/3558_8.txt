Along with the Southern Pacific are guys and dolls for adults - it's sassy, ​​sexy, and full of men, men and women are brought together. <br /> <br /> There is an energy and drive that stands out from the pack - the power of Jean Simmond's performance, and the charm of a young Brando, and an already masterful Sinatra add much to the overall feel and appearance of the piece. <br /> <br /> Boys and dolls win as it is unashamedly what it is: an MGM musical. <br /> <br /> Still good to watch and also listen to good songs and dance numbers. This will remain one of the classic 20th-century theater blocks and will be looked after for the coming year. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
