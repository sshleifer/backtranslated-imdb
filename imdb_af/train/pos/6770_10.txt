Airwolf The film, a variation on the original 2-part pilot, but the movie though shorter, contains extra footage. Not seen in the 2-hour pilot. The pilot is much more of a pilot than the movie. True as a pilot movie is normally the same 2 parties combined) But the movie is actually another modification with extras here and cut there. <br /> <br /> Worth even if you have the season 1 DVD set, I'll have another copy of The Movie It's still in some stores like virgin, Woolworths and mixed media stores. Although it is usually necessary to order, it is still necessary to buy online (as many of us still do not shop or trust online), but if you look around in the airwaves <br /> <br /> Airwolf was truly one of the 80's most understated shows. <br /> <br /> A full-size Airwolf is currently being rebuilt for a Helicopter Museum:) Information and work in progress photos are over at http://Airwolf.org. Also with Airwolf Mods for Flashpoint and Flight Sim Games, she's finally staying again :)
