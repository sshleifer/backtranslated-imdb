The only thing about this movie that blows me out is that the DVD is so expensive. It's too much for my budget at the moment, or I'll buy it because the movie is a good example of film noir ... and I enjoy watching Richard Widmark, Jean Peters and Thelma Ritter. <br /> <br /> Criterion delivers large DVDs, but sometimes the demand price is just a little bit. This is the case for an 80-minute black-and-white, mono sound movie that is good but nothing extraordinary, cinematographic. <br /> <br /> The story is the story here (as opposed to visuals, actors, sounds, sets, etc.) as a bag (Widmark) incessant excitement with espionage microfilm in his possession after he took Peters's wallet has. (say it three times!). Everyone except Peters is a credible character in this movie: Widmark, the police, the American agents and the Communists and especially Ritter as "Moe", an informant. She and Widmark are the stars of this movie. <br /> <br /> Peters does a decent job of playing the cheap floozy, but loses her credibility early by "falling in love" with Widmark at the first meeting, though he is nasty to her. Just in the world of the movie !! This is a pity because the ridiculous romance is part of the story. <br /> <br /> It's an average movie noir that does well but doesn't mean well and definitely not worth owning at a $ 25- $ 35 price. For the price one can do much better in the film noir market.
