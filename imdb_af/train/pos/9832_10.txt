Wow it was a wonderful Italian "ZOMBIE" movie by two great directors Luci Fulci ("ZOMBIE") and Bruno Mattie ("HELL OF THE LIVING DEAD"). Lucio started this movie and was sick so the big Bruno took over and it turned out surprisingly better than I expected to turn it out, so if you read "HELL OF THE LIVING DEAD", led by Bruno Mattie and if you saw "ZOMBIE" director by Lucio Fulci and liked both or one of the themes, then this is a movie you should see it has a great "ZOMBIE" makeup witch that looks good. "ZOMBIES" has a funny "ZOMBIE" flying head! And "ZOMBIE" birds that spit on you and turn you into a "ZOMBIE" People), but they are mostly just the big poisonous "ZOMBIES" as in Bruno Matties "HELL OF THE LIVING DEAD". So if you look at the Italian "ZOMBIE" movies or just the "ZOMBIE" movie, it's generally about looking it up. Italian "ZOMBIE" movie!
