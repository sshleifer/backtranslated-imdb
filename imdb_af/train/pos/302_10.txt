This movie is perfect for all the romantics in the world. John Ritter has never been better and has the best rule in the movie! "Sam" hits near the house are fun to watch and so much fun to play with. Ben Gazzara was an excellent role and easy to fall in love with. I'm sure I've met Arthur somewhere in my travels. All around, an excellent choice to pick up any evening! :-)
