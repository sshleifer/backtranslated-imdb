I was adopted at birth and certainly had no problems. Antwone Fisher was in the movie, but I still share the emotions and this movie really helped to bring them out and force me to handle it. It even made me realize that I have a "missing piece" and I'm going to look for my birth parents now. <br /> <br /> I screamed almost a day after seeing it for the first time. Antwone's confrontation with his maternal mother, coupled with his father's family's response to his sudden appearance, is powerful for those of us who do not know what will happen if we find our birth parents. And his self-confidence and self-assurance to his mother and to the abusers of his past was so powerful. I really could identify with this and my need to tell people. "Yes, I was set aside with my parents when I was born. But another set of parents picked me up and loved me. And now I'm a success!" <Br /> <br /> It also helped me understand my wife and our adopted children, who are going through tragic experiences before coming to our home. And it helped me realize how disturbed our social system is. If you remember, read the story about the lost foster child in Florida last year, and then the "Miranda & Ashley" story in Oregon City where SCF ignores several sexual abuse complaints about the man they were finally murdering and the week This movie was released, another story in New Jersey of three children ignored by the system. One died. The state apparently thought the home they were living in was good, because the guardian was employed (as a stripper) and a few times "used heroin! <br /> <br /> There are just as many issues in This movie is being taken out - and they are treated so well by the screenplay and by the play that Antwone Fisher must surely be a "Best Picture" nominee. No matter if you are accepted or not, this is a heartbreak by anyone who is worried about children in our society.
