Dick Tracy is easily made the best comic book based movie to date. The movie has the same feel as the cartoon, remains true to the color scheme. The Batman series climbed, fell, climbed and fell again. Dick Tracy has real strength as something that both adults and children can enjoy. The good guys triumph over the evil, without blood and gore to get the point over. Al Pacino does a wonderful job of his own adaptation of Big Boy Caprice and Madonna is unforgettable as Breathless. But the best work far is Warren Beatty, who just did Dick Tracy just like he did with Clyde Barrows. I can't wait until it appears on DVD on April 2, 2002, my tape is thin.
