In 1993, with the success of the first season of Batman: The Animated Series, Warner Brothers commissioned the hit show team to produce a movie originally broadcast for Direct-To-Video. but knocked on the scene. status. This will be known as Batman: Phantasm Mask. Ten years after Phantasm, we released another three feature films from the WB's Sub-Zero, Return of the Joker, and now include the Mystery of the Batwoman with the family. <br /> <br /> The plot is basically and in many ways similar to Mask of the Phantasm: A new female vigilante modeling itself after Batman started the operations of Gotham bully Rupert Thorne and Oswald Cobblepot AKA The Penguin . Batman must now try to unravel the mystery of the Batwoman before crossing the line. <br /> <br /> The animation is the slimmer, futuristic style used for Batman: The Animated Series's fifth and sixth seasons (AKA The New Batman Adventures). , it's done pretty well, and just as slender as the return of the Joker's animation. There is also some use of CGI, but it is small compared to its abundance in Sub-Zero. The music was good. Different and exotic and similar to the Justice League score, although the points in the score when the old animated Batman theme pops up, will surely send waves of nostalgia by the older supporters' rodent-shaped hearts. <br /> <br /> As always, Kevin Conroy does a great job like Bruce Wayne and Batman. It's also nice to have the old Batman back: the animated series of alumni; These include Bob Hastings (Commissioner Gordon), Robert Costanzo (Detective Bullock), Tara Strong (Barbara Gordon / Batgirl; her coming to the romantic relationship between her and Bruce called Batman Beyond) and Efrem Zimbalist Jr. Alfred). <br /> <br /> Villains were also great, especially since Rupert Thorne, the old crowd of the original series, appeared for the first time since the fourth season. <br /> <br /> Overall, while MOTB did not reach the standard of Mask of the Phantasm ten years ago, MOTB carries the torch very well for the animated Batman movies. And if you have the DVD and a hardcore fan, you'll love the five-minute short Chase Me.
