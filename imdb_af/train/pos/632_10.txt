OK here is how I do it. I rate movies on 10 components. Each component will inherently start with 5 points. It can lose 5 points for a possible 10 or 0. <br /> <br /> Mood: Action, Romance, Comedy, Drama, Suspension - I give this component 10 points. It had a perfect balance of all five aspects. The action was fun and exciting. Romanticism was not overdoing, but still very emotional and moving. I laughed loudly and long in the movie and still I was captivated by the fantastic drama, and the anticipation of excitement. <br /> <br /> Plot - I give this component 10 points. I thought all the good fairy tales were already told. I found myself in the theater, returning to my childhood, and in that moment I again believed in unicorns, wicked witches and falling stars that make dreams come true. <br /> <br /> Cinema Photography - I give this component 8 points. While the movie caught the story very well in most corners, I tried to find out more than once what happened just outside the camera. <br /> <br /> FX - I give this component 10 points. I love being C.G.I. sparingly. The epic scenes were credible. The magical powers were terribly realistic. All in all, less, and this has it all! Cast - I give this component 10 points. No names and seasoned actors, the role-play was great! Michelle Pfeiffer was wonderful, Charlie Cox made Tristan alive, Claire Danes gave emotion to the stars, and I will never look at Robert De Niro again. <br /> <br /> Acting - I give this component 10 points. Even the newbie actors played their roles perfectly. Again I will never again see Robert De Niro again. <br /> <br /> Character development - I give this component 9 points. It was a bit rushed and I think if the movie was a bit longer, they could have done the characters a little better justice. <br /> <br /> Dialogue - I give this component 10 points. The dialogue was clever, witty, fun? even the mess had good dialogue. <br /> <br /> Score - I give this component 7 points. I can honestly just remember one small piece of music from the whole movie. I do not complain beyond the fact that the music can be more memorable. <br /> <br /> Finish - I give this component 9 points. Almost perfect end! I feel certain aspects of the end would have been more pronounced, while others might have been more muted, but no threads were released. <br /> <br /> Total: 93% Buy the DVD? HELL YES! See it in the theater? Definitely! Bottom Line: Excellent movie for everyone! EPIC! I strongly recommend watching it in the theater, I know I'm going to go back for seconds!
