Fun character development in a very cool environment. As a man, I'm probably not qualified to fully understand it, but they do a good job of establishing the restrictive Victorian environment from the start. It's not as pale as it really was and the treatment of women was probably even harder. What it is going to do is a wonderful chemistry among the main characters. Everyone has their own "thing" with which they argue. As soon as they come out of the rain and break out of the spiders, they begin to communicate and slowly lose their sense of suspicion. What I enjoy about this movie is that it didn't go for cheap comedy if it could have. It didn't try to teach us a lesson. The people who look completely without merit are very well-developed people who see the light. I had a little trouble with the Alfred Molina character who had such an epiphany so fast, but within this world it had to happen. Good acting everywhere with something positive that takes place in the lives of some good people.
