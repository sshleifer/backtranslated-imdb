Ying, a Chinese girl speaking Czech, invited us to verify a Czech movie (with English subtitles) in the Department of Visual and Environmental Studies (VES). It was the first time I saw Samotáři (Loners, 2000) and it was pretty good. <br /> <br /> As in many other Czech films, the seven central characters seem to be a very difficult, dirty life; the web indicates that this theme was popular among American movies in the early 1990s. Their relationships break, combine and recombination. Another typical feature of the Czech movies is that none of the characters is designed to be a universally negative one and neither is a permanent positive character. You can also see how the characters judge the characteristics of others, depending on the context; This is a very realistic feature of the psychological analysis of the film. <br /> <br /> Ondřej is a talented and married young surgeon who has two daughters. Yet you learn that he only studied neurobiology to prove how much he loved another woman, Hanka. He is so obsessive that he repeatedly dresses as a plumber to get into Hanka's parents' home - a house he repeatedly burns. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Hanka has a very mixed relationship with her parents. She decides - by throwing up a coin - to break up with Petr working in a private radio station. Hanka does not see her parents' civil life as a good example, but rather seems unsuccessful in creating a better environment. But she is a very flexible figure, as far as her boyfriends go. <br /> <br /> For a while, Hanka seems to have serious plans with Jakub, an innocent drug addict, whose memory appears to be devastated by the drugs. However, his group's friends tell Jakub that he already has another friend. Hanka is disappointed and returns to her parents. <br /> <br /> When Hanka and Petr break, it is organized by Robert, a matchmaker who also works for a travel agency where his work is the life of ordinary Czech. people to Japanese tourists. Robert - who also provides Jaku with marijuana - is never serious about anything and usually sleeps with many different women; eventually his mother dies in a hospital and he has his own ways to deal with the depression. <br /> <br /> Vesna (a Slavic word for spring) that came to Prague from Macedonia, works as a barmaid - and you won't learn if she came to Czech Republic to see her father or UFOs no. She looks pretty confused, but sometimes helps the other characters of their problems. <br /> <br /> Petr works in the radio station and he is the only one who likes his job - a job he eventually loses. He announces to his audience that he has broken up with Hanka - how Ondřej learns about the news that makes him very happy. <br /> <br /> Finally, Ondřej's wife, Lenka, is always ready to forgive him and stabilize their marriage - even after Ondřej asks a wizard to make him disappear so Ondřej can try to catch Hanka again . (The wizard pays his debt because he is a brother of a major car accident victim. Jakub and Hanka bring the victim to hospital and Ondřej saves his life.) Lenka also works for the travel agency - as translator - and finally she has to translate some hysterical scenes for 20 or so Japanese tourists who shoot their movies during Hanka parents' dinner. <br /> <br /> The seven characters vary in interesting and exciting ways that would be natural if Prague was smaller by four orders. Given the real size of the Czech capital, it seems a little unlikely that all these events happen between seven people, but it's fun.
