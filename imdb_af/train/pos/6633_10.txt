The first movie ever made. Workers flow from a factory, some cycling, walking most, right or left. Together with Melies, the Lumieres are both the starting point and point of departure for cinema - with Melies starting narrative fiction, cinema, fantasy, artwork, spectacle; with the Lumieres pure, unproven observation. The truth. There are many intellectuals who regret the oscillation of the theater of the latter in the tired formulas of the former. <br /> <br /> But consider it again briefly. There is nothing 'objective' about it. The film is full of action - a static, inhumane scene has burst into life, activity, and the silent harmony of the frame has broken out, from the back to the right or left (but never of course the front where the camera is). And yet the camera stands still, contains the energy, the possible subversion, subordinates to his will. Cinematography can be a revolutionary invention, but it will be used for conservative purposes. To plan, change, restrict, limit the world. <br /> <br /> Worse is the historical reality of the movie. These factory workers are Lumiere employees. The boss spies on their workers, the invisible eye of his faceless minions. The film therefore describes two kinds of imprisonment. Behind the gates, the workers in their workplace are limited. The opening of the gate seems to be an image of freedom, escape, but they look at another wall, the fourth wall, which limits them further. The first film is also the first example of CCTV surveillance, an image of invisible, all-seeing authority that captures its servants. A terrifying, all too prophetic movie.
