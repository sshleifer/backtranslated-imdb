What's Good About It: Some ingenious and truly creepy little effects that will come under the skin of even the most seasoned horror fan. Don't rely on the hacked soundtrack for his "gotcha" moments. Even if you've seen everything, there are still a few things in this movie that will drop your jaw. <br /> <br /> What could have been better about it: The acting was sometimes flat and unconvincing. In some places it had a "shot-to-video" quality (although it mostly reached the ambience it was aiming for), and the camera is full of unnecessary close-ups of meaningless actions. Although the effects are actually creepy, I think they can go to the well after a few times. The end rushed, and shine on what could be more impactful moments. The viewer is about to find out many things for themselves, not as a challenge by the filmmakers, but because they just missed it. <br /> <br /> Another good little indie horror movie that is easily a few steps away. above average. Well the rent was.
