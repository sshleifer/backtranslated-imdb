Another attempt by modern Japanese directors to redefine the Chambara genre. Successful, and not, varying degrees. Buddhist monk has a vision that he should kill a legendary (and very active) demon at the Gojo Bridge to gain relief. While not at the forefront, Buddhist thought is at the heart of this movie, like Kurosawa's "Ran". Probably, what made the movie the most interesting to me, although it's now close to Ran's league. <br /> <br /> Stylish visuals and excellent photography keep the movie interesting for two hours and eighteen minutes. The protagonists are uniformly excellent. The music is really good. The two weaknesses are the story and the battle scenes. The movie dragged in the middle that could be solved by careful editing. And the battle scenes are mostly filmed in invisible close-ups. It works for most of the movie, but the final one feels like a cheat. Another recent film like this is Tsui Hark's "Seven Swords", a great movie, but the promised scenes are disappointing. Asano doesn't really move like a sword-resisting devil, but his action is great, but he'll be an extra in a traditional Chambara battlefield. <br /> <br /> Good movie, you'll probably find it interesting, Don't expect traditional sword fighting.
