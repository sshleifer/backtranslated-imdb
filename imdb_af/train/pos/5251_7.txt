Well, Wayne's World is over and the years have since been difficult for snl off-shoot movies. From such a movie waste as "It's Pat" to the recent 80-minute yawn, "A Night at the Roxbury," many have undoubtedly lost faith that any other snl-skit will ever make a successful transition to the silver screen . Don't be afraid, because Tim Meadows comes in spades. The well-written plot keeps the audience's interest to the end, and while it is evident from the Leon Phelps character being introduced into the five-minute slit, the story can develop character. The humor (consisting mainly of sex jokes) is fresh and interesting and made me laugh louder than I recently had in a movie. It's just a good time if you don't feel too serious about yourself. Tiffany-Amber Thiessen of "Saved by the Bell" boasts a look in the movie and looks incredible. finally Billy Dee Williams, who revives his Colt for 45 days, gives the movie a touch of class. And for those who are there, unconscious movie quotes like me, you find this movie actually quotes, "ooh, it's a lady!"
