I just want to say that I am so glad someone has finally wasted the beans on this movie. Bravo "The Spaz", Bravo! This movie is a ridiculous crowd of movie-making. Especially for a student movie! I just want to give the Spazz credit the caring of the absurd amount of time to find such a rare picture, and then to get there! Most people I know don't have that kind of time, especially so few will end up reading it. Kudos to you sir! Anyway, the movie follows a thin story that is at least incredible and just silly. I understand the idea behind creating a satire from Charlie's Angels, but why rent such horrible actresses! Also, what kind of director has himself writing, writing, producing and editing the picture! Choose one job and put all your love into this man! It's so sorry, because I hear he made a good movie about a killer toothbrush. Again, thanks to the Spazz for pulling back the curtain on this movie, people are like you find a rare one.
