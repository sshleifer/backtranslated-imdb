The men can slave over Lollo, if they want (or her lollos - she gave her name for snake conditions for breasts in French), but the ladies still have a nice treat in the divine Gerard Philipe, who is not just beautiful can not act. Don't be discouraged if your version has no captions, because in this simple, staggering story of love and war, in which everything is right, it is not necessary. All you need is that, at the beginning of the film, Lollobrigida reads Philip's palm and tells him he will marry the king's daughter. Then the story is pretty clear from the Gallic gestures and the running, jumping and swording. <br /> <br /> At the bottom, the obviousness of the story and the heavy-handed facet of the tone become slightly tired, and it is annoying that the French speakers are even better than themselves, even better than Hollywood. to bother the plausibility of its exciting stunts. And of course the non-French speaker of ooh-la-la misses, like: Virtual girl: I have to tell you that my heart belongs to Fanfan. Seducer: My dearest, what made you think I was interested in those bagatels?
