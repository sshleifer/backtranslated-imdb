I heard this film was a study of a landscape photographer's art by presenting the beauty of man's deconstruction of the natural landscape. It certainly showed the troublesome activities to find places, make upshots and capture strong images of which the final destinations worldwide were art studios. Along with moving photos, it's really a horror show. <br /> <br /> This movie oozes by replacing you with the shock of horrible images of soft waves from a wonderful industrial soundtrack that leads you on a slow moving river. Each sequence is on its own, but in combination you become deeper and deeper into the feeling of overwhelming inevitability. There are few words, it allows the grandeur shown in its own way to preach. A horrible, massive factory filled with human auto living in hopelessly lifeless dorms. Individuals who die early while escaping for reusable pieces in mountains of our E-waste. The birth of giant ships and their destruction by hand in giant cemeteries. The construction of the Three Gorges Dam, the largest industrial project in human history and probably for all time. The time lapses as a city dies and is at the same time revived in a replica of modernity that deliberately destroys all the remains of culture. <br /> <br /> The most frightening image for me was a dam engineer who explained that the main feature of the dam was flood control. The shot moves to the orchard behind the spokesman where you testify the level of the last flood through the poisonous water that the bark of the trees ate. It shows nothing but the most harmful pests in the water. <br /> <br /> The obvious is not set, is much more powerful than your usual preaching. Save the Earth's documentary documents. Artist Edward Burtynsky explains the method wonderfully. "By not saying what you should see, many people today are in an uncomfortable place where you do not necessarily want to give up what we have, but we realize what we are doing, creating problems that run deep. This is not a simple right or wrong, it needs a whole new way of thinking. ”The subtlety of this is in one or some suggestion, but the movie images shout that the decision has been made in favor of the dark side. br /> <br /> Although never set directly in any way, waves of what you see were away from your consciousness and you think there is only one possible conclusion - we are doomed. Of our nature, leave behind the massacre that this artist finds terrific beauty.What he actually takes is the traces of us, the lemmings that unknowingly run to our own demise, unlike most films with environmental themes, this ends one with no call to wap etc. not. It basically argues what the point is, but make sure you put the blame on all of us equally well.
