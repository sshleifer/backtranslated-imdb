First, this movie is painfully beautiful. One who works on 3D CG movies as a lighter / component has blown the footage away. Every second I was amazed at what was on the screen. As for the story, it's good. It won't burn the world, but if you like your futuristic Blade Runner esquire stories (and who doesn't?) Then you'll be fine. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I feel the voice worker was particularly pale and detracted from the film as a whole. I saw it at the cinema in English, but I hope a French version is moving around somewhere. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth seeing.
