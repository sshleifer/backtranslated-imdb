After all the shit that Hollywood (and India) snapped, we finally get a movie that gives scary moments. There are some clich√© moments, but I'm not sure it's possible to make a completely original movie today. There's not much new here ... it's just done well. <br /> <br /> Make sure and notice, because the "subtle" aunts are quick and frequent. It's not a movie to watch while eating pizza. <br /> <br /> There is a very well written red herring in this movie and unfortunately a very poor role. Cheri Christian just doesn't make an effective July (the wife / mother). For one thing, she is completely impersonal. I know, I know ... she just experienced a traumatic experience. But the viewer never knows her as she normally is and the relationship between her and her husband is rather uncomfortable (in an unintended way). I think the director meant to have compassion for her, but I never did. <br /> <br /> Finally, a thumb for the end, which is both disturbing and satisfying. It could easily be cheap at the start of the final credits, but the director resisted it cautiously. <br /> <br /> It's not a masterpiece in any way, but it's a good, old-fashioned scary movie ... something that's scarce nowadays.
