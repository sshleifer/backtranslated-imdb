If you have any kind of heart and compassion for people, it's a hard movie to watch, at least in the second half. <br /> <br /> It's in that segment where we see how beautiful, a kid is beaten and then a delayed (spiritually challenged) man from the deep end after witnessing this brutal act against the child . It's not nice stuff. <br /> <br /> However, it's a good movie and the acting is good too. The story will be with you for a while. <br /> <br /> "Dominick" is the mentally handicapped man and is played by Tom Hulce. I think this could be Hulce's best role ever. He is played by a fellow student, "Eugene", played by Ray Liotta, who became a star next year with Kevin Costner's "Field of Dreams." Dominick is a good-natured garbage man who reads "Hulk" comic books and loves wrestling. He is the kind of "slow" guy you can't help but love and root to live a happy life. When he freaks, it's for several good reasons and ... well, watch the movie for the whole story. It's worth your time, but be prepared to go on real emotional tobogganing and perhaps be very upset about some things you see.
