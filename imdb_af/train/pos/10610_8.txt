A loving young man with a sad past (Henry Thomas) arrives at an abandoned baby girl in the forest and immediately falls in love with her. The town's guys usually support him to keep the child, although a local requester (Cara Seymour) thinks little of the new family. A long-lived girl and a sinister travel salesman (David Strathairn at his creepiest) have parallel stories that converge fatally. It's a beautiful cut-in-life in the Ozarks in the same ace as "Where The Lillies Bloom" & "The Dollmaker". All three are shot in that spot in those beautiful hills and cover the lives of a simple life - but not simply - American people. A minimum of strong language and short but pronounced violence makes this fairly safe family display.
