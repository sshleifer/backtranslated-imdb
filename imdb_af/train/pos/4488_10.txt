Here's a favorite Tom & Jerry cartoon that is perfect for Halloween. I know it doesn't have much creepiness, but has the 'trick' as in 'Trick or Treat', as Jerry did to Tom with the window blind and the vacuum cleaner with a knitted shirt hanging on it to make it look like a ghost ; but still keep it on my Halloween cartoon list. In this brief, Tom listened to the "Witching Hour", a ghost story program on the radio, and scared the horror story being told. Halfway into the story, the drama begins (hairs are at the end, heart leaping in the throat, icy cold chills on the spine). . . literally. And Jerry observed the whole thing and laughed at himself, thought he raised Tom's fears by frightening him. <br /> <br /> I love the end, it was a little funny. And you know, this short is the first of four cartoons in which Tom Mammy Two Shoes attacks; the other is the lonely mouse, a mouse in the house and a sneaky kitty. And also this short is the first of 25 cartoons where Tom talks. The other is The Lonesome Mouse, The Zoot Cat, The Million Dollar Cat, The Bodyguard, Mouse Problems, The Mouse Comes For Dinner, Quiet Please!, Trap Happy, Solid Serenade, Mouse Cleaning, Texas Tom, Mucho Mouse, and The Cat Bo and the mouse below led by Chuck Jones.
