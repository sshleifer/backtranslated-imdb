I loved the episode, but there was a quick reference to the secretary being punished for being effectively an accomplice. While I want an episode of Columbo to have an unpredictable turn like this one, the resolution must be part of the closing of the episode, along with the dissolution of the killer. <br /> <br /> The interaction between Peter Falk and Rut Gordon is invaluable. At one point, Gordon, who plays a well-known writer, commented a little on the fact that he was known by the well-known Lt. Columbo flattered. He makes a tongue-in-cheek speech to the real life trial of the detective trial known as a crime solver. This is one of the best of very good Columbo installments.
