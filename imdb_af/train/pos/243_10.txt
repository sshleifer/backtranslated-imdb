Definitely one of my favorite movies. The story is good, the acting is good, all technical (especially cinematography) is sharp and the writing is clever. <br /> <br /> Heath Ledger is great as Edward '' Ned 'Kelly. He is poignant as the legendary ban, and is well supported by Geoffrey Rush, Naomi Watts and Orlando Bloom. All action sequences are at point <br /> <br /> The movie is from your seat to the end. One of my favorite films from the late legend Heath Ledger is the highlight of every movie he played. And don't make a mistake here. <br /> <br /> An excellent film all-round.
