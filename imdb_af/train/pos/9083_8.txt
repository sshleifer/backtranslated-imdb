I enjoyed this movie and I had very low expectations because of all the negative reviews I read before reading. I went because I was curious about what all this fuss was about, because some of the posts were so angry with this movie and with the Koreans. Oh, and it comes from Korea that took out some of my favorite movies. I like Host, but not my absolute favorite. Some of my favorite sci-fi / fantasy movies so you can get a feel of my taste: Mirrormask, Stardust, Tranquility, Gattaca, Willow, Matrix, Resident Evil Series, LOTR, Stargate, Dark City. <br /> <br /> It wasn't confusing as everyone said and the monsters looked good and the battles were good. There are a few holes in the story, but didn't really matter. I sort things out like this and keep quiet and ask why long ago when I saw the summer blockbusters. The Korean legend was interesting, the reincarnation was different, and I thought the main characters were suspicious like Korean actors in other programs. Ethan's (Behr) hair looks as Asian. <br /> <br /> Yes, it could be better and I hope in the future that Korea, with its unusual peculiarity of life, intense emotions and unexpected humor, can bring some. diversity to the blockbuster genre. Maybe a combination of Host and Dragon Wars in the future?
