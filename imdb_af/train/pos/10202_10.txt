I personally liked this movie and was worried about the rating some people gave it. It's a cartoon-based movie that's animated, now that you don't like comic books or animation, then of course you won't like this movie. Why have you watched and bothered to judge it, it's beyond me. Although, if you are a fan of interesting, strong characters and heroic (sexy) women kicking kicks and saving the world, you will love this movie. I thought the story really pulled me out and it was a very cool movie. Quite anime-esque or more like some American movies following this new trend of adult animation. Like Titan A.E. Meet is the live action version of Punisher. In the end, I recommend this movie the comic buff and super hero fan or somebody with an open enough mind looking for a fun movie.
