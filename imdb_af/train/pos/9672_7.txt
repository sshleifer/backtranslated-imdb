I know, I know: it's childish. But I just like this kind of movie. A bird that suffered many "accidents" and still lost its faith in humanity and its sense of humor. What is especially about this film is the fact that the main character Paulie is - the parrot - and he is not used as a boost for a human actor. I also love the storyline: Paulie tells his life story to a cleaner at the point that he hit the bottom. (Incidentally, Jay Mohr's voice sounds almost like Joe Pesci's!). And of course, Cheech Marin, the man is humor to me. Since I saw 'Up in Smoke', I appreciated his naive way of acting, a simple situation made a hilarious one. Can't help me.
