After '' Empire Returns '' '' Return of the Jedi '' is my second favorite movie from the Star Wars series. <br /> <br /> Luke went to Tattoine to save Han Solo from Jabba. At the same time, the Galactic Empire does secretly, building a new space station like the previous star. If this station is completely built, it will be the end of the Rebel Alliance. Both the Father and the Emperor are impatient because of the delay of the new Death Star, and they have to kill many of their commanders to schedule the project. <br /> <br /> R2 and C3po are in Jabba's Palace to send a message from Luke to Jabba, where Lukes pretends to negotiate Han's life. He gave R2 and C3po as a gift to Jabba as part of his plan. Jabba does not accept the negotiation, as he uses Han Solo as a piece of his palace's decoration. (Han is still frozen in carbonite.) Lando is hidden as Jabba's guard and Chewbacca is also given to Jabba by a reward hunter. When the same Hunter tries to save Han solo and leave him in human form again, we see it is actually Princess Leia in disguise. The problem is that Jabba discovers Leia's plan and sees her as his slave, while Han is thrown into Chewbacca's cell. <br /> <br /> Luke comes as a Jedi knight to save his friends. At his first attempt to kill Jabba, he fell into Jabba's monster cell (Bantha), but made it easy to kill. Jabba remains angry and decides to throw Han, Chewbacca and Lukas to Sarlacc, a great creature from the desert that consumes 1,000 years and consumes it. Luke, Han and Chewie are again successful in scape, and even Boba Fett dies if Han accidentally throws himself to Sarlacc's mouth. Leia kills Jabba and also goes to Han, Luke and Chewie as well as C3po and R2. <br /> <br /> Everyone is safe again and decides to go to Dagoba to complete his training as a Jedi as well as his promise to Yoda. The problem is that Yoda is too old and sick, as he is already 900 years old, and before he dies, Yoda tells Luke he no longer needs training, but to really be a Jedi, he has to go with Father again. fighting. He confirms to Luke that the Father is Luke's father, and that there is another Skywalker, except Luke. In his last moments, Yoda asks Luke to remember his advice on the temptation of the dark side, and to send Luke his knowledge of Jedi to others. When Yoda dies, Obi wan shows his spirit to Luke and tells him that Luke's father killed his good side Anakin to become Darth Vader and also that he is more machine than a man since he became a sith. Luke remains worried about killing his own father, saying he feels his father still has kindness. Obi Wan tells Lukas that his twin sister Leia is, and says the reasons why Luke and Leia have been divorced since babies. He gives his last advice to Luke to say that if he refuses to kill Father, Caesar will win the war. <br /> <br /> At the same time, the Emperor tells Father that he must give Luke to him when he is stronger than before, both must combine their efforts to bring Luke to the dark side. <br /> <br /> Now we will have one of the best battles of the star war series, when the Rebel Alliance wants to attack the new space station, the "Star Star 2", Luke will confront the Father and the Emperor , and Leia, Han and Chewie have to switch off the Sterfster 2 power field. the help of the EWOKS. (small creatures that are small bears) <br /> <br /> This is probably one of the most exciting star wars of all!
