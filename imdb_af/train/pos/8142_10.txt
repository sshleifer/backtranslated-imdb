Chances are, you will think this movie is incredibly stupid, the first time you see it. But if you happen to view it a second and third and fourth and fifth times (I'm good at the hundreds now), you'll regret yourself there and run out! My friends and I actually threw the Fear of a black hat party to get more of our friends, "as they say, with the riots."
