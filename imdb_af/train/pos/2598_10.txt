As if the film itself was not of value, it is a great way to get an overview of the novel as a preface to read it. In the summer of 1968 I saw the film in NYC; falling into the graduate school, I read the book for the first time. From the pleasure of reading the novel, I was reminded of the carefully detailed film. And better or worse - and I've learned and learned the reading matter for more than three decades - Milo O'Shea is still Leopold Bloom.
