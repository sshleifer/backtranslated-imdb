VERBODS PLANET is the best SF movie from the golden age of SF cinema, making it a great movie. Once the spaceship leaves the public - through the ship's crew - travel through an intelligent and sometimes frightening adventure. We meet the memorable Robbie, the mysterious dr. Morbuis, his beautiful and innocent daughter Altair and we teach about the former inhabitants of the planet - The Krell that is dead overnight. Or did they? <br /> <br /> You can nitpick and say the planet is, of course, filmed in a film studio with painted backgrounds, but it adds a sense of threat to claustraphobia I feel and Bebe and Louis Barron's electronic music adds more atmosphere. <br /> <br /> I'm shocked this movie isn't in the top 250 IMDB movies.
