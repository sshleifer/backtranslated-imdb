DER TODESKING is not one of my favorite Jorg Buttgereit movies - but it is still an interesting movie about suicide and these are reasons and consequences. Those looking for a gore festival, or exploitation in the style of NEKROMANTIK films or SCHRAMM will probably be disappointed. DER TODESKING is definitely an art house style film, so those who need linear, explainable narratives do not have to apply. <br /> <br /> The basic concept of DER TODESKING is that there is an "episode" for every day of the week that revolves around a strange chain letter that apparently causes people to commit suicide, between the scene of a slow-dissolving corpse ... <br /> <br /> There are some very well done and mind-like scenes, including the man who talks about the problems with his wife and the concert murder that unfortunately lost my strength on me. because I was too busy loading the SCORPIONS tire on stage. But seriously - it is sometimes beautiful (the scene showing different angles of that great bridge is especially effective - especially if you understand the meaning of the scene and the names shown are people who actually committed suicide to jump out of the bridge ... ..., sometimes confusing, sometimes stupid (the SHE WOLF OF THE SS rip-off is quite amusing), sometimes harrowing (I have the scene of the guy talking to the girl in the park About his wife particularly effective) is more of an "experience" than just entertaining, as many of these "art" films are meant to be. Yet, I have not found that DER TODESKING is as strong as NEKROMANTIK or SCHRAMM, and it will probably occur on relatively equal footing with NEKROMANTIK 2 in terms of my personal "pleasure level". Definitely take a look at any Buttgereit or an art movie fans. If you're digging this kind of movie, look at SUBCONSCIOUS CRUELTY - in my opinion the best art house / horror movie I've seen. 7/10 for DER TODESKING
