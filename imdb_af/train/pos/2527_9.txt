This is what I call a "pre-Sci Fi; Sci Fi" movie. It doesn't get any better than Lugosi / Karloff in this amazingly good "mood" type movie. These two real artists are at their best, just like the story line. <br /> <br /> Karloff does a wonderful job as a scientist who has captured himself in a range of vanity, pride and scientific competition. I was trapped in the idea of ​​looking at a man while drowned himself in the three previously mentioned concepts. I was sad and at the same time fascinated with the two stars as they did themselves. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of movie that asks for a remake. This time, Harrison Ford played in the Karloff part and perhaps Kieffer Sutherland as the Bela Lagosi role. It may be possible to do so almost as well. <br /> <br /> It's one of the best Hollywood ever made. As I said, I didn't get any better. Not at all.
