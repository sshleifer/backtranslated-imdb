"My Child, My Sister, Dream <br /> <br /> How sweet everything looks. <br /> <br /> We were in that kind of country to live with, <br /> <br /> And there Love is slow and long, <br /> <br /> Love and die under <br /> <br /> The scenes your image, that opulent weather. "<br /> <br /> Charles Baudelaire < br /> <br /> Based on the novel by Elizabeth Von Arnim, "Enachanted April" can be described in one sentence? It takes place in the early 1920s when four London women, four strangers decided to rent a castle in Italy for April. This is the correct description, but it will not prepare you for the fact that 'Enchanted April' - an ultimate 'good feeling' movie is perfection of its genre. Beautiful and sunny, soft and quiet, beautiful and magical. It is like a ray of sun on your face during spring when you want to close your eyes and smile and stop this moment of tranquil happiness and cherish it forever. This is the movie that really affected my life. I watched it during the difficult times when I was lost, unhappy and very lonely, when I had to deal with the sadness and tragic events and talk about myself with an unobtrusive truth. It helped me regain my optimism and hope that anything can be changed and anything is possible. I then promised myself that it didn't matter, I would pull myself out of misery and self-pity and I would appreciate every minute of life - with its joy and its sadness ... I promised myself that I would go to Italy go and later that year i did and i was not alone. <br /> <br /> Charming, enchanting and heartwarming, "Enchanted April" is one of the best movies ever made and my everlasting love. This small film is a diamond of the highest quality.
