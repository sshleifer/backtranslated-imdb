I watched this movie with my mom when I was in high school many years ago. I was definitely not the least interested in opera, but he changed my mind. I enjoyed this movie very much and have had the opera ever since. I even bought some of his CDs. Whoever cares about his acting abilities, he actually only played himself, which was spectacular. He was so charming, so charismatic; I didn't want to embrace him. I feel very sad that so much criticizes him. It was so straightforward, don't accept people who surround him or judge him for his actions. He deserves respect and admiration for his talent. He will definitely be missed !!!
