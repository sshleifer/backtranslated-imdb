It's a good movie. <br /> <br /> I agreed to watch a chick flag and some eventually ended up with it. I have never heard of it or anyone in it. (Mike expressed friends). <br /> <br /> But it's great! Eva, Lake and Paul give wonderful performances. The humor is consistently dry and greasy. <br /> <br /> Paul Rudd plays the same Mike character from Friends (which works well). The other characters are stereotypes and the plot is formative (I mean we don't speak 'Apocalypse Now' here). But the characters are nice, the story is alluring, the soundtrack, production and direction all work well. <br /> <br /> In all, a good, good movie that really earns much more than it earns. <br /> <br /> Everyone has their own taste, but I don't understand the one star reviews for it.
