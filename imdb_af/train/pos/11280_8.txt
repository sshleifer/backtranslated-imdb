A very interesting entertainment, with the charm of the old movies. Tarzan is undoubtedly the greatest danger as the moment demands and we all enjoy his success. The most invigorating thing for me is a man without special powers who experiences the problems and just defeats them with human skills (he was a good swimmer and had a great scream)
