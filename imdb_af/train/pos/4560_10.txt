I just returned from a show of my left foot in our public library. What an emotional experience - I feel drained and excited. <br /> <br /> This is the story of Christy Brown, Irish writer and painter, based on the autobiographical "My Left Foot" of the author. Christy was born with a form of cerebral palsy, so the only limb he had good control was his left foot. Doctors told his parents that he was hopelessly mentally retarded, but his mother did not give up and, as Annie Sullivan did with Helen Keller, helped him reach a breakthrough in which he had learned the alphabet and then read, wrote and paint. <br /> <br /> This film won Academy Awards for Daniel Day-Lewis (Best Actor), as well as the best supporting actress for the actress playing his mother. It also received Oscar nominations for best photo, best director, and best custom screenplay. <br /> <br /> As a retired clinical psychologist and family therapist, while many movies can entertain me, many often leave me fictional or unlikely in realistic psychological reactions. <br /> <br /> Not this movie - it was absolutely "spot on" in portraying typical Irish parenting roles and behaviors (see, for example, typical Irish families in McGoldrick's "Ethnicity & Family Therapy") as well. Christy Brown's odd emotional aging - some immature personality reactions even reinforced by his father's actions. <br /> <br /> The movie offers the greater truth as certain sequences change in its development (painting and writing) and condense several important people in one person for the sake of telling a coherent, credible story, which is not taxed by small, distracting, minorities. (See Christy Brown in Wikipedia for more accuracy.) The DVD version we've shown has a few English subtitles that were a great help in understanding Christy's speech (and some of the Irish speech). the initial release of the movie might have been missing. (If you watch it on DVD, activate the option.) <br /> <br /> The performance by Daniel Day-Lewis is one of the biggest, credible works I've ever seen. I have a more recent film, "The Diving Bell & the Butterfly," in which each one portrays the life of a real person. It's a wonderful, outstanding, superlative. <br /> <br /> successfully exceeding the prison sentence and isolation of a very serious physical disability. <br /> <br /> With that, it reacts with William Ernest Henley's "Invictus" who begins: "From the night that covers me, like the pit of pole poles, / / ​​I thank everything that God may be . / For my invincible soul.
