From this writing, John Carpenter's "Halloween" is closer to the 30th anniversary. It has since grown 7 successors, a remake, a whole mess of imitations and every year around Halloween when they do the Top 10 Scariest Movies', it's always there. It is quite surprising for a film made on a budget of about $ 300,000 and has an almost completely unknown film of young and talented talent. I can go on, but the big question here is: How does the movie last? And all I can say is fantastic! <br /> <br /> Benefits: A simple but haunting opening credit line that really sets the mood. An unforgettable and goosebump-inducing score by director / co-author John Carpenter and Alan Howarth. Great cinematography. Staring through Carpenter holding the tensions high, getting good shots, and being careful not to show too much of his villain. Good performances of the then mostly unknown role. A good sense of humor. Michael Myers is a scary, evil man. Many ominous moments that stay with you. The pace is slow but steady and never dragging. Unlike most other slasher films, this one is more about tension and terror than blood and a great body number. Cons: Probably not nearly as scary as it was then. Many of the goofs really stand out. <br /> <br /> Final Thoughts: I want to start this passage by saying it's not my favorite movie in the series. I know it's not a popular opinion, but it's really how I feel. Nevertheless, it really is a major movie that reaches new generations of movie buffs. And just because it is adapted to a new generation doesn't mean it will be forgotten. No way, no how. <br /> <br /> My rating: 5/5
