An American in Paris is an integrated musical, which means the songs and dances fit perfectly to the story. The film was inspired by the 1928 orchestra composition by George Gershwin. <br /> <br /> The story of the movie is captured with show Kelly choreographed by Gene Kelly and featured on popular Gershwin songs. Songs and music include "I have rhythm," "Wonderful," and "Our love is here to stay". It sets a new standard for the subgenre known as the "songbook" music with decades of Gershwin tunes buried in the underline. The climax is the ballet of the American in Paris, an 18-minute dance with Kelly and Caron who is Gershwin's An American in Paris with an Impressionist daydream in the style of several painters. any Hollywood movie. The ballet alone costs more than half a million dollars, a staggering sum at the time. <br /> <br /> It is funny to think that such a work of art about a pool game between film producer Arthur Freed (Singin 'IN THE RIGHT, OWN, ON THE VILLAGE, MUST BE IN ST. LOUIS AND THE BANDWAGON) and Ira Gershwin meet. It was Freed's idea to buy the title so he could use as a film about Paris and Gershwin's idea that it would only use Gershwin music. <br /> <br /> Original cast was Cyd Charisse, but she discovered she was pregnant before shooting began. An important reason Gen Kelly suggested Leslie Caron as the female lead was because he felt this movie needed a "real" French girl playing Lise, not just an American actress playing one. Gene Kelly discovered Leslie Caron while in Paris, where he saw her performing in a ballet. When she got the call to audition, she said, "Who is Gene Kelly?" According to Leslie Caron, her introductory dance series, which included a seductive dance with a chair, was considered by some sensors to be suggestive. Gene Kelly directs the short fantasy dance sequence shown when Lise is launched. <br /> <br /> Vincente Minnelli first wanted Maurice Chevalier in the Georges Guerary section and Celeste Holm in the Nina Foch part. <Br /> <br /> Minnelli was a groundbreaking director of musicals with Meet Me in St. Louis (1944), an American in Paris and The Band Wagon (1953). He uses color and songs in ways they haven't used before. He used imaginative space and time. Best of all, however, he allowed him to cut loose for the long ballet sequence ending all his films. The ballet in an American in Paris can be his best job. <br /> <br /> Although Vincente Minnelli is credited as the only director, he is sometimes associated with his divorce from Judy Garland and other directing projects, which leave Gen. Kelly to take over the legal duties. <br /> <br /> Other highlights include Guetary's version of "Trap to Paradise"; Oscar Levant's fantasy of performing and performing Gershwin's "Concerto in F" (see why it was Oscar Levant's favorite.) <br /> <br /> The ballet sequence, now we know it is successful, everyone wants to take credit. , Freed, Minnelli, Kelly ?? But before the film was completed, the MGM New York office said no to spend half a million dollars on a ballet. So Freed himself went to Louis B. Mayer's studio and agreed to vote. New York said no. Finally, did Kelly Kelly show the New York office how a British movie, THE RED SHOES, used a long ballet sequence and the movie became a worldwide hit? and is still considered the premium example of a successful art film today. Well, the financial guys finally gave in and signed the checks. <br /> <br /> There was a break in production after November 1, 1950, and at that time Gen Kelly started training the ballet choreography. By the time the production was resumed for the final series on December 6, Vincente Minnelli directed another film - Father's Little Dividend (1951). <br /> <br /> Irene Sharaff designed a style for every ballet sequence that bounced off several French impressionist painters: 'Raoul Dufy', the Edouard Manet (the flower market), Maurice Utrillo (a Paris street), Henri Rousseau (the trade show), 'Vincent van Gogh' 'Opera') and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec (the Moulin Rouge). The background took six weeks to build, with 30 painters not stopping. <br /> <br /> Roger Ebert said after watching the recent restoration, an American in Paris has many features, especially the well-known ballet production number, with Kelly and Leslie Caron symbolizing the whole story of their courts in dance. . "An American in Paris is often compared to SINGIN 'IN THE RAIN, who made it the greatest musical ever, and one critic did the best when he said:" SINGIN IN THE LAW makes me happy and an American Paris makes me feel good. "The ballet represents Kelly's fantasies as portrayed by the great French artists (Renoir, Rousseau, Lautrec, Dufy) he admires. Arrange a show for the then-bad Raoul Dufy, the actor and producer came to the end credits. was relieved, they found the artist, went to tears and asked for a second aid from the wonderful final. <br /> <br /> The film was also the first to win a Golden Globe award for the best film (comedy or musical.) <br /> <br /> That year, Gene Kelly received an honorary academy award for "his versatility as actor, singer, director and dancer, and specifically for his brilliant performances in the art of choreography. on film. "It was his only Oscar.
