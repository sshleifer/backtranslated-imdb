I won't repeat everything that has already been said by other viewers of this movie. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is an excellent movie, not only as a very human story of the developing relationship between a father and his grand son, but also as a small window on the world of practicing Islam, for those like me who are not very familiar with that religion. <br /> <br /> An important aspect of this story is that of the young man's relationship with his father's beliefs and practices, and how his attitude toward religion is subtle as we move on their journey with them. . <br /> <br /> It's a very enticing, enjoyable and well-made movie I recommend to anyone with a brain and heart.
