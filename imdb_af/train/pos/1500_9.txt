Now days, most people don't look at classic movies, like this one. Most friends just watch movies from the 90's to host. It's so friendly. <br /> <br /> Most old movies like these are masterpieces unique in their own way. Just because, when these movies were thought and made, that's when ideas were fresh. Now people are just pushing to think of new ideas. <br /> <br /> Anyway, after the movie. For true fans of classic horror. It's for you. The film is based on a Scotland Yard investigator investigating the disappearance of a film actor and bumping into three other strange incidents with the former residents of the same house. <br /> <br /> I won't say anymore because I'll ruin the movie more than I already have. But it's a great movie for as old as it is. And it will never care to see it again!
