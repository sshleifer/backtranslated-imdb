"Citizen X" is the wonderful story of the hunt for one of the worst serial killers of history. What makes this story even more compelling is where and when it happened; the Soviet Union in the 1980s. <br /> <br /> ** Soft Spoilers ** <br /> <br /> Viktor Burakov (played great by Stephen Rea) is a newly promoted forensic investigator for the Rostov oblast. He discovers past and present unresolved murders, apparently by the same person. The murders are unresolved because no one has ever bothered to investigate the evidence properly. He is managed to find and stop the killer. His only tools are his dedication, skill and honesty. His stumbling blocks are the corruption and political ideology of the Soviet system that discourages the search for truth. His naive would have led to failure, it wasn't for his boss, pat. Mikhail Fetisov (Donald Sutherland). Fetisov is a politically smart cynic who understands the game and knows how to handle the Soviet bureaucracy. He also shares Burakov's desire to bring a murderer to justice, even though the official party is "There are no serial killers in the Soviet Union!" <br /> <br /> The cast is outstanding. The places and sets are perfect recreations of the latter Soviet life. Randy Edelman's score is especially good. <br /> <br /> More importantly, this film shows a dark and disturbing criminal phenomenon with both intensity and poignancy. It was a combined movie by HBO Films and they have become a great source for films that would otherwise never be made.
