The story and music (George Gershwin!) Is wonderful, like Levant, Guetary, Foch, and of course Kelly. One thing is missing, and that thing is a good leading lady. I'm sorry Leslie Caron bothered me. Anyway, despite her, the plot moves nicely with the well-known (and deserved) Ballet. O the colors, the bright reds, blues, greens and yellows. Don't forget the beiges. ; ) I'm just surprised by the contrast between the Beaux Arts Ball (completely black and white costumes) and the one-day brilliant Ballet. <br /> <br /> So I suppose I'm trying to say, this is: Please, Anyway, see it and enjoy it, because although it's not the best, it's great. But be sure you haven't forgotten the other Gene Kelly music game, with the 20-year-old girl popping into the stars shortly afterwards.
