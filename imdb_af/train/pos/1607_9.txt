As someone else has said here, every scene in this movie is jewelery. Most movies are fortunate to have a perfect scene, but director Jewison hit a homepage every time. The movie just managed to take the excellent script. In addition, Dick Hyman's musical institutions of opera and other music have created a perfect match. Difficult to imagine how they kept the exact mood through the long production of a movie. The comedy is subtle (mostly), and the camera work reflects every little emotional bent of the story. Cher is such a comedy natural, Vincent Gardenia (who I know mostly through his Frank Lorenzo role at All in the Family until I saw him in this and then outside Broadway in the 80's) deserves much more death than ever, and Aiello's unfortunate loser is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to kudos to this tremendous role. Did Jewison ever write about this movie? <br /> <br /> Would like to read it. Hard to figure out why the average rating here at IMDb is so low ...
