Of all the 1940s and 1950s movie reviews, it has to be one of the strangest and most fun to watch. I say this because of the four main actors: Orson Welles, Rita Hayworth, Everett Sloane and Glenn Anders. <br /> <br /> The first two names are known to everyone, but it was the last two that made this movie so entertaining for me, especially Anders. His character, "George Grisby," is one of the strangest people I've ever seen on film. His voice, and some of the things he said, should be heard to be believed. Slaons are not far behind in the "strange" category. Hayworth is not as glamorous with a short blonde hair, but Hayworth, which means it has to be a lot if you are an old one. Welles' is as fascinating as ever. One tip: If you have the DVD, switch on the English subtitles. His character in this movie is an Irishman and you need the captions to understand everything he says. <br /> <br /> Welles also directed the movie, which means that you have great camera angles and wonderful facials. You also have a unique ending, visually, with a shooting in a mirror house. Good stuff! As bizarre as this film is, I still thought the buffalo-like carnival atmosphere at the trial near the end was too much and kept away from the seriousness of the scene. Other than that, no complaints. <br /> <br /> It's great entertainment, which is the name of the game.
