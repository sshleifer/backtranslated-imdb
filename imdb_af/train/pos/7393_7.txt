This movie was impressive. My first experience with a foreign film, it wasn't too long or too complex. I enjoyed the captions myself; and the plot was surprisingly fresh. The story of an adult boy who visited his elderly father, and a delayed brother after a long separation, first acted, but it was very touching and realistic. There were also some subtle humor not to push or tolerate the audience.
