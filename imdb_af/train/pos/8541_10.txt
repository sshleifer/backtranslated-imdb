I know it's not what you expect from a movie with this kind of <br /> <br /> descent - it's a direct descendant of the best years of our lives <br /> <br /> and the men ... movies dealing with in-hospital men <br /> <br /> dealing with tragic circumstances. But this movie is full of wonderful surprises and performances. It features star performances from <br /> <br /> Eric Stoltz and Helen Hunt (including a rather risque nude scene) <br /> <br /> and Wesley Snipes and William Forsythe. As Emanuel Levy <br /> <br /> wrote in his book Cinema of Outsiders (about the Independent film <br /> <br /> movement) "The Waterdance is coherent, attention to detail, and <br /> < br>> careless with a wicked to earth humor - it is immediately <br /> <br /> funny and sad, and the whole role is impressive. "I was <br /> <br /> particularly moved by this movie, it's hard to hit yes, but also <br /> <br /> <br />. A rare jewel.
