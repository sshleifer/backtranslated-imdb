I saw this movie at least fifty times and after seeing it for the first time for the first time in a long time, I still experienced it. <br /> <br /> The story itself was incredible, but came through Spielberg's expertise and the fabulous cast including Whoopi Goldberg, Oprah Winfrey, Danny Glover, and Margaret Avery. Akosua Busia deserves an Oscar nomination for her short but powerful portrayal of Nettie. <br /> <br /> You will experience every human emotion while watching this movie. I laughed, wept and got angry. Like most big movies, it was considered by the Academy with a host of nominations, but no victories. But this movie is definitely one of the best movies of all time.
