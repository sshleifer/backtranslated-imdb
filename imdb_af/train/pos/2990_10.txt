I think it was Ebert who gave Stella four out of four stars, but, apart from her, I have never read a positive review of this sadly misunderstood drama about class divisions, love and sacrifice (three themes that are most romantic) stories or movies are common). <br /> <br /> Here is the main theme class section. Stella is a story of depression era America. It is said to have been translated on the screen, then in such a memorable way that these remakes (if you ask a Stanwyck fan or two) are not exactly appreciated. Fans of the original never gave it a chance. Furthermore, this version of Stella was made in the 1990s, not exactly a time of major financial problems in America (as the depression was). Now is the time to remove the rose glasses amid a new era of recession and poverty in America and to see that this powerful story is still true is as timely and relevant as ever, in its updated format . <br /> <br /> Yes, class distribution is the big theme here. Stella is one of the poor, single, with big dreams, but little hope to realize those dreams. She works in a bar, doesn't have much money, lives in a nice apartment. You get the drift. In the morning she didn't really want to get out of bed. On her wall, pictures of movie stars depict. <br /> <br /> A man sees her dance at the bar. He is rich, educated, of one of those top class families who have nothing in common with Stella's. His biggest concern is what the Ivy League college should attend, how to pay the rent, how to be happy. They have a relationship. They love each other. Stella ends up pregnant. Stella tells the guy the news. She replies? "How about an abortion?" She replied, "I just wanted a room full of balloons." He provided the balloons, and the proposal, but she saw his heart not in it, and had too much to accept. She sends him packing. <br /> <br /> Eventually, her daughter is torn between the two lifestyles - the love she has for her mother, and the benefits and happiness and love that her rich father has faced. Stella, alone and unloved, and does not want her daughter one day to be as unhappy as she, make the ultimate sacrifice. She gives the only love and happiness she ever knew to her daughter's happiness, and maybe she knows with good fortune and hope that at least her daughter has found something to live. <br /> <br /> Now, for the movie. Everything is right. Beautiful score, artful cinematography, great design (contrast between the two lifestyles, the messy appetite and the decorated homes), wonderful and sincere performances throughout the role, with especially Bette Midler, Oscar-worthy. <br /> <br /> It's a movie that is much more meaningful and well-made than you have been taught to believe.
