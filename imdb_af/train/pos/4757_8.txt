Of course, Rod Serling was a genius and his wonderful, playful, creative thought left the era in which he lived, examples of television in the development situation. There are no such shows now, but rather 'Housewife' locks, Eva Longoria or Terri Hatcher, or the spicy breakthroughs of humor and witty rogue who rub our high-tech screens. <br /> <br /> In the episode with such acting precision and with the usual madness that I can't help, Jack Elam thinks Rod Serling watched the long show week around Elam, though he was a complement to flow of the story. This episode ends with a twist, as usual, but shock and humor are mixed with especially "Serlingesque" agility. <br /> <br /> Rex Lewis Field
