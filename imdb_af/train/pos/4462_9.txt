Anchors Aweigh is one of the first of the best music games. It features several memorable musical series such as Kelly dancing with the mouse, Kelly dancing with 7-year-old Sharon McManus, Sinatra singing with Jose Iturbi, piano, Kathryn Grayson, singing iturbi. export, and more. The Technicolor is perfect, with some innovative camera work like seeing a piano played from below, through transparent keys, and Grayson singing, seen by the finder of another camera. The plot is thin, but you get involved with Kelly's & Sinatra's enthusiasm. Sailor is on leave, they have to take a runaway son (Dean Stockwell) and Sinatra home for his aunt. To set up with the aunt (Grayson), Kelly suggests that Sinatra can get her an audition with Jose Iturbi. But Sinatra's young and naive in this one, and in his own healthy words, fall in love too quickly. While trying to contact Iturbi, which is never available, he falls for another girl (Barbara Britton); but Kelly now loves Grayson. Anchor Aweigh is mostly remembered for the combination of live-action / cartoon series with Tom and Jerry, but there are many more here that are worth it. I give it nine stars, because although it's not quite as good as the best musical - Singin 'In The Rain, The Music Man, Oklahoma - is one of the first of their class Technicolor major productions (maybe I meet in St. Louis was the first, and better than most others.
