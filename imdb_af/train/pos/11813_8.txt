Love it or surprise it, it's hard to find Warren Beatty's actions on Dick Tracy. The 1990 film adaptation of Chester Gould's well-known cartoon, anything but a genre classic. Superhero films have come out of the woodwork in recent years, and may soon become a genre on their own. <br /> <br /> Beatty's film uses Gould's source material to its fullest, shooting in all six stripes of primary colors, thus giving this unique but familiar world of faster happy mutant gangsters and loose, seductive women a lush visual style and tone. <br /> <br /> It can be said that the strong visual aesthetics of the film drastically shortens the characters and their acting abilities, which I don't think, can be further out of the truth. <br /> <br /> "Dick Tracy" enjoys his looks and abominable characters, and Beatty himself, who plays the dogged and incorruptible detective of the title, is quite stoic and ready to spoil the bad guys against any and all costs. <br /> <br /> Unlike the visual delights and Oscar-winning make-up, there's a plot and Big Boy Caprice (Al Pacino, delightful over-the-top in an Oscar-nominated performance), to eliminate Tr. Tracy is currently maintaining his relationship with Tess Trueheart (Tess Trueheart). He is also moving into a well-planned movement, but is also trying to gain control of all criminal action in the city by uniting all the feuding gangs under him. <br /> <br /> Glenne Headly, who would like it, stays true to his side and cares for The Kid (Charlie Korsmo), who eventually finds a father figure in our crime-breaking hero. Tracy's faithfulness to Tess is tested by the seductive progress of Breathless Mahoney (Madonna), who is also Big Boy's biggest hit. At the same time, it all goes down, things are heated when a new criminal figure arrives in town and decides to play both sides at the center. <br /> <br /> The performances are good as Beatty's focus On the tense and romantic relationships between each of the leaders becomes the centerpiece of the material, as opposed to just concentrating on useless action and special effects. Pacino freely throws the scenery into a role that really stands out from the rest. <br /> <br /> "Dick Tracy" is one of the best and most overlooked comic book genre. I think if Chester Gould was still alive, he would be proud of Warren Beatty's attack on his beloved crime fighter. <br /> <br /> 8/10
