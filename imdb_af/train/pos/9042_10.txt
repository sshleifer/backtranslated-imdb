I think I read this place: Joe Johnston (director of the movie and also one of the guys who created Industrial Light and Magic for work on the first Star Wars movie) and one of his producers or something hung their brains for a title for The movie, Rocket Boys, was missing something. <br /> <br /> One day they messed up with a computer program that forms words from other words (ie you enter a word or series of words and it mixes the letters and forms different words.) An "anagram" <br /> <br /> Anyway, they typed in "Rocket Boys" and sure enough, coming back is "October Sky". They were shocking to say the least. The title summed everything up in the movie, as the film revolves around Sputnik. Initially, Homer Jr didn't have the idea, but he warmed it up after the movie poster paperback novel came out.
