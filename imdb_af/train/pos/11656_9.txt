I saw some movies on eating disorders, but this one was definitely my favorite. The problem with the other was that the people with eating disorders to the end just got better automatically or accepted the fact that they needed help and that's it. This movie I thought was more realistic in this one's main character, Lexi doesn't get better automatically. She gets better and then has his disadvantage. I think this movie shows more than the others I've seen get better, it doesn't just happen, it's hard work and takes time, it's a long way to recovery. I think this movie shows it very well. There should be more movies like this.
