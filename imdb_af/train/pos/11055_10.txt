Well, what can I say, unlike these people are super in every way. I love Sharon Mcreedy, I enjoy this pure nostalgic series and I have the box of 9 slices 30 episodes, I didn't realize they made so much. I also think it's a great shame that they haven't made any more. I wish I had given these powers, Imagine, I am being repelled from my cycle somewhere, chewed somewhere, and then waking up in a special hospital. Later I discovered that my body was improved. Just like Richard Barrat. These stories are totally 50 minutes of pure action and tension. You can't fight these 3 people as they will defeat you in all types of weapons. The music is well written, and for me, a wonderful picture of 3 super creatures in my mind. The kind of powers the champions have are the same as our domestic dog or cats, Enhanced face, Enhanced hearing and touch. and the power of 10 men for Richard and Craig and the strength of 3 women for Sharon. Who I thought was beautiful and intelligent. When I was a boy, I loved her very much! Now I can see why, on my DVD set. The box is very nice and it comes with a free booklet about the series. I also thought Trymane was a good boss, but he did things!
