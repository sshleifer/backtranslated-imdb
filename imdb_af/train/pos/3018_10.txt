This movie is one exception to the rule that a successor is worse than the original one. His comedy at its best. This movie is a quick action slapstick comedy, where something happens every second. On more than one occasion the whole audience laughed aloud at a joke. <br /> <br /> Seeing the first movie is a big advantage, but it's not a requirement. <br /> <br /> The GÃ¶ta channel 2 also has the advantage of a parody of the last decades of reality TV series as survivor (expediton: Robinson in Swedish). This is a Swedish movie for the Swedish public. This is not the case if you are not familiar with Sweden and its language. Other: Enjoy! Johan
