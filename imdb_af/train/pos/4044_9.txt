I played this movie very well. The point of departure is quite imaginative, and as a viewer I was drawn as the characters developed. The pacing is done very well for those who like to think. Enough of the viewer to be hidden early enough, questions remain that are answered later, which produces a well thought out and very satisfying film, both cerebral and action. position. <br /> <br /> It seems some people were looking for a non-stop rollercoaster ride with this movie - one of those coming out of the gate. It will be more analogous to one of those coasters who first take you on the hill - it creates a wonderful sense of anticipation - and is ultimately more fulfilled in my mind for the foundation initially laid. <br /> <br /> Excellent movie.
