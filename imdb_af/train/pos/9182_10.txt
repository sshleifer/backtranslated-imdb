Those who love the book Jane Eyre as I do (this is my favorite every time, and I read it at least once a year) will love this version. Timothy Dalton is just a little nice to be Mr. Rochester, but otherwise he does a wonderful job depicting the moving master of Thornfield. Zelah Clarke may have been a little too old to play 18-year-old Jane, but if I watch this movie, I don't think of the ages of the characters. The film's dialogue is almost verbally taken from the book, which was very clever. Sure, this movie may look a bit long, but it's the only version I've seen that includes part 3 of the story. <br /> <br /> I wish the people who made this movie were involved in the newer Zeferelli version, as it would have helped the mess of a movie. <br /> <br /> I also realized the last time I watched this video that Judy Cornwell plays "Auntie Reed"! She is so versatile that I didn't recognize her. She plays Daisy in Keeping Appearances and also plays Mrs. Musgrove in 1995's persuasion (another wonderful adaptation). <br /> <br /> UPDATE: Got the DVD this week, and it's great to see the original undated version. There is much more to it (Young Jane at Gateshead and Lowood.) And in the end, they did a lot of recovery. (I always wondered why St John had a slip of paper when he revealed that he knew who Jane was because the part where he tore it out of her painting was released from the VHS version of the USA!). Rosamund Oliver is in there ... she was completely cut out of the VHS. As far as I could tell, they didn't work out any of Timothy Dalton's parts, so nothing new, but it's great to see the whole miniseries as a whole after enjoying the VHS years. Thank you, BBC (PS ... I would have paid more for a special edition DVD ... with maybe a few star interviews ... or a show)
