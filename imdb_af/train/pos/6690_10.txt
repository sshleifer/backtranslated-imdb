Mystery Men is one of those movies that gets harder over the years. There is a naive innocence and "beauty" to the characters. It has become part of our family "culture" and we often call the characters. This is my favorite movie of the past two years. My kids are 13 and 11 and we all love this movie. Great acting and comedy. We also love Galaxy Quest and Monty Python flicks. Okay, we're not talking here intellectually, just family bonding!
