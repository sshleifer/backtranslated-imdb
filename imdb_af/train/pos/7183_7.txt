It is a perfect family viewing series. We gather around the TV to watch it on BBC America. This is an updated version of Robin Hood and appeals to children and adults. Our teen and tween rider enjoy sitting with mom and dad and watching Robin's next races. We can't wait for the next episode to fly every week and are happy for the free "On Demand" look. <br /> <br /> The wardrobe has a place of current fashion. There is a moral on every story. It's entertaining. The violence is not on top or unnecessary. The soundtrack is absolutely fantastic with the feel of John William. It is an old world story that is brought back to life with a new world flag. <br /> <br /> There is so much rubbish on television from the brain of "reality" tradition to senseless violence. You need it for what it is and it's an updated "Robin Hood" that doesn't compare to Errol Flynn's movie releases. It is a gem that is enjoyed by everyone. Parents who are concerned that their children are seeing too much violence will like Robin to lose his taste for war and bloodshed. He is a Robin Hood who rather tries to save his way from a disagreement than a fight. Maid Marian is also an attractive role model for young girls. Rather than getting up and doing nothing, she takes her own role to help the poor by being the Night Watchman. The Sheriff of Nottingham is wonderfully upset, just as the Sheriff must be and looks like a cross between Billy Joel and Tim Curry. Guy Gisborne is played by an extremely handsome actor, one who wishes most women he did not portray the role of a bad "Guy". <br /> <br /> The only question we have is: "Where is Friar Tuck?"
