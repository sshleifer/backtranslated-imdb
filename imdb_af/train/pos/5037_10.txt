It could be the most underrated movie of his genre. I do not remember any advertising or advertising for this one, which could be the reason why it did not do so well at the checkout. However, Frailty is an excellent and truly original horror movie. I rank it within the top 10 most favorite horror movies on my list. <br /> <br /> Movie begins with photos and news stories telling us about a killer calling himself "God's hand." And then a man goes to a police station and tells the chief officer that he knows the killer is his brother. Two of them go to a place where the victims are buried, which can help solve the case. During the journey, the man began to tell the story of his brother and went back in time when the events started. Fenton and Adam are two young brothers who live with their strict and religious father who one day claimed to have received a divine message from God that asked him to kill the demons who are regular people. He receives from God a list of names of demons to be destroyed and asks his sons to help him accomplish this divine mission. <br /> <br /> It is an absolutely horrible and exciting movie that puts you at the edge of your seat. The tension runs high, innocent people (or demons?) Are murdered and religious experiences are questioned. It doesn't have one, but very many intelligent twists at the end. If you like this genre, I highly recommend Frailty. I own the DVD and this is one of my favorite horror thrillers.
