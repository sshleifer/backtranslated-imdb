I am disappointed, if not surprised, by the lack of appreciation this movie received. Again Billy Zane proves he is more than just a Hollywood handsome boy in a quiet performance combining spastic slapstick with understated pathos. To call it a silent movie is inaccurate, as there is a lot of music and sound. It has a manic fit and is full of the goofy ingenuity that Ed Wood is ultimately appreciated. Look at the molded listing, and realize that everyone is shining. Nobody is just there to show their face. I believe they are all in the movie to show their appreciation for Wood and to do a broad, physical type of acting that is not so much seen. <br /> <br /> But today, adjudicators are trying to guess To become a hit much more than they show any kind of aesthetic appreciation for a movie. And IWUETDID has no clear target audience. It's mostly made out of love for Wood's writing. Even after his death, the modern-day social parasites gave him another serious blow and robbed the world of a minor classic. It is a highly entertaining and truly experimental movie that really deserves to live, at least on DVD.
