No sense about the story, as enough reviewers did it. Here are some different angles to it from one of those "religious nuts", as one outrageous reviewer puts it so tolerant. <br /> <br /> 1) "Baby Face" (1933) may be the classic example ever put on film of how women can manipulate men with sex. There is a lot of truth that Barbara Stanwyck demonstrates in this movie: look cute, bat your lashes, offer your body for free ..... and men will fall over to help you with everything you want. <Br /> <br /> In this case, it was performance with the ultimate goal of money ... much of it. At least four men in this movie just offer it, even though they ruin their lives in the process. <br /> <br /> 2) The end - which many of the judges looked here to hate - gives another good message: all the money and material goods in the world will not feel a person being fulfilled no. A sad comment that so many "critics" here would rather have bad messages, prefer to slam over the dust. No surprise, I think. <br /> <br /> The way you look at it is the start of entertainment, and Stanwyck has some good lines, especially in the beginning when she was her rude father and his illegal bar clients. Over a little over 70 minutes, this movie moves at a fast pace and is over before you know it.
