This is a great show! I had a US high school history teacher who was so much. There are many facts in history that are not quite true and Mr. Wuhl shows them very well in a way that is unforgettable. Mr. Wuhl teaches a class of film students, but history students and even the general public will appreciate the wise way of discovering some of the well-known errors in the history of the world and trying to impress them on the minds of his students. The use of live actors performing sketches is also very entertaining. <br /> <br /> I recommend this series to anyone interested in the history they've learned when a child has turned upside down.
