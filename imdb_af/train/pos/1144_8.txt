In 1955, the British made a comedy called Simon and Laura, with Peter Finch and the brilliant Kay Kendall. To date, this is one of the best examples of British comedy and more specifically about how television sitcoms become so popular. It was and is also an excellent example of self-referring theater. So also Soapdish, a movie I never heard a few days ago when I caught it on TV. Initially, I was a bit doubtful because the comedy is so hard to do, as you know. <br /> <br /> However, I was pleasantly surprised and delighted to watch a very clever satire about American American TV. In fact, it has been a while since I laughed so much. So, if you like satire, I advise you to see it. <br /> <br /> The main actors ?? Sally Field, Kevin Kline, Robert Downey and Cathy Moriarty ?? Simply do an excellent job, and reveal just how bitchy and level are the issues of acting. While I watched it, I thought to myself: just how much of this bitchiness switches to real life? That is, if actors ever have a real life? For example, as you probably know, Peter Sellers was notorious for hiding his true persona behind a multitude of characters so no one knows the right person. When I watched Sally Field for Celeste Talbot playing Maggie, I thought about the previous British movie with Kay Kendall playing Laura in a TV sitcom to Peter Finch. <br /> <br /> Is it any wonder some actors have nervous breakdowns? And that feeling was crystallized when Celeste eventually confronted her daughter (Lori, played by Elizabeth Shue) and at an emotional moment repeated the fictional lines she used on a previous episode of her day soap, when she entered her fictional daughter face it That's how! Are you confused? Well, it's not so, but the dialogue is cute for originality, comedy, bitchiness, anger, depravity, duplicate, and even ... love. <br /> <br /> The story? Well, there are many stories in this movie, all interwoven, and all come together (of course, but not like a Robert Altman movie, okay!), And not everyone is finally resolved. But life is not so, right? The pace is almost awful, and you really have to watch and listen carefully to catch all the giggles and subtle jokes. Spend the 97 minutes of your life and look at it; You won't regret the time management. <br /> <br /> The rest of the players are playing well, although I have never taken much notice of Whoopi Goldberg. Perhaps the funniest exchanges between Robert Downey and Cathy Moriarty and my money stealing the latter are so many scenes, she gets my vote as the outstanding player. I don't baby you, she gives the term bitch a completely new face ...
