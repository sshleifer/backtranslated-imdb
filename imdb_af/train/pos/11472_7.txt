As a fan to look further at the phenomenon of school shooting, this film has taken an interesting and different approach to the idea. Offered as a series of video recordings made by the two troubled men (I can't refer to people being killed as boys or teenagers), the preparation preparations that lead to zero day (the code name for the day they are going to attack) To present the situation on the opposite side of the gun. They seem to portray the pain they are suffering, but focus on literal preparation. The problem is that little in terms of emotion is delivered directly. The only point that made emotion overwhelming was the end, as expected. But so far, it's never really clear why they're planning it. We are told the compulsory story that they are mocked, but the film also seems to contradict it. Without destroying the movie, it's easy to say it was a good effort and has similar intentions, but falls short of messy movies. All directing is amateur, to further promote the homemade video concept, but the story and continuity are poor. The film seems to want to decide a lot, but it does not provide the information for such an event either. The end is suddenly, and it does not feel that it has finished everything the movie has started.
