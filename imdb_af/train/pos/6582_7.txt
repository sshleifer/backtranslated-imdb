Okay, so there is a front view of a Checker taxi, probably late 1930s. It has the large triangular headlights. There is also a DeSoto taxi in this black and white, character-driven, almost musical love has gone wrong story. <br /> <br /> The real pleasure here is the look at the 1940s room interiors and fashions and hotel elevators. The hairstyles, male and female, are beautiful. If Dolly Parton had Victor Hare's hair, she could have made it big. There is an artist loft that will be the envy of every Andy Warhol wannabe. <br /> <br /> If you see this when you expect a great Casablanca story or Sound of Music oom-pah pah, you'll be disappointed. There is a nice little story under the runway model approach in this movie. <br /> <br /> My copy on DVD with another movie for $ 1 was very visible. The title series was cute, but not there, with Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World or The Pink Panther. It was a RCO movie, but it didn't have the nice airplane logo that RCD used. <br /> <br /> I have Victor Mature in One Million, B.C. and love Sampson and Delilah and especially in Great Saturday. See if you can find that one. He was great in the comedy with Peter Sellers, called Caccia Alla Volpe or After the Fox. <br /> <br /> In the early 1950s, Richard Carlson led me to three lives on TV. <br /> <br /> Vic Mature is part of Sampson's dad presented in the remake of Sampson and Delilah. He was allegedly asked if he would have trouble with the father, as he was known as Sampson. Victor replied: "If the money is right, I'll play Sampson's mother." <br /> <br /> Tom Willett
