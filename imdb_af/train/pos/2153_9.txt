This movie was charming. An accountant wants more of life than the approved conventional success. What makes it so good, and makes it so different from the standard dance movie, is that it's not really going to be "Big", it's just about finding a way to express yourself. The great triumph in the end is not winning a game, not the discovery of a whole new lifestyle, but the simple joy of doing what you want to achieve the other parts of your life. No one is discovering their passion, they find their quiet soul. <br /> <br /> The Japanese background makes the subtle oppression and the "secret life" of ballroom dance understandable and personal. We can all see in ourselves.
