Madhur Bhandarkar is all out to touch taboo issues and give the most realistic picture of modern society. One gets the impression of the director even from his previous films such as the Satta and Chandni pub. The issues that are only covered in the latter film are being investigated and exposed here in their entirety. The casting is great and you can see the judgments on every scene from many angles. Mostly, the movie makes you wonder about many facts around. As you start guessing things, you don't end up at all, but miss the point in many scenes. It finally leaves a lasting impression. <br /> <br /> Actors watching include Konkana Sen Sharma, Boman Irani and Atul Kulkarni. The dialogues are well written and you feel you have lived from these people. There are still some scenes that remind you of more depths. The songs are in the background saving time and Lata's voice in a very meaningful song "Kitne Ajeeb" makes you feel you are alone in the midst of modern society!
