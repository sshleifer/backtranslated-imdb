No other movie made me feel like it before ... and I don't feel bad. As I didn't want my money, or the time I waited to watch this movie (9 months), I also didn't feel like using two hours of a sunny summer day to see it ______. The reason I say "_____" is because it doesn't matter how hard I wrapped my brain. I just can't say a word in any of the seven languages ​​the movie included. I have no idea what's going on all the time and halfway through the movie I needed to get a break. No movie ever did it to me. Never in my life do I need so much cauliflower, milk and rolls. Thank you. - Ed <br /> <br /> Uh. * throat throat * no words No thoughts. I do not know. I really don't know. - Cait
