Exceeded by "Braveheart" released the same year, the two costume dramas compare badly. I acknowledge my bias against Mel Gibson, but I maintain a rational preference for "Rob Roy." Both "Braveheart" and "Rob Roy" give a spectacular picture of the history of the Scots in a bloody, romantic way. "Braveheart" is an epic attempt at individual honor and courage and a fine revenge fantasy. This is also melodramatic, anachronistic and maudlin. Note his cornball use of slow motion filming. The violence is ugly and glorious. It is the latter quality that makes it more attractive to the adolescent mindset. While "Braveheart" Rob Roy exceeds in mere levels of massacre (not to mention his tranquil running time), the final movie is finally more mature and satisfying. His action is more understated, but more surprising and clever. His sex is less showy, but still erotic. "Rob Roy" also has a better-regarded romantic interest. His dialogue seeks to approach the poetry of the period. His rats in the mouth of the actors are trying to approach the dentistry of the era. And Tim Roth is an excellent villain. Also recommended: "The Last of the Mohicans" and "The Patriot." You may be more related to "Braveheart" with the emphasis on bloodlust, with the former similar to "Rob Roy" in tone. All the aforementioned movies earn their R ratings for violence.
