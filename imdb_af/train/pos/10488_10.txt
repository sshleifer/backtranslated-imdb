After her Oscar nominee turned into "Secrets & Lies", Brenda Blethyn stood in the equally big "Savings Grace". And let me tell you, it's not the kind of movie you get every day. <br /> <br /> After her husband commits suicide, Grace Trevethyn (Brenda Blethyn) discovers that her irresponsible financial decisions are massive. Fortunately, she finds a way to meet ends: marijuana. That's right, Grace is starting to grow it. <br /> <br /> Every aspect of this movie has been played to a good effect; there is not a dull moment in it. And I guess I didn't see the end come! But anyway, you should see this movie. You can only feel more than a little festive after you have seen it. If nothing else, it can work as a good lesson if you know your finances. But of course there is much more to it!
