Bye Bye Birdie is not one of the best musical of all time, but it is fun and accessible to many audiences. The original movie could have been great, with Dick Van Dyke giving his signature Broadway role, but instead they cut the plot. The film is therefore very unsatisfactory. This re-make, broadcast on ABC in 1995, is much more true to the original screenplay, and also includes original songs used in a national tour. This movie from which Tommy Tune and Ann Reinking Choreographed this movie. Jason Alexander is a very different kind of Dick Van Dyke, but he was well-cast as Albert (before his "Seinfeld" days, he started in the Music Theater .) Vanessa Williams is a perfect fit for Rose. They are also good work from Tyne Daly as Mae and Mark Kudisch as Conrad Birdie (a role he played on the national tour.) <br /> <br /> However, this film is not without problems. A big responsibility is Chynna Phillips, who looks attractive and just looks too old to be Kim. And George Wendt is somewhat sweet as her father, throws away the number of "kids" (a number of original role player Paul Lynde stole the show.) <br /> <br /> But that's all beautiful, well done movie that deserves the material.
