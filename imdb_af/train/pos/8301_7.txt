Gary Busey is the title character, Frank "Bulletproof" McBain, your standard reckless maverick policeman who earned his nickname because it doesn't matter how many bullets he takes (38 and count). He never stops at the bad guys. <Br /> <br /> When a former US tank called "Thunderblast" is driven across the border to Mexico, it is revolutionized by terrorists led by General Brogado (Rene Enriquez) and Libyan colonial cartiff (Henry Silva ), which aligned it with Russian villains. The Army staff involved are detained, including Devon Shepard (Darlanne Fluegel), who is McBain's ex-girlfriend. McBain is then designated by the military for a rescue mission. <br /> <br /> Busey should not say the physical presence of the saying, someone like Schwarzenegger, who would be another appropriate lead for a movie of this type, but he is an explosion as a confident man who fast with the erase cracks. Fluegel is a good female lead; She doesn't just look incredibly sexy, but makes for a fine pouring action babe. Enriquez, Silva, Juan Fernandez, and always welcome William Smith (as a Russian chief) is disgusting scum in the classic action movie tradition. The supporting role is fairly full of known and reliable character factors: L.Q. Jones, R.G. Armstrong, Thalmus Rasulala, Lincoln Kilpatrick, Mills Watson, Luke Askew, Danny Trejo, and Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa. <br /> <br /> T.L. Lankford and B.J. Goldman provides the writing, based on a story by Lankford and veteran B director Fred Olen Ray. This is the kind of script you just know the authors have their tongues in their cheeks: they know their material is absurd and cheesy, and just has good credibility from the window. Veteran action director Steve Carver keeps it moving and delivers a respected amount of firearms, explosions and general all-out chaos. <br /> <br /> "Bulletproof" is great fun for the action fan who doesn't mind switching off. occasionally their brain enjoys a wide variety of violence and humor. <br /> <br /> 7/10
