The Cameraman's Revenge is an unusual short because of the subject (adultery) or because it is animated (Winsor McCay has introduced Little Nemo to the scene by this time), but because it depicts errors telling the story! Ladislaw Starewicz originally wanted the real mistakes to be made, but they couldn't get it on camera, because the hot lights they suffered, he died and started using stop techniques to manipulate movements to his satisfaction. This brief is a good job of placing human attributes on small creatures, such as motorcycling, painting, filming, kissing and dancing. Starewicz will also make Frogland (1922) and The Mascot (1933), but his first notable work will be this one. If you are interested in this and the other shorts mentioned, look at your local library to borrow the DVD The Cameraman't Revenge and other great stories from Beeld Vermaak.
