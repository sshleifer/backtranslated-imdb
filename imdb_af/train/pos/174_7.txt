Sunny, a cocktail waitress in the D.C. area, is a little dull to put in lightly. She runs an old clunker and hires a small room from a gay male couple. However, she saved the life of a prominent Arab by taking a bullet in the back intended for the official. She charms the national press with her zany remarks and her sweet look. Presidential tools get her installed in the protocol department for the US government. Even then she sometimes wastes things, but she tries hard and learn a lot. She even grabs the romantic attention of a government department official. But, is there another sinister plot in making an Arab man who wants to take another woman? A blonde one? LOL, LOL, LOL. This movie has Goldie as beautiful as a picture and as stupid as a fox, as they say. Sunny teaches her way around the jungle of the US government very well. She even has important things to say about honesty and the lack of it in her protocol environment. Maybe the Arab community will be less excited about this job, but for those who like to laugh, rent it today.
