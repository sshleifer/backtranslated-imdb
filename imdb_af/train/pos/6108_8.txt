I really enjoyed this movie. Many Korean people will be familiar with this movie because many of them have tutors when they go to school. Cinematography was average. The movie would have been better if the angel or the motion of the camera were more irregular. However, the editing was very neat and unusual. <br /> <br /> The acting was also very good. Kim Ha Neul usually played an innocent, weak girl in Korean soap operas. But this time she plays a cute tomboy very well. Kwon Sang Woo also plays his role very credibly. <br /> <br /> What I like most about this movie is that the emotion of the characters is not too exaggerated. There are many Korean romance films that cry the characters before the audience and I always thought it was very old. There was no such thing in this movie. <br /> <br /> Very funny and well done.
