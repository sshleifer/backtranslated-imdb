I was captivated by this touch and hilarious film, not to mention surprise. I was also surprised to find that Paulie's voice was performed by Jay Mohr. The performance was as subtle in appearance, not in schmaltz weight or too heavy under the New Jersey swagger. I thought it should be an old, old pro, not Mr Mohr. A very impressive show, indeed, and it is gratifying to see that his talents are taken seriously in a series of impressive indie films.
