I've always liked it. Warren Beatty is just fair as the comic book hero. What this movie saves is the set, the incredible cast and it leaves a mediocre script. I really expected something more significant in terms of action or plot, but I had very little. The main reason for watching this movie is to watch some of Hollywood's biggest stars at that time in such an unusual movie. <br /> <br /> The one person who did a terrible job and was not even in this movie was Madonna. She didn't help in this movie and her acting work was pretty bad. The movie just stood still on some points. You expected something more and you have nothing. Al Pacino plays a very bad man and he does pretty well. He and Beatty make an excellent good old and bad guy. <br /> <br /> It's also interesting to see Dustin Hoffman and Warren Beatty in a different movie than Isthar. I didn't see Ishtar, but I heard bad things. The thing about this movie is it's good, but it could have been so much better. I kept it as a kid because I thought it looked cool, and the movie was visually surprising, the sets were incredible, the writing was just fair, and with such a role in the movie I would anyway be a a little better expected. <br /> <br /> SPOILER <br /> <br /> I especially thought the final wasn't big enough. It was interesting, but for such a large-scale movie I just thought it could have ended with a little more of a bang. The reason to watch this movie is the atmosphere. The movie uses only the 7 comic strips that make it more visual. <br /> <br /> The costumes and makeup were also flawless. The face makeup for the villains was wonderful. Beatty is just not as big as the life character. Yet it is a good movie that could have been much more. It's better to me than Batman, the other comic book adaptation that came out the same time. Of course the movie was much bigger in terms of gross.
