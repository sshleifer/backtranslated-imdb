I love this movie, but can't find what is in this movie. People who don't like this movie should be Richard Roeper and Roger Ebert. But I can't believe Mr. Carrey is behind all that makeup. And I'm sure most of the actors and actresses in the movie have previously made films. And there's a new face in the movie. Taylor Momsen who plays Cindy Lou Who plays. As the opening comes, the Grinch (Jim Carrey) comes away. And some fun for the Whos in Whoville. Sicne we know that those who love Christmas. While The Grinch doesn't like Christmas. And even make fun of little Cindy Lou Who (Taylor Momsen) who is the daughter of the town's postmaster (Bill Irwin). The movie was directed by Ron Howard. And the narrator's voice is done by Anthony Hopkins. And Jeffrey Tambor (Muppets From Space) is thrown as mayor of whoville. Who doesn't like to talk about the Grinch near Christmas.
