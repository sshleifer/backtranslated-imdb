Dr Mordrid, what can I say? Jeffrey Combs did it again! <br /> <br /> Anton Mordrid has been on earth for 100 years and is waiting for Kabal, an evil wizard, to come and kill him. Mordrid and Kabal worked together as children, so Mordrid knows all the tricks of Kabal. <br /> <br /> The movie only starts a bit confusing, but soon you'll feel part of the action. I won't end, so go see Doctor Mordrid! <br /> <br /> I found the movie very enjoyable because it didn't have much violence or sexual scenes. The film focuses on the plot and that's what I want! I find the best movies are those where times seem to fly. That's because you're so worried about the movie. Doctor Mordrid is a fantastic movie! I give it a 20 out of 10. Appreciate to see! <br /> <br />
