Fused between San Francisco and Captains Courageous two of Spencer Tracy's greatest parts is this very curious film about the war and its effects on some people. They have spear-ridden Spencer Tracy and Franchot Tone in the only movie they ever made, and Gladys George as the woman they both love. <br /> <br /> Tracy and Tone is a few World War I dreatees, Tone is a poor character who almost walks over the hill in the boat, but Tracy stops him. Tracy still plays the lovely blowhard, younger Wallace Beery type that MGM predicted for him when they signed him off Fox. <br /> <br /> At the front, Tone gets an opportunity and takes it when he gets a church tower during a battle that falls on a German machine gun. He learned to shoot and he did a sergeant York. But Alvin C. York was never changed by the war as Tone did. <br /> <br /> Wounded in battle Tone reaffirmed at a hospital while Gladys George looked at him. Tracy goes to AWOL himself to visit his partner and he and George get something going. Later, when Tracy is in action, Tone and George marry. Tracy is broken in sadness when he comes back and learns from marriage, but goes into battle. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film is about Tone who applied the war time skills he learned to the gangster. He's now a hit and George doesn't really know what he's doing for a life. I think you can portray the rest. <br /> <br /> The part of the movie that made me difficult is that I can't believe Gladys George couldn't figure it out. She is a street smart girl, her part is much like the one she played in The Roaring Twenties to James Cagney. <br /> <br /> Speaking of The Roaring Twenties, Humphrey Bogart's character development, is similar to Tone's, though not the central character of the movie. In fact, there are elements of They have Him a gun found in Taxi driver and in Clint Eastwood's classic, The Unforgiven. <br /> <br /> The war series of the First World War are very well presented by director Woody Van Dyke. For some reason, Leonard Maltin put this movie in, I think it's much better than he gave it credit.
