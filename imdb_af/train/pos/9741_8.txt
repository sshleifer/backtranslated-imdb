I was pleasantly surprised to find that losing friends and alienating people was nowhere near as a brutal comedy as the trailer led me to expect. I quickly absorbed in the unfolding of the narrative and stayed throughout. The attempt of the more visual, humorous content, I thought, was at stake. (I mean I got the impression that I had so much to say to Pegg's efforts to lose lost control really in real time.) At other times, there was time to reflect the main characters (ie Pegg's and Dunst) about how events influenced them and what led them to where they found themselves. All the characters were well thrown, to some extent interesting in and of themselves, and generally very nice. (Any seemingly relentless ambition shown is likely to be tempered by a correspondingly good natural resilience.) An entertaining, intelligently written, brilliantly-directed, and wonderfully-activated film I highly recommend.
