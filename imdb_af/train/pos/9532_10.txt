I loved this movie ... the time to develop the characters, attention to detail, beautiful performances, beautiful lighting and cinematography, the amazing soundtrack ... <br /> <br /> It has a combined intensity and light touch that won't work for anyone who wants the typical fast action movie. If we lived in the Elizabethan days, I would say this movie is a bit like a Shakespeare tragedy. But as we don't, let's say it's more like a Drama-Suspense movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple, but the story is complex. The movie is intelligent in the way relationships and problems are investigated. Much of the story is shown rather than I find. It makes it subtler and moving - and it also works well for a story based on a cartoon (or a graphic novel). Sometimes I felt I was actually there in the 1930s, part of this story. There was such a realistic but dreamy quality in the style of his narrative. <br /> <br /> I don't often prefer movies to the books on which they were based, but in this case I do. (Although I also enjoyed the book.) I bought the DVD, which is great because it has wonderful scanned scenes and insightful comments. <br /> <br /> (I also took my little cousin, who's a little younger than the boy in the movie, to see it after I saw it for the first time, because he's at home had problems and I wanted to use it as a way to start a discussion on father-boy issues with him. He loved it - and the discussion.)
