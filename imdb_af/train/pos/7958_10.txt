I really liked the movie. When I ended up, I was in tears. This movie is incredible. Check out the movie. you will enjoy it. I could have given it more than 10. I like the teasing between chance and sassy. I like the shadow leadership. All this movie was perfect. <br /> <br /> The sequel is good but not good like this movie. I think there should be a third successor. Not only this movie attracts children, but also adults. My whole family enjoyed this movie. That chance was full of humor. Sassy is an intelligent cat. <br /> <br /> Again I say THIS MOVIE MUST WATCH. The more you see this movie, the more you are attached to this movie. This movie is a classic.
