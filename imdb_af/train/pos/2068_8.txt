1958. The sleepy, small, southern village of Clarksburg. Angry Sheriff Roy Childress (the almighty Vic Morrow in a spooky form) cracks very hard on speeders by forcing offenders from a cliff to their untimely deaths on a particularly dangerous road. Childress meets his game when the cool, young hot rod manager Michael McCord (a wonderfully smooth and rotting depiction of Martin Sheen) appears in his sophisticated car in town with the specific intention of ending his brother's death (Sheen's real brother and sister). Joe Estevez in a short comedy). Director Richard T. Heffron, who works out of a tight and intriguing Richard Compton script (the same man who directs the 70's entry movies communities "Welcome Home, Soldier Boys" and "Macon County Line" director), tells the gripping story at a quick fit, neatly creates a tasteful 50-year period and hardly milk the exciting game of white and wills between Childress and McCord. The uniform fine role-play helps a lot: Sheen radiation a brash James Deanesque rebellious atmosphere in the lead, Morrow makes the most of his bad bad part, plus there are excellent supporting performances by Michelle Phillips as sweet dinner waitress Maggie, Stuart Margolin as a national representative, Nick Nolte, as friendly guest station servant, Buzz Stafford, Gary Morgan as Buzz's engaging Gawky, younger brother, Lyle, Janit Baldwin as a salty local tart Sissy, Britt Leach as the solid taxi driver Johnny, and Frederic Downs as the strict judge JA Haker. The climatic vehicle confrontation between Childress and McCord is a truly pulsating white-knuckle exciting doze. Terry K. Meade's sharp cinematography, the well-drawn characters (for example, Childress is obsessed with speed-accelerators after his wife and child have been killed in a fatal hit and run incident), the gross, syncopated score by Luchi De Jesus and the beautiful mountainous scenery, enhances the overall sound quality of this superior TV winner.
