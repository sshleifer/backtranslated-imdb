And I'm absolutely up to Isabelle Blais! She was so cute in this movie, and totally different from her role in "Quebec-Montreal" where she was more like a man-eater. I think she had to be nominated for a Jutra. I mean, Syvlie Moreau was good, but Isabelle was much better, IMO. Pelletier did good work for his first time, and I noticed that he sank into some of his friends from Rock et Belles Oreilles, Guy A. LePage and Andre Ducharme. It was nice to see them in here, I didn't know they were going to appear. <br /> <br /> I don't think I've seen a romantic comedy from Quebec I didn't like, and this one is as good as anyone I had the pleasure to see. And if you're in the state and wondering how to get a copy of the DVD, www.archambault.ca gave it to me in less than a week.
