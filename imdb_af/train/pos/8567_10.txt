I enjoyed the movie and would recommend that everyone just get a good time. Don't take the movie too seriously, because it's Disney and it's rated. It is well clean, although some are recognized by adults, but children will never notice, especially the triangle between Cruella, Le Pelt and Cruella's loyal Alonso. Glenn Close is fantastic and has made Cruella herself real and is incredibly scary, even when she is healed of her furious ways, she can rub her fear in the audience with her scales that literally shake the theater. (I even jumped in my seat when she surprised you with her "bipolarity" as the dog Ella loves.) All in all, I will see it again in theaters, I enjoyed myself so much.
