I saw this movie back in the 80's and almost forgot it when I noticed it was on TV again and watch it. I remember having this little sleeper when I first saw it, and I chose it even better during the second show. <br /> <br /> All the actors, especially Robert Duvall, Glenn Close, Wilfred Brimley, Frederic Forrest, and Jason Presson (as the twelve-year-old boy who feels responsible for the accidental shooting death of his older brother) are excellent. The film has a very real feel for it - an understated, quiet, deep-moving story of a family that is sad. The dialogue is sparse but told, and the non-verbal acting is outstanding. Similar to a simpler, rural version of Ordinary People sans psychiatrist, but equally impressive family dynamics. <br /> <br /> The Stone Boy is worth the time and emotional energy involved in watching it.
