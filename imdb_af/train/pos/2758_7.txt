This film is about the unlikely friendship between a businessman and a man with Down syndrome. <br /> <br /> The character development in this movie is excellent. We must believe that Harry is a businessman who neglects his family, and Georges is an innocent man who loves to keep the "normal" society. Acting is excellent, and the Cannes best actor award is well deserved. <br /> <br /> The fantasy scenes in the film emphasize the fact that Georges is miserable after his family abandonment and his desire to be treated like a normal person. The song that is repeatedly played enhances this message as well. The film shows that people who are mentally disabled are good pleasure. We treated them with discrimination and neglect, a fact highlighted by the scene where Georges gave a gift to the waitress in the kitchen. If we understand and share these people's world, we as well as mentally handicapped can be very happy. <br /> <br /> I was so dressed in the movie and the characters' emotional experiences. It's a touch movie for good natural souls.
