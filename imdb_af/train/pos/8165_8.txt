The dentist was made at the time when almost every profession had its psycho. We had crazy police officers, ambulance men, secretary and it was just for starters. The dentist came surprisingly late because dentist is usually the nightmare of everyone. <br /> <br /> The plot is twisted. Super Clean Dentist Doctor Feinstone lives perfect life in his big "white house", he has a beautiful blonde woman and a great place to work as a dentist. Dark clouds come to his horizon in the form of nasty IRS (Terminator's Earl Boen) man, dirty swimming "clean" his wife and suddenly everyone's teeth seem to have gone through the dark filter. He's going now and starting to care for people's teeth in the nasty way. And you don't want to get in his way. <br /> <br /> Crew was professional. Producer / director Brian Yuzna produced stylish horror films such as Re-Animator and From Beyond. He managed the successor of Re-Animator and his first movie. The society was nice spinoff from John Carpenter's They Live. Film producer Pierre David is known for movies like Scanners. Cast was great. Corbin Bernsen really surprised me. I got him from LA Law and Major League, but I could dream him later as a psycho-dentist. He was really big in his role and he was kind of sad. Linda Hoffman was beautiful and stupid like Feinstones' wife. Micahel Stadvec didn't have many rules, but after seeing him with ladies from the area, I knew my future career. Ken Foree (Dawn of the Dead, Van Beyond) was a nice sight as a policeman on the case. Virginya Keehne was the innocent teenager about to be next customer at Feinstone. <br /> <br /> Final Warning: If you are like me and have problems with a dentist, you may need to have one left over. But if you want to try as you should prepare yourself with dark humor and very nasty drilling.
