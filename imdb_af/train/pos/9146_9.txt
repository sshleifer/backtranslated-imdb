These electrifying musicals have more than a flute of egoism of his star, the musical genius Prince is. The movie is 90 minutes, but in truth it's easy to see why it's such a cult classic. <br /> <br /> Much like other movies centered around the struggling young musician, trying to be great, it has a hint of drama in adding a dimension to the musical numbers. While this movie isn't as good as 8 miles as a recent example, it's quite entertaining and the soundtrack is much better. On the dramatic side of things, the story around the Kid (Prince) centers on a young artist and regular place at a club. The owner of the club is frustrated with the child's arrogance and little does the child know that he will soon be fired and replaced by a competitor. One of the parents' parents has problems, with his father abusing abuse. During the course of the film, the child learns a few lessons in life and teaches his friends more. These are all the things we've seen in drama of the age group, but it is combined as a musical, a very styled musical. <br /> <br /> The role play is good. Prince is actually pretty good on the drama side, if he doesn't hit a pose. He looks human and related. Clarence Williams is also very good as the abusive father. Appollonia Kotero makes a great debut as Princess's sexy love interest. <br /> <br /> The main strength of the movie, however, is the excellent soundtrack. The music numbers are well performed and electrifying. Prince is undoubtedly a musical maestro, even though it is very eccentric. If he is inspired, he is wonderful, but on the other hand he often does songs that are just for his own taste. And sometimes she can burn experiments, but it's the same for many musical geniuses. However, the soundtrack for this movie is excellent, with only Sexshooter a weak point. However, the performance performance of Purple Rain is the standpoint. This is one of my favorite songs of all time. *** <br /> <br />
