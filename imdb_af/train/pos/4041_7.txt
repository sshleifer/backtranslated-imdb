Tenshu was imprisoned and sentenced to death. When he survives electricity, government officials give him the choice to either become more electrolytic or to accept some experiments. He chose the experiment and was placed in a large metal cell with a bad donkey criminal who also survived the electrocution. They can have everything in the room (within reason), but they can't leave. After a few days meals are cut to one per day and the room temperature is too 100. After more alarms, intervals are sounded so that they cannot sleep. One day a "witch" comes in their cell (though a glass section). What happens now, I'll let you find out. I may be here in the minority, but I like the build-up, it was interesting to me. Now if the payout was half as good as the build-up, I would have appreciated it so much higher. <br /> <br /> My Grade: C + <br /> <br /> Media Blaster's 2 DVD set Extra's: Slide 1) Director's cut; Trailers for "Versus", "Aragami", "Attack the Gas Station", and "Deadly Outlaw Rekka" Disk 2) Theatrical Track; Comments with Hideo Sakaki, Ryuhei Kitamura, Sakaguchi Takuand Tsutomu Takahashi; Cast and crew maintenance; Make of; Original Trailer; and Promo Teasers
