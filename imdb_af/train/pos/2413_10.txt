Love the TV show. Was first addicted when I saw it. Wish I was in there acting with them. It affects the reality when you love someone and you think you want to spend the rest of your life, then an event you meet and someone you want to be. You are in a situation where you have to choose one or the other. Someone is going to be hurt, it doesn't like it. Taking the decision is difficult, but you want to remain dissatisfied if you could have been. Why go ahead and live a life you thought you wanted or think you were doing the right thing and you're both unhappy. The other person is not going to wait a lifetime, they have a good life. The decision you really want will eventually be better. Being the best of what you have is a good thing. Money, cars, homes, etc. .... don't make you happy, with the one person you really want to share it with.
