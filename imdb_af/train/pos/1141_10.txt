Anyone who doesn't all laugh at this movie is embalmed. I watched it for at least twenty times and I still get many tears in my eyes at many of the screens. Sally Field is absolutely perfect as Celest Talbert, a fading soapster whose supporting role is trying to replace her, hoping their own star will rise. Fields, at 45, still has that wonderful and beautiful pixie quality and a perfect figure that believes she had three children. I'm biased, I'm in love with her. <br /> <br /> The "Soapdish" cast is filled with stars performing their roles perfectly. Kevin Kline is flawless, such as Robert Downey Jr., an Elizabeth Shue, Whoopi Goldberg, Teri Hatcher in one of her early roles, Carrie Fisher as the renowned probation director who auditions an actor for a small role as a waiter without his shirt up. Kathy Najimy is wonderful as the unlucky costume designer, and best of all, Cathy Moriarty as Nurse Nan, who leads the plot to get Fields character out of the show, is hilarious. <br /> <br /> This movie had won Oscars for best comedy, best-leading lady in a comedy, best-performing man in a comedy and many other bests, including writing, directing and supporting actors and actresses. Get the DVD so you can watch over the next twenty-five years. You will still laugh when the disc goes out.
