An excellent documentation. I personally remember it in NYC in the early 80's. This movie is for anyone who wasn't during that time. It shows the one thing that felt the African American Gay Underclass is just about them and the love and camadrie you see is real. The people are real and unfortunately there are still few people who are still alive. The balls are still being held, but not to the extent that they were in the nineties. That time is gone forever. This is a good pre "homo thug" movie. When Queens was really proud to drive out. Goodbye to Storyville this is yet another era away, but largely documented all hail movie!
