This is one of the wonderful movies of the 80's in MY collection that I think all the time. <br /> <br /> The Running Man is one of Arnold's best and most diverse films to this day and when I first saw the Running Man, I was so excited to see such a movie. I just love the battles and it's really a special movie. It also includes Jesse Ventura, legendary professor Toru Tanaka, Sven-Ole Thorsen, beautiful Maria Conchita Alonso, Yaphet Kotto, Kurt Fuller, Richard Dawson and Thomas Rosales Jr. which seems to always be like death in his movies, as he was killed in films such as Universal Solder, The Lost World, Robo Cop 2, Predator 2, and others. All of the Arnold fans have to love this movie from the beginning to the end, as his action is full, star filled, and one of Arnold's best to date!
