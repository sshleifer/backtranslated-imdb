Pinjar is a really good movie, with good acting, good narration, good presentation, emotions, etc. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that the quality of movies produced by Bollywood is fairly improved these days, and this film is one proof. <br /> <br /> No Bollywood movie I have ever remembered has made such an impact on me - I thought about the film for hours - wondering about the different emotional situations in which humans test. 'a human. <br /> <br /> The movie is based on the great play of Urmilla Matondkar, and also of Manoj Bajpai. Urmilla plays a girl in North India in the background of the partition, and all the problems seem so nice when compared to the problems she faces. <br /> <br /> a must-see movie. A technically better Bollywood product, which I feel, is comparable to the best movies coming from other countries around the world.
