Sandler is amazing again ... I'm already a Sandler fan. This movie is the saddest Sandler story. The expression is fantastic. I cried to watch more, but there are some similar points. To consider the value of the family before it is lost and to say "I love you" are some of the most impressive truths in life ... It's hard, it's really ... and actually There is a true owner of this success, Binder. I don't think another director can give such emotions that way. <br /> <br /> Cheadle and Burrows are also amazing ... Cheadle has been one of my favorites since Crash. Don't expect to laugh or very positive atmosphere ... If you're ready to experience the realities of life, don't miss this movie.
