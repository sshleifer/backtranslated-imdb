It is a wonderful new crime series, bringing together three old stalwarts of British television (Denis Waterman, James Bolam and Alun Armstrong), while retired detectives have brought back cases to solve, led by younger career-oriented Amanda Redman. The three peculiar, irritable old police make a brilliant team with the application of 20-year-old detection methods in a police force that has come a long way from the police - in other words, to the horror of their senior officials. The three are depicted sympathetically, warts and all. There are wonderful comics, and a few very moving kids, as each of the three has to agree with the older and the legacy of their past. <br /> <br /> At the end of the first six-part series (we are promised next year), each of the characters has evolved. Wife James Bolam cannot come with his wife's untimely death. Lothario Denis Waterman learns to accept his role as grandfather. And even obsessive Alun Armstrong is helped by his new friends to fight the demons of his past - and still keep the medication! While Amanda Redman faces the well-known conflict between a life and a career. The story lines were interesting, if it was rather dependent on the wonders of DNA testing. But this is the interplay of four of Britain's leading actors who made the series unacceptable.
