It's a wonderful story of family loyalty that, thankfully, doesn't resort to the usual tricks (or at least those I see in American and European films) of super-sentimentality or high-dramatic tension. <br /> <br /> It is very viewable and very fond. It has beautiful cinematography, but doesn't just trust it to entertain.
