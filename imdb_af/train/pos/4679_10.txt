Wonderful movie with a slight slow start - give it a chance to cook. Story builds in interest and complexity. Characters and story line under-expected expectation and cliche at all the right moments. Superior New York City Places - Eager, Actually - are a fantastic antidote to the commercial imperatives of "Sex in the City". The whole film is in fact an antidote to the HBO / Hollywood idea of ​​New York City, sex and relationships. It's a rare movie that deals with its characters as honestly and kindly. WAS ABOUT THIS! Big belt with striking performances by Steve Buscemi, Rosario Dawson, and her love interest (forget his name!).
