My discovery of Jan Svankmajer's theater opened my eyes to a whole tradition of Czech animation, of which Jr. Trnka was a pioneer. His Ruka is one of the best, technically-impressive animation movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> A potter wakes up and water his plant. Then he goes to make a pot. But in there comes the big hand that collapses the pot and demands that the potter make a statue of himself. He throws out the hand, but soon it comes back and sticks it into a bird cage where he is forced to form a stone hand. He sits down, fails with exhaustion, but eventually ends the task. <br /> <br /> In a wonderful series of metakinem, the potter uses a candle to burn his visible puppet strings, holding him in the pride and escaping home. He joins himself and is accidentally killed by his own beloved plant when it falls on its head. <br /> <br /> This film does not hide the fact that it is pure animation, unlike modern movies that attempt to be realistic (why?). The hand, for example, is clearly someone's hand in a glove. Everything else is clay. Strings are visible and are part of the story, making it the forerunner of the movie Strings. The atmosphere is ominous: the hand that goes to the small potter has managed to bring more fear into me than many horror movies combined. <br /> <br /> The movie is obvious but avoids being completely manipulative for its simplicity. It is a fable about artistic freedom and tyranny that cannot help win the heart and spirit of anyone who has freedom as a natural right.
