Michael Kallio gives a strong and convincing performance as Eric Seaver, a troubled young man who has been terribly abused as a little boy by his monstrous, abusive, alcoholic stepfather Barry (a really scary portrayal by Gunnar Hansen). Eric has a compassionate fianc√© (sweetly played by the beautiful Tracee Newberry) and a headline report on a local mortuary. Rushed by his pale past, eaten by the naked, Jack, the devil (a really foul Michael Robert Brandon), and sent over the edge by the recent death of his mother, Eric goes from the deep end and starts with a cruel murder spree. Kallio (who also wrote the sleek, spectacular writing), with an equally fine play with a sound-no-name cast (Jeff Steiger, is especially good as Eric's wannabe-helping guardian angel Michael), quite rough but overall sophisticated cinematography by George. Better, credible true-to-life characters, the outbursts of raw, shocking and unwavering violent violence, a haunting score by Dan Kolton, an uncompromisingly cunning end, Grungy Detroit, Michigan bodies, a grim serious tone and a Naughty, gripping story that goes on, this extremely powerful and eager psychological horror thriller often makes it look and disturb. A real sleeper.
