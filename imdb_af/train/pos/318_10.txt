This is without a doubt the greatest film ever made. It's almost incomprehensible, even with many repeated views in an effort to find out exactly what is going on. The film was almost completely improvised and included random musical numbers, ads, emails, and a host of other innovations. Besides, what other movies did came by Martin Luther King, Jr? To decipher the film, the director's book "I Was Curious" is hunting. It will all be clear. It is a great and brave experiment in improvised recursive filmmaking. A triumph. Now, if only someone has a version with color subtitles * other * than white, the white subtitles will wash out and become invisible.
