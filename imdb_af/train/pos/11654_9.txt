I agree with the above remark, I like the realism in this, and in many movies (not just movies about eating disorders) it seems as if the producers forget it. They take a daily problem and create a very dramatic scene and then the end of the movie is all perfect again, which I don't like because it's not real. This doesn't mean that things can't get better, and that doesn't mean things aren't going to be in this movie, but they don't spend most of the movie creating all these issues, and coming to the end of the movie is everything again perfect. . When people have eating disorders, people do not recognize it and they want to get better, and then life is perky, it takes time and I love how we grow in this movie with the characters, we go through trouble with them, to better and worse, this is a very important part of the movie. It comes in the minds of people with eating disorders, showing the complications and pain, in a very realistic way, and I love it. I also like how it turns out. The secrecy and betrayal experienced by people suffering from eating disorders is scary to see how people react when they find out, especially if they approve it. I thought this movie was very enjoyable and beautiful and well told, and challenging one of my favorites.
