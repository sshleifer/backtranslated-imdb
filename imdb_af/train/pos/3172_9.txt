Debut? Wow - Cross-Eyed is easily one of the most enjoyable movies I've watched over the past year. It makes it hard to believe that Cross Eyed is the author's debut movie. I mean - I subscribed to IMDb to find more movies by this author ... because Cross Eyed has that unique signature - you want to see what else this author might say. Nowadays it is rare to see a movie that is well written, benevolent, well edited and well behaved. For me - Cross Eyed encapsulates that make film should be about - combining the best of all movie elements to create a clever, artistic and horrible story. More please.
