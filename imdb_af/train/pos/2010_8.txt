I thought this movie was pretty good. Some parts were corny, but it is understandable as it was made more than 55 years ago. I thought the best performance in the movie was given by Michele Morgan who played Millie convincingly. Jack Haley is also very good as Mike O'Brien. Although I'm not a big Frank Sinatra fan, I think he was very good at this movie. If you want a fool, about the best musical comedy, Higher and Higher is the movie for you. <br /> <br />
