The violent and rebels, twenty-five-year-old sailor Antwone Fisher (Derek Luke), are sent to three sessions for evaluation with the marine psychiatrist Dr. Jerome Davenport (Denzel Washington), after another outburst and aggression against a superior naval man. Restrained in the beginning of treatment, he gets confidence in Dr. Davenport and he reveals his childhood, which generated painful traumas in his foster home. Meanwhile, he meets Cheryl Smolley (Joy Briant), and they fall in love with each other. By solving his personal problems, Antwone becomes a new man. This true family drama is a touch and positive story of a man who finds a friend and returns to a regular life. The direction of Denzel Washington is excellent, making sensitive, attractive and with good taste, a story about child abuse. In the hands of another director, this can be a very difficult story. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): 'Voltando a Viver' ('Returning to Live')
