This film must be required for all librarians or librarians. All the best lines are directly related to library service. The public library against academic library argumentation is a classic argument between librarians and library school students. It also breaks many library stereotypes. Librarians may even be able to have fun - even if they don't * usually have sex in the romance section! (The best film about librarians? Desk Set, with Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy, of course.)
