Perhaps you won't mind the social commentary or the filmmakers' point of view. I'm self-guessed at the 'insignificance' angle. Kasdan seemed to promote the actions taken in the movie, a certain meaning. end confused me. However, there is absolutely no denial of the way the story is presented; the wonderful symbolism throughout; the threaded characters; visual; dialogue ?? is absolute masterpiece. I watched the movie quite a few times, and I still wonder about his perfection. There isn't a moment, action, cut or line that doesn't have everything to do with the theme. Realistic human performances by all actors. Scene to stage is woven fantastic. <br /> <br /> I have a nice level juice meter. The siren never went off during this movie. If you are a thinker (rather than a casual viewer)? deliver this movie. Exponentially. Absolutely enchanting. (Do you agree with the message to appreciate the show? Who cares whether it makes you hot and vague or not?) Was that interesting? Personally, the movie touched me? significantly. In my top 5. <br /> <br /> Note: The cover reviewer clearly speaks of a deficient African American perception. What he might not recognize is, was there a hand? shake. Not a handout. The "spiritually dead white man" simply saw a man to respect and admire. And he did something about it. The fact that he was black has little or nothing to do with it (color is simply used to draw the parallel. And the gap. It is no coincidence, the opening sequence moved from black and white to color as well). Seeing the blacks in this movie? You may reconsider your anxiety. You might just see black and white, eh. Just a thought.
