This dark comedy in a middle class setting in the imaginary town of Willard in the 1950s. This dark comedy with a light touch toy with such American obsessions as gun mania and violence, materialism and follow-up of Joneses, fear of others, slavery, golf, and the disposal of the dead. Yes, it sounds a bit heavy, but trust me, it's almost as light as a feather. <br /> <br /> Zombies are prominent among the characters. Important questions arise, such as: who will become a zombie (90% of Willard people choose this final road, while only 10% prefer a traditional funeral)? Who owns how many zombies they offer like robots (they have become a social status point)? And, what is the extent of possible relationships that can be worked out between the living and the kind of reincarnated dead? <br /> <br /> Somehow, director Andrew Currie, who also wrote the live screenplay (along with Robert Chomiak and Dennis Heaton), kept this unlikely material for an hour and a half without to ever be shaken for a good laugh. Carrie-Anne Moss, Billy Connolly, Dylan Baker, Henry Czerny, Tim Blake Nelson, Mary Black and Sonja Bennett are the principals supported by young K'Sun Ray as Timmy, the innocent child with a good heart who serves as a righteous witness of all the luxuries of adults. (After she only saw her in "Memento" and "The Matrix", I had no idea that Moss had such fine comedienne chops.) <br /> <br /> Production design and music is beautiful 50's, to a tea. Maybe this one is not for everyone. It will definitely be a hard movie for my annual Bizarro award. But intelligent comedies that stay funny from start to finish are one of the hardest winning performances in movies. For me anyway, "Fido" is a hoot! My Grades: 8.5 / 10 (A-) (seen on 30/01/07)
