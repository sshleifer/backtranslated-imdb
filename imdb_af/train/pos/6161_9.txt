Bedknobs and Broomsticks is a fun fantasy adventure for children during World War II, with Angela Lansbury as a trainee witch who, with the help of three evacuous children and a professor of witchcraft, faces a Nazi raid stare. <br /> <br /> Brilliantly inventive, with lots of laughter, this movie will thrill kids of all ages with its great characters, exciting story and catchy songs. Lansbury is perfect like Eglantine, the not-perfect witch the three kids take on the adventure of a lifetime, and her three young stars (Cindy O'Callaghan, Roy Snart and Ian Weighill) are equally impressive as the Cockney rascals which helps to fight the nasty hun. <br /> <br /> The special effects are somewhat dated, but let's see, children don't care too much about these things as long as they are entertained. And entertainment, they will be. With a few impressive scenes that blend vibrant action and animation brilliantly, and more real-life movie magic than one hundred Harry Potter, it would be difficult not to enjoy this wonderful cut film philosophy. In fact, just a rather prolonged music number in Portobello Road marches the film's perfection, but with so much more to enjoy, it can easily be forgiven. <br /> <br /> Also, any movie with British television legend Bruce Forsyth as a 'Flash' Harry style spiv is guaranteed a good score from me.
