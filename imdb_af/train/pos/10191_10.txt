What is included on this disk is a first-rate performance by a first-class band. This slide is NOT for the most beautiful of the heart ... the music is incredibly intense and very cool. What you will learn if you watch this movie is just why the Who was so big for so long. It is true that their records were great, but their performances were the top of the hopes. In 1969, when this concert was shot, the screaming teenagers who were jelly beans thrown at the Beatles were gone and bands (and audiences) established themselves to long and often incredible performances of musical virtuoso - something that few audiences have the intellectual curiosity about strive for the age of canned music by Britney and Christina. What you especially learn here is the wonderful things that can happen when gifted musicians are encouraged to improvise. Try the concert, it's really great.
