The True Story (in 1959 in Kansas) came from a murder (Perry and Dick, two ex-prisoners who broke in a rainy night in a remote home to kill and kill everyone they met) ). Richard Brooks has chased and upset the Capote's book on the reasons these children drove to crime (Are they natural-born killers?). The crime scenes are very brutal and haunting because of the lack of senses and reasons for what we saw. Beautiful black and white cinematography from Conrand Hall, excellent land-road music score from Quincy Jones, incredible performances in two leading roles by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson and for the first time in a movie a sad commentary on the last-minute death penalty before their death. . Jones, Hall and Brooks (as director and author of custom script) are nominated Oscar Awards. Gripping, beautifully arranged and frightening, one of the best films of this decade
