******** Spoilers - Caution ********* <br /> <br /> What can I say? I'm biased when it comes to Urban Cowboy. I love it and have watched it many times - and usually find something new about each look. <br /> <br /> I think one of the things I love about is that Urban Cowboy is about working class people. , not rich people living in LA or New York. Well, that's true, except for Pam. <br /> <br /> Travolta plays Bud, a small Texas boy who moves to Houston to work in the oil fields. And that is when Travolta actually played in good dramatic movies like Saturday Night Festival instead of stereotypical bad guys / good guys in big budget movies. It's a very good movie. The mechanical bulry game and two-step dance can be stupid, but you should enjoy it for what it is. <br /> <br /> Bud meets Sissy (played by Debra Winger with finite shine) - and soon after they got married and live in their dream car. But their relationship becomes a real life battle of the sexes. Bud wants to be a real cowboy. Sissy wants to be a real cowboy. But in modern times, men's roles are not so clear. Where can Bud prove he's a real man? He can work his dangerous job daily and drive the mechanical bull at night - he can be an "urban cowboy". But Sissy wants to drive his bakkie, and she also wants to drive the mechanical bull. So, where does this leave Bud? As Sissy claims her independence, she lays over the bull and flits with the ex-con and the rodeo star - a real bull rider-- West (played greasy by Scott Glenn). Bud is threatened, and Bud and Sissy break up. <br /> <br /> Sissy kicks with West, abusing her. Emasculating himself further, Bud becomes the son's toy of Pam, a rich girl whose dad is in oil and everything that implies. Sissy comes to the trailer to clean it up - Pam doesn't do that kind of thing. She wrote a made-up letter to Bud, but angry Pam broke it up and took credit for Sissy's homework. <br /> <br /> Bud's uncle Bob dies tragically at work when lightning strikes and causes an explosion. Bud and Sissy have a chance to reconcile but are too stubborn. Later, the mechanical bull riding competition at Gilley's, and you know Bud will win. Pam realizes that Bud doesn't love her, but Sissy - he did it to her. West is trying to rob Gilleys, but does not want to know that urban cowboy, Bud, will save the day and win the woman he loves. <br /> <br /> Of course you can ask yourself why Bud and Sissy would go to Gilleys every night and "live like pigs." Maybe it contributed to their bad marriage. Or why didn't Bud stay with Pam - she wasn't that bad and had money. Or why did they have to kill Uncle Bob? Or why Bud and Sissy had such stupid friends like Marshall and Jessie they always try to break: Marshall tells Bud: "She (Sissy) is driving that bull better than you do!" But part of the fun of Urban Cowboy makes it a little fun - and it's not Bonnie Raitt on stage!
