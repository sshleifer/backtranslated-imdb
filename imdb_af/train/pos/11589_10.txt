Man, I loved this movie! It really takes me back when I was a child. It was the days when the teachers still showed classroom movies on real-to-real and if you were good, they would slow the movie back so you could see it looking backwards. I remember one of the opening lines .... "Tutazema was his name, and he was an orphan. He also lived with his sister in town." It's a great movie for kids and just like the red balloon. In the end, the other Indian boys in the village attach the feathers to Tutazema and become an eagle himself. He gets the way he always wanted to live. He gets the heavens to glide.
