This could be the revival of 1987 Autumn story after eleven years, as director Mabel Cheung claimed. Mabel uses rock music as the medium of this movie to express her personal attitude towards life, in which love, desire and the resulting frustration play significant roles. Rock music cannot be the best vehicle to convey the deep sentiment, yet it is not too inappropriate to use it, as the life of underground rock musicians is much more intense than an ordinary one. The director focuses on portraying subtle love and ultimate vanity of life rather than mere rock music. The love between father and son, lovers and friends is rendered fine and pleasant by the good performance. Mabel does not try to beautify rock musicians as artists, but tries to make a real life on the screen. It makes great efforts over years of work on this project and collects information in the Beijing underground bar. <br /> <br /> Daniel has probably made the best performance in all his movies. His innate indignation and reticence fit perfectly into the blue mood of the film.
