Before Cujo, Lucky was the devil's dog. In 1978, the film "Devil Dog, The Hound of Hell" premiered on Halloween night. A story of a family that gets a new puppy (from a farmer who is only nearby and sells fruit and vegetables) because their dog skipper has been killed. Everyone loves the new dog, but there is something strange about him. <br /> <br /> It's not long before father Mike Barry (Richard Crenna, First Blood) begins to see. His wife Betty (Yvette Mimieux, where the boys are, Jackson County jail, snowbush) is different and his children Charlie and Bonnie (Ike Eisenman, Heksberg and Fantastic Vourage and Kim Richards, Heksberg, Nanny and the Professor, Hello Larry, Tuff -Turf also changed. Does the dog have anything to do with it? He is determined to find out and do what is needed to save his family. <br /> <br /> This movie is great because it has Ike and Kim a darker side of themselves than we saw on the witch mountain movies. It's one of the many 70's made-to-TV horror movies that were actually scary for a TV horror movie. The music was creepy and even the end I won't have told you was thinking. <br /> <br /> This movie also starred Ken Kercheval (Cliff Barnes of Dallas) and R.G. Armstrong (who couldn't keep away from devil flies remember "Race with the devil"?) <br /> <br /> It's worth watching.
