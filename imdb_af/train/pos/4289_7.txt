I need to be 100% honest with your fellow IMDb users. I wanted to see this movie for a very long time just because of the poster. Don't see Charlotte Gainsbourg so sexy and charming? I'm in love with that woman! I have what I expected ... but only half. This film should deliver expectations for those who enjoy all sorts of romantic comedies or stories that include intelligent humor and light dramatic situations. <br /> <br /> I disagree with another fellow IMDb user who says the movie is over-rated; I have to admit that the "Pr√©te-moi ta main" has many errors. <br /> <br /> My biggest problem with the movie is the lack of screen chemistry among the main characters. There is no single scene before the climax that shows that the main characters are part of a romance or even an idea that they are interested in one another. <br /> <br /> In fact, the only scene that is part of both is incredibly uncomfortable (when both are in the bank) and doesn't help the audience understand about a possible love interest. I didn't buy the order. <br /> <br /> Still, the movie provides very funny moments and has a strong dialogue that supports such an ingenious premise. I am pleased to say it will be very difficult to feed such a farce by a 43-year-old man. <br /> <br /> I understand it's a movie and therefore I accept it as a funny situation. Plus, the humor is versatile. There are moments with S & M, funny lines with Chabat's best friend, a few lesbian references, funny situations where the family women and more. <br /> <br /> In addition, Charlotte Gaionsbourg's performance is the reason for the movie. She is funny, sexy, looks very thin and fine, and shows that she is a versatile and talented actress who can devise a comical and dramatic performance in sheer luster. <br /> <br /> Alain Chabat is a good actor and gives a very decent performance. I think the supporting role team does what they can. <br /> <br /> The score, art direction and other technical aspects are really good and give a dynamic look to the movie. <br /> <br /> Those who enjoy this kind of cinema should be happy with end credits. This is a good example of a good cinema.
