Certainly, history in this movie is "Hollywoodized" - but it is far from the only piece of history written for the masses. Lafitte sat with the Americans because he regarded himself as a Frenchman and therefore hated the British, not because of any sense of patriotism for a nation that had just taken over New Orleans a while ago; he broke his deal and returned to smuggling, which caused him to load into Galveston; He was more of a small criminal and a crook than a hero * or * a swashbuckler. But who cares? This is a film that is pure entertainment - and we have to see it. We all wanted Jean to go the feathery swallow, rather than the prickly daughter of the governor. Brynner again rises over mediocre writing to give a fascinating display.
