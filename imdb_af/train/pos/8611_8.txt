I really enjoyed watching this movie. I drew it while I watched so I could revise it later. I actually enjoyed the second show because I could absorb more of the smart dialogue between Natalie and Adam, the two main characters. I thought the way this story evolved was very challenging. I was very interested in how Natalie would respond to her daughter's friends. In the beginning, she seemed to spit a lot of hostility, but as she began to interact more pleasantly, I had to see how this visit unfolded. I was not disappointed. Gradually, the secrets that Sara had kept from her mother began to reveal a daughter who was not so perfect, a defective person like most of us who wanted her freedom from a dominant mother who thought she was know her daughter, but unfortunately in a very painful way sometimes to love someone who has to give them freedom. The viewers who held this film at the end, Diane Keaton had a very enjoyable performance (which is always great, even in some of her less well-received films, Town and Country thinks). The closure of the Diane Keaton rowing house was worth waiting for and revealing that someone who loves another person must learn that we must live our own lives, we love others, but they do not own and eventually we must allow it to go. This is a hard lesson, but it is worthwhile to conceive every now and then. Thanks to CBS for this broadcast, it was worth the long wait.
