Disney might just be here. First, they remembered "Denem the Titans" with Denzel, a story based on the truth of sport and a small town in Central America. Now, with Quaid and The Rookie ... another sports story based on the truth. <br /> <br /> Both movies sometimes pull you to tears, and both make you smile and feel warm after you see it. My wife and I took The Rookie and we expected it to be a good, fine type of movie. We were not let down, when asked if we wanted to buy it on DVD when it came out, it was a no-brainer. Most definitive.
