Firstly, the period during which this film was made must be taken into account. 1995. Rappers was in it, and it added to its flair. <br /> <br /> Remy was a socially uncomfortable teenager trying his way and could not, until he met and befriended Nazis. They took him in. Nazis are not so uncomfortable, but like most gangs they fill a lack that is missing, economically, socially, emotionally, whatever. Michael Rappaport played the part perfectly. <br /> <br /> Omar Epps was the hot shooting star, with a dubious work ethic and a slide on his shoulder. He tried to feel sorry for himself and his fate, and extended his girlfriend and professor to it. <br /> <br /> Kristen was a young white girl trying to find her and trying to fit in, until she was raped. She then found her self-experiment with her sexuality and became politically involved. <br /> <br /> This film is about racism and, like most racism, people's own perspectives are in the game. <br /> <br /> I read so much comment on how there were no 'evil' black characters, but there was an evil white one (Nazi). Approximately? Remy was not portrayed as angry at all, he tried to find his way and stayed until a few skinheads accepted him. He was scared, it was sad to see him do what he did. He even says right before he kills himself, I didn't mean it, I wanted to be an engineer. <br /> <br /> Ice cubes and Busta Rhymes were angry black men; They didn't even consider their households at all, and they didn't look much like white people. They were angry like the Nazis, but not at the level of Nazis in terms of overall badness. Sorry if this makes it look unfair, but are there really black groups like the Nazis? No. <br /> <br /> People say it shows white = -bad black = good. Not true, the only bad white characters were the Nazis and the police, which are more or less true in real life. Kristen was a good girl, her boyfriend was a good guy, and even Remy was a good guy. He was just misleading. <br /> <br /> Omar Epps, Ice Cube and Busta were seriously flawed characters, angry and inconsiderate. Although their constant harassment by the police justified some of their anger. Remy's inability to fit in was justifying his anger. <br /> <br /> Good movie, well done. Like all racial films, it's a good idea to start a conversation. <br /> <br /> I don't think Cube and Busta could beat the Nazis.
