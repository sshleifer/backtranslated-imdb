Fast and funny satire on the original "reality TV", the soap opera. The writer of playwright Robert Harling is full of one liners and ridiculous situations. The best of them is the climax, a live broadcast that quickly deteriorates into a bad improvement and a brain transplant. Keven Kline's murder of his lines, because he doesn't wear his glasses, is hilarious. "Her brain will investigate laterally in the next few homes." The brilliant cast is on the same page as Kline. Sally Field, Elizabeth Shue, Cathy Moriarty, Robert Downey Jr., Whoopi Goldberg, Teri Hatcher, Garry Marshall and Kathy Najimy are all perfect. It is a surprise to see a decisive click as it does in this movie. It's a classic that somehow slipped through the cracks. <br /> <br /> P.S. The score by Alan Silvestri is an added bonus. It fits the soap opera with its flamboyant and melodramatic air.
