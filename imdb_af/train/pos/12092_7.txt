First I remember this one back in the 70's when it was shown late last night. Scare hell out of me. But then I was a teenager back in those days, not complaining about movies like I am now. <br /> <br /> COTTAGE OF BLOOD (aka: DANSE MACABRE) is a good example of the Italian horror genre of the 60's, along with Mario Bava's BLACK SUNDAY (1960), LIVE DEAD COURSE (aka : KILL BABY KILL (1966) and Mario Caiano's NIGHTMARE CASTLE (1965). If you want ghostly atmosphere with good writing, it also goes out. I also rate it with the early Poe movies that Roger Corman did during the same period. <br /> <br /> I saw the new Synapse DVD taken from a French press and this is a huge improvement in the old pan and scan prints made on television over the years. It adds a few minutes of dialogue (in French) that doesn't really add much to the movie, but it's nice to see it, without cuts. Unfortunately, the DVD doesn't really offer extras, except for stills from the movie. <br /> <br /> One flub I noticed was in the opening scene, as the smoke effect next to the camera reflected on the glass at the inn's entrance. I think the editors didn't catch it, or maybe they didn't care, but that's something I didn't see for the first time. It's the wonders of the DVD. You get all the flubs, bugs and details that weren't first clear. But don't matter. <br /> <br /> No matter, it still gets a 7 on the imdb meter <br /> <br />
