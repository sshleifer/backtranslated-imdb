We all create our own reality or do we? This is the core question behind this highly original and masterly exploration of the illusory nature of reality. The Eastern and Buddhist philosophies blend with the visual chicery of M.C. Escher, this fascinating treatise succeeds in taking the fairly cerebral question on "Who are we and what is our place in the universe," and captures it in a fascinating and fun 100 minutes. The film focuses on Bart, a writer struggling with his script, The Sea That Think. While sitting on his computer, the work started out as nothing but a description of her sitting on the computer, writing the script. For a long time he was stuck in a swaying confrontation in which everything he wrote became reality. Director Gert de Graaff approaches his subject with a bad sense of humor and shines the viewer with a series of astonishing visual tricks confronting the nature and validity of our perception. Eventually De Graaff's film challenges the audience at various levels to ask if anything we see or touch or taste really looks like our whole understanding of the universe and our place in it is just a trick on us. our senses. Note: After watching the movie, watch the movie's entertaining website. (English with English subtitles) - Eric Moore
