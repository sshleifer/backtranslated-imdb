More than just a "children's movie", Holes looks at how previous incidents still affect us today, whether we know or not. When teenage Stanley Yelnats III (Shia LeBoeuf) is sent to a prison camp where he is forced to dig all day, he discovers a number of things about the camp and his personal connection with it. Through flashbacks we learn that a number of things are closer than we realize (you will understand it better if you see the movie). LeBoeuf does a pretty good job, just like the other members of the group: Sigourney Weaver, Jon Voight, Tim Blake Nelson, Henry Winkler, Patricia Arquette and Eartha Kitt. A very interesting movie.
