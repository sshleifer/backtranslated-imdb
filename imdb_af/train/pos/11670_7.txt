A springweight plot and questionable characterizations make no difference when a movie is just as fun to watch as this one is. Live action and spectacular stunts - for their day - give this movie a real zip. And there is a real comedy from ripchemy between the two leaders. Quinn also makes a good villain, although his role is completely overshadowed. <br /> <br /> But don't be fooled by Maureen O'Hara's tough broad role, it's as sexist as any Hollywood movie of this era. You may be forgiving it because of the time it was made, but it's still hard to get past. For all the heroism and horrendous adult out-of-town situations, it's still no more than a good time for adolescents.
