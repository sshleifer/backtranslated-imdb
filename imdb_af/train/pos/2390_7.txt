My 2-year-old likes the Doodlebops show, it seems to keep his attention for a while. The characters are interesting, alive with primary colors and all. There are not many educational content that can benefit the intended target audience, but they seem to have a theme that shows every show and tries to teach children about sharing and respect and other basic principles. So I like it. It is well produced with high production values. But it's actually just an average show like most of the shows on television. We do not buy in the merchandise corner and let our son wear Dooblebop. I don't think we want to spend money going to a live show if they ever come to town. Going to the zoo or science center is a much better experience for everyone involved and I think money is better spent.
