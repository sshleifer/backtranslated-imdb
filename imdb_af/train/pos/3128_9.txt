Corny! I love it! Corny - just like the TV show was about 40 years ago! Adam and Burt revive the same chemistry on the screen that never seems to be! They revive old memories, plus the actors they play from the 1960s show behind the scenes things that are interesting to know. 1960's TV was for many of us returning, and this DVD is no exception if you are familiar with the original TV show. The battle scene with the written Boofs and Bams or whatever is fantastic !! The scene scene shows clips of the villains who died. In the end, Frank Gorshin makes an appearance. He didn't go too long after this DVD was made, I believe, and it is thanks to him that he came back to play a villain on Adam and Burt just as he did to Batman and Robin many years ago. done. He didn't lose his contact! Thanks to Julie Newmar for playing a rogue again. Finally, I think this DVD is great memories, and I thank both Adam and Burt for coming back and recovering these memories for those of us who remember the original - !!! Thanks guys !!!
