I could see this movie is super. He didn't surprise himself when it happened to the truth, so by itself, how did the flight turn to those who didn't have the place, but that's just a conspiracy theory, right? <br /> <br /> I really wanted to see this movie when I was the child. I'm interesting what it was like it seems that such a flight really happened, certainly because it's not a belief because it denies logic and common sense. Who on healthy senses, sent to children with spacecraft in orbit. I like reading a lot for the subject, US and Soviet space programs. I know a few missions of space shooters were provided by the CIA with the clause TOP SECRET sure it's just my apostates, but who knows?
