I can remember seeing this movie as a child in 1977 or 1978. HBO will show it back late at night when they were the only movie pay channel. Only then was it UNRATED and was the only movie of its kind ever shown on pay television ... especially then. I would love to see it as an adult, where I will understand the adult theme better. It was probably the closest thing I have ever seen to pornography at the age of 7 or 8. Fortunately, I had dumb baby seats and party parents in the weekends. Most of my memory of this movie was the completely erratic sexual behavior of these two guys. Breaking in homes to sniff lingerie, feeding on a stranger's breast milk on a public bus, and playing on a cabin at the request of one of their female subjects, were just a few of the escapees these guys pulled out. has. A very racy movie for the early 70's. Until I checked IMDb, I had no idea that this movie had such a next. Most people I talk to have never heard of it.
