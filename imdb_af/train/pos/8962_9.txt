As a pagan, I must say this movie has little or no Magickal meaning. It is a "fun" witchcraft movie and not meant to teach us anything except love is the strongest Magick of all, and never uses it in a controlling or vengeful way. It is a lesson that everyone should learn, not just Gentiles. <br /> <br /> It is said, this movie was wonderfully written and performed nicely by Kim Novak and the venerable Jimmy Stewart. <br /> <br /> Hermione Gingold delivers a fantastic show like Bianca, Elsa Lanchester (with too many film credits to name, except if Jane Marbles of "Murder By Death") was wonderful like Mrs. Novak's absent but non-capable neighbor, Queenie. Also starring Jack Lemmon (great show) and Jim Kovacs (brilliant). Witches can't cry. Why can't they shed a single tear, because their heart is full of Magick. don't have time for stupid things like love. "Queenie. <br /> <br /> Gillian Holroyd (Novak) and her brother Nicky (Jack Lemmon) are Manhattan witches, deep in the secret underworld of those of the Arts, living among New Yorkers as one of them, without causing a big eyebrow. <br /> <br /> But then comes Shepherd Sheep Henderson (Stewart), a trusted, undisputed, dedicated businessman involved with Gillian's old college rival married. <br /> <br /> Through a strange accident of accident, he finds himself in Gillian's building and is instantly captivated by her charm and grace, using Magick, with a little help from Pyewacket (Gillian's well-known, educated by Robert E.

Some of the scenery was apparently shot in the basement of someone's small house, but the characters were striking and fun. <br /> <br /> On a personal note, Pyewacket steals the show. Big cat! Great training by Robert E. Blair. <br /> <br /> As a Trivia Note, it is the roots of the beloved Bewitched television set. It introduces the original Samantha and Darrin. All the characters of the note are present and justified. You have to look to see it for yourself. <br /> <br /> It's one of my favorites, and I often see it. <br /> <br /> This movie gets a 9.1 / 10 of. .. <br /> <br /> the enemy :.
