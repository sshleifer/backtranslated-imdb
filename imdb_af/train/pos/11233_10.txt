I see myself as the # 1 fan of Hidden Frontier, as I am among a small group of fans who actually met most of these guys - of course, not to count conventions. I've been watching Hidden Frontier since 2001, and I have to say I'm impressed by what these guys have. <br /> <br /> Hidden Frontier is the brainchild of Rob Caves and his self-made studio, Areakt Pictures, working from the back room of his home. While not as fancy as the TOS series New Voyages (which sometimes come from the original series actors / writers, such as Walter Koenig, aka Mr. Chekov), Rob and the cast and crew of HF succeed create a series that replaced the terrible experiment we called "Enterprise". The most controversial and successful story bow is the launch of Star Trek's first openly gay character, Corey Aster (launched in the second season), and his quest for a soul mate. Sometime later in the series he meets Jorian Zen, the Excelsior's Trill helmet officer. In the recent story lines with these two characters (WARNING: GREAT SPOILER! Don't read if you haven't watched the series up to this point!), Zen is connected to a cursed symbiotic, which causes a lot of change and conflict with his Aster. Although the future is uncertain - as the most recent episode, Beachhead ", was only shown to HF fans last night in the chat room - I think this relationship will endure but will just tell the time. <br /> <br /> Gene Roddenberry created Star Trek with the intention of making the story more about his characters, rather than with spooky space fights Rob Caves created the same grounds for Hidden Frontier - and this is what made this series as popular as it is. said the previous comment, I wish I could give it a score of more than 10, but that would suffice, although the next season will be the last in the seven-season tradition, start with Star Trek: The Next Generation - I'm willing to bet we'll hear a lot about Hidden Frontier after the last episode.
