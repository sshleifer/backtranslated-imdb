This movie is kind of a Carrie at Heavy Metal. It's about a high school man who is picked up a lot and he gets totally revenge with the help of a Heavy Metal ghost. it is such a classic. The soundtrack is A ++++. You have live legends of Metal in it. And Marc Price was great in this movie. It's a must have for metal fans.
