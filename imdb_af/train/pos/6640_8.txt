This one-minute movie is probably the first movie ever made. Other inventors have previously filmed actions - such as Edison's motion picture of a sneeze - but the Lumiere brothers developed equipment that greatly improved the medium. At that time, of course, their 'cinematograph' had to disregard their peers, including their subjects. First of all, the brothers record employees leaving their factory, some of which understandably hide their sensation from the camera. The Lumieres are trying to make the movie more entertaining by introducing animals and a bike, but La Sortie Des Usines Lumiere does not nearly include the ingenuity of their later films. The most interesting aspect of this short film is the brothers' choice of a well-known work ritual as their subject. Their choice is the initial proof of their curiosity about all the world's people, a quality that is rewarding their experiments very much and fascinating today. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8
