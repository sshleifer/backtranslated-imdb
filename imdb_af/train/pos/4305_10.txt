Grand Canyon is a very strange bird. It is a completely unique urban piece, with which the whole plot relates, will not convey much. <br /> <br /> This is the central theme that is the inherent uncertainty that contains life for people of every race, background and station. But to declare that the theme of the movie would be to underestimate its magnitude. Similarly, it is useless to the devil in a particular genre. <br /> <br /> The movie has volumes to say, but probably different volumes for each viewer, all saying in such a non-preaching way of so many angles, in the end I can't even get its central define message for myself. <br /> <br /> However, it does so with such laser accuracy; every prop, line of dialogue and bar of background music that adds to its pervasive mood and powerful message, that I am pleasantly surprised and after each visit becomes very considerate. Yet it didn't feel cramped at all. A sparkling movie with a good role and everything works.
