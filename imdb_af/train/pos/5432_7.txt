.... Rather well done, actually - attack the evil villains in their army, stop a little Big Horn quiet ambush, save the day through the waterboys bugling, work for me. Stiff British lip and everything. <br /> <br /> So how does it play 66 years later on a DVD? I am a Western, Apache or Sioux for the Thugs, and the American Cavalry for the Imperial British Army. It's very colonial in its prospects, you know? Witman's burden and everything? Kipling would definitely have approved. <br /> <br /> Cary Grant, Fairbanks and MacLaglen play it as wide as possible so that some buddy in the blend between the shooting and brawling beats well. (I didn't know it was Joan Fontaine as the token armywoman - they left her scenes on the cutter floor? Many were not there to look for an Oscar - in fact Grant wasn't at his best) some scenes - but it sucks, it still works, and where else would Ben Casey thrill as an Indian beer? Only in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Definitely go out if you like adventure and pseudo Keeping Western style antics done by a lot of benefits and I can add. <br /> <br /> *** outside ****
