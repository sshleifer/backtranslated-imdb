There is a lot going on in The College Girl Murders. A Mad Scientist creates an almost undetectable toxic gas. Before he can reap the benefits of his discovery, the scientist is killed by a whiplash, whiplash monk. After a rival in the church is killed by the gas, Scotland Yard is called in to investigate, but the murder continues. Who can stop this mad killer, who looks like he can come and go as he pleases in and out of college? <br /> <br /> What works: <br /> <br /> - The Killer. What is not like a killer sneaking to wear a vibrant, red CCK outfit, with red gloves. The white whip he wears and uses very effectively, stands out beautifully against the bright red gown. Although the idea of ​​a killer in a flaming red, pointed headgear pervading around a girl's school is pretty far-fetched, it is one of the more sinister costumes I've seen. <br /> <br /> - Groovy 60s music. I really want to find the title music for The College Girl Murders. It has a jazzy, hip, 60's that I just loved. <br /> <br /> - Bizarre Touches. Besides the red gown and the hood of the killer, the movie has a sliding fireplace, a pit alligator with a loft, poison spray bibles, a strategically placed mannequin, mini skirts, gas socks and miles high hair. I will describe it as a cross between the 60's Batman TV show and an Italian giallo. The College Girl Murders is a real surprise to the eye. <br /> <br /> - The end. Let's just say there's more to it than a mountain road. Just when you think the killer is uncovered, comes here a bend ... and another? And another and another. <br /> <br /> Not Working: <br /> <br /> - Chief Inspector Sir John. I know the man was meant to be comic relief, but his buffoon character has far too much screen time. <br /> <br /> - Why do alligators have? Previously, I called the alligators in the pit. And while they are a fun touch, they serve very little purpose. Why is all the trouble going through and not using it? <br /> <br /> - Plodding Plot. Some of The College Girl Murders have no flow or rhythm. There are too many moments throughout the movie when things are inexplicably stopped. Better pacing would have made it a much nicer movie. <br /> <br /> I didn't see much of this German crime, but of the few I saw (Phantom of Soho, Strangler of Blackmoor Castle, Dead Eyes or London) this can be my favorite. This one has a real funky feeling that I'm really going. If the plot flowed a little better, I could easily have given the College Girl Murders the 7/10.
