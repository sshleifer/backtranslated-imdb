Chloe was secretly saved from dr. Caselli, the corrupt doctor responsible for transferring patients with abilities from Belle Reve to Project 33.1, and a fraction of the second time comes Clark. He finds that Bart Allan has returned to Smallville and they meet at Kent Farm. When Bart is caught in a LuthorCorp facility during a burglary, Clark discovers that the Green Arrow also hired Bart (Mn Impulse), Arthur Curry (Aquaman) and Victor Stone (Cyborg) to investigate Project 33.1 . Clark accepts joining the trio to save Bart and invites Chloe to take part in their mission. <br /> <br /> "Justice" is the best episode so far from this 6th season. In this episode, the Justice League begins its saga with the association of five heroes: Clark, Green Arrow, The Flash ("Impuls"), Aquaman and Cyborg. The participation of Chloe is spectacular, and the necessary teamwork organization. In the end, Oliver breaks up with Lois, based on the importance of fighting criminals and Lex's secret labs around the world. My voice is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Justi√ßa" ("Justice")
