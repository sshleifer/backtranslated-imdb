Seen it as a young naive punk when it was first released. Trimming me like a baby while leaving the theater, trying not to let anyone see. So, when I saw it again in '07, I knew what to expect and the strings were ready and prepared as needed. Luckily I came home this time. <br /> <br /> What I didn't remember about my youthful performance, or perhaps not noticed, was the technical glory of this movie. The use of flashbacks that tell so much story without talking to dialogue. The camera work that the viewer looked like, along with the characters in the scene. Think of the opening when Joe crosses the street to dinner, the camera pans behind the woman and child sit on a bench in the foreground, the street frame. <br /> <br /> The story itself, and the characters - cunning, sad and cruel indeed. It has been very much touched to be drawn into a human drama as closely as possible to people who are likely to tear most of us. Then again, Joe & Ratso can be any of us. Must have been 70 when I saw it. I remember that at the time of leaving the theater I would find the business of friends. All these years I've been glad I'm not alone tonight. It's a hell of a good movie.
