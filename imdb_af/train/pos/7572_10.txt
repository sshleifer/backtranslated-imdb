I just can't believe these games can get much better, but they do. Unfortunately, I had to rent a Dreamcast to play it, but even if I hit it, I couldn't wait to buy it for PS2. This is the only series of games I have to own, even if I hit them many times. I hope they never stop making this type of game, even if the series is coming to an end. <br /> <br />
