Leonard Maltin still has to watch another movie. (Although I find his Guide a reasonable source of resources, you should refuse his comment on this one.) He says, "Start well and then fizzles" when it's really the reverse. The plot is about as simple as it gets. Happy mother, happy father and happy son taking a vacation on a secluded beach, dad having unhappy in accident, mum walking down to get help, meeting with a dangerous escaped offender. Mom tries to help condemn while Dad waits and hangs on for best life. <br /> <br /> Good white knuckle, an electric shoot by Ralph Meeker, who suddenly appears (director, John Sturges, rolls it in a clever way that makes you stumble) about half way through as the cunning, desperate criminal . Meeker is an unusual pinball, reckless actor (at least here and in the classic "Kiss Me Deadly") and he happily hits the keys to the movie's narrative and accelerates with the top down. His character has a habit of grinning childishly and saying, "Pretty neat, huh?" when he is particularly pleased with his crimes. There is a funny break in the action if they get a flat tie and he immediately instructs his hostage, Barbara Stanwyck: "Don't get away". She burns back: "Where am I going?" (they are in the middle of nowhere) and he realizes sitcom-ishly "Yes, that's right". The friction between them is a hoot. <br /> <br /> There are mistakes, somewhat ludicrous. There is one scene where police, who have pursued Meeker for some time, stop Stanwyck's car and evade detection. Meeker rests his head on her shoulder like a loving man who supposedly wants to, and pretends to be asleep as she is being questioned. A. He looks remarkably masculine in this post and B. I think it's safe to say that any adult who seems to be asleep during a law enforcement meeting is surely suspected. <br /> <br /> Another solid thriller that builds up to an exciting and constructive conclusion. <br /> <br />
