I enjoy movies like this for their spirit, no pun intended. It's a decent, clean movie about a baseball team left behind, and a young wagon wants them to win, as his father-in-law has said it is the only way he returns to him. <br /> <br /> The spirit shines in two ways: a funny role with Danny Glover and a young Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and Heavenly Shepherd Al, the dynamic form of Christopher Lloyd. It's an energetic movie. It makes you smile and really involves you in the sport. <br /> <br /> Therein lies my grip. The one thing that is obvious to me is these sports films that make you an unexpected fan for the team. There is absolutely nothing wrong with. I just find it strange that I have to come out of the movie, think the Angels are a strong, cool team, as my basic loyalty, like that, lies with the Toronto Blue Jays. It's interesting, really. If it's just a movie about an undercover childhood team, then that's fine.
