Mario is invited to Princess Peach's Castle Cake. When Mario gets there, he finds Bowser kidnapped her! Mario has to save the day again. Unlike the 2-D games, Mario can explore anything he wants. He can just move around, climb trees trying to find 1-Ups, find secrets in levels, and more. You can spend four hours at one level. No time restrictions. There are 16 worlds, with a number of stages, and there are star doors that require a number of stars to enter. Once you are in these star doors, you must go through a stage and fight Bowser at the end of the stage. To get some worlds, you need a number of stars to enter. You enter the world through a painting. There are so many things to do and so many hours of play, I don't see how anyone can keep this game. It's wonderful. This launch title is the game that gamers made sure the N64 will have a good life. Every 3D platform game we know has something in common with SM64. Banjo Kazooie and Banjo Tooie are commonly used examples. Super Mario 64 is one of the biggest games in the history of 3D games. 10 out of 10. If you have a N64, buy this game. It's hard to get used, because nobody sells this baby for $ 5 at the pawnshop. A perfect 10.
