Are you a giraffe? ... asks John to Nadia, and she, sure to respond, responds: yes. In this way, communication between a man and a woman who do not know each other, and at the same time the questions and doubts begins in "Birthday Girl". A movie I've heard many times, but I dare not see. Up to two hours write it. <br /> <br /> "Birthday Girl" is a passionate movie that dropped me, at the same time, that Nicole Kidman is one of the best actress (except she is beautiful and intelligent) I've ever seen. "Birthday Girl" is the story of a lonely and routine man looking for a woman on the internet. The woman he finds comes from Russia. She looks like that delicate woman, normal, no longer. One day she suddenly comes in his birthday, his cousin and his friend. The man starts to discover some things. Since then, he has not been the lonely and routine man who has always been. Many of us will think that this movie is just a regular one with an exploited plot. Many of us will think that action and excitement are certain and not novel. But "Birthday Girl" is just the opposite. This movie is full of good surprises, good performances and an imaginative plot I've never seen and imagined. This romantic thriller with some funny touches is an excellent natural movie with many movie suggestions. "Birthday girl" has some beauty and roughness in his screens, but at the same time nature has become more natural and so deeper. <br /> <br /> "Birthday girl" is sometimes sad, sometimes funny, sometimes violent, but at the end, is quite satisfactory. And I'm not sorry to say it's a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> * Sorry for the errors ... well, if any.
