Probably the best Picture Producers Releasing Corp. ever made, this little horror piece sounds the attention of the first to the last. Director Frank Wisbar, of course, knows a good story when he writes one more and, more importantly, he knows how to realize his full shock potential on the screen. Not only is the plot involved and the characters drawn fascinatingly, but the environment is absolutely beyond this world! Almost all the action takes place at night or in the middle of a cluttering, pervasive fog. This cool atmosphere is enhanced by Wisbar's ingenious direction and the absolutely convincing performances he has made of all his players. The beautiful Rosemary La Planche makes an ideal heroine, beautiful, enthusiastic but vulnerable. Robert Barrat delivers his usual no-nonsense, straight-down-line portrait of the local bigwig, although it is difficult to believe that the personal, beautiful guy playing his son is none other than the later dullsville writer / director Blake Edwards.
