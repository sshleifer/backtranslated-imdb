Simply put, Oliver! is one of the best musical of all time. It's filled with memorable songs, "Olive!", "Oliver!", "Think yourself" and "Oom-Pah-Pah" to name just a few - and equally memorable characters. <br /> <br /> The film is a musical adaptation of Charles Dickens's classic novel and, like the story of Oliver Twist himself, it is a perfect family movie. There are a few scary moments - the villain Bill Sykes, who played Oliver Reed, is scarcely enough on his own - but in general, the film will appeal to children of all ages and adults. <br /> <br /> The story - which almost everyone is familiar with at the moment - revolves around a little orphan named Oliver and his life growing up in London. Initially, he was living with the rest of his co-orphans in the workplace, but after he dared to do so. Bumble, the supervisor, is being sold to a family as a servant. <br /> <br /> After a series of accidents and near-misses, he meets the Artful Dodger - played excellently by a young Jack Wild, who gives her everything - and by him, the greedy Fagin (Ron Moody ), which teaches young boys to choose pocket treasures he likes for himself. <br /> <br /> The film was shot in Shepperton Film Studios only in studios and soundtracks, but it doesn't translate film at all. The sets perfectly replicate Victorian London as well as the costumes worn by the characters. A multi-Oscar winner and a great success on his release, Oliver! is a worthy contender for the best musical from time to time and will surprise anyone who loves film.
