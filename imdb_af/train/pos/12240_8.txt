If you're the kind of person looking for a realistic movie or one with a strong and credible plot, then this movie is NOT for you. No, you will hate it. For those who like sweet, slightly screwball comedies, you'll have a great time watching this little movie. <br /> <br /> Tony Randall works for the IRS and investigates a very good farmer who never realized he needed to file an income tax return. But he is trying to convince them of the seriousness of his visit, everyone in the family is excited to have a company. They threatened him and treated him like one of the families, and plans to join his daughter, Debbie Reynolds. It really is about all the plot there is. But the movie gets high marks for a fun writing and decent acting. A very nice little curio of the late 1950s.
