She looks here and there and then goes into his bedroom and you get the picture: 'Oh! another girl ?? those two-dimensional baths and yes he has his two timings, but this is a GUY this time. And I say "Brilliant!" END OF SPOILERS (The above scene is not really a spoiler ... but for me it was so I didn't want to have a chance) <br /> <br /> When asked how this movie was, my friend replied: "Oh, this is just an outline of the P3 people," which makes me believe it is bad to watch a silly movie than nothing else. When I went to the theater, I thought to myself, "I better get a pen and a paper to write off the bad things about this movie," but I was totally wrong? and then some because I could only collect the goods. This movie was wonderful. Great, not because it is priceless and non-commercial theater like storyline, but because of the smartness in the script and how this movie tells you how to handle a movie brilliantly, which could be a silly and senseless movie than that given in the wrong hands. /> <br /> Konkona Sen Sharma is grace. She is so beautifully beautiful that she has given her role perfectly as if she were born to play this part. One of the most beautiful actresses I've ever seen. But it's not the only show that's good in the movie, there's Sandhya Mridul, Boman Irani and Atul Kulkarni. Especially Sandhya Mridul that just fire on the screen. (And guess what even the unusual accents Tara Sharma normally speaks) <br /> <br /> The movies die off with some stupid old parties of the hush-hush celebrities of the movie industry et al and you get the idea of ​​what this movie will be. And for about half an hour through the movie, you just feel the same. But then the movie takes on a good storyline and never lets it go. Even Boman Irani agrees with the statement ?? "It was a good story, Madhvi. (Thank you.) The big thing is that it addresses the issue of how stupid these people are with style and doesn't let it go and tackle social issues and don't make them boring. In the end, it's all a rollercoaster ride and Madhvi tells us that we are just smiling at all these people, just the reason I like watching movies. .
