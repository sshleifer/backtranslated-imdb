I first discovered Alexander Korda's (1940) Fantasy, THE THIEF OR BAGDAD in the early 1950's about a re-release known as the "Wonder Show of the Century". Both Korda Technicolor movies, THE THIEF OR BAGDAD and JUNGLE BOOK have been shown on a never-forgotten program. The music of Miklos Rozsa improved both films. The Technicolor in each one was incredibly beautiful! THE DAY OF BAGDAD stayed on my list as the best fantasy film ever made. As the years passed, it became harder to enjoy the movie's color as it was originally presented. True Technicolor made an Eastman Color process in the mid-1950s. Both Kino and Samuel Goldwyn reissued the film both on theater and on video. But the Eastman color prints were more pastel in nature and dampened the vitality of the original Technicolor. The laser disc release of this title also has the pastel look to it - beautiful but not as it should be. Now comes the M-G-M DVD (December 3, 2002). THE THIEF OR BAGDAD has another wonderful Technicolor look at it on a DVD that is nothing less than STUNNING !!! It was so exciting to see it again that I watched the DVD once. The only "Extras" is a Spanish Dubbed version, Subtitles in both English and Spanish, and a beautiful original theater trailer. Thank you M-G-M for this exceptional DVD edition. Now one can only hope that Korda's FOUR FOUR and a restored version of Korda's JUNGLE BOOK (to replace poor public domain printing in circulation) will soon follow on DVD.
