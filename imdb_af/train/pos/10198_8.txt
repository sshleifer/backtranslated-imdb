I am grateful to Cesar Montano and his crew for the revival of the once-moribund Visayan movie. "Panaghoy" is hopefully the forerunner of a revival in this national language (claiming more speakers than Tagalog). The dialect and lifestyle details are reminiscent of this region of the Philippines. Disadvantage: the coronary and stilted behavior of the American antagonist. The other item I didn't appreciate was the lack of authenticity in the "era" costume of the same character, and above all its bright red fast food I was supposed to be for a 1930's. Without those small but scary details, "Panaghoy" would be at least 9 out of 10 on my rating - hangover, Manoy Cesar! Addendum: This movie makes sure that Peque Gallaga's "Oro, Plata, Mata", which during World War II gave a different view of the Visayas. Alos, there are some parts where cinematography looks back at Spielberg's "The Color Purple" and the storyline reminds of "Noli Me Tangere".
