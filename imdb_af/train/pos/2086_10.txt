True to the work of Pearl S. Buck, who spent years in China as a missionary childhood child who gave her deep insight into Chinese culture and philosophy, this film adaptation was done brilliantly, both in technological art and acting. /> <br /> Wang Lung is a humble farmer who is grateful for the basics of life: to survive from his country and to be recently to Olan, a servant of a rich and powerful family in township. Despite Wang Lung and Olan's best efforts to farm the country, raise children, and build savings and wealth, a famine threatens to eradicate everything they've worked on. If they choose not to sell their country, a traditional Asian faith, they would rather go to a big city to wait for the famine. While in town, they are being reduced to begging and being just one of hundreds of other unfortunate homeless families. Although he is not a lover, Olan is caught in a squad at a rich man's house. She is briefly rounded off for execution by the army, but is rescued at the last moment. Her luck, however, is that she has found valuable jewels at the looting place that gives her and her family the opportunity to return to their farm. The new-found wealth transforms Wang Lung. He becomes selfish, self-centered and takes credit for finding. He becomes a very wealthy farmer, but it only makes matters worse because he is becoming increasingly unpleasant, arrogant and difficult to reason. He loses contact with the basic things in life that money can't buy: loyalty, dedication, trust, equity and honesty. As a punishment, nature once again made Wang Lung table by sending a plague of locusts to destroy everything he had. On his knees, Wang Lung is assisting all friends, former friends, workers and family. With everything that helps, he manages to save the farm. From that experience he returns to humility and appreciates the basics of life.
