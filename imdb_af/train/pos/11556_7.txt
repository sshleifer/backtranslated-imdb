Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau start and end their career together. Remember the best as the Grumpiest or Old Men as well as the weirdest couple we ever laughed at. Lemmon and Matthau have been one of Hollywood's beloved comedy teams of the past 100 years. Not so "raunchy" like Pryor and Wilder, but they were the classic comedy team that reflected a more modern Marx Brothers routine. Like the physical comedy as well as the mixed mix of chaos that Marx, Chaplin and Keaton were so familiar with. In the Odd pair, Lemmon and Matthau play complete opposites who create the chaos. The physical comedy is just as unique as Kaplins. The joke is usually on itself as an opponent to transfer the joke. Not your typical oufilm, it is in some way a comedy comedy with two old men than against two young teens in their first. The chemistry between Lemmon and Matthau is fun enough. Although this movie is not for everyone, it's a good comedy.
