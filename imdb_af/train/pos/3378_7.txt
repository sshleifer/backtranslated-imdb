This movie highly recommended me by Matt Groening. Well, I both watched the Simpsons and Futurama, and it's both called, so I thought "what the shit". The movie brings home a few "what if it is" that makes you realize how happy we are at this time and age where we take simple things like soap and water for granted. Interestingly, though, in the year 2022, the people still shave with a single blade of security guard! Nice that those responsible did not load the movie with unnecessary special effects, jet guns, etc. Some look for furniture as soon as you find out what it means. Remember, "Tuesday is Soylent Green Day"
