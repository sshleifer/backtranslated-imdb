'Arms and the Man' is one of Shaw's funniest plays, if handled correctly, and this production does a great job. Helena Bonham-Carter, pre-movie star, is Raina, the daughter of a military family, with a peacock of a fianc√© (Patrick Ryecart), and who hides an enemy soldier (Pip Torrens) during a attack on the village. <br /> <br /> Full color and energy, this production ripens along with a good fit, and as Bonham-Carter and Patsy Kensit as the maid shoot out a bit at the rest of the roll cage, they keep their ground. Kika Markham and Dinsdale Countries as parents are beautiful, and the whole play is generally a happy one. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
