I used this movie in a religion class I taught. The golden fish swim happily in his bowl in an upstairs apartment. A young boy and his mother are away from home. The boy was given money to buy milk. On his way home, he stopped at carnival to play a match. Along him stood a man in a black suit and looked a little scary. The boy dropped the bottle of milk. It breaks. The man in the black suit gives him money to replace the milk. This scene varies with what happens at home. A black cat climbs the firefly and enters the apartment. He (?) Discover the fish bowl and watch it. The fish is energetic and flips out of the bowl. By this time, a lot of teenagers in my class and I fell in love with the fish. The cat takes the fish in his mouth and we all love our breath. The cat falls into the bowl. The double story line includes the suspicious man in black and the suspicious black cat. Both inspire bias. Both are innocent. It was a good discussion principle in my class.
