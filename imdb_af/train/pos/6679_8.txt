I'm just making one apology for this movie: there are far, far, too many wide-angle close-ups, and if they irritate you beyond reason, enough. They drove MY mercy for the first ten minutes or so. But after that I made some kind of a ceasefire with terrible cinematography; And long before the end of the movie I stopped taking care. It's too rich a comedy that's so easily destroyed. It's hilarious, it's spectacular, the comic delivery of ALL the throws is flawless, and how much Usher looks at his characters through a cold fishing fish lens. He can't give them much. He succeeds in giving them warmth. "Mystery Men" is actually not only more beautiful, not only smarter, but also deeper than anyone has acknowledged. The jokes in the Austin Powers movies, for example, as well as less funny than the jokes here, are also much more toothless. The satire of "Mystery Men" bites when there is something worth biting and gnawing gently when it is not. It doesn't just mock an old thing. Therefore, contrary to what some (I have to observe) critics said, it never runs out of ideas. <br /> <br /> The `super 'heroes are an attractive bunch. Sure, they're two-way, but they're not just second-rate. The Blue Rajah, for example, does nothing but throwing people, and he's not that good at it. On the other hand, he is not bad either. He is better off in his limited field than most people, and he is diligently practicing. He is not a buffoon, which makes him a much funnier character than he does. If Superman Christ is in a cape, the Mystery Men are capes of all the smaller demigods of the foothills of Mount Olympus. Much cleaner; also much more encouraging.
