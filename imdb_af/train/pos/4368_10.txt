It's a very exciting and romantic movie. I've seen it several times and never get bored. Everything is realistic and this is a good plot. The actors are excellent Liam Neeson, Jessica Lange, Tim Roth and Brian Cox. <br /> <br /> I actually prefer this movie to Braveheart as Braveheart contains so many historical mistakes. There are many exciting scenes - watch out for the bridge tones and the last screen scene. It's really good and surprising scenes. <br /> <br /> The music is beautiful ... it really fits in with the movie. The environment is wonderful.
