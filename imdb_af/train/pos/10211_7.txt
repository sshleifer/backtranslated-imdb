Tales ?? whether it is written, visual or poetic epic? usually try to avoid characters; Readers and viewers can be overwhelmed too easily by trying to keep up with who exactly who is. This is especially true in film, I think, simply because we can't easily go back to refresh our memory in a theater. Viewers like me, however, don't have that problem, because we see all our movies on DVD or VHS. <br /> <br /> A year ago, I was introduced to Audrey Tautou, a French actress, who I first saw. The Fabulous Destiny by Amelie Poulain (2001) and later in a Very Long Reliability (2004), which were both mashed and complex stories with great role-playing characters. This earlier presentation exceeds the others in both ways: more characters and more complexity. <br /> <br /> Now, other directors used the techniques: Robert Altman with The Player (1992), Short Cuts (1993), Gosford Park (2001) and others; Paul Thomas Anderson did the same with Magnolia (1999). Stanley Kramer did this with a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World in 1963, a comedy of almost epic proportions. The difference with this movie is first and foremost that the director shows us in the head of some characters. Second, some scenes are repeated as a means to refresh the viewer's memory as the story flip-flops between different periods. /> The basic? the core, so to speak ?? Story is about a young woman, Irene (Tautou), told by a commuter on a train that she will meet her true love on that day. It takes place in the first few minutes of the film. The smart irony at this point is that Irene doesn't realize that the young man (Gilbert Robin) can be that "one true love." And neither ... <br /> <br /> They are going together with the realization of the potential significance of their close encounter. However, Chaos is the rest of the day, not only for the two youngsters, but for the rest of the characters that appear in a series of cleverly crafted and interwoven vignettes, it seems nowhere to go, and yet ... < br /> <br /> If the story was simple, it could be boring and even pretty predictable. Not so. The author and the director call our expectations with an army of innovative scenes that are too mundane, but which lead to credible, extraordinary events that the two possible lovers can meet again. For example, the next time a bird spy falls out of the air on a book or paper from yours, consider your alternatives; Two characters make a clear choice what must happen before Irene and her husband meet again. Or how about a rock board flying on your windshield? Consider again what will happen ... <br /> <br /> All this is interesting enough. What was more interesting was to assess every new man who came together and to decide if this man was one for Irene, or whether it was actually the young man on the train. It made me guess for a while. <br /> <br /> If you see this amazing skirt, I'll make you think about it. <br /> <br /> Recommended for everyone.
