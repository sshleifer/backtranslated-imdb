A terrorist attempt to steal an upper secret biological weapon, and in the process of escaping, is contaminated when the case with the deadly agent is compromised. Soldiers are able to recover the case, but the terrorist makes his way to a hotel where he tries to hide. They eventually make it to where he is hiding and cleaning the hotel and its residents. Unfortunately, by their body they get rid of cremation, and if you've seen Return of the Living Dead, you know what happens next. <br /> <br /> Zombi 3 is widely used by critics and zombie fans as a full movie movie. Although it is a fair rating, it is not without the highs. For one thing, it has very bloody deaths to keep gorehounds happy. There is an abundance of zombies that come from everywhere. They are in the water, the branches of houses, hiding in trees, and for some reason they like to hide under a lot of dead brush, just to jump out as the heroes try to escape. There is even a flying zombie head hiding in a fridge. You have to see it to believe it, as the scene only needs Zombi 3 to view IMO. It may have very terrible editing and some very dubious actions, especially from the doctor who is one of the worst actors I've seen, but Zombie 3 is still a very entertaining movie. Sometimes it is nice to sit back and watch a movie that needs nothing more than your time and an open mind. Zombi 3 fits that account, and then some. It's even nicer when you open a few beers, and watch it with some other friends. I give it an 8/10, just because of sheer enjoyment.
