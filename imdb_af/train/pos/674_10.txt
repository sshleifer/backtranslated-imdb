While most of the movies are watching the movie, it's of little importance, but from the many hundreds of movies dealing with magic and occult in one form or another, this one is probably the best in many ways. <br /> <From the Golem to The Craft is the subject of endless interest to the film industry. Most movies that touch it in any way do it childishly (for example, "Witchboard", a real piece of garbage in every respect) or the transcendental elements as well as cheap excuses for cheesy special effects or cardboard cutout villas (cf. "Warlock"). More often, the subject appears in a hysterical religious context (in the various Revelation-oriented films, the antichrist is inevitably a supporter of a kind of age-style practice). Rare, a movie seems to show at least a passing experience of magic as it is practiced in real life, but the presentation of the occult in such movies can at best be as allegorical and not literal, or symbolic or not not quite right. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie again after many years tonight. I previously saw it on VHS; This is a dark, moody piece, and after watching it on DVD, I would say if you are planning to watch this movie, watch it on DVD, it should not be seen on VHS. <br /> <br /> The darkness and mood are overwhelming in VHS, but in DVD the movie is quite different. I think Weir has deliberately pushed the dark aspects for style, but if the film is converted to the smaller medium of VHS, it goes over the edge. DVD brings the movie back to life and I saw it differently. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I see it as the first time, I realized that magic treatment is extremely good in this movie. It's hard to go in all the reasons I don't mind taking the time to do it. <br /> <br /> For anyone who is curious, anyway, if you want to see how it is in real life, this movie is just right on many levels. <br /> <br /> And for anyone who isn't, you really lost a lot of time reading this point.
