one of the best low-budget movies from Germany! Is this the dark side of the new era? If you believe in esotericism, you shouldn't see this movie! It blows away all your positive fantasies. This movie shows that beyond the peaceful facade of spiritual soul research lies a world of extreme transgressions and terror. I hope there will be a 35mm copy soon! Andreas Marschall's first film is just the start of a new field and makes movies with a few euros! I'm waiting for the second hit!
