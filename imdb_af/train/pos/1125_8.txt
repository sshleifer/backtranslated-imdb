Michael Cacoyannis has had a relatively long career, but has surprisingly few credits to his name, including some real dudes such as the unprecedented Cold War satire The Day the Fish. However, Iphigenia is a highlight. Adapted by Cacoyannis from the play of Euripides, it is a superior version of the classic tragedy and recently made its first television appearance in the United States with many thanks to the Flix Channel. The film was shot on an epic scale, but is certainly not a "big" movie, with the emphasis on the simple story. In prayer to the gods, King Agamemnon (Kostas Kazakos) is obliged to sacrifice his daughter Iphigenia (Tatiana Papamoschou). , much to the dismay of Queen Clytemnastrae (Irene Papas). Kazakos and Papas are both excellent, but it is the beautiful Papamos show that brings the most interesting elements to the screen, the innocence of childhood with the realization that she is the pawn in a political game. Highly recommended for fans of international theater.
