I watched this movie without knowing anything and found it thematically theme for Billy Elliott (2000). Both films are based on a troubled father / son relationship. In both films, the boy does not want to follow his father next to the mines and dreams of a better life away from their hometown. Both boys are beaten by their classmates and both have a strong female role model who teaches them. <br /> <br /> The big difference I found between the films was October Sky was an infinitely more interesting and touching movie. Laura Dern sits in a moving show and Chris Cooper plays the disapproving father very well as he did in American Beauty (1999). Joe Johnston surprised me with his subtle direction, very different from his other direct features such as Jumanji (1995) and Jurassic Park III (2001). <br /> <br />
