Such a film of beauty makes it difficult to describe. Perhaps this is the absence of an unnecessary dialogue, or maybe it's the absolute star soundtrack, or maybe it's just Meena Mumari's feet, but it's a joy to watch this movie again and again. I have never seen another Indian movie coming close, and little of any country thinks its perfection.
