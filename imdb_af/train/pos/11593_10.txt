I remember seeing this movie when I was a kid on the wonderful world of Disney one day. This movie has been in my memory for over 30 years and I searched for it. I would have to say it from all the children's movies I saw when, "this one came out more than all of them and once I saw it, I really hoped I'd see it again. The story and images of this movie have been burned in my memory, until now I have never seen it again, but I never remembered the title until an internet search made it known to me earlier today. have my kids see it, is there anyone who knows where to find it?
