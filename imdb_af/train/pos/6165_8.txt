Yes, some plots are a bit difficult to follow, and the bill has a tendency to become violent, but it's actually a surprising view I'm not trying to miss. A lot of the episodes are very exciting and quite tense and the play is pretty good, but I miss Roberta Taylor as inspector Gina Gold and Todd Carty as Gabriel Kent. I will admit, I prefer the older episodes for the new episodes, and it is a pity that the program is now on the watershed, because I have easier to see when it was at 8:00. Still, why I like the bill is because it's not only annoying, but the stone hangers at the end make the next episode indispensable. It is true that it is more melodramatic than it was, but I really like this program as a program that is not trying to take itself too seriously. 8/10 Bethany Cox
