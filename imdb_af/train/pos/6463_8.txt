This is one of those movies you think about when you wake up the next morning. It will give you the warm, vague feeling and leave you with a smile on your face. <br /> <br /> Sure, we're fed up with the typical stereotype characters and stories, but it does the trick: Entertainment. <Br /> <br /> Because of Sweden and for a little somewhere in the US, it's funny how we respond. "The dead man will kill him," "She (Gabriella) will die and then there will be a heartbreaking longer than the end of life." We know how these things work, everything comes together. And it did. The characters were a bit simple, they were so expanded that you didn't think twice about it, nothing was really left for your own imagination. The neighbor will probably be Siv, she asks you if she is indeed in love with Daniel, but it is about it. <br /> <br /> But the movie is beautiful, in rural Norrland, the music is absolutely incredible. and the characters love. Michael Nyqvist is really genius, with his crazy unique look and Frida Hallberg is charming and approachable. Maybe it's a little too nice. <br /> <br /> But most of all makes this movie feel, and that's the most important thing. You cry, you laugh, you hate and you identify. I don't know about you guys, but it doesn't happen that often.
