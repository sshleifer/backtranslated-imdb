I wrote mixed feelings for "Les Valseuses" (1974) and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started to look, but I finally liked it. I wouldn't call it vulgar ("Dumb and Dumber" is vulgar, "The Sweetest Thing" is both vulgar and unforgivable stupid); I call it shocking and offensive. I can understand why many viewers, especially females, do not want or even hate them. This is the epitome of misogyny (or so it seems), and the way two antiheroes treat every woman they want to meet seems unspeakable. But the more I think about it, the more I realize it's somehow a beautiful jewel. I was fascinated by how Blier could get away with it. The movie is very entertaining and very enjoyable: it is well written, the acting of all is first class, and the music is sweet and melancholy. Actually, when I thought about it, two companions did something good for the women they came to: they prepared a woman in the train (the lovely, deaf blonde Brigitte Fossey who started her movie career with one of the most impressive debates in René Clément's "Forbidden Games" (1952) at the age of 6 to meet her husband she hadn't seen for two months; they found a man who would eventually leave a zealous Marie-Ange (Miou-Miou) and be satisfied; their enlightened and educated young and very willing Isabelle Huppert (in one of her early screen performances.) Their encounter with Jeanne Moreau elevates this comedy to the tragic level. In short, I'm not sure I want to meet Gerard Depardieu's Jean-Claude and Patrick Dewaere's Pierrot in real life and invite them to dinner, but I had a good time watching the movie and two hours almost flew . It was never boring. .
