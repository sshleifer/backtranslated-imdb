I'm a fan of C&C, go back to their records and love this movie, but at one point in the mid-1980s on cable television in San Jose California it was broadcast with an alternative plot line that made the whole point of the movie . All references to marijuana were replaced by "diamonds". The bag that "Red" falls to Chong has diamonds in it, instead of dagga, but the conversation remains the same ("... it's worth ~ $ 3000 / lb"). There is also a subplot in which clips of aliens on a ship have been added to observe C & C and talk to each other about the diamonds. In the end, instead of the "space cooks", it's something else. I'm not sure who created this version, but it was terrible and clear that they were trying to make this family / child friendly. It would have been better if the network didn't sow it at all.
