I first saw "Breaking Glass" when it was released in England in 1980. I loved it and when it was just caught in a Canadian station in August 2005, it's still good. The only thing I regret is I can't find the soundtrack or the DVD in the stores ... ... give anyone to shed light or order it from an excess of internet company. But to return to the movie, the music is on the verge of time. Hazel / Kate had something about 80's Britain. Actually, it was the same decade, I went to Canada for the same reasons as a Thatcher and what she did to the country at the time. If you get the chance, watch this movie, you won't be sorry!
