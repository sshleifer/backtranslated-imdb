This film takes place in the 1950s. Of these, the dead (called zombies) originated to eat the living. But a company has developed a collar that, when sitting around the zombie neck, makes them easy and perfect servants. The Robinsons mother, Helen (Carrie-Anne Moss), dad Bill (Dylan Baker) and son Timmy (K'Sun Ray) hire a zombie because everyone on their block already has one. Tim calls the zombie Fido (Billy Connolly) and becomes friends with him. But his dad hates him and Timmy loses control of Fido and things go wrong. <br /> <br /> As you can see, it is - among many other things - a take-off on the Lassie series with Fido, who stands for Lassie. Timmy mentioned it for a reason! Every single of the well-known Lassie episodes are stretched here. My favorite is when Timmy sends Fido to get help before the zombies eat him! It is also a satire of the 1950s Douglas Sirk films where everything is bright and colorful - but dark secret tears people apart. The characters wear VERY bright 1950s clothes (Moss is always in a dress). The furniture, settings and cars are especially bright colors in the 1950s. Even when the text repeats, there is always something to look at. The writing is good - but there are just as many Lassie jokes as you can make. The melodramatics are so stupid, but the throws off it. Everyone here is excellent and right on the target. Even Connolly as an emotional zombie does a good job. Moss is the best - play every line for all its value --- but never go overboard. <br /> <br /> It's not for everyone (of course). The satire can be lost on most people and the gore is pretty tame. The gore is done so comfortably and with happy music, it is difficult to take it seriously. So, for some, it will really work. I give it a 8.
