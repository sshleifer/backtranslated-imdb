Although this movie came out a year before I was born, it is definitely one of my favorite comedies. Redd Foxx dies as a father trying to understand his son's homosexuality. Like most parents, he knows nothing about what it means to be gay and has all these stereotypical concepts of what gay people are. His son, Norman, is now big and lives on his own. When his father, Ben, finds out that his son is gay, he pays his son in the hope of changing him. The title comes from one of the funniest lines in the movie. When Ben comes to Norman's apartments, he walks into a female prostitute and thinks it's his son in tow (Norman ... is that you?). The film made me laugh from beginning to end. Red Foxx is wonderful. Although much of the content is stereotypical, I have found nothing offensive about how the material was handled, and it even has a good end. Highly recommended.
