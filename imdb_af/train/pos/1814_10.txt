All Dogs Going to Heaven is in my opinion the best animated movie ever made. I'm not really a big fan of animated movies, but there's something about this one that makes it better than any other animated movie I've seen. The music is great like the performances of Burt Reynolds, Dom Deluise, and especially Ken Page as the King Gator. "Let's make music together" is perhaps one of my favorite songs of any movie music I've seen. It's definitely a must for people of all ages.
