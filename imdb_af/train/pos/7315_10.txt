Classic, highly influential low-budget thriller that gave birth to a horror icon and started the careers of both director Carpenter and star Curtis. <br /> <br /> The seemingly unstoppable killer escapes the spiritual institution and returns to his hometown where he begins Halloween as a local babysitter. <br /> <br /> Halloween is a film that will never fulfill its reputation as a horror masterpiece! Carpenter's frightening story and clever direction give this movie such a chillingly good life that it should be seen to be really feeling! The direction often consists of such simple elements, shadows, dark streets, creaking doors, that even make the everyday environment of a village truly rude. Carpenter stops his tension and his shocking shocks to make them the most effective surprise, it is in itself a thing that few horror filmmakers ever manage! Plus, he is wise enough to give us a really nice young character and a lot of villains to keep the tension stronger. Highest kudos also go to Carpenter's simple but frightening music party. In a sense, Halloween is a great example of a perfect horror movie! <br /> <br /> The cast is excellent. Young Jamie Lee Curtis does a very good turn as sweet babysitter Laurie Strode, she is so good that she will be playing in a number of other horror movies before breaking into bigger movies. The great Donald Pleasants do a perfect performance as Myer's doctor, desperate to catch him again. Supporting Cast Loomis, Soles, Castle and others are also good. <br /> <br /> Like its own villain, Halloween is an unstoppable force that never relaxes and relaxes. It's a MUST for all genre fans! <br /> <br /> **** from ****
