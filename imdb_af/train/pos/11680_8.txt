OK Clara Bow style 1927 movie, a devastation of Rain, with Bow playing the half-Hawaiian wild daughter of the local pineapple king, in love with English engineer Clive Brook. Bow competes with the local widow (Arlette Marchal) for his attention, but both women get a big surprise when his wife arrives (Patricia Dupont). The robber woman is ready for a divorce until she discovers that he may be on the verge of a fortune. Bow fastened her hash quickly. <br /> <br /> Bow has personality savings and has some great scenes: her open nude bath, her hula in a grass skirt and the dog rescue scene with Bow and Brook doing their own stunts. <br /> <br /> Note: The IMDb credit list is incorrect. The movie credits (of the DVD I have) list Patricia Dupont as Mrs. Haldane --- not Margaret Truax as listed on IMDb.
