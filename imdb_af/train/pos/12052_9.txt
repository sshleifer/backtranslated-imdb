I saw it on TV so long ago that I can't remember when it was, but it still looks like one of the scariest, stupid movies I've ever seen. There is a simultaneous subtle but intense fear that the woman in the black light on the edge of the frame is not quite clearly visible, so you feel (like the lawyer hero), unsure whether she is just imagination or not . This is also one of the few films that really made me scared to keep watching. "Production values" are hung up, good movies are about a director's ability to create atmosphere using film, actors, places / sets, music, attention to detail and ... imagination. A real gem.
