many chess movies have been made over the past few years, but this one is more than just a chess movie. It's a story about the need to be loved and the need to win it, John Toturro plays a psychologically challenging man. for him accept 64 squares and 32 pieces, the game empowers him as a person, when he loses a match, he loses the one thing that makes sense to him and John Torturro expresses it in a beautiful way, even the love of a woman was not enough to save him from his sad existence. It makes you wonder if there are other Luzon's out there who are obsessed with the game, I'm sure they are, if you're a chess enthusiast, it won't hurt to see it. It is an intelligent piece of work well done and well executed, it achieves its goals, unfortunately I doubt whether there will be prosecution.
