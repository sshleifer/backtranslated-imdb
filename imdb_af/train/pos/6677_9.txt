A movie about wannabes, never-west's and less-than-heroes makes it all possible. Where did we hear it before? But when the unlucky are the Shoveller, the Blue Raja and Mr.Furious, you know it's not your conventional rags for wealth story. <br /> <br /> A classic performance by Eddie Izzard as Tony P. one of the Disco boys leaders and Geoffrey Rush as Arch Villain shows the real thought has gone in the decisive course. <br /> <br /> Even at first glance, Greg Kinnear is a strange choice for the role of Captain Amazing, a cartoon. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie if you're sick of comic-road movie stereotypes. Why can't anger be a superpower?
