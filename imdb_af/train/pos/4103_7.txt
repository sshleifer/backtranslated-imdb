The main characters in this movie fall into two categories: clever and stupid. Simple enough. <br /> <br /> Jiri Machacek (Standa) is playing an intrepid, dopey man arrested for a crime he has not committed. While trying to be financially compensated by his evil, former boss, the situation becomes out of control. <br /> <br /> While Standa is really (but endearing) stupid, his girlfriend Ondrej is an absolute blissful idiot who is hiding and managing everything the wrong thing to say and do. Without Ondrej, Standa can offer a chance to go through life through a modest degree of success. With Ondrej, life will never be boring, but it will certainly not be without many headaches. Ivan Trojan plays Zdenek, an evil genius type who degenerates into some Hitler-esquire disorder tyrants. Zdenek and his henchmen try to kill Standa to keep Zdenek's secrets safe. <br /> <br /> I am very impressed with the high quality and imagination of Czech movies. For a relatively small country, the Czech Republic certainly produced more than its share of excellent entertainment. The best Czech movies I've seen are: 1) Peli ?? ky and 2) Tmavomodr√Ω Svet (Dark Blue World). If you see these two movies, you've seen the absolute best of Czech theater.
