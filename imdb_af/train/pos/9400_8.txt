If the man in the white suit was made in America, can't you see Danny Kaye or Jerry Lewis trying to try Alec Guinness's Sidney Stratton? <br /> <br /> This is one of the best of Alec Guinness's films and certainly one of the best Ealing Studios in the UK has ever turned out to be. It fits in well with the timeframe of the new Labor Government and the society that is trying to build it. It's amazing how in times of crisis capital and labor can agree. <br /> <br /> Alec Guinness this gentle man's skeleton is obsessed with the idea that he can find out clothes that never need cleaning, all kinds of strange objects the moment it touches the garment. <br /> <br /> He is a persistent cuss and he succeeds in it. Of course, the implications are not really thought out about the kind of impact clothing it will have on society. In the end, everyone is chasing him like a refugee, almost like Peter Lorre of M or Orson Welles in The Stranger or even Robert Newton in Oliver Twist. <br /> <br /> This is the sign of a great comedy film that a possible serious situation like the chase described in some of the serious movies I mentioned can be played for laughter. Poor Guinness's suit is not only white and stain repellent, but glows like a neon board. <br /> <br /> Unlike Guinness, Cecil Parker's best performances are another pompous grandfather, Joan Greenwood as his siren daughter and Ernest Thesiger, the largest clothing manufacturer in the UK. <br /> <br /> Come to think of it, Paramount borrowed that suit from Ealing and gave John Travolta for Saturday night's feast?
