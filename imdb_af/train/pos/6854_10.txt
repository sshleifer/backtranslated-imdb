Intelligent, attractive and compelling thriller of the great Brian De Palma is a modern classic that stands strong among its best movies! <br /> <br /> When troubled housewife is brutally murdered by a bizarre stranger, the victim's son joins a prostitute to expose the murderer. <br /> <br /> Dressed to Kill left a strong impression on hearing his day and for good reason. De Palma creates a wonderful dramatic story that begins with an intriguing set-up and builds in a sad secret full of tension. The final and conclusion is especially 'nightmare'. It's a real edge of your seat shock. Even more impressive is De Palma's elegant direction that not only gives this movie a thrill, but also a unique and dark atmosphere. Dressed to Kill is also a very erotic film, but especially in a strange way. Pino Donaggio also gives a beautiful musical score to the film. <br /> <br /> The cast is another strong feature of this movie. Michael Cain does a tremendous turn as a psychiatrist. Angie Dickenson is wonderful as the bad housewife. Nancy Allen's performance as a street walker is solid. A young Keith Gordon also appears to be a worthy supporter than the investigative son. <br /> <br /> Many criticisms of De Palma's films for Hitchcockian elements and this film were no exception. But any resemblance between Hitchcock's works and De Palmas can only be considered a good quality, as the call of this movie would be a rip-off, breaking down into a fine thriller. Dressed to Kill is a must have for all cinema fans. <br /> <br /> **** from ****
