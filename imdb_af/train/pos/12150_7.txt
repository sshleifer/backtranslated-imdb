This movie is one of many Kung Fu action films made in Asia in the late 70's - early 80's, full of cheap sound effects, baptized dialogue and lightning camps. But unlike most movies of this genre, it also has a decent plot and very good comedy. When workers of a dye factory are forced out of their work by Manchu bulls, they hire a fellow artist (Gordon Liu) to scare them off. When his attempt fails, he misses his way into a Shaolin temple to learn to actually fight. Instead of making him a Kung-Fu student, the master commands him to build a scaffolding to cover the roofs of all 36 rooms. Well, it seems he has the skills to be a Kung-Fu expert while performing these multitude of tasks (stacking and tying bamboo posts). It's kind of like in Karate Kid when Mr. Miagi Daniel teaches the basic characteristics of karate by doing routine household tasks - "Wax on, wax off" and so on. There is a lot of good comedy from start to finish and lots of action at the end when Gordon Liu faces his Manchu tormentors again. "This time it's not just tricks, it's the right thing!" Liu proudly declares his chest. If you like classic Kung Fu movies, you don't want to miss this one!
