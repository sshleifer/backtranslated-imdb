I thought the kids in the movie were wonderful. I am dealing with children in that age group, and I thought their behavior was very credible. I had a problem referring to the private parts made by the 5-year-old. I didn't think the comment was necessary and slightly lowered my opinion of the movie. <br /> <br /> I think Lukas Benward is up and coming. I'd like to see more of him on the big screen. I enjoyed his reactions to the situations he was in. Often children in this age group do things without thinking about the consequences. Almost all the actors did it throughout the film. <br /> <br /> I also think the message of bullies should be investigated more in movies with this age group. This is a major problem in schools today. <br /> <br /> The end was quite unexpected. Billy's thoughts on whether he won the bet or not won was very surprising. The way he dealt with the situation was excellent. Too many children are not willing to compromise. The actors in this movie have shown that compromise is an important part of life.
