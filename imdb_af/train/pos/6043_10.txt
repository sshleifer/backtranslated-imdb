I saw the freebird movie and think it's good! It's fun back, over time the UK movie industry has entertained! It's good how the man they meet at the service station appears in the news agencies in the movie. The play was convincing (I'm a cyclist). They reminded me of some good times I had in the bike scene. It was good to see how the film director came to the play, which was well done! At the end a new crop is called. In Ireland is it the basis for a 2nd film? hope so keep them coming. Great movie, well written, realistic characters!
