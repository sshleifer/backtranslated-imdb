Cursed, indifferent and impeccable, Fay Grim is hard to go through, but Parker Posey is really the only actress who can take this story and run with it. She gets fast, funny, cunning. The supporting actors also link it. <br /> <br /> I won't even try to tell the plot. It entails characters from Hartley's Henry Fool and tries a story of international espionage. <br /> <br /> The movie works well if you continue to understand it. in a sense, completely ridiculous. It is becoming more ridiculous than you walk along. (I resisted the temptation to turn off the DVD twice.) <br /> <br /> Fay Grim requires an adventurous movie to tackle something that is not a cookie cutter. In the end, it offers something that describes.
