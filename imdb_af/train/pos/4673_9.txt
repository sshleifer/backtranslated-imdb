One of the things that interests me most about this movie is the way the characters and their related history are developed on the fly. I think the authors wanted us to be interested in the characters by not feeding their characters. The premise of using the art and craft of furniture design and construction was a unique theme and / or analogy for which families / brothers and sisters are alive. The complexity of twins serves as a surrogate father and a spouse has created great tensions to make this film emotionally interesting. Although the story was not one that directly links the masses (ie Jewish / twin / family business), the themes are fairly universal as each family has a black sheep in it. This made it very encouraging.
