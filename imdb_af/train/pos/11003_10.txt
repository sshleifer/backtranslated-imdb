Listen, I don't care what anyone is saying, as Cypher is nothing less than a 5-star movie. Cypher is not, I repeat, a B-movie. Cypher is an absolute masterpiece. That's enough to say, I'm an expert on the world's best spy movies and this movie is nothing short of top flight. I can't think of how phenomenal this movie is. Cypher is one of the best spy films ever developed and ever made. The technology in this movie is about the horizon of space time. In fact, I have to admit that Cypher surprised me from hell. In fact, I recommended this movie to my colleagues more than any other movie. Other critics, some of whom have been playing the movie, have no idea what they are talking about. Don't listen to the haters. And actually the reviews of Cypher are largely positive. And it should be noted that Cyher is not just a good movie, but it is also a fantastic movie. Cypher is the kind of film so advanced and so wonderful that it is the head of most critics and all the cynics. There's nothing wrong with or cheap about Cypher whatsoever. Again, cinematography, background, technology, storyline and acting are already 100% of world-class top speed. Of course I will give away nothing. It's not a spoiler. And although it is the criticism of some critics that Cypher should have been in films, I rather believe the opposite. Cypher is a movie that was just right for DVD release and not in a bad way. Cypher must be the largest underground spy flag ever to hit the shelves. Blade Runner, 1984, Brave New World, Total Recall, Logan's Run, Jason Bourne and Impostor and Deja Vu ... watch out! Cypher also deserves the distinction of being placed in the AONN Multimedia Research, 5 Star Eternal Spy Movie Hall of Fame. Cypher is contradictory to the absolute best. Hands off and guard. Nothing is what it seems and the truth is strange as fiction. The future is now.
