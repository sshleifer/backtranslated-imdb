I was taken by a friend to this movie and was skeptical of a Swedish movie with subtitles. However, I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this beautiful movie. The unnecessary cruelty the man is capable of is portrayed with confidence without overwhelming images - although animal lovers may need to screen a few seconds in the first 10 minutes. A traditional story of humility towards brutality and hope versus tragedy is illustrated from a satisfying new angle by using a spectrum of characters with many natural flaws and functions. I especially liked how the film managed to address various aspects of hypocritical human behavior that relate to bias, discrimination and sacred appearance. An absolute jewel of a movie I will promote to anyone who will listen.
