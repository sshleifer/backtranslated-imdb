Cinderella is a beautiful movie, with beautiful songs of course. In fact, this is one of the best films of the 1950s. <br /> <br /> I think all the characters are incredibly portrayed. You can see the cruelty of Cinderella's stepchildren and her stepmother, the sweetness of Cinderella. The mice are funny and sweet. <br /> <br /> I think they've changed the story a bit, but I think it's for the best. It's such a nice movie, and I don't think anyone can defend it deeply. <br /> <br /> I give it an 8/10. I don't think it's the best Disney movie. But this is certainly a true classic.
