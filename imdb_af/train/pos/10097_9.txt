One of the first OVA's ("original video animation") I ever bought, should be one of my favorite anime titles. A cyberpunk sci-fi action comedy against an unlikely (for a comedy, that is) background of near future pollution in a dystopian society. <br /> <br /> The "heroes" of Dominion are the Tank Police, formed with a "if we can't beat crime, we will have bigger guns" philosophy, and who, as the name suggests, patrol the city ​​in tanks instead of patrol cars, and which is actually much more dangerous than any criminals are trying to catch. Most, if not all, of this police are borderline (?) Psychopaths and neurotics, which give new meaning to the phrase "loose cannons". <br /> <br /> Just as colorful and amusing are their opponents, Terrorist Buaku and his handle (the) men, the Twin Cat Sisters, whose existence always seems to give the Tank Police a hard time . <br /> <br /> The animation is not the latest in art, but it is very different; The colorful palette and cartoon-like appearance of the characters and mecha fit the comic atmosphere of Dominion. <br /> <br /> English dubbing is fun again. The soundtrack of the English version is also very good. I wonder if they ever made a soundtrack album ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, Dominion Tank Police is great. It is Japanese cyberpunk SF with lots of comedy, filled with completely over-the-top characters and situations, and make sure it never takes seriously. Highly recommended.
