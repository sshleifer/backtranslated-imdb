I would like to see cuts since the day I heard about it, which was somewhere last year. Anyway, I saw today, and when the movie started, I thought it started earlier this week, but it got better after 10 minutes or more. I thought the movie was pretty good. but the thing I didn't like was how the killer was created, I thought just before I hired that it would probably struggle just like urban legends: final cut, I almost died. Mostly everything in UL final track should be improved. CUT is 100 times better than UL: final cut. The best part of CUT is the killer and the death tones. The killer kicks MO F *** ING ASS. <br /> <br /> I give an 8 out of 10 slices
