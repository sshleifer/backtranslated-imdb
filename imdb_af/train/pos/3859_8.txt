Paul Verhoeven's The Fourth Man (The Fourth Man) is one of the most compelling thrillers I've ever seen. It was really a pleasant surprise. The story is about the bi-sexual writer Gerard (Jeroen Krabbe), as he is lured into a relationship with the beautiful hairdresser Christine (Ren√©e Soutendijk), but in the distorted mind of Gerard there can be more to the story. Verhoeven and film maker Jan De Bont create a beautiful and thick atmosphere full of surreal and sickly sexual images. It really puts you in the story, you don't want to look, but you can't turn yourself away. This is Far Vereven's best movie (maybe second only for Robocop). True The fourth man is not for everyone, some of the sex scenes are pretty free (ignore it but trust me, if you watch for at least ten minutes, you will be tied up. This is one of those movies you need to know how it ends, a real whodunit it in the Hitchcock tradition, compelling, controversial and exciting. I even like the spin metaphor. <br /> <br /> 8/10
