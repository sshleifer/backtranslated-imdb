From the first scene I was very excited. "I can say it will be wonderful!" I think. The acting was so good, I felt like I was on the lives of these people. The music was also terrifying. The plot started with a sudden event and then driven to an irrevocable lot. The construction was slow, but I personally love that kind of thing, as long as the quiet tension is on course and not being shot down before it is ready to pay off. <br /> <br /> So everything goes well, and then the fireworks start, and before you know it, roll the credits. "WHAT? !!!" was everything I and my film nightclub could say. If you understand the director's intentions, the blunt end is meaningful (for those who have already seen the movie, look at the very fascinating and hilarious interview with Larry Fessenden at filmcritic.com), but I can't help it. is not straight. <br /> <br /> It could probably be resolved with as little as ten minutes of material before the climax. Anyway, it's too bad. The ten minutes could have made the difference in the world. (But for those who don't write or make movies, you need to know that a story is made with the right timing, is a big pain in the butt and I definitely don't make this criticism of any kind of pedestal!) < br /> <br /> Wendigo feels like a masterpiece given up before it was finished. But hay, I will overpower a broken masterpiece every day over an over-produced piece of dog doll with too many digital effects (like most horror movies these days). <br /> <br /> Another comment. Some of the monsters left me confused whether I should be scared or lazy. I don't know how to explain it, but there was a clear Monty Python about this monster in its more blatant "monster" shapes. Although it may seem like a terrible criticism of a horror movie - I don't know, it still worked in a crooked way. I will never look at deer vineyards again! :)
