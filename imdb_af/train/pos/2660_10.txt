When I first looked at the Shining, I expected a decent movie of what I heard about it and I had a lot of Stanley Kubrick's other work, but when I started to look it was so much better than I thought. At times I felt seriously uncomfortable and I couldn't take my eyes on the screen. There is something very upset about everything in the movie. Now some people don't like Kubrick's version of The Shining, as it doesn't quite follow Stephen King's book, but in my opinion both Kubrick's version, the mini-series and the book are all great. Jack Nicholson gives a great show. If you're looking for a good original movie that will make you think even after watching the movies about The Shining.
