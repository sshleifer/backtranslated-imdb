DANIEL DAY-LEWIS does a remarkable job of playing the cerebral palsy artist Christy Brown, but has managed to have a productive life, successfully handle his disability and a respected artist and writer to become. <br /> <br /> However, the movie is a very difficult one to review - or even watch. Fortunately, I had the caption function to capture every spoken word that would have been impossible if I saw the movie in a theater. While respecting it as a brave piece of work with tricky topics, I can't say it's the kind of movie I want to see more than once. <br /> <br /> Yet, my story-telling device, a spring-backed jump, shows that Christy is honored for his achievements before we see the jump back to his youth and his struggle for with the people to communicate to him, who definitely loved him. DANIEL DAY-LEWIS is definitely remarkable as the troubled man who falls in love with a therapist (FIONA SHAW), much to his mother's fear that when love does not become reciprocal, his heart will be broken. There is a painfully long scene in a restaurant where he confesses his love for others, and then goes into a fierce rage after drinking too much. <br /> <br /> BRENDA FRICKER does a brilliant job as the mother cares for him, his father and a brother of brothers and sisters as they struggle to keep a roof over their heads until Day-Lewis successfully completes work begins. She complements Day-Lewis's actions as the hot-tempered mother and shares many ongoing moments with him. <br /> <br /> Rich detailed story of a family who stayed under the most unusual circumstances with attention to the detail of the period in each frame of the film. Both Fricker and Day-Lewis won Oscars, but HUGH O'CONOR and RAY McANALLY are also excellent. O'Conor is Christy as a boy and McAnally is the father who spends too much time at the local bar, but loves the boy. <br /> <br /> Summary: Elmer Bernstein's music is an added plus. Well worth it, but certainly not a movie for everyone.
