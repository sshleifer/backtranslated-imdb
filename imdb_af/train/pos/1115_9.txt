This is one of the unfortunate films that have suffered an even more sad, unfortunate death at the cashier's office. I watched this movie at a local art cinema in revival form, shortly after thinking in mainstream theaters. It definitely deserves a second approach (or even a third). Sandra B. takes it to the extreme by doing a spoken word and recording some well-known songs in this piece. (Her version of Hank William's "I'm so lonely that I can cry" can easily move you to tears). Perhaps the audience will already be ready to take this movie a little more seriously (but not without some well-placed laughs). The movie moves at a fast pace (thanks to some good editing), so some viewers won't find it boring and boring. Perhaps a revival is just below the pipeline.
