Since this film was based on a true story of a woman who had two children and was not very good, it was just scary about how real it really was! The acting is what the film has given that pushes to greatness. <br /> <br /> Diane Keaton depicted the main character, Patsy McCartle, who had two sons she worshiped. Her show is what made the real life story come alive on a television screen. It was very difficult to watch the scenes, as they were as realistic as happening to becoming addicted to drugs. <br /> <br /> Just look at this very loving mother, go from sweet to not care at all, was loud, but so true. I knew people who had withdrawn and it was much like this movie happened, of what I remember. <br /> <br /> I also thought it was very risky that the director made a movie out of this woman. Yet it is done so well. I welcome the director to make this movie. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it to anyone who knows someone who has ever been addicted to drugs or just learning what can happen to you if you become addicted to them.
