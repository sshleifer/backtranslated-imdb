First love is a desperate difficult subject to draw convincingly into the movie: the all-embracing passion involved usually ends as a light imitation or, worse, slightly ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Lifshitz manages all the pitfalls and delivers a moving, sexy, thoroughly outrageous story of love, disaster and possible redemption, touching on some of the deeper themes of human existence. <br /> <br /> The core story is from Mathieu, 18, a lonely, introverted son who meets Cedric, brasher, more outgoing but just as lonely while on vacation with his family. As summer warms up, they fall in love and, when the holiday ends, decide to live together. A year later, the relationship ends in a catastrophe: Cedric cheats on Mathieu, who, betrayed, tries to take his own life. He survived and, to get a perspective on his life, he returned to the coastal village where they first met. This time it flung in the cold of winter. <br /> <br /> If the story is told like this, it would never have its impact: much of it is implied, everything happens non-consecutively. <br /> <br /> The complicated story is essential to get a deeper sense of the passions experienced, using counterpoint and temporal perspective. Fortunately, the three timelines used (the summer of love, the post-suicide psychiatric hospital and the winter of reconstruction) are color codes: hot yellow and oranges for the summer, an almost terrifying cold blue for the hospital tonal and warming browns and blues for the winter sea. <br /> <br /> Both main players have performed excellently, although it is a pleasure to see Stephane Rideau's (Cedric) full capacity (I am more used to seeing him under -Sterreemie Elkaim (Mathieu) must sing for special mention: you can feel its loneliness, then its almost incredible passion, then its character behind a wall of aphasia crumbles. Beautiful handmade gestures get much more than the dialogue ever could. <br /> <br /> The themes that are touched on are almost classic in the French film: our problems to really understand what another is - our difficulty in fully communicating, the moving sand of meaning? The film's title Presque Rien highlights All this and indeed on one of the key scenes in the film To try to understand why Mathieu himself tried to kill, a Cedric psychiatrist asks if he ever cheated on him "Not? And that's not, you know. not, it's not really. "(No, well? Yes, but it wasn't ks) Cedric still loves Mathieu? He brought him to hospital during the suicide attempt (which no one sees) and desperately tries to contact him again when he leaves? but can not understand that he has lost himself forever, for something that looked nothing to him is all for Mathieu. <br /> <br /> While the film is darker than the rather unlucky Pierre and Gilles poster, it would suggest it is not without hope: we see Cedric's slow painful efforts to get in touch with life again , first by a cat he accepts, then by working in a local bar and eventually contacting Pierre, who may be his next love. But here the story ends: A teenage passion, over the year, another beginning. So what was it? Almost nothing? Certainly not when you live it ??
