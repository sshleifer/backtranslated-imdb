First, the release date is 2009, not 2007 for this feature length nature documentary film. It should be more properly referred to as "Earth, 2009". Secondly, allow me to address the complaints of some reviewers who saw the "Planet Earth" TV series of 2006. <br /> <br /> I didn't see this TV show, but here I learned that this movie is full. length version of this 2006 TV series. I judge any movie, on its own merit, not by its source. I judge the results on their own and the results of "Earth, 2009" are indeed excellent. I reject this trivial complaint from some reviewers: it is simply an extended version of the 2006 series "Planet Earth". Approximately? It doesn't really matter. <br /> <br /> As a film paint and one that has seen dozens of nature documentaries in my lifetime, I was amazed and impressed with the "Earth, 2009". This is the debut movie of Disney's new DisneyNature section following the footsteps of Walt Disney's pioneering and Oscar-winning nature documentary films of the 1950s and 1960s. <br /> <br /> Cinemas, movie editing, music score, sound and narration are all excellent. There were a few other nature documentaries that also excelled in these categories. What really sets 'Earth, 2009' apart is its scope. It literally covers the entire planet covering all seven continents. <br /> <br /> After my first viewing it was clear that this documentary had a massive effort and time and talent to create. <br /> <br /> Three production companies had to make this incredible documentary film. <br /> <br /> "Earth, 2009" convincingly tells the stories of four species about their great migrations, as it starts one year over the seasons in January and ends in December, from the North Pole to the South Pole. <br /> <br /> Two special new high-tech cameras have been used for this movie: one camera has a 360-degree computer-controlled motorized rotating lens and the other is an HD camera that has an incredible 1000 frames per second set. This filming technique added drama and beauty to some of the "Earth, 2009" scenes, especially the cheetah hunt and large white sharks jumping out to catch sea lions and an aerial view over the edge of the world's tallest waterfall. There are many beautiful shots in this documentary version. <br /> <br /> In this documentary, there is drama, sadness, humor and great beauty through cinematography, music and narration. Featuring a good music party performed by the world-renowned Berlin Philharmonic, excellent creative and technical cinematography and James Earl Jones narration, I consider "Earth, 2009" to be the greatest documentary film ever made. <br /> <br /> Five years of hard work, patience, talent and commitment paid off very well. This film needs to be watched in all schools around the world. I predict an Oscar for best documentary feature, including awards. Truly, an amazing, astonishing, exciting and beautiful documentary film. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended
