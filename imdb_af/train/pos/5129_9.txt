I can see why this film is Oscar-nominated for Best Live Action Short, as it is masterfully built. Even if you don't particularly like the Blues (although for me it sounds much more like jazz), you can easily appreciate this movie. It's just made very well, but for my life, I can't see why director Gjon Mili should only direct one movie - this one. In other words, the film is nominated and yet the director has not received any kind of career boost. As far as the black artists are concerned, I can understand it, and cause their careers not to move in high gear. Unfortunately, most of the white society has indifference (or worse) to blacks or "kind of music". <br /> <br /> If you watch this movie, if you don't particularly enjoy the previous section, skip the 5: 50 point - where it adds up significantly. When the lady stopped singing and began to improvise the artists, the pace improved.
