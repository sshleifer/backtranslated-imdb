no movie with dennis hopper, gary busey, erika eleniak, tom berenger, dean stockwell, marilu hunter deserves a score below 5 here. It's a poor men's version of movies like 16 blocks or the timeless Midnight run, except the prisoner being transported here is very easy to spot Ms. Eleniak. Tom Berenger plays another gruff, military military type and William Mcnamara plays his newcomer to be dismissed foil well. The plot on the face is absurd because I lost the score that Eleniak had and could have escaped, but it is an entertaining, good movie and there are good cameos from all the actors mentioned above who are filming. It's not really a family movie, as there is a curse and a rare nude scene with eleniak, but it's much better than some of the other guffs that came out of this time.
