I recently watched this 1954 movie with Vincent Price for the first time on Turner Classic Movies. Prize depicts Don Gallico, a wizard / inventor driven to murder when his boss steals several of his magical inventions (and also his wife, depicted in a short role by beautiful Eva Gabor). Although Price is a killer, I actually chose myself, he is a sympathetic character who is saddened by the greedy people around him, who still benefit from him. <br /> <br /> Although this movie is not "I have the" horror "factor of some of his most famous roles (such as my favorite," House of Wax "), it is enough to interest the viewers. love. <br /> <br /> It's a must have for Vincent Price fans.
