This is one of the few comedies I can see again and still laugh out loud. In other places, I read complaints about racism and sexism of sacred, politically correct preaches. There is not here either, unless you define sexism as a woman as a housewife and racism as a family using a colored girl. <br /> <br /> The lines are hilarious and all the leaders have never been better. Melvin Douglas is especially brilliant. <br /> <br /> If you ever thought or tried to build a new home, you would be relieved to know that no matter how busy the process is, no matter how much lame among wolves you may feel, you are not alone!
