This is one of the best military films ever made. And that's good because of the focus on values. It is a great human interest that results in a dedication to honor, loyalty, love and determination. <br /> <br /> Gooding and DeNiro are great in the lead. It's great to see the master's racism evolving towards respect and love through Carl Brashear's determination, drive and yes, honor. The title indicates the source of their relationship. I have never noticed before this last time watching how brilliant Carl Lumbly's portrayal of Carl's father, Mac Brashear, was. In a way, it is a cornerstone of the film because it is Carl's memory of his father who helps him carry him through difficult times. <br /> <br /> I'm selective about which movies I buy. This is one of the rare things I want on my shelf. It will be seen many times in the future, I'm sure.
