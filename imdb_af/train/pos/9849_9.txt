When I saw the trailers, I just saw the movie. And when I had it, I had a feeling that was unsatisfied. It was a good movie, don't get me wrong, but I think the big parts are already in the trailers, if you catch my drive. It went very fast and it rolled, so I was never bored, and I enjoyed seeing it. The humor was absolutely amazing. My first contact with a sloth (or something like that).
