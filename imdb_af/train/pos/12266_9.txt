Imagine that I would miss this great cultural event on Swedish TV last night, and that was just because my friend insisted on keeping the TV on (it makes it easier for her to fall asleep!) (yes I have already seen an ad for this, but of course forget about it and look forward to an 'early night' ...). <br /> <br /> Anyway - it must surely be an unusual idea - to base a film documentary on interviewing audio just over 30 years ago. But with animated and other documentary footage, it is a very good and informative portrait of one of the 20th century's most popular literary artists - Georges Remy aka Hergé. <br /> <br /> I will surely read my Tintin albums with a different eye after seeing this movie, which makes it easier to connect the variations in style as well as content with the different periods in Hergé's life ( and I can tell you that I will get so little that I do not have). Of course, my perception of the albums has changed over the more than 25 years I've already read, as well as my views on which albums are my favorites, but that adds (at least) one more dimension.
