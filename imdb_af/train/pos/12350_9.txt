I'm not sure how I missed this one when it came out for the first time, but I'm happy to finally see it. <br /> <br /> This movie takes place in and around the 19th century red light district of Okabasho, Japan. It tells the story of prostitution, caste systems and women who are strong in a society based on the strength of the samurai code of Japan. <br /> <br /> This is unique Akira Kurosawa! Even though he died before he was able to direct this movie, his adaptation of the script shows. His view of the Japanese world and caste system is well known and sheds light on how these systems interact. The characters may turn around, but the cabinet system remains intact when each character returns to the world to which they belong. The samurai warrior moving in the heart of the sad and loving prostitute goes back to his life while on a different road with a man who is part of her caste system. the lowest of the layers. Many praise the world of the samurai above all others, yet it is the lower caste residents who can support each other and who can love without self-control. The samurai in this movie seems to be the worst, while the classless lovers are honorable. <br /> <br /> The movie deserves a higher rating. This is a story of the survival of women in feudal Japan. During this time frame, men are thought to be the survivors ... the strong, while women are thought to be just bad and bad. This movie highlights the strength of Japanese women and how they did what they needed to survive, and how their power made Japanese culture possible to continue as it did. <br /> <br /> I recommend: "The sea look" to everyone who is a fan of Akira Kurosawa and even if they are not a fan. It's a lovely, quiet and soul-entertaining movie, and one that is commended for any movie collection.
