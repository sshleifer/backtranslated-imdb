First, we know Bruce Willis is a good actor, but if you take most of his movies, you'll see that the characters have these moments where they are the same. His character in this movie is far beyond every one so far ... and counting. The story begins in the (not so far) future where a man is sent to the past to find the source of a virus that swept most of mankind off the ground. The story seems to go to SF, but I think it's closer to a drama because of the slow rhythm of the story. About it. Movies tend to be faster and slower on some points and develop more at the end than the beginning, but if you see this movie, you will be aware of this constant rhythm of story and revealing facts that don't accelerate or slow down . It is the one and the same speed that flows lightly and fairly well. But that doesn't mean that the end won't pull your nerves, because it's pretty good. In terms of direction, it is prefect. Movies as such are easily destroyed by bad direction, but this one has become much better. So, if you're ready to watch a Sci-Fi movie or action, you'll miss it. B There should be more movies like this.
