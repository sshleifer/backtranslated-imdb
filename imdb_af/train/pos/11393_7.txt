Uggh! I really wasn't so impressed with this movie, though I have to admit it was technically well done. It gets a 7 for very high production values, but for entertainment values ​​it is very poor. In fact, I consider this one of the most overestimated films of the 50's. It won the Oscar for Best Picture, but the movie is sometimes boring with dancing and dancing and dancing. This is because, unlike some musicians who have a fair number of songs, along with a strong story and play (such as MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS), this movie is almost all singing and dancing. In fact, this movie has about the longest song and dance number in history and if you're not in it, the movie will drill you quickly. Give me more story! Consequently, with remaining production numbers and a poor story, this film is like a steady diet of meringue - it doesn't last in the long run. <br /> <br /> To think ... this is the movie that has chosen "A Streetcar Named Desire" and "A Place in the Sun" for the best photo! And, to make matters worse, "The African Queen" and "Ace in the Hole" have not even been named in this category! Even more surprising to me is that "Ace in the Hole" for best writing, lost script to this movie - although an American in Paris almost had a story to talk about and mostly driven by dance and song.
