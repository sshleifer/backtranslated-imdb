I regret that the leading remarks about this movie include the words "Clueless and Appalling Nonsense". I think it's a very funny movie and great entertainment. One has to suspend your unbelief that a homosexual man and a lesbian woman may fall in love, have a child, and happy together. But it's always great to see it play in a movie and warm your heart. Is that so impossible? There are many more impeccable events described in other movies. The acting is good, the writing is funny. The only negative remark is that the story could end well when the family departed from its initial home instead of continuing to explore whether the man retained any remaining homosexuality.
