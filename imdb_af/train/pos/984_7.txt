I happened to be on the cable one morning about the "bait" just as it started and thought, "Eh, why not?" I'm glad I gave it a chance. <br /> <br /> "Bait" is not perfect. It suffers from unnecessary flashing direction and occasional stupidity. But overall, this movie worked. All the elements sounded right, and they pulled off what could otherwise have been a pretty ugly movie. <br /> <br /> Most of this I think is due to Jamie Foxx. I don't know who Foxx was looking at, but whoever it was, this movie had a great favor. Credible and incredibly nice, Foxx slips through the movie, smooth as butter and louder than hell. You can say he works on instinct, and instinct does not fall. <br /> <br /> The plot, while unimportant, actually works well, and there is even a character bow through which Foxx's character as a person grows. Once again they could have slipped without any of these, but it just makes things much better. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised at the low rating for this. Maybe I just caught this move the right night, or vice versa, but I'll give it a 7/10. Bravo, Mssr. Foxx.
