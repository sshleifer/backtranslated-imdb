Ralph and Mumford, misfits in their own country, are remembered to realize the pawns of Synanomess Botch. Twice at a time is the story of them, the characters they meet, and their struggle to fix things. With a surprisingly impressive soundtrack and wonderful voice acting by some of the best in the business, this horrible movie hits the point. <br /> <br /> While the animation process is similar to that of the "South Park" style, it is much smoother and much more three-dimensional. If I didn't know the animation was this style, I would swear it was traditional pen and ink. If you can watch this movie in Dolby Surround or THX, PLEASE PLEASE! You won't miss anything if you don't, but if you do, you'll get a lot more from the experience!
