Japan 1918. The story of 16-year-old Ryu begins with the death of her father. As later announced, both parents died of tuberculosis. In this desperate situation, Ryus aunt arranged a marriage with a Japanese man in Hawai, who only knew about his photo. Upon her arrival in Hawai ryu, she discovered that her new husband is much older than in the photo, and that he lives in a humble environment next to a sugar cane plantation. Ryu did not get used to the hard work on the plantation and was presumably running away in despair over her situation in her new home. She soon discovered that she was going nowhere. The friendship with Cana, a female co-worker, gives her new hope and strength. This photo was based on actual events between 1907 and the 1920s, when thousands of Asian women were married to men in America, who only knew them from their photo. This not very well-known picture is well written and performed. The location is breathtaking. This movie also features Mifune Toshiro in its very last screen appearance as a Benshi (narrator of silent movies). This film gives some insight into Japanese culture here and across the sea. A must see!
