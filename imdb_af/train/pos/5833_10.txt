I can't believe people are looking for a plot in this movie. It's Laural and Hardy. Relieve already. These two were a riot. Their comic genius is as funny today as it was 70 years ago. Not a dirty word from the mouth and they could keep audiences in stitches. Their comedy is not sophisticated by any stretch. If a cub can't grab you, there's no reason to watch any of the things these guys have done. It was a simpler time, and people laughed at things that were funny without a plot. I think it takes a simple thought to enjoy these things, so I qualify. Two man comedy teams do not calculate, we are just too sophisticated ... Are we not happy?
