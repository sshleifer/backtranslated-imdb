The 14-year-old in me is very fortunate that they can now make really good-looking movies, and that they are all the rage, with lots of cash at the checkout with Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter and The Chronicles of Narnia. This year a few more (and already seen) will be seen, especially the Golden Compass, which is the most exciting trailer I've seen this year. Stardust, based on a novel by Neil Gaiman, appeared in the theaters this week with a little more than a look. I didn't see any previews, just a few ads. The critical reaction is kind of bladder. I wouldn't even have seen it, or I shouldn't wait for a friend to see the Bourne Ultimatum, and that nothing else would have opened this weekend. Well, if you forgive the horrible pun, the stars have to be straight, because I saw Stardust, and I loved it. It's not a big movie like Lord of the Rings. The plot line is your basic fantasy quest (the hero sets out to look at a fallen star) filled with obstacles. But within the basic outline, the story is lively and imaginative. It's fun to have a lot of fun and a beautiful little romance. And it succeeds. There were many big movies this summer, but none of them was as fun as this one. There is a lot going on, but the story is well told and is almost completely coherent. This is not a masterpiece, but it can certainly have the same kind of ground as something like The Princess Bride (although I don't like it much like the previous movie). It's great fun to be here if you're a fan of the genre.
