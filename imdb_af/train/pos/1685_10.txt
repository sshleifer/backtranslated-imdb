For the first time, this film was seen in about 1990, and died completely laughing. It has become a cult lover with my circle of friends, and we'll get it to the drop of a hat ("I'll go home in a bag!"). Needless to say, the humor is still there, 15 years later. It has become a tradition on Halloween to expose many of my new friends to this movie (good thing you can still buy from Ebay!) I found that Halloween candy was much better planted with your tongue, firmly in your cheek . This movie offers it all-pados, tensions, unanswered love, nobility and the list goes on. Royal Dano offers a wonderful warm performance as Old Man Wrenchmuller. I remember seeing him in "The 7 Faces of Dr. Lao" as a bad guy who met a bad end. Here you really feel from the beginning to the old man. <br /> <br /> If you are not careful, you will miss some of the levels of humor in this movie. The creators in many ways have become really subtle, with awkward comments, small subtle costumes at other sci-fi movies, and even a scene torn from the pages of Wile E. Coyote! <br /> <br /> Also don't spend many thought processes trying to analyze a movie, people - it's a fun rate without the need to nitpicking, and shouldn't be offensive to anyone (well, maybe stupid people, but they will not know they are mocked.). <br /> <br /> Now, if you excuse me, I'm going to get a Zag utility bar. <br /> <br /> -Ramsay "RC" Cowlishaw, Karaoke DJ / entertainer
