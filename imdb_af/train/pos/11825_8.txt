Don't look here for an over-developed plot line. Just sit back with some popcorn and enjoy it. A gallery of stars appears as the classic cartoon character's villains in this lively action comedy. It features incredible make-up and set design, and doesn't mean Beatty's, Madonna and Pacino's knockout achievements. Great fun for kids and adults. <br /> <br /> *** from ****
