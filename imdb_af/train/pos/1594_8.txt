What I like about you is one of the series you should see, but you are not sure you will see, the start is cool and it just sucks you for fun in the series, the second part I make 2-3 which is more outdated. , they come and go in whatever you want. What happens with many series is that they don't end up with anything special, because the second part of the series is always in the drain, this one has also done a bit. The third part is the one that spoils and destroys the whole series, usually, but it is not, this end is perfect for the series, it fits perfectly, actually I was pretty angry about all these guys in Val's life. Actually, I finally wanted to end up with Jeff, but later it changed to prefer to take it after about 3 seasons without him in the series and that was the biggest surprise and also what the series went up. <br /> <br /> watch it many times, the series is actually very cool, just don't expect the second part to be as good, but the third does what it takes and made the series one that the whole thing was worth it. I am happy to say I was happy and happy about the series and now I will be going to see two guys a girl and a pizza place, if I have seen the whole series, I'll be back.
