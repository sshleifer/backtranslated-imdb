Without a doubt, this film should be one of the greatest ... in the film history. I watched it too much to remember, and every time it's like I see it for the first time. <br /> <br /> Where does one start? <br /> <br /> Meena Kumari's central achievement is undoubtedly one of the best of her career, followed by Sahib Bibi aur Ghulam and Phool aur Pathar. Every move and nuance of her performance makes any other Bollywood heroine turn out to be meaningful. Her masterful interpretation of Kathak, along with her grace, tragic vulnerability and poetic rendering of Urdhu, is like nothing ever seen on the bollywood screen. <br /> <br /> Pakeezah may be the most stylized interpretation of the human condition; the photography, beautiful cinematography and mise and scene are so accused of symbolism and meaning that the viewer is breathless. <br /> <br /> Naushads music is unbeatable, its knowledge of the music of the court songs gharanas is incredible, and the way in which it interprets the narrative with dark atmospheric motifs and overwhelmingly romantic melodies is indeed remarkable. <br /> <br /> My only advice to anyone who seriously enjoys the spectacle of the entire cinema should see this epic mediation on life and art.
