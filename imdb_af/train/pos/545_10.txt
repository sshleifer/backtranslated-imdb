Sequels hardly ever live to the original. It certainly seems true in this case. However, if you're a big fan of the original, it definitely gives a watch. Although the work of the camera is missing, Brian Krause's character is annoying, and the plot is clickable, it's much more beautiful than the first and that's what I am entertaining about it. <br /> <br /> Don't see this movie expecting the same performance as the first movie. Frankly, it's a little different. Instead of sitting in his cabin screens, Stanley in Hollywood is busy directing his dream project, Cabin by the Lake. This movie has a lot of other feelings, but it is still good to see Stanley back in action. <br /> <br /> I give it a 6 out of 10.
