Dream Quest was a surprisingly good movie. There were some noticeable goofs, but it can be expected in a movie like this that has been made so short. I didn't feel the urge to move forward quickly during the movie, and I really found it entertaining. It sometimes becomes silly, but overall I recommend it. They probably used all the glitter in nearby stores, and some of the costume designs were pretty good.
