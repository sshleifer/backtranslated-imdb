How the Grinch Stolen Christmas immediately stole my heart and almost became my first favorite movie. Now, eight views later, it still has the same impact on me as it did the first time I saw it. <br /> <br /> Writers, Jeffery Price & Peter S. Seaman of Who Framed Roger Rabbit fame do a fantastic job adjusting the story of The Grinch to the screen. Ron Howard's direction has brought the story to life, and Jim Carrey's typically energetic performance as The Grinch steals the show. <br /> <br /> Some opponents of the movie claim that it is not true to the spirit or principles of the original story. After reading the original story, I have to say I can't agree. The movie makes the same point about Christmas and its true meaning as the original story. Indeed, it increases the impact of the story by making it more personal by showing us how and why The Grinch became what he was. <br /> <br /> * MILD SPOILERS * (They probably won't ruin the movie for you ... but if you haven't seen it yet and you're one of those who don't want to know a story until You've seen it, you need to overshoot the following two paragraphs. I think all of us were at one time or another the unpopular one in the school that was always picked up. I know I was ... and therefore I personally had so much sympathy for The Grinch and what he went through. <br /> <br /> And Cindy Lou Who is naive idealism and believes no one can be bad, was heartbreaking. When everyone else turned their fear and ignorance on The Grinch, Cindy Lou was determined to be his friend. If everyone can have such an attitude. <br /> <br /> In fact, I think the only thing that might make the movie a little better would be to show the mature humor and content further. It's been pretty limited, but any of these adult humor (like when the Grinch's first nose crashed into Martha May Whovier's fission) does not fit into such a story. <br /> <br /> This is great way to be a Christmas classic, with a richly earned place next to the book and the Chuck Jones cartoon as a must-see of every Christmas season.
