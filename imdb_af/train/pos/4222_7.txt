I like this episode quite a bit, Ruth Gordon is good if not a little hammy as she always was. As already mentioned, the music is very good and it has a mood that does not exist in all episodes. <br /> <br /> But one big plot hole exists, so wide you can drive a truck trucks. This. It is determined that the light does not work in the safe. Don't you think the very intelligent Columbo or the rest of the police would like to think the light bulb is working? You would think in a short short sequence that they would have screwed the bulb and found the note. Admittedly, this is TV-wodunit fiction, and several holes will always be found, but it seems very scary. <br /> <br /> It doesn't really matter to Columbo to be the hidden genius if the light doesn't work but the testimony of the "deathbed" goes biased, apparently for days.
