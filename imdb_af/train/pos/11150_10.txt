I sat down to watch Midnight Cowboy and think it would be another over 60s / 70s movie. Some of my favorite movies come from the 70s, in the same level as 'Midnight Cowboy' ("Taxi Driver", "Mean Streets", "Panic in Needle Park", etc.), but there are many, many overstated Wel , it got good reputation among critics because they were pioneers. Unfortunately, the vast majority of them do not keep up well. So I feel like this about "Easy Rider." (Although it's also one of my favorites.) <br /> <br /> So, I didn't expect much from Midnight Cowboy, but got back a lot. It's a pleasant story, well made and well-versed in some of the best performances of all time. Dustin Hoffman, as Enrico "Ratso" Rizzo, gives one of his best - sometimes funny (he sounds like a cartoon character when talking - perhaps because of the Lenny / Simpsons connection), but Hoffman is quite convincing. . Half of the film's budget went to his payroll, as he just became a major star in Hollywood. Opposite him is the second fair Jon Voight as Joe Buck, the "cowboy" traveling north to the Big Apple in the hope of becoming a male prostitute. Soon his naive ways will be in trouble, and he links with a cripple scam artist called "Ratso" - offering to become Joe's manager for a certain percentage of profits. <br /> <br /> The movie is quite long at two o'clock, but never really looks long. Some movies may tend to drag, especially some of the movies made in the 70s, because (as called "Easy Riders, Raging Bulls", the directors were the stars of the movies in the 1970s and they sometimes a little too saturated with their material, too long investigating characters / scenes / etc. It's not important. Just about the only scene I felt was a bit too long and unnecessarily was the drug party. It looks like the movie looks very outdated (similar to the drug odyssey in "Easy Rider") and really stiffens it because it's not needed. /> <br /> Unlike this, Midnight Cowboy is an almost flawless movie. I was pleasantly surprised. It has its faults (flashbacks are a bit tough and never used so well). And some of the screens are a bit uncomfortable (like the gay movie movie sequence), but if you can handle its contents "Midnight Cowboy" is a really big movie, an uncompromising exploration of street life in late -60's / early 70's. It is a depressing film, yes, and according to today's standards, a bit outdated and hard on the liberal perspective of "life is terrible, etc." ... but I still love it and especially the utmost gripping end will stay with me for a long, long time. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended. One of the best films of the 70's. (Technically released in late 1969, I still categorize it as a 1970s film. It also won the Best Picture Oscar, which was the first and only X-rated movie to do. R appeal.) <br /> <br /> 4.5 / 5
