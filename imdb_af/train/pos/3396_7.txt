Very interesting. The big twist was not as big a shock as they might have hoped and it was very dated, but it made my mind work. It really made me think of a world without vegetation or livestock and appreciated me in the world where I live in much more. Charlton Heston does a great job, just like all the supporting characters, and it was a very realistic movie that was surprising. It sometimes deviated, and many of the settings and backgrounds needed more explanation, but it was still a surprisingly good and intelligent movie. The biggest mistake I could find was that I didn't want the movie to end when it did. I would like to see what happened next. <br /> <br /> 7/10
