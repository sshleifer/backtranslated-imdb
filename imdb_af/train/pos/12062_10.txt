This movie has scared me since the first day I saw it. <br /> <br /> My mother watched it when it was back on the telly in '92. I remember waking up in the middle of the night through her tears, while my father helped her on the stairs. <br /> <br /> She said something like "Don't let her get me" or something. I asked what made her so upset and she told me she had looked at the woman in black. <br /> <br /> Of course I had to see it and even though I was only eleven she let me go. It frightened me. I've been immune to horror movies since I watched it!
