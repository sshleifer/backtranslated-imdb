The story of Cinderella is one of my favorites of Charles Perrault, with Sleeping Beauty made in a Disney movie in 1959. This movie is a lovely, enchanting Disney masterpiece. <br /> <br /> The movie has a good soundtrack; it's one I love in a movie, is a very good soundtrack, and I also love the songs; My favorite song is the romantic "So This is Love." I also love the mice of the movie, they are cute. My favorite scene is the scene after the story, the little ones trying to wake Cinderella in the morning; I also love it when Cinderella's animal friends (the mice and birds) fix Cinderella's birth mother's dress so she can go to the ball ... until Drizella & Anastasia put it on the bones!
