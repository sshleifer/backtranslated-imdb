Star Wars: Episode 4. <br /> <br /> The best Star Wars ever. It's the first movie I've ever been to, winning the bad guys and it's a very good ending. It really made me wait for the next star wars, because just so things come together in this movie that you just found out in the last one. with all the movies I always get the feeling that it can't be, but not the one. and I will never forget the part, were the roads that are Luke. He is his father. Too cool. I also love the Bob feat figure, and I'm a background player. If you've never seen a Star Wars movie, go to this one. This is the best. <br /> <br /> Thank you Lucas
