As I noticed with many IMDb remarks, some reviewers seem to be demanding that every movie they see smugly have intelligent plots that converge on their own. I'm not one of those people. If I watch an action movie, I want to see explosions, gun and heroism. When I watch a comedy, I want tears in my eyes. You get the idea. So, to watch a horror movie, I want to be mainly scared. The resentment is a very scary movie, in both it's well-executed 'jumping' scenes, and it's creepy images. I've been a horror movie fan for years, and I'm talking about masters like Dario Argento, rather than directors of some of the treadmill teenage horror movies being pulled out today. If you want to be scared look at this movie. Away scarier than the original Japanese 'Ring' (which I also think is a good movie).
