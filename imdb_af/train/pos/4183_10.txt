I saw this movie back a long time, but it was unbelievable and until now it has never surprised me. <br /> <br /> A wonderful movie describing a group of Australian commandos that some of them are trying to sink has made Japanese ships in the port of Singapore during World War II. <br /> <br /> These commandos are trapped in ordinary clothes and are considered spies by Japanese exiles. But there is something that hasn't been explored much in any Hollywood WW2 movie I've seen. <br /> <br /> A close and friendly bond develops between the prisoners and the prisoners. They began to respect each other, while the captain of the captured Australian soldiers became the best friends with a senior Japanese jailer. It's the most wonderful part of the whole movie and it really touches your heart. <br /> <br /> Soon, one day as the two friends talk, the Aussie captain learns that other prisoners are being tried and executed for the sinking of the Japanese ships in the Singapore port. <br /> <br /> He mentions that it was his team and not other people who sank the ships to his Japanese friend. He must remain silent because it can lead to his entire group being executed. However, the captain remains determined to confess it to the Japanese authorities. <br /> <br /> Finally, the Japanese authorities condemn them to death in the most respectful way according to their rules. It is the highest honor the prisoner warriors in Japan have given. <br /> <br /> This is the most incredible part of the movie where Aussie soldiers are waiting for their impending death and the tense indecision of the friendly Japanese guard who is not ready to believe why she has Aussie friend confess guilty. <br /> <br /> I won't give up the end here. But it is more gripping than you can even imagine and can easily move one to tears. <br /> All in all, an excellent underestimated movie that may not have received the recognition it deserves internationally. Get one copy today and be hypnotized.
