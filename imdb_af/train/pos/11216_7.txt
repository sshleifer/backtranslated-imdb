The story is extremely unique. It's about these 2 pilots that save the earth from strange creatures, but they need to use a special speed that matures everything around them. The whole series is about the pilots who handle the loss of time, friends and mentors. . <br /> <br /> The end could have been fantastic. It started ending up with a total sign and left a real point, but ended up on a super happy Disney note and irritated me greatly. <br /> <The animation is decent for 89, but can't be compared today. I also heard a lot about the cheesiness of the nudity. I actually found it somewhat decent. The nudity is mostly justified except in episode 2 where there was an excess. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's worth a look, but the end is like being a classic.
