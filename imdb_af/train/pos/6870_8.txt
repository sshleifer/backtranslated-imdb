From start to finish I really walked hard in the whole movie. It's amazing that "The Groove Tube" may be the grandfather, but the best of all comic skit movies. This is the way I enjoy watching television without being bored on the channels just to suffer from insomnia! For 73 minutes, the strange, strange humor never stops! Just imagine how all this nonsense laughs can help you enjoy life easier! It's way, WAY better than Comedy Central or any leading time show! Do yourself a favor and research all the soft, lamb romantic comedy films in the bin! Better yet, tell your box office manager, you want "The Groove Tube" back on the big screen!
