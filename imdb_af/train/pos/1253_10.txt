This benevolent and meticulously researched documentary sketched the frightening case of Chagos Islanders, shown between 1969 and 1971, was violently deported by the British and American governments from their homeland. Anglo-American policy makers have decided to do so because of their perception that the islands will be strategically essential bases for controlling the Indian Ocean by air and naval projection. At a time during the Cold War, when most of the newly independent post-colonial states moved away from the western orbit, it seems that British and American officials had rather felt that islanders could decide the fate of the islands, not a viable option. Instead, they chose to bring about the great violent removal of the indigenous people. The film shows that there was no provision for the islanders during its ejection, and that the displaced Chagossian community of the coastal hole in Mauritius fell for three decades of hardship, suffered significantly accelerated death rates. <br /> <br /> Over the course of more than three decades, however, over the past few months (and years), the release of many completely damning newspapers from Britain's Public Record Office has been suspected. these newspapers were not supposed to ever be known). The resulting legal appeals by the Chagossian community in exile have seen British courts consistently in favor of the islanders and against the British state. As such, the astonishing and disturbing conclusions drawn in the film can only be reasonably seen as evidence. However, the governments of Britain and the United States have so far not committed themselves to returning to the islands what the courts have definitively concluded, the rightful residents. This is a very valuable movie for everyone to watch, but it is an important one for British and Americans to watch. To be silent in the light of these facts is to be complicit in a thoroughly ugly crime.
