I saw it when I was 17 and didn't see it. The 'CBS Late Movie' showed it on a regular basis at one point. I remember how sad and upset it was, it really made me sick to my stomach. Effects were then not what they are today, yet they have left the feeling of being alone in the Amazon after losing both parents and looking very well. I remember the mistakes and virgins most, so realistically they were, eating her flesh. It is a dark film that was controversial at the time, although it was probably heavily modified for TV. I wish I remember more details, and if I ever get the chance to see it again, I can comment more. I've been searching for years afterwards. I believe it might be shown on another CBS title. I have no idea if it's ever been released on video.
