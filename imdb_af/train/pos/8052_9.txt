This movie is not a kung fu movie. It's a comedy about kung fu. And if Sammo Hung, before making this film, didn't have time to watch movies by the great French comic film maker Jaques Tati (eg Veral Jour de FÃªte), he is definitely on the same wavelength. <br /> <br /> Personally, I think Tati's movies are hilarious; but they are not all tastes. Some told me that they disregarded his work. I've never figured out why, but I think it's because the character Tati usually plays is so dead, so untouched by the events around him (which he usually causes) that many miss the more subtle comics that happen to him. <br /> <br /> In any case, Tati's headshot - or at least his best-known - is taking a pretentious upright petite bourgeoisie with the 19th century sensibility and abandoning France in the 20th century where he " To confront a society This is largely determined by the gradual aging of that sensitivity. He usually has serious problems with small things like record players or radios. He's a danger in a car, but the world is not safer if he drives a bike. But by all this he never lost his aplomb, which is derived from his inner recognition that the nineteenth century was more interesting than the 20th overall. <br /> <br /> Likewise, the character Sammo Hung himself plays, a country boy comes to the big city of Hong Kong, totally convinced that what makes the city interesting is that Bruce Lee Kung Fu films made has. This makes him struggle in small ways, as he gets to know in a small town, which will never be noticed in a small town, but which is considered inappropriate in a big city - as the moment he blowing in the street, a policeman stopping him, just to discover that Hung was just pushing water out of his shirt, soaked in a casual dip in the bay. What is interesting about this gag is why it understands Hung, not what the cop's fuss is about - in a village, as long as no one is watching, if you have to go, you have to go. In other words, Hung is not really urinating in the street - but he will definitely - and what is the problem officer? Of course, Hung's obsession with Bruce Lee also gets into big trouble. He knocks a gang of villains who have refused to pay his restaurant owner. Of course, in a Bruce Lee movie, the thugs would be considered trounced, and they would have learned their lesson. But in Hung's Hong Kong reality is unhappy and the thugs come back when he is not there to marry his uncle. <br /> <br /> Of course, finally, Hung ends, just as Tati always did. Characters like this should always (at least in the comedy) triumph because they are completely innocent, and as such, in spite of their comical missteps and misunderstandings, they really represent the best in the people we admire and want. We don't really want to be Bruce Lee (who must experience the loss of all his friends before he gets the bad guy), we want our own innocence to have a world where Lee's heroics are. possible. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the world only exists on film. <br /> <br /> "Oh, but what if ...?" - And in that question we find Sammo Hung at his comic best.
