Bette Davis turns in a cold amusing performance like Mildred Rogers in this 1934 movie. The movie now looks quite dated in 2003. It is undoubtedly worth watching for movie buffers and Bette Davis fans, but may not have so much appeal today for the average movie beater. It was amazing to me to see how young I was. Davis in this move seems. The actors turn into performances that are basically sound and the story is meaningful and interesting. Leslie Howard is well-cast as Philip Carey, the club's medical student. This is a movie with a strong message about who we choose to love and why. But "From Human Bondage" didn't have my spiritual or emotional influence on me. I got a little indifferent and got rid of the movie after I watched it. I have an intuition that it can be the response that the director goes. You are the judge! <br /> <br />
