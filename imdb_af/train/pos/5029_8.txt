In this movie I might have chopped a bit through the hack-and-slash movies on the screen nowadays. Boy, was I surprised. This little treasure was pleasant with a gloomy, dark atmosphere. Even more surprising was the very limited amount of blood actually shown. As with most good movies, this one leaves for the imagination, and Bill Paxton has done a great job of directing. Screens shot inside the car are well done and after the episode "Anatomy of a scene" at the end of the videotape, it was good to see some of the subtle, but wonderful things I noticed, was deliberate and not just an "oh, it looks good, keep it" type of direction. It's a moody movie, full of fury. Yet, for the dark subject, much of it is filmed in the daylight, even of the more disturbing scenes. The acting is exceptional (Okay, I've always been a Power Booth fan), and never go over the top. Au Contraire, it is very muted, which works very well for this type of film. If there is one area where this movie is missing, it is in the end, which looks just a bit, but still works on a simpler level without destroying the mood or the message of the movie. What is the message? This is something every individual decides for himself. Overall, on the 1-10 scale, this movie counts an 8 for those who love the southern Gothic genre (ie "Body Heat" or "Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil") and about 5 for those who don't t.
