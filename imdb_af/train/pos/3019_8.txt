To start with, I loved g√∂ta channel 1, it had many classic jokes, including the unfortunate man in the canoe who always seems to be in the wrong place, he is still the same man on the channel 2 movie, but in my opinion the show is not as funny as it was in the first movie, and you do not see much at all. One thing that makes me bad about this movie is choosing boats. In this movie there are just racing boats, they are probably fast, but it doesn't make waves like the big roof houses used in the first movie. those better and these new boats make one of the last scenes ridiculous when the man in the canoe suddenly jumps out to evade the "big waves" of those little speedy boats. Really a minus. You have to accept that we no longer live in the same Sweden as in 1974. This movie also contains a little more violence than the first one. Although the movie was all good. I just concentrated on being disappointed, but the rest of the movie was up to my expectations, so go! It's worth the money.
