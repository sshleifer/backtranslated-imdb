How can you go wrong with the wonderful Ramones? What a crime two of them have already died. It reminds me of Dennis Leary joking about the great musicians who die in kitchen fires, while useless people live forever. I paraphrase here, but you get the idea. <br /> <br /> ROCK AND ROLL HIGH SCHOOL tells the story of a group of children with indifference, fighting against their oppressive high school administration. It is extremely silly, but there is optimism about what is refreshing (even if they blow up the building). Who knew this would be a real concern for students around the world? ROCK AND ROLL HIGH SCHOOL is a time capsule of an era when people still believe that music matters and that it can make a difference to the larger society. It's full of kids who know that authority doesn't have the right answers. Rather and Roll is the only thing they can trust. <br /> <br /> But most importantly, it's pure exploitation. <br /> <br /> Take nothing seriously. Just go in and enjoy a good time. If it wasn't what high school life was in the seventies, then it had to be.
