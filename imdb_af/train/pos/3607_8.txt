So I sat on the digital subscriber channels a few years ago and thought I'd watch "Girlfight" for half an hour waiting for "Hart's War" to start. With a title like I figured out, it was a bit of exploitation 'B' movie about inner girl gangs. <br /> <br /> To my surprise it was not at all about. Instead, it's a well-maintained, well-written story about a young woman who almost accidentally gets into the box of women. She is responsible for taking her younger brother to his training sessions and getting interest while taking his attacks into account. As he doesn't really want to be a boxer (only on the footsteps of his father), she convinces his coach to take her in his place. <br /> <br /> The story unfolds in an intelligent and credible way as she goes through several trials on her quest. To begin, her brother's coach doesn't want to accept a female boxer. After being reluctantly done, there is the problem of making matches for her. Then the confrontation with her dad when he finds out what's going on. Yes, developed a love interest, but it serves to improve the plot. It is about more interesting interpersonal responses with its own conflict-related effects. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is a good little sleep movie that looks like little of an audience. A few times later when I saw the much advertised and award-winning Million Dollar Baby, I thought "wait a minute, it looks kind of familiar". Needless to say, I didn't watch the night's Heart's War.
