The most satisfying element about "Dan in Real Life" is that the relationship between Dan (Steve Carell) and Marie (Juliette Binoche) is sensible and beautifully realistic. The decisive Oscar winner Juliette Binoche as Dan's love interest was an excellent decision; She is extremely talented, intelligent, of course attractive and thankful, appropriately outdated for sharing! If this movie was made with Jessica Alba or Scarlett Johansson, it would have been a disaster. <br /> <br /> Another wonderful aspect of Dan in Real Life is that it is a perfect movie for adults interested in an adult comedy leaving the three pillars of the "frat pack" formula: stupid chicks, chauvinist guys and messy jokes. "Then in real life" is witty and fun, intelligent laughing. While other comedies incorporate or are almost entirely based on jokes that scare the audience, the jokes of "Dan in Real Life" are more natural and clever, and include some thoughts of the audience. <br /> <br /> My only problem with "Dan in Real Life" is that the rebellious, mediocre daughter is being shamed by actress Brittany Robertson. It's hard to tell if it was a personal choice of her or a choice by the director. However, her character is unrealistic and annoying. But it's just a small mistake in the movie, and doesn't take away the story as a whole. <br /> All in all, "Dan in Real Life" is a great movie, a fantastic escape from the dismissal of offensive and dumbed-down comedies. The quality of writing, directing, acting and (especially) cinematography is excellent. It's just a beautiful, light-hearted comedy.
