I bought the DVD series on a recommendation from Amazon.com based on my other interests. They hit the nail with the one on the head. I remember watching the show when it was on TV, but I always wondered what had happened. Ten years later, it's like watching it again for the first time. Lucas Black as Caleb Temple and Gary Cole as Sheriff Lucas Buck are great together, although they are a bit rival. Almost well represented (Caleb) and angry (Sherriff Lucas Buck). I never really understood what Lucas was supposed to be, but let it be enough to say he has given certain special powers that I don't believe, through something Holy. He can make phones ring, write or even change a person's emotions. Nevertheless, there are a few episodes where he actually becomes the good guy, in spite of that. All in all, it's an excellent series that like many others I can think of (IE Point Pleasant, Threshold, Nowhere Man and SeaQuest DSV just to name a few) has been canceled before their time. The Steven King's Dead Zone (Sunday's US Network) seems to be the only thing in this genre that looks like it. There is just nothing fit to watch more on TV. This is because anything that deals with Christianity and Satan is considered offensive and must be taken from TV immediately. In the meantime, I will only buy DVD sets and watch programs that still have to be on TV, but TV messages have been turned on by religious enthusiasts, so our "quality" programs like Family Guy and American Dad and The Simpsons bunch of shit it is).
