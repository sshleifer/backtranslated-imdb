The movie is absolutely stupid. <br /> <br /> But do you expect a high-tech intellectual movie based on a comic called Slam Dunk? Really? Jay Chou's play is not exactly the most moving thing I have ever seen, but I really enjoyed the movie. Was it somewhere near the level of wonder that someone like Jet Li or Stephen Chow can produce? No not really. Was it really entertaining if you just took it on surface value? Absolutely. It's a movie about some Chinese candy idols and musicians who can play basketball at an unreal level of expertise. There is an evil Triad-style man and a sly rogue man who engages Jay Chou in all these things. A love interest. It's a formula, but it's really unbelievable for a while. Come on. This is called Kung Fu Dunk. What do you really think you've reported? Do yourself a favor when you see it - I got myself a copy of Engrish subtitles that show the movie almost incomprehensible conversations, but we got a big laugh from it. They look extremely fit on Jerusalem and the numbers 1, 10. I laughed, I was crying, I was tossing. I'll see it again. <br /> <br /> Especially for that fight in the bar. Well choreographed and well shot. I especially enjoy the plexiglass light pool table. I'd like to play on one of the games. <br /> <br /> Lubricate enough for me, but I'm digging at the trash.
