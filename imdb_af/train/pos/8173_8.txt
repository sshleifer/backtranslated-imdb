The sparkle of this movie is that even a competent dentist is frightening. This is one of man's primary fears. This movie is the nightmare image that every child has to go through the waiting room. Corbin Bernsen gives a surprisingly non-shiny performance as a foolish dentist I think people are trying to kill, but he only works on their teeth so it doesn't really work out. In a particularly gory scene, our so-actor Earl Boen finds his teeth completely destroyed with drills and what not, what I think is the absolute worst thing you can do if you're a killer dentist. It's a typical Brian Yuzna situation, not well written, but there are gore. The plot is clumsy and sometimes looks in place, but hey, it's a killer dentist movie, we all thought about it, but they did it first.
