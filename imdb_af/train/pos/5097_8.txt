It's a very rare movie and probably the least known of Shirley Temple, as it's not on any of her collections. The reason is probably because it doesn't have a happy ending, unlike all her other movies. It is also not a musical, although she does not call a song "The world owes me a life. The film was made in 1934 and originally in black and white, the version I have is in color and on VHS, I would say they have a good work if the color looks realistic, other than I would say the colored films of Laurel And Hardy that's terrible. The movie is good for its age and the story is not dated at all. I'm surprised no one tried to do a remake. At times the movie is a bit too talky as some of the scenes with Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard look really pulled out, in some scenes they seem fifteen minutes to tell them in five could have said. Although do not dispose of this because this film does have very good moments in it, especially when {Jerry} Ga rides Cooper steals a necklace and puts it in Shirley's teddy bear. The tension and slowness of his actions, while his daughter is singing to an audience in another room, is very well-directed. Gary and Caroles edgy facial expressions when examined, are also very good. In all this is a good movie from the early 30's, accepting it for his age.
