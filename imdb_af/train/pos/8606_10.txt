It seems there is no middle ground on this movie! Most of them take place in a dream and like most dreams it is often foolish and illogical. It is also a beautiful production with some good songs and fine performances, especially by our angel. <br /> <br /> Jeanette's death squad, unaware of insults and several other faux suits to the dream reception, are hilarious and her bitter Binnie Barnes is a surprise and a pleasure. At one point she gets a slice from Carmen, sings through Faust's final trio (a female, for a strange reason), then "Aloha Oe" on the beach! <br /> <br /> It's a surreal comedy - great fun when you get in the groove.
