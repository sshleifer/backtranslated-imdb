This movie is one of the funniest, saddest and most accurate portrayals of the mentality that the Balkans have portrayed 45 years afterwards. All the usual characters and conflicts are presented with such anger, sadness and love, combined that it is impossible to decide whether to cry or laugh the more appropriate answer would be. However, the accuracy of the depiction and timeless nature of the types makes it a good movie to see if a little of what Yugoslavia has been driving to his madness wants to understand. In fact, no diplomat dealing with the region should try something until they have seen this movie, and its twins, * Maratonci trce pocasni krug. * Did I mention it's one of the funniest movies I've ever seen?
