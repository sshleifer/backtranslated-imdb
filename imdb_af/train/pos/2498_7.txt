I caught it in the 'Danger After Dark' box, and just watched it because I was interested in performing Hyde and Gackt. I expected a horizontal film that was a great gore festival and with a very bad dialogue. This is exactly what it would have been if it were made in America. Instead, I feared by the good development of the characters, and the way Sho (Gackt) developed through the film as a person. The acting skills of both stars were surprisingly good as they were not professional actors, and the director did a wonderful job with it and put it in the future, less the flying cars and holographic billboards. <br /> <br /> On a side note, Taro Yamamoto's performance was very surprising. The only other movie I saw him is Battle Royale, where he plays Shogo Kawada, and in this movie it is exactly the opposite of Shogo. Toshi is bright, exuberant and hyper, and serves as a kind of comic relief with its antics. Shogo was the big tough man on the island who killed without thinking about it. So be aware of his performance. If you are familiar with Battle Royale, you will be very surprised. <br /> <br /> But don't be thrown out of the box by the summary. because it's not really a vampire movie. It's just a movie with a vampire in it. The fact that Hyde's character is a vampire is almost a background fact with what really goes on, and you will love the last scene. This is a very moving picture on some points, photography is really well done. This is definitely something to pick up on Blockbuster next time.
