Paul Lukas plays a Russian intellectual who lives his life as a waiter <br /> <br /> "Grand Slam," directed by William Dieterle (1933). It is a surprisingly funny satire of building up celebrity personality. The waiter and the Russian restaurant's day-maid girl, played by Loretta Young, become America's love and bridle partners who have no backlash. With the help of publicity and ghostwriter 'Speed' McCann (The Wonderful Dead Man Frank McHugh), they become the walking ads <br /> <br /> for the "Stanislavsky system", a "system" that feels one of them </ br> <br /> (Since tenders are not rational, there is no basis for accusations about their stupidity.) <br /> <br /> A duel with relocated bridge guru Cedric Van Dorn (sounds near Goren, no? and I suspect the choice of character's name "Stanislavsky" was also a grind at another kind of system), a bloated charlatan played very well by Ferdinand Gottschalk, broadcast on radio stations in America, like a prize fight by Roscoe Karns (another great fast-paced deadly comic actor of the 1930s). <br /> <br /> The bridge players are even in a rounded square, though the audience <br /> <br /> is above them, unlike <br /> <br /> The wide variety of US types prefigure the comedies from Preston Sturges, although for the production of well-known personality, "Grand Slam" Most people call two better movies from the same (pre-code) era with Lee Tracy who speaks fast <br /> <br /> publisher: "The Half Naked Truth and Bombshell, but Grand Slam has his <br /> <br /> moments, especially for anyone who has played bridges with serious points <br /> <br /> scores. <br /> <br /> Loretta Young was already a clothing horse. (For me, her face looks a bit long <br /> <br /> and also horse. Another era of beauty, I think ...) The movie <br /> <br /> unfortunately everything but Glenda Farrell, who plays McHugh's forgetful <br /> <br /> girl.
