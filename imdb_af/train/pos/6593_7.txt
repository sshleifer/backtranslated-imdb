I watched this movie twice and think it's pretty good for the limited equipment used to create this movie. (filmed in 1947) Dr Heyerdahl explains his theory on the migration of South American Pre-Colubian Indians to the Polynesia Islands, with the raft of large balsa trees. This documentary follows dr. Heyerdahl and crew while choosing balsa trees in Equidor and floating with them in the river to the Pacific for composition in Peru. They start with a 101-day sea adventure that survives the strength of their primitive raft, only through available natives of that era. See for yourself, a real adventure!
