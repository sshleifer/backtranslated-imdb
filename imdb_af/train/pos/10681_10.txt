While the British gained some hilarious and fun sitcoms in the 1990s - Ab Fab, Men Bad, One Foot in the Grave, etc. - The 70's was the real golden age. <br /> <br /> In the 1970s, there were whole new areas to explore, including the sexual revolution, feminism and the slow awareness of a need for "sensitivity" which, twenty years later, will become political correctness. Attempts to contend with the confusion of this thorough modern world were the subtle and not-so-subtle themes in all of the sketches of Monty Python's Flying Circus to live like the Man over the House. (By the late seventies, this "grappling" led more meditative and bittersweet sitcoms like the masterpiece Butterflies.) <br /> <br /> Man over the house is a perfect example of the good Britcoms of the time - slightly excited, shaky, fresh, inventive, sometimes outrageous, with some well-made observations on contemporary life. Compare it to a cynical 90s show like Ab Fab, and it's hard to believe that the two were created in the same country. <br /> <br /> Man over the house is one of the great Britcoms of the 70's, right there with good neighbors (the good life) and over the house's turn of George and Mildred. Its quality is confirmed by the fact that - as with Good Neighbors - its creators, writers and many of its role-players in Britain have continued.
