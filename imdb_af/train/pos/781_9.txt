"Crush" examines female friendship, especially since the saccharin quality is avoided, which spoils so many films with the same theme (eg "Steel Magnolias"). At the same time, it reveals the power of a sudden passion to be overwhelmed and surprised. The depicted events were highly unlikely, but the underlying emotional truth seemed very real to me. Not a movie for the speed-vehicle-and-explosion crowd, but adults are sure to respond with both laughter and tears.
