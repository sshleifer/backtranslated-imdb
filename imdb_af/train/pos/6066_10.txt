When I first saw this movie, it was long ago on VHS-Video. I liked this movie because it was funny and exciting. A few years ago I saw another movie called: * Andy Colby's Incredible Adventure * In this movie, parts of * Wizards of the lost kingdom * were used. They called this movie "KOR the conqueror". For many years I searched for the COR music, because I wanted to see the full movie, not just the parts used in the * Andy Colby * movie. No store rented this Kor-Movie and no store knew this movie. Many years I watched my old VHS tapes that I had at home and what a wonder ... I've had this movie at home for many years, but the movie had a different title because in Germany it has 3 or 4 titles. So I was happy to find this band at home and this time I had a lot more time to watch COR the Conquerer again. The music is wonderful during the hole film, but the best part of the filming in combination with the music is this moment, when COR drunk runs through the green forest. The music in the background had some kind of magic. I love Bo Svenson, and also the son Simon played in the movie. Both did their job very well. Manfred Kraatz, Germany, 26.10.2004.
