This review leaves almost 30 years. Nonetheless, it should be noted that I drove a copy of this movie early in 2008 and watched it repeatedly for 4 months! I just had to write about it! I struck and forgot anything else when I saw this movie. How ironic it is to see Literature's ugliest male protagonist portrayed by the handiest man! Yet, what a welcome irony! It suited me perfectly and more, because Timothy Dalton justified his right. He made an amazing and triumphant achievement! I have never seen anything like this! All the other actors are also very good. The whole movie is beautifully composed. I don't care what someone says about this movie. I love it and love it! It made me happy and satisfied. It crushes me a little to say it, but I prefer Jane Eyre in 1983 for A & E's P&J, which I believe is the ultimate mini-series. <br /> <br /> The excerpts from Jane Eyre searched me a little back in school. I never came to read the book seriously and to know the story line so well. By seeing this particular production, the story came to life and drove me to a near madness. The screens and Mr Dalton's voice haunted me endlessly and eventually led me to read the book seriously, which is of course a masterpiece. Bravo to the whole team and especially to Mr. Dalton !! This movie is now part of me. <br /> <br /> I give it 10/10 rating.
