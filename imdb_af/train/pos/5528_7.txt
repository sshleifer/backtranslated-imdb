It is a very beautiful and almost meditative film. There is almost no dialogue in it except the narrative; and the scenery and music compliment each other perfectly. I didn't even connect the red hair of the girl and the jackal until it showed me through a friend (who also had red hair). It's almost an old-fashioned kind of children's movie that says kids prefer animations like Shrek or Toy Story, etc. - But I feel that young people need to be introduced to the beauty and wonder of nature that this film definitely does. Maybe not the best ever movie of its kind, but definitely an excellent and relaxing view for all ages - not just kids.
