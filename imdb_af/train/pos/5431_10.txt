I have seen this movie many times and every time I see it, I can't help it, but it gets entertained. Gunga Din is one of those classic movies made in Hollywood's Golden Year when the actors had to pull the audience into a movie without relying on special special effects and male "monsters" to carry a scene. The screen scarcity and comrade shown by Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. is suberb and very entertaining to watch. The tongue and cheek attitude in which the three actors play their roles works nicely and flawlessly. Some may regard it as "corny", but I consider it "classic" filming and acting at its best. One must remember when this film is seen that Europe was involved in a War with Germany and audiences go to the movies to escape the horrors of war and to be entertained and take away to a place where people are growing as life was and heroic deeds did. good will always overcome evil. Gunga Din achieves it perfectly by letting the audience laugh at and with the actors during their disturbing escape. In short, it's a classic movie that doesn't take it too seriously and doesn't want the audience.
