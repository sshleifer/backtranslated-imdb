Since this movie is entirely in Swiss dialect, it is probably difficult for most German speakers to really follow this movie. I'm not from Switzerland, but I've been working there for a few years, so I had the chance to understand this wonderful spoof of the Lord of the Rings. I have seen many movies of this kind (eg Scary Movie, many Scifi spoofs etc.), but this one is the best one of the kind I have seen so far. I give a 9 out of 10. so there is almost no chance of understanding non-Swiss.
