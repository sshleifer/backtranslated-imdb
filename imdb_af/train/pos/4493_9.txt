This is an excellent film about a traditional working class family in northern England. Filmed in place in Bolton, it stars James Mason as the father who dominates his home. Or so it looks. The movie, based on the play, shows the complexities of family life cleverly. The supporting role is also good, with many well-known faces lending support.
