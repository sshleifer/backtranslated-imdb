I think it's a nice movie; I think it's a very Romanian movie by nature and atmospheres; I think it was not meant to be sensual (sensuality is a consequence, not a goal); I think it's very natural; I think it's human; I think it was interesting; I think the actors never made me think. Waw lame acting (they're not Sean Connory & co), and the movie isn't a blockbuster either, they are like the movie ... normal ppl that can act ...; I think the movie reached its intention; I think it made me feel (or felt again :)); I think I'm not objective; <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed it ... what I know.
