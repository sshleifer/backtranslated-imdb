It's a great little movie about the loneliness of the single man. Phillipe Harel as Notre Heros is an amalgam of Robert de Niro in Taxi Driver, Inspector Clouseau (in his stoic) and Chauncey Gardiner in Being There (also Peter Sellers). He is single, but has no idea how to pull the opposite sex. He didn't really bother! <br /> <br /> He has a stoism and fatalism that stops any hope of ever joining - his friend Jose Garcia as Tisserand is in the same condition, but at least makes a brave effort to his extended virginity (he is 28 and admits he never had sex). Very good outdoor shots from Paris and Rouen, where the two software people travel on business. They try different nightclubs and venues, but it is useless. My theory is that they are trying the wrong places - they go to more or less youth nightclubs; they should try the type that older people have more their own age. <br /> <br /> Harel is increasingly isolated and does a bit of the Niro effort, as in the Taxi driver, and asks his friend / colleague to poke a little. Block who pulled a pretty girl into the nightclub. <br /> <br /> Worth watching.
