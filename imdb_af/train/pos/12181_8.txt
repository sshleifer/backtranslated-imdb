The Lady of Shanghai is known as one of Hollywood's most turbulent productions. Welles' original cut was taken away by the producers and cut to ribbons. This made the already hidden mystery story even harder to keep up with. They called a good amount of his dialogue because of the density of the Irish accent, and the dubbing was done too clearly and poorly. Most disastrous of all, Welles and her on the screen, and Rita Hayworth, the real leading woman, have gone apart in their relationship and their turbulent chemistry comes on the screen. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, it is all overcome by just how fantastic Orson Welles is. He makes the movie incredibly stylish and atmospheric - every scene just seems to breathe your back off the screen. The characters and scenes are so bizarre that they are dreamy and surreal. This sense of strangeness often increases scenes that occur in these films, such as the courtroom order in the middle. I usually find courtroom dramas a drill, but Welles' direction and beautiful touch make them as fascinating as everything. The end to the carnival almost reminds one of David Lynch. <br /> <br /> The acting here is also very good. In spite of their lack of relationships, Welles and Hayworth both show good performances - however, their interactions are just a little lacking. Everyone else is great to watch, especially Everett Sloane and Glenn Anders. Of course, "The Lady of Shanghai" has its problems, but it is worth looking at just one of the master's theaters at its best. (8/10)
