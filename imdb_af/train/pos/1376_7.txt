It sounds like it should be a biography of Claude Monet, but it's actually a highly focused story of relationships between three adolescent girls on a French synchronized swimming team. There are no parents or teachers to speak of, no school, and boys are represented by one peripheral figure, the shaky Francois who enters the story from time to time and always confuses. <br /> <br /> Pauline Aquart is the youngest of the three who just aspires to join the team she admires so much. She's kind of weird. She is not yet out of her adolescent growth and has long, bony limbs, big feet and no derriers to talk about. She is prosperous and sports these blooming lips. After a while her appearance grows out of you and from some angles she can look impressive. <br /> <br /> Adele Haenel is older - more, well, more physically developed. What a glamorous figure she cuts in her swimsuit, saws to bother the boys, waving her long blonde hair. But she's not what she looks like. Or is she? I couldn't do it. The French are long on paradoxical and short on consistency. No wonder Francois always sniffs at her. <br /> <br /> There is not so much ambiguity in Louse Blachere's character. She is also on the team, but she is dumpy and plain and sensitive about it and loves Francois. Blachere is a good actress and adds to the indifference of the character through her performance. <br /> <br /> The film deals with the relationships between these three, which means intrigues, cheats, hidden feelings and the rest of us associate with young girls who spend a lot of time with each other. This is, of course, a difficult subject. It becomes more difficult during the gradual development of a homoerotic relationship between Pauline and Adele. Not that you should expect it to be a soft porn movie. The only nudity we see is much less than a turn, and what little sex is under the lids, sometimes literally. <br /> <br /> I don't think I want to go into the plot or in its analysis too much, partly because it suggests rather than expressed by action, partly because it's complex, and partly because I'm not sure that I have it all. <br /> <br /> Let me give you an example. Okay. Adele is the girl the other envy. She is also very far and herself satisfied. In addition, she apparently shook every boy and the man in the eyes if they couldn't be her hair, from the handsome, but stupid Francois to the bus driver, she wanted a favor. She bragged about her expertise in fellatio. When Pauline approaches her to join the swimming team, Adele uses her as a lookout during the missions with the guys. An excellent and confident daffodil, you know? But then the soiantant takes the skinny Pauline under her wing and reveals that Pauline is still a virgin. Really? Yes, really. Pauline starts coming closer to Adele and Adele finally confesses she wants to get rid of her and she wants Pauline to do it for her. Pauline, now sexually moved to Adele, performs the task with subdued enjoyment. NOW Adele really wants to adapt it with a man, preferably older and experienced. So she took Pauline on a farm where she seduced with an old dance until she followed Pauline to the powder room. The two girls stood there staring at each other and did not openly express a sexual interest in the other. But Adele is so close that Pauline slowly releases her own reins, gets up and kisses Adele. Adele goes back, smiles and says, "Now it wasn't that bad, was it?", And then goes back to the club. <br /> <br /> It's a nice description of everything going on between Pauline and Adele - but what's the hell going on? Initially, Adele Pauline treats like an irrelevant child, later as a good friend, eventually like a potential lover. And the moment Pauline responds, Adele is happy. Does she use Pauline the way she seems to use men? Does Adele satisfy you that she now has another person in involuntary servitude? I do not know. <br /> <br /> I rejected Louise Blachere as the third member of the trio, the plain and overripe flowers whose expression always suggests dumb, but at least thoroughly heterosexual and the first of the three to dispose of her to touch the notorious virginity, but I just skipped her considerations about space. <br /> <br /> Do you see it? With pleasure. (Just compare it to the typical American movie about high school children.) For men, some of whom have never penetrated the female mystic, it can give you an idea of ​​what it looks like in a medium shot.
