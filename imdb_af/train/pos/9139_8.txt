The movie is okay, it has moments, the music scenes are the best of all! The soundtrack is a true classic. This is a perfect album, it starts with Let's Go Crazy (suitable for the start as it is a great party song and very up-tempo), Take me with you (a fun pop song ...), The Beautiful Ones (a cheerful ballad, probably the closest thing to R&B on this entire album), Computer Blue (a somewhat upset full of Appolonia), Darling Nikki (one of the funniest songs ever made it very vague from Appolonia). When Doves Cry (the highlight of this masterpiece), I would die 4 You, Baby I'm a star, and of course, Purple Rain (a real classic, a very appropriate ending to this classic album). The movie and the album are both very good. I recommend them!
