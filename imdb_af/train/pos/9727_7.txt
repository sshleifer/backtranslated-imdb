Simon Pegg plays a rude rough and often out of control journalist brought from England to work for a large US magazine. Of course, she makes winning ways of all kinds of complications. Amusing facts based comedy that co-stars Kristen Dunst (looks quite big), Danny Huston, and Jeff Bridges. It works mainly because we like Simon Pegg, despite his bad behavior. We fully understand why Kristen Dunst is still talking to him, despite his regular screw options. I like the movie. It's not the only one and ends, but it was a nice way to have a night out of the lounge on the couch. Watch movies. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
