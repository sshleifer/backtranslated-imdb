by Dane Youssef <br /> <br /> "Coonskin" is a film by the only Ralph Bakshi, reportedly a satirical charge of blazing exploitation movies and negative black stereotypes, as well as a look at life black in modern America (Modern for the day, I mean - 1975). Paramount dropped it like a hot potato that just burst into flame. <br /> <br /> But it's a Bakshi movie, controversial, exciting, and a must-see almost by definition alone. Not just another random shock-jock of a movie trying to shock for the sake of shock. It's by Ralph Bakshi. Anyone who knows the name knows that if he made a movie, he has something to say ... <br /> <br /> Although it's rooted in cheap blaxploitation, "Coonskin" is not just " another camel off the mainstream white film or any kind of throw away flick. "Coonskin" wants to be more. It is aimed at raising the images and freezing a little bigger fish. <br /> <br /> The movie doesn't just make fun of the genre. It not only introduces black people, but actually looks love, beauty and heart in the strangest places. <br /> <br /> "Coonskin" tells a story from some prisoners waiting for a prison sentence. The fact that it is even possible to break out of a prison in the "Coonskin" world alone makes it old-fashioned. <br /> <br /> One of the prisoners tells a story about a thirty black brothers in Harlem, called Brother Dra, Brother Rabbit, Pastor Fox who wants respect and a bit of action and is willing to do it. to get in any way. The Itallian pel has all the right action. <br /> <br /> Big name black musician star: Barry White and Scatman Crothers, as well as Charles Gordone, the first black playwright who goes home to the Pulitzer. There is, of course, something that happens largely here. <br /> <br /> The film plays like a descent in this world, this side of the racial division. From an angry, hip, deep, soulful black man with a hatred in his heart and a gun in his hand. <br /> <br /> Bakshi's films never know the meaning of the word "sublete". This one seems to never even hear the word. But perhaps a subject such as this extremism is needed. Real sledgehammer satire. Some subjects cannot be taken lightly. <br /> <br /> Bakshi is ungodly ruthless. Here, no member or minority of the Harlem scene is intact. <br /> <br /> The characters here are "animated" to "real" everything, depending on the mood and situation. The animated characters and the people all have the same reality and are meant to be just as literal. <br /> <br /> Bakshi just shows ugly caricatures just for shock value. He always has something to say. Also, black face is not free. Here, unlike Spike Lee's "Bamboozled", he seems to be using it to really say something. <br /> <br /> Like 99.9% of all Bakshi movies, this animation includes animation and live action. Usually at the same time. Bakshki is not just clumsy here. All this technique is all intertwined, joined while something is being said. <br /> <br /> Somehow this one inevitably feels dated. Many of these types of films (including Bakshi's) are very up-to-date, very encouraging at the moment. They reflect the particular tendency of the day, but look back on them for years, but there is only an unmistakable sense of nostalgia (as well as timeless truth). <br /> <br /> Though the music, clothing, snake and the City seem like pictures that belong to a time capsule. The attitude, the spirit and the heart remain the same, no matter what. Anyone who really saw the movies, the condition of things and is in the community of people, knows what I'm talking about. Even some of the black characters are a bunny (junglebunny), a great bear and a fox. One of the most sour and indifferent racist characters is a dirty Harlem police who are on the trail of this "dirty n" after the death of a policeman. But for him it's not just business. And neither is the rest of the brothers wearing the shield. It's just pure sadistic racist pleasure to hurt blacks. <br /> <br /> The order in which the Godfather and his wife are involved is one of the most moving pieces in the whole film, of which there are many. It plays like an opera or ballet. <br /> <br /> The promo line: WARNING: "This movie insults everyone!" It's not just hype. Continue with extreme caution. <br /> <br /> You're warned ... <br /> <br /> by Dane Youssef
