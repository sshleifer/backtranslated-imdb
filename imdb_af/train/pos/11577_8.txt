It was a very cool movie. It's just to prove that you don't need dull little things like continuity and scripts to make a movie. It shifts continents in seconds, people are shot and nothing happens to them, swords are on fire, Samuari fights on sink galleys, David Essex is the hallmark of Slimey Villainy and John Rhys Davies is just the man. I enjoyed this movie, but I love s ** t movies, this is the perfect example of a lot of movies just KICKS ASS. If you like Battlefield Earth, you will be this movie lover, his bastards, his quick, foolish, his samuaraitastic !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> It looks like it was made in 1972
