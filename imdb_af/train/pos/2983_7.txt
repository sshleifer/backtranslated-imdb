BASEketball is indeed a very funny movie. David Zucker manages to make us all laugh, in a very stupid, but often clever, comedy. <br /> <br /> The two creators of South Park, the lead actors in this movie, actually play very well, surprisingly well, but this is the first time I've seen them as actors. <br /> <br /> It's a very good and funny movie, so don't miss it. <br /> <br /> Vote: 7.5 out of 10.
