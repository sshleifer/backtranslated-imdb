Don't listen to fuddy-duddy critics, it's a jewel! Young Empire Joan and her brother find themselves strange after their father dies - and now they have to work for a life! Of course she becomes a reporter, and of course he is also a manager for the crowd! Through co-incidents, their careers meet, thanks to the gangster Clark Gable. Meanwhile, there is a chance to swim a moonlight underwear for a bunch of nice young things and Joan to do some risque dance numbers (with the grace of a steam head). <br /> <br /> But it's not supposed to be taken seriously - it's fun from the wonderful pre-code days when Hollywood was really naughty. Joan looks good and shows much of the emotional extent that her career will give so long (thank you, she stopped the dance!). Gable is remarkable as a smart gangster - he has not been a star yet and should not be the hero. Big to see him playing something different. And William Bakewell is excellent as the poor confused brother. And there are a couple of great montages and watch shots courtesy of director Harry Beaumont, who switches the piece at a creaky pace - and occasionally watches the audience! Great fun!
