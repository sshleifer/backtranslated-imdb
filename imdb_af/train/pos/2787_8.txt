Originally I rented this movie for my daughter as she was interested in football - and I wasn't so disappointed (except the plot interfering with the soccer zone). As a father, I suppose I was a little surprised at the introduction of the topic of lesbians - but I have to admit that these issues today as parents are completely available to children (as uncomfortable as I feel with the subject). In a way, this emotion was right in the main premise of the movie - that at a certain age you should trust your children to make their own choices. This dilemma is being launched by a young British-born teenage girl - Jasminder (Jess) - from East Indian heritage who dreams of playing professional football. The waiting marriage of her older sister in a traditional Hindu marriage offers many opportunities for her to explore her hopes and fears for her future. <br /> <br /> The multicultural challenge was a very interesting technique to investigate Jess's frustration with her parents' expectations for her - yet nothing more than most child-parent relationships. <br /> <br /> In the SUMMARY, the soccer screens are BIG (lots to learn in slowmo) and while I didn't have the storyline, something was needed to keep the movie.
