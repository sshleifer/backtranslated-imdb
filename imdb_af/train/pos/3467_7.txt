I still wonder why I watched this movie. Although, before I watched this movie, I knew almost nothing about the beatles. I didn't even know all their names! All I knew was that they had a lot of fans, they had albums that some people claim to be the biggest ever. They broke, John married Yoko Ono and John was killed. <br /> <br /> Also, VH1 is not even my favorite music station, MTV. Still, for some reason I decided to watch it, and I don't expect much. Surprisingly, I really enjoyed it! The dialogue is written and handles very well in the light of a bit of accent. This is very important, because John and Paul are talking about the whole movie, although they are taken outside to explore more possibilities, and to make you look. Jared Harris and Adien Quinn are performing well. <br /> <br /> The end was also very clever. I enjoyed how the movie excited you about the SNL performace and then hit your head and realized it would be better if it just let it go and shut it down on a good note. My favorite moment is probably the touch of the roof. <br /> <br /> Overall, I recommend this movie to almost everyone. This is a great way to establish your curiosity about what could have happened if Paul acted only on John's threshold, 6 years later. This is probably the main reason for my viewing of this movie, and I settled my curiosity on who the beatles really were and what could have happened to them after the break.
