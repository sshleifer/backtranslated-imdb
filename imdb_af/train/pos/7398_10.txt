Xizao is a rare little movie. It is simple and indifferent, and at the same time so rewarding in emotion and joy. The story is simple, and the theme of old and new clashes is introduced in the first scenes. This theme is at the heart of the movie, but it would have flattened if it wasn't for the wonderful characters and the actors depicting them. <br /> <br /> The aging patriarch, Master Liu, is a remnant of China's pre-expansion days. He manages a bathhouse in an old environment. Every single scene in the bathhouse is a source of jealousy for our stressed, unhappy people. Not even hardened cynics can find any mistakes in this wonderful environment. <br /> <br /> Master Liu's mentally handicapped son Er Ming is the second truly powerful character in the movie, along with his modern brother. The interactions between these three people and the various visitors to the bathhouse are incredibly detailed and cordial, with some scenes so packed with emotion, it is almost all that is seen in movies. <br /> <br /> With his regime critical message, this movie is not only censored, but also given unreasonably small coverage. It may be coincidental, but if a movie of this caliber is virtually impossible to find, even on the internet (!), You can't help being suspicious. <br /> <br /> So help free speech and the movie world, buy, rent, copy this wonderful movie, and if you own the DVD, if there is one, then share share!
