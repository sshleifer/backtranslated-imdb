Before we start, I fear dentists. This movie gives me the creep and even makes me closer. This is what I love for this movie. The movie is so boring. For that I take 3 stars! <br /> <br /> * Spoiler Alert * <br /> <br /> The film revolves around dr. Alan Feinstone, who recently found out his wife was cheating on him. Soon he began to have hallucinations and started torturing his patients, killing co-workers and even killing his wife and killing the man where he had a relationship. <br /> <br /> * End Spoiler * <br /> <br /> The movie is very bloody and stingy. I would recommend it if you are in gore. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 7 stars out of 10. Dr. Alan Feinstein is not your normal daily dentist!
