This sci-fi masterpiece has too many mistakes after the editors closed it after the opening in 1936. Visually, it is a wonder to watch, but the writing leaves too many intellectual speeches on war and progress. It gets very tricky when the actors are given to mention very high messages at all times. Raymond Massey and Cedric Hardwicke, both major actors, come out as quite a few fanatics. Ralph Richardson is very good as "The Boss" is a megalomanic warlord. The Second World War prediction was very terrible, as the world was on the brink of devastating conflict in human history at the time. I'm sure the war didn't turn out like it did in the movie. There are a few visually stunning montage sequences that bridge the leaps of time between the different episodes of the movie. Although not as entertaining as I had hoped, this movie will last a long time after you see it.
