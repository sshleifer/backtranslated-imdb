Those of the "Instant Gratification" era of horror movies will undoubtedly complain about the pace of this movie and the lack of free effects and body numbers. The fact is, "The Empty Acre" is a good example of how independent horror movies should be done. <br /> <br /> If you avoid the indie shelves because you're tired of boring teenagers or twenty somethings being killed by some bad ones whose back story is the back of a spade chocula box, "The Empty Acre" , is, is the movie for you. <br /> <br /> Set in the rotting remains of the rural American dream, "The Leigh Aker" is the story of a young couple struggling with the disappearance of their six-month-old baby. As the couple's poor relationship falls apart, a bigger story plays on the background. At night, a shapeless dark mass sees a sun-baked bare acre on their farm and prevents anything in its path, leaving no sign of it ever being there. <br /> <br /> The movie is loaded with enigmatic characters and visual cues about what happens, ending with a well-executed end that resonates with just enough remaining questions to help the writer / director's belief in an intellectual audience. confirmed. <br /> <br /> There seems to be a subtext about the death of the American dream, but I will hardly call the film an allegory. Sounding, well maintained, and technically smart, "The Empty Acre" is a fantastic little indie that lovers of love should love.
