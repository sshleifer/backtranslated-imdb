Offbeat, slow, entertaining erotic thriller with many graphics and "blasphemous" scenes that will undoubtedly disturb some viewers. However, it will be difficult not to appreciate the various imaginative series that this movie contains, or to ignore Krabbe's first-rate performance. Verhoeven maintains an intriguing ambivalence throughout the film, with the meaning of the hero's visions-omens. Unfortunately, everything in the last 5 minutes has become a blur, and the unsatisfactory end is definitely not as good as the rest of the movie. (***)
