Forget the camp 'religious' movies that monopolized the television / film market ... this movie has a real feel for it. Although it can be considered a movie that has cheap emotional drawings, it also has the message of forgiveness and overall good morals. However, I didn't like the lighting in this movie ... for a movie dealing with such topics, it was too bright. I felt it was taken away from the overall appeal of the movie, which is almost an unpardonable sin, but the recognizable role, and their performances, reflect this review. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth seeing ... buy the DVD.
