Yes, it's another wonderful Muppet movie and I worship them all; the characters, the movies, the TV episodes (it's the best comedy or musical TV show ever) and all the artists behind it. But here they have done such a rare fatal error and I'm definitely talking about the strange end! <br /> <br /> I think it's very dangerous to involve so much in American drama and end a love affair per marriage! We, like all the poor viewers, feel so free or perhaps happy for the absence of their annoyance, pain and misery! So we enjoy all of these stories that collect 2 cute heroes as a couple in love without the legal band like Mickey Mouse and Minnie, Superman and Lois Lane, Dick Tracy and Tess, etc. With all the previous couples and their containers, I bet you feel safe, calm and at peace. Therefore, if you look at what the makers of this movie have already done, you will be as crazy as me! <br /> <br /> They married the poorly miserable creature (Kermit) with his daily nightmare, the most versatile woman ever (Miss Piggy)! This is a historic change through the measures of the American entertainment industry! And it was fairly normal to have a negative impact on the audience who just refused to bless or believe or be content with the sudden marriage (even the pathetic frog didn't have the time or the right opportunity to think or decide something!). So it's no wonder you know that this movie is the biggest failure in their movie, but only five years earlier, 25 million compared to 65 million earning the first one (The Muppet Movie ?? 1979). <br /> <br /> Only in this movie do they have Manhattan, and also my rest!
