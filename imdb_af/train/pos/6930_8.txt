It is quite an unusual and unique little western, which is mostly made original because of its story that revolves around a unique and better Winchester 1873 and everyone who gets it at some point in the movie. <Br /> <br /> It's usually a very entertaining movie to watch, but not without being a true Western. The film has been featured in a typical '40s / 50s style of Western genre making, so the genre lovers should not be turned off by its somewhat unusual headline. <br /> <br /> Because the gun is actually the main plot device of the movie, it allows the story to follow more characters in the movie, which of course are all connected and the story finally makes the full circle. Without it, this movie would be a nice mess to watch, as the story often jumps from one dangerous opportunity to another, with constantly different characters involved. Quite amazing how they even managed to put Wyatt Earp in it. But it's really no criticism. I liked that the movie and its story were original and how the movie seemed to move from one event to another. It gave the movie a little sense of adventure and entertainment. <br /> <br /> It's also a very nice movie. I like the institutions that used the movie and it seems incredible that it was actually director Anthony Mann's first western. Fortunately, later he will be sending more Western directors, who would also often star in James Stewart. <br /> <br /> Choosing James Stewart as the lead was a pretty decisive choice. He is one of the softest and most polite search and actors, and so he throws himself like a hard guns like a bit of a strange choice. But Stewart is surprisingly convincing as a tough man and it shows how versatile and really capable as an actor he actually was. <br /> <br /> It also has other surprising actors in the movie, who are not often associated with this genre. Shelley Winters plays the female head and also later known actors Rock Hudson and Tony Curtis appear in a few minor roles. <br /> <br /> A true western with lots of action and entertainment. <br /> <br /> 8/10
