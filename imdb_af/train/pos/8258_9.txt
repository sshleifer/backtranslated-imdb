With the risk of being slightly sacred, on the first show I tend to set it on a level with 'Shaun of the Dead'. Now, considering Simon Pegg as an undisputed comedy genius, I realize it's a pretty big claim. And to what extent you agree with the last statement, can be a good preliminary criterion or "Fido" will arrive at you. <br /> <br /> Somehow, the comedy where Shaun is gone, except we are back in the original 1950's Living Dead era, comes stereotypical mid-American small town. The Zombie Wars is over and zombies themselves are becoming more and more adapted, useful members of the community. It has been informed from the beginning, and it is largely due to the scientific advances made by the good people at Zomcom. <br /> <br /> The beauty of the film lies in its dead pan depiction of a respected environment that maintains core values ​​while making a place for zombies and the particular dangers they set. The charm and balance with which it does, is close enough to perfection. Themes that you can expect from a more general kitsch comedy come through - the veneer of good clean life, stop appearing, suppressed emotion, confused parenting, social decor and the fate of the alienated individual. <br /> <br /> It's a story telling with a happy heart and wide appeal created alive by the film's all-round strong role. This is one of those works where it really does show that everyone involved participated. It's also fun to imagine what Billy Connelly is learning his script ... So, with the conclusion, it is likely that you would appreciate the humor of this movie unless your dad tried to eat you.
