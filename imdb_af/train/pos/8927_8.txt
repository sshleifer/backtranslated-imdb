Clair Denis re-invents her theme of estranged fathers again, men who follow their own happiness in a determined manner, indifferent to the emotional toll on their family, but while Nénette and Boni live from the previous movie in a narrow world of Marseille, we investigate Louis Trebor's intruder brings us from a remote location along the French-Swiss border to halfway the world, to Korea and Tahiti. Once again, the middle-stream film, with Louis, in his sixties, starting with a sick heart, trying to maintain a high level of fitness. We learn that Louis is no stranger to violence, as his cabin is the place for smuggling and gunfire a regular occurrence. Louis sleeps with a big knife under his pillow with guns in the area. Denis is not in a hurry to move on and we need to build our understanding of Louis from his daily activities and the few people he handles on the border, including a boy, Sidney (Grégoire Colin, almost unrecognizable with long hair and a whisper of a mustache that rejects him as a "lunatic": as a dedicated father of two. There are very short plays that, while seemingly unrelated, build an impression of Louis and his environment. Ms Godard's camera work is exciting here. The controlling metaphor is Louis's heart transplant for which he goes to Korea and then to Tahiti to look for another son, not found, and where Louis's new heart rejects him, just as Sidney rejected the guy. We are accustomed to short scenes in Denis' film that is inexplicable: Nénette astride Boni feeding with a spoon; a ride through the shooting of Boni's father and then the shortest images of Boni with a gunshot wound in the head; a scene of Louis in a mortuary with a cadaver scarring transplant, but Sidney's body. The implication of the last two is a rejection, real or imagined, by a father, killing something indeterminable in a boy.
