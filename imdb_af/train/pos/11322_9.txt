This anime threw my socks seriously. When the anime first opened it, I felt it was too slow; The story wasn't quite forward, and Shirou was quite a petty male head. As soon as he learns more about detection, and you learn more about Saber and the Holy Grail war itself, the story goes out and you can see that several facets move together. It was fantastic. <br /> <br /> In addition, I felt that the way the characters evolved was very true to the way real people evolved, in the real world. There wasn't a stupid, completely obvious thing; The development of Ilya and Rin was interesting to look at, but I think the way Shirou and Saber grew in their particular personalities was just interesting to see everything in turn. A few of the "surprising" people who pop up (Gilgamesh?) Were also unique to the rest of the cast in one way or another, meaning we didn't replace "Generic Bad-ass A" with "Generic Bad Ass B "once A is dead. <br /> <br /> Anddd, I loved the music. The opening of the music smelled, and the finishing touches of the final episode just got the look of the last episode even more pressing. Good work, type MOON!
