CAROL'S JOURNEY is a pleasure to watch for so many reasons. The play by Clara Lago is simple for everyone so young, and she is one of those special actors who can say a lot with facial expressions. Director Imanol Urbibe offers a stiff and controlled film with no break in continuity, thereby securing the plot with a steady fit with enough tension to wonder the one who will bring the nest scene. Angel Garcia Roldan's script is the story that tells at best, which seems to be the main purpose of movies. The plot is unpredictable, but the events as they unravel are completely logical. Perhaps the best feature of this movie is telling a story of the Spanish Civil War, as it influenced the people. It was a great event of the 20th century, but almost Americans don't know it. In fact, in 40 years of university education, I had on average one student a semester that even heard it. Much less that could say anything about it - and the overwhelming number of students were merit scholars, who all speak to the enormous amount of censorship in American education. So, in one way, this movie is a great way to start a study of the event. Keep in mind that when one thread is drawn, much of the history is unraveled. The appreciation of this film is therefore directly related to the amount of knowledge. To see this movie as another coming of age movies, the movie is the whole movie. The left elbow index considers seven aspects of movie viewing, production sets, character development, plot, dialogue, movie continuity and artwork. Needed on a scale of 10 for very good, 5 for average and 1 for help. CAROL'S JOURNEY is above average on all counts, except the average-measured dialogue. The LEI average for this movie is 9.3, increasing to a 10 when it is equal to the IMDb scale. I recommend this movie for all ages.
