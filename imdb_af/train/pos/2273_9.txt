I have another movie with Nolte that I didn't want. But it is said, he made many movies and I just saw a few. In my mind I keep the images of his performance here and the one in "The Thin Red Line". Nolte has a full range of actors. When it is necessary to scream, he roars like a wounded lion. His best moments are those I estimate in actors: when he feels emotions only through facial, hand and body gestures, without saying anything. Having come to the conclusion that our current generation of actors generally has no appreciation for what an actor can do without speaking, and without conscious appreciation of the ability of Keaton and Chaplin, this generation of actors relies too much on the mechanical wizard of computers. Of course, it's just a sign of the times we live in. If Chaplin lived in our time .... who knows, he might as well have become an aficionado of CGI tools. <br /> <br /> I didn't read the Vonnegut novel from which this film comes on the screen. However, the plot is not so far-fetched or complicated that we cannot follow the loaded road, with all its surprises. Of course, it seems, of course, ominous. However, this is not impossible either. <br /> <br /> Consider starting: A Spy in the Heart of the Third Reich: Extraordinary Life of Fritz Kolbe, America's Main Spy in World War II by Delattre and Prichard (see Amazon for more details ). Consider: History Undercover: Piercing the Reich: American Spies Within Nazi Germany DVD (I've seen it here: http://store.aetv.com/html/product/index.jhtml?id=75054) seems to have a history channel production be. . <br /> <br /> So, is the story ludicrous? Story, yes, impossible, no. Back to the plot. Nolte's character is recruited and accepts an impossible dangerous mission and unfortunately the writing does not give us a sufficient reason why he does not accept it. Was it a kind of passivity that he was sucked into this role because it says it was the best story he ever wrote and he played the role? It's a difficult thing to think that any of us would understand. But it was an unusual time and people did extraordinary things. <br /> <br /> The play throughout the film by the whole role is excellent and as people alan Arkin pointed out, always fantastic, is very good in a small role. <br /> <br /> I was really shocked at the end of the movie (no I won't spoil it) and it made me feel terrible about the choice. Did this person feel that the road was finally over and that he was all that needed and that more chapters would be added to a life already filled with many burnt pages? Hard to say, but it's really jolts. <br /> <br /> Nolte gives one of the best performances you can expect .... The site of the movie makes you wonder about many things. It is very entertaining and challenging. What good movies should be. A little long but worth it. By the way, the movie music has choices from one of the best living composers: Arvo Part.
