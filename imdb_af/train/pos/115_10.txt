Piece of subtle art. Maybe a masterpiece. Undoubtedly a special story about the ambiguity of existence. Speak in Kafka style about the impossibility of victory or survival in an eternal strange world. Life in this movie is only exercise of adaptation. Lesson on Limits and Original Sin, on the infallibility of innocence and error of his ways. <br /> <br /> Leopold Kessle is another Joseph K. Images of Trial and the same ambiguous woman. And Europe is a symbol of basic crisis that has many aspects such as chimeric wars or inevitable search for truth / essence / golden age. <br /> <br /> Metaphor or parable, the movie is the history of disappointment's evolution. War, peace, business or lie are only details of gelatine time. Hypocrisy is a mask. Love-a convention. The sacrificial only method to hope to understand a painful reality.
