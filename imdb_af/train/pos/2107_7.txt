I recently bought this movie with a lot of other LaserDiscs from eBay. Usually I am in the war and action movies, but sometimes I enjoy romantic comedies. <br /> <br /> If you're bored with today's special FX movies and high gloss romantic comedies, watch a quiet night around Shop around the Corner. . What I like about the movie is that the characters have a lot of decency. There is nothing false or pretentious about them. Take Mr. Matuschek for example: If he finds out that his wife is cheating with one of his own employees, he tries to shoot himself. Not just because of the humiliation, but because he was unfair to Stewart's character. (OK, example.) <br /> <br /> Yes, the focus of the movie is narrow and the plot is predictable. Yet I enjoyed it very much. If you like Notting Hill, you'll like Shop around the corner. In fact, Hugh Grant reminds me a lot of Jimmy Stewart.
