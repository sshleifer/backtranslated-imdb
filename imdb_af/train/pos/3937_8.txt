The early career of Abe Lincoln is beautifully presented by Ford. Not that anyone in life has seen the image of true Lincoln, but Fonda, who carries a false nose, is rude like Lincoln, with voice, delivery, walking and other ways - exactly as Lincoln would think. Ford, in the first of three consecutive films he made with Fonda, is at the top of his form, making the early 19th century America excellent. The story focuses on some accused of murdering Lincoln's defense and the court is fairly well done. The supporting film includes much of Ford's regularity. It was Alice Brady's last movie, as she died months after his release.
