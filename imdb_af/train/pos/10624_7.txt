I thought I should qualify my position after reading other reviews. The movie is not good, but it has very large elements. The lighting and scenes with the camera work is wonderful. The story is slow and weak, but entertaining. The acting is bad, but not worse than what you would find on the SyFy channel. The music is pretty good and the gore is good. It has the great Leather Face in the movie and was produced by Bruce Campbell. I watched the full movie and although it was mostly predictable, it was still nice. The women are attractive enough and the main actor does a good job of being fragile and creepy. The movie was remarkably clean for a modern movie and the violence for children 13 and up. There were no sex scenes. I gave it 7 out of 10 and I think it's fair. I'll see it again if I had nothing better to do. The gay-sounding angel was the most annoying aspect of the movie, the devil being very creepy.
