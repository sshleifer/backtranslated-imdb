Not everything is said in this excellent first feature of CÃ©line Sciamma. The friendship, the "wants to fit in", the first sexual feelings ... All this and more are sublimated by the underwater synchro swimming scenes. <br /> <br /> All three girls in the movie are trying to find and express their personality in a completely different way. This is a much less violent approach to teenage understanding compared to, say, "Thirteen", but a very good journey. <br /> <br /> A must see and leave all American cinematographic assumptions. The soundtrack is A + on the go. <br /> <br /> Bon cinema!
