Mr. Irving Berlin, with musical speaker, gave Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers another top fitting music. Although in this case like Jerome Kern confectionary Roberta where they were, the fleet follows Randolph Scott with another singer, this time Harriet Hilliard. <br /> <br /> Randolph Scott is a Navy CPO career and Fred Astaire is an ex-vaudevillian who has chosen to forget his former partner Ginger Rogers. But now the two are on land leave. Fred and Ginger come up straight where they left off, and Randy accidentally meets Ginger's dull sister Harriet who blooms in real beauty. But Randy is a typical love and looses the sailor. <br /> <br /> Again, Irving Berlin captured a hit story with him properly overseeing production. Ginger gets a very outstanding call with Lief yourself, after which she and Fred dance later. But the real hit of the show is Let's Face the Music and Dance, which is a song made at a naval show. Sang first by Astaire and later danced by the couple, Let's Face the Music and Dance is one of the great romantic numbers ever written for the screen. Their dance on this one is absolute magic. <br /> <br /> I'm sure that when I call Harriet Hilliard, some younger people might ask who it was. But they will immediately know when I call her in conjunction with her famous husband, Ozzie Nelson. This is right Ozzie and Harriet. It is a mystery to me why Harriet stopped singing when she just became David and Ricky's mother on television. Then she didn't even keep her own name. <br /> <br /> Not Ozzie or Harriet sang on television. Ozzie was a pale imitation of Rudy Vallee as a singer, but Harriet could really carry a song. She sings Get Tea Behind My Satan and the Moon and I am here, but where are you, both with real feeling and class. I recommend you see the Fleet follow as for no other reason than to hear a measure of Harriet Hilliard today incredibly forgotten.
