First, I must say that Before Sunrise, like all movies, is NOT a movie for every taste. It seems that some people are less clever in acknowledging this fact, but it is remarkable to think of the kind of direct aversion to this little innocent movie that is being induced by some. For me, as most people here, before Sunrise hit a deep cord in me, I was truly amazed, moved, inspired by it. It's a movie that ultimately benefits from more than one viewer. It creates some of the most unforgettable feelings and emotions you may possibly imagine. It is impossible to think of this world without ever thinking of the kind of inspirational feelings I got from it. <br /> <br /> The movie works as a community of two fragile souls starting to get to know each other. It is very intelligent and inspiring, not so much in how one conversation necessarily relates to the meaning of the topics of Jesse and Celine's discussions, but rather the small nuances, the perfectly worded responses they elicit from each other. It captures an honest, romantic, but fleeting human emotion that begins to bloom in the awesomely sublime Viennese environment; It convinces us that their elusive relationship can be the greatest compliment in the world. And what happens after that night is open to debate, but I never doubt they won't do each other again. <br /> <br /> The healthy comments by RockytheBear and the user below are hopeless examples of a doctrinal dissenter who is unwilling to accept and respect those who love this movie. <br /> <br /> See it and it can change your lifestyle.
