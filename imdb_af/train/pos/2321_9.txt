Here's the kind of love story I enjoy watching. And usually it's for two reasons. One of them, it focuses on young people, VERY young people. People who are still in their teens and for the first time love, or at least think they are. All of us are there in our lives and "The Man in the Moon" is a wonderful reflection on our memories, and may add some details and improve them beyond what we have experienced. The second reason is that it is a love triangle. And I believe it as teenagers, it's the most dramatic. And the story is so well developed that you believe that the characters really are in love or just as new to love that they just believe they are and after a tragedy or so, it will be for the rest of their lives believe. <br /> <br /> The film by The Man in the Moon is full of talented names. It's stars Sam Waterston, who is truly a versatile actor. He is also able to play tough district attorneys, as well as strict but caring and wise fathers as in this movie. There is also Tess Harper, Jason London, and a young, young Reese Witherspoon. You look at the young talented actress, as she is at age four and you think she's about ten years away, the Oscar award will win. All members of the film show good performances, and with the dialogue of the compelling script they are strengthened to look like real people in real-life situations. As if all this really happened. This kind of movie I want to see comes out more often. Love story or not. I would like to see movies that really make everything happen and not in any way bad or unreliable.
