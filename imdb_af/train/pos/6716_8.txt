Last, great Grade Z intrusion film maker par excellence Al Adamson totally surprises himself with this glamorous horrific sci-fi soft core musical comedy horror that launches dull and dull depths into sheer celluloid silliness and jaw drooling. In the grim totalitarian future of 2047, sex was considered an illegal act by the Big Brother-like impotent bumbling idiot the Controller (an amusing goofy Erwin Fuller). But, Sweet'n'sexy Cinderella (Radiant Blonde Cutie Cake Catherine Erhardt) remains determined to change things for the better. Using her beloved Fairy Godfather (a flamboyant camping Jay B. Larson), Cinderella lives a huge gala ball at the specific plan of the seductively handsome stud Tom Prince (dorky Vaughn Armstrong) and teaches all who make love, " a positive, pleasant and totally acceptable activity. <br /> <br /> Adamson leads this ridiculous yarn with his usual all-thumbs incompetence, which sets up the incredibly horrible songs and dance series with a totally sideways lack of skill and flair. The unwavering, despondent "We All Need Love" number with people in absurd animal cost that is uncomfortable over the forest is a hilariously horrendous wonder; also the equally horrific "Mechnical Man" routine with a lot of cavorting robots. Louis Horvarth's raw static cinematography, the sticky plastic miniature sparks, Sparky Sugerman's grossly throbbing disco score, the overwhelming generosity (overwhelming brunette hottie Sherri Coyle, guarantees special praise in this particular section), the brain-following puerile attempts to create low temper learning (Roscoe The Robot Law enforcer is particularly annoying) and the uniformly horrible actions (Renee Harmon's scandalous portrayal of Cinderella's wicked excessive stepmother, called the big boobie prize here) enhances the remarkably great cheesiness that is sparked in this beautifully terrible yolk .
