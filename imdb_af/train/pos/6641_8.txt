On December 28, 1895, in the Grand Café in Paris, the film history itself wrote while Louis Lumière showed his short films, all singles, to a paying audience. La Sortie des Usines Lumière was the first film to be played and I wish I was there, not only to watch the film but also the reaction of the audience. <br /> <br /> We start with closed doors of the Lumière factory. Apparently, since the picture looks like a picture, people thought they'd just see a slideshow, not something they hoped for. But then the doors are open and people are going out to the house. First many women, then men, and one man on a bicycle with a big dog. When all this is done, the doors are close again. <br /> <br /> Whether it's the first movie or not (some say 'L'Arrivée d'un Train à la Ciotat' was the first movie Lumière recorded) is an impressive piece of early theater. To be bored by this is impossible for various reasons. Simple reason: it's only fifty seconds long. But also for people who are normally just like the special effects films, there must be something interesting here; You don't see historical things like that every day.
