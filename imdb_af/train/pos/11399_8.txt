Okay, so is the plot on shaky ground. Yes, yes, there are a few randomly inserted songs and / or dance series (for example: Adam's concert and Henri's play). And Leslie Caron can't really, you know ... act. <br /> <br /> But somehow, an American In Paris' runs it all as a polished, first-class musical - mainly based on Gene Kelly's incredible dance talent and choreography, and the truck's charm looks like as if he was importing Caron in every scene. (He has to, because she looks like a problem with emotion.) <br /> <br /> Of course, the most advanced and technically awesome number in this musical is the 16-minute ballet at the end of the movie. It's incredibly filmed, and Kelly and Caron dance beautifully. But my favorite number should be Kelly's character who sings 'I Got Rhythm' with a bunch of French schoolchildren, and then breaks into a variety of American dances. It's just about proving how you don't need special effects if you actually have * talent *. <br /> <br /> Not at the 'classic' level with 'Singin' In The Rain 'but pretty high there. Appreciate the watch!
