Now I know that French prisoners did not read Lovecraft (and this proves my point that his writings in school should be taught, perhaps as a separate subject), but how did they think something that sounds like "ftagn yog sototh" possibly lead to any good? <br /> <br /> The movie takes place in a prison where four very unlikely companions stumble upon a magical book that, if read correctly, can get them out. While the prisons were going, the cell was completely unrealistic. It made me difficult to get into the atmosphere of things. It also moves slowly, which can tolerate people. But unlike that, it's a great horror feeling, and Sartre's "hell is other people" with a Lovecraft / Barker-type story, and rather successful. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: Take the time to watch this. This doesn't mean doing it when you work or go to bed or while doing something else. It is a movie that works best if you are immersed in it. Lessons to be learned: Yoga is bad, almost as bad as French women.
