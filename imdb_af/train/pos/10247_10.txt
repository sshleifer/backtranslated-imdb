This movie is banned in just about every foreign country I can think of. The Japanese people (?) Who stare at it, really had to be desperate, or we are just friends. Here's the kick: <br /> <br /> Three villains torture hell out of a helpless woman, they use all sorts of things to kill her, they burn her, kick her, turn around in a chair (more than 200 times!), they use healthy torture (by forcing them to listen to a static sound for over 20 hours! It doesn't sound that bad, but it can make you at least). They throw guts (probably from an animal) to her while she is eliminated, and she freaks when she wakes up. And who can forget the big final, the GREATEST EYEBALL TORTURE I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> If you haven't heard of these movies, and look at one without knowing it's a simulated sniff movie, you'll think it is! (Just ask Charlie Sheen). It is guaranteed to exploit people and make them sick! As I said purely underground. Check it out if you're a fan of underground horror, or foreign gore. If you don't, I strongly advise you to read the series before you look! From the gore, shock and creativity aspect it gets a 10, but from the storyline and all those things it's a 1. An underground classic ... <br /> <br /> My final rating is a 8/10 <br /> <br />
