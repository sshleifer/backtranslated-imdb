This film describes the life of someone who grew up in the worst circumstances, but unlike many, he actually grew up to be a respected person. What's more, it's a real story. <br /> <br /> Antwone Fisher is so innocent and yet he's just abused because he wasn't white. Antwone Fisher has been married to the same women for ten years and he never deceives with women, coke, cigars, weeds, alcohol or any of the things that are very popular in the places he grows up. <br /> <br /> There's not much more to say about this movie, it's great. The only score I can give is a 10/10.
