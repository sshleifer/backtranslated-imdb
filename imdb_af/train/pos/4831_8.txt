I wasn't going to expect it; I thought it would be terribly dignified and serious, and rather tedious and boring. <br /> <br /> It's actually much better than that, and I really enjoyed myself. I don't know too much about Queen Victoria except what most know - married to Albert, who died young, and she ever mourned him. To the circumstances she grew up was fascinating; In fact, I found myself seeing more of the story, and I suggest we can see a sequel at some point. <br /> <br /> Visually, the movie is wonderful. The sets and costumes are incredibly lazy, without being deceptive and over the top. The acting is above all for everyone involved. <br /> <br /> In a word it was wonderful!
