# 3 in young John Travolta's blockbuster trilogy. He dances to disco, rock and roll and country. He heads to Houston to find work and love. Gilley's is the hot spot, which is the time of the mechanical bull. Not to go out, I drove the bull to a club in Nashville. I recently watched this almost forgotten movie on television and remember how good it was and how good a year was 1980. That year I wear a black cowboy hat just like Travolta. Debra Winger was in her first. She looks beautiful in her red top. There is a lot of charisma. Bud and Sissy look like the ideal couple even if they are trailers. They only divide because it feels so good to come back together. Urban Cowboy has an incredible soundtrack. We hear Lyin 'Eyes by The Eagles and Lookin' For Love by Johnny Lee.
