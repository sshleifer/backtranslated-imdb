One of my favorite movies to date started as an adventure on the wild side of a team of four men from Atlanta. The idea of ​​living the Chulawasse River before being transformed into a lake comes from Burt Reynold's Lewis, who unknowingly drowns his fellas in their worst nightmare. But if the first half of the movie looks like an action movie, the second half carries the viewer in a totally different story, forcing our husbands to make a decision that they will change their lives forever. In very bad ways. At the end of the movie, everyone was forced to deal with scars that were just a good week-end on the river, but muffled to a struggle for survival. The movie (apart from some clear goofs) is very well aimed and beautifully shot in a paradise of nature that steals your breath. That photography is also excellent. Voight, Reynolds, Cox and Beatty are all great at showing how a single event can be destroyed in different ways. Four different lives are just linked to the same mistake.
