I was curious to know how critics responded to this exciting, inspirational film. I then went to Rotten Tomatoes and was upset to discover that the pompous peanut gallery that our country's film critics have, the movie an average of 43% (or "Rotten"). <br /> <br /> All I can say is, if this movie doesn't move you, you have no heart. (It is interesting to note that the same movie on the same site received a 74% view of viewers). <br /> <br /> Not that the opinion of critics is all important to me. After all, I can't think of a more useless, overpaid profession. Some schmo is paid to go to the movies (which is a difficult life) and do the same thing everyone does on the planet: form an opinion. But these chompes have a way of coming over, as their opinion somehow matters more than yours, and worse, they like to hate. <br /> <br /> I'll let this movie be old (good except for the f-bombs), viscous and a bit predictable. Yet you know right from the start that Cuba Gooding Jr., who portrays the actual naval hero Carl Brashear, will end up just like that, he comes across: determined and brave; strong and optimistic. <br /> <br /> But his performance and that of De Niro (such as Billy Sunday, a composite character of several real people) are so strong, so inspiring you will be Your feet cheering much of the movie's scenes, especially the courtroom climax. You must be a real stick in the mud not to move through these scenes. Like our country's film critics. Michael Rappaport is excellent, as well as a lovely, stuttering dive student who befriends Gooding's Brashear. If someone has seen "Higher learning," this character totally loses character. <br /> <br /> Anyway, confirm what I've always felt: don't listen to critics. See this movie and get inspired.
