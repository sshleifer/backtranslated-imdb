It is probably Karisma at its best, apart from Zubeidaa. Nana Patekar also gives his best, without even trying. The story is sometimes good, but by the end it seems to drag, especially when Shahrukh comes in the picture. What really made me was the appearance of the leaders, the dialogue, and the story, for what it was. It could have been better directed and edited. The support case was even great, including Karima's mother-in-law, although she had only one bright moment, it was wonderful to see her. <br /> <br /> The sets were also pretty good. I didn't really like their portrayal of a Canadian family, but once they enter India, it's so real. <br /> <br /> Overall, I'll give it a thumb!
