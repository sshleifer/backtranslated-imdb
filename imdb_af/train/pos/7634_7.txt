<br /> <br /> Okay, the movie won't win awards and it's purely bubblegum and it's a modern update on "It's a Wonderful Life." But it just came out as a cheap release on DVD and there are much worse ways to blow $ 13. You get a movie that has a surprisingly strong role, but for most they were another year or two to become B-list celebs. However, it is a pleasant way to pass an hour and a half, just don't think too much about it.
