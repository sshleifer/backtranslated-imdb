Tee Leoni plays Nora Wilde, a serious photographer, who goes through a bad divorce. She wants her freedom, but it comes at a price. She wants to justify photography, but is appointed to work for the tabloids as a paparazzi. Her boss is played by the wonderful and divine Holland Taylor. The performance was well written most of the time. TEa's Nora was developing to a rather memorable character, but the network just didn't support the comedy and they still don't. Even when they brought in George Wendt from Cheers, they made unnecessary changes to castings and characters. The show was good at first and the audience got used to it, but then the network became like a bad plastic surgery.
