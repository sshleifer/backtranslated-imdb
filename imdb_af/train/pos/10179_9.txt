The Cave is a very good movie. The great plot comes from the novel by Tim Krabbe, who also adapted this story to the screen. Some really top class acting not only by Van HuÃªt, but especially by Marcel Hensema, who mostly did television work before his performances by Axel van de Graaf. The movie looks like a brand new kick and sets an excellent mood. Then we start to learn about Egon Wagter and Axel from the Count, and the story is revealed a bit in a very compelling flash back structure that adds the romantic aspect and the character-driven drama of the movie. In the end, it all culminates in an emotional end, which will grab their audiences. Make sure you know as little as possible about the plot when you watch this movie. A must-see, especially if you like "Trackless" (The Vanishing's original screen adjustment).
