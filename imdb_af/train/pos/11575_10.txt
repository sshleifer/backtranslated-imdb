By saying this, I mean it's not a well-made movie, but it's a very good version of the real event and the best portrayal so far. And if you're a WW2 buff, it's a treat for you, as there are three out of four saboteurs playing roles in this movie. It is theater that performs at its best, but then it is still as before a semi-documentary said. <br /> <br /> I am personally a strong fan of our almost supernatural second world war heroes, and there must be hundreds. of these movies that show us what they did, it will not be forgotten by the next generations. Because children don't read books, they watch movies. <br /> <br /> If you want an action outrageously, rent private Ryan, it's the truth about deadly pain, outrageous endurance and the will to fight when everyone gets lost.
