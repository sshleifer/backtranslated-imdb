Well, this movie is a tough one really. Being straight with you does not contain much of a sounding story. It makes you "want" to know how it will end ... but I'll tell you something ... never did I have been so tense and jumped in front of my life! This movie does deliver the jumps and excitement! To be fair, I looked at it almost midnight, so I was so sleepy, so maybe it was explaining why I was jumping ... or maybe it's because this film is delivering in that aspect! It's actually about a couple who lose their child in a tragic event. They decide to move away and look for a cabin that looks in the mountains. Everything looks calm and calm until they have their first visitors. I think it's the main character's sister and she brings her husband along. During the night the man hears sounds ... check it out and that's when things start really wrong ... they don't stay for another day and tell the couple what to leave as if something isn't right. ... to cut a long story short ... finally find out what happened in the past few years and decide it should be taken care of. <br /> <br /> It's not a Hollywood blocker Nore has a big budget, but don't let it sit. It's creepy, tense and very very jumping! Just give it a try :)
