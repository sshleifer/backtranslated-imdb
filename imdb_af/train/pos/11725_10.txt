I suck at a free Boob reference, so I'm just going to write a clear flat (no pun intended) review. I love Elvira, not in a "I'm going-to-shoot-the-pres-just-to-impress-jodi-foster-fanatic" way, but enough to say I think she rocks. The movie is played like a 50-year-old horror movie, but rather nicer, look for the "Leasurely stroking of the single" reference to know what I mean. which relays shine through the movie, is Elvira's absolute charm (or should it be cassandras). For the first time I saw the movie at the age of 8, and I have seen it unnecessarily since. I really have to get around to buying a copy, but the video-streamed version looks a bit worse for the wearer. If any other fans of the movie want to send me emails, I feel free. <br /> <br /> Another great show by Edie McClurg (chaste pariah), an actress who never gets the attention she deserves.
