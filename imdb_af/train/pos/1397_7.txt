Shore Leave is usually an average Star Trek adventure. Nothing wrong with the episode. I just think it's not the best idea of ​​what the show was supposed to offer fans. It is lightweight entertaining, nothing more. However, I am pleased to see that a TV show of this kind had enough good sense to break serious intergalactic conflicts. In this episode, Kirk decides to give his crew a little, and a landing party is demarcated to a planet that looks like the ideal place for a holiday. As usual, the planet is not as peaceful as it seems to be. There are some action and tense moments, but most of the story is played for the laugh. Good, but unavailable.
