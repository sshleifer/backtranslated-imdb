This movie was a great movie about something we all touch. I know I have entered it many times in person. Thanks Will Smith jumped on the societal issue during management. People don't do it. An hour and forty-five minutes is not enough time for this reason. Personally, I wanted to throw my phone into the movie. I was glad to see other people in the theater seeing the message and plunging their phones with the empty bags of popcorn. I decided to disable all text messages on my phone and would encourage others to do the same. If you care for your family, let them look at this important public service announcement about texting while they are running, or they can kill seven people. Thank you for showing the way.
