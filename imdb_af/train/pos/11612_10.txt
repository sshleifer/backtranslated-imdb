Picture Bride paints a realistic and moving portrait of what it should have been like for Japanese men who, after the turn of the 19th century, brought them to Hawaii to work in the sugarcane fields. Most planned to return to their homeland, but few people could ever do it. Simultaneously, the fate of Japanese women, some as young as fifteen or sixteen, just as promised brides sent to men who only knew them by photos that were often 10 or 15 years of age or from another younger man. They also worked very hard hours in the field while protecting themselves and retaining their dignity. <br /> <br /> Director Hatta's portrayal of one photo, bride's courage and determination, struggling to survive in a foreign country and alien community under great physical urgency is ultimately inspiring and uplifting - a story of moral and cultural survival. There is a greatness and grandeur of the whip of character and landscape in Picture Bride that captures the attractive beauty as well as the violent harshness of colonial Hawaii. It is a film that is emotionally, intellectually and artistically rewarding.
