... and if you are very, very good, it will look Moon over Parador. <br /> <br /> This movie had a slightly stupid story, but it was definitely a fantasy and the decisive and acting was spot on! Dreyfuss was perfect as the actor / cheater, full of all the little neuroses and vanities you think actors should have. You get a look at what actors are like behind the scenes. <br /> <br /> It was one of Dreyfuss's best roles, just as his character has his best role to personalize the dead dictator! And the secret scene: like something from Casablanca, indeed! <br /> <br /> Raul Julia was beautiful as the Paratorial Head of Secret Police. He gets some very funny lines, some of which are other movies, like "Around the ordinary suspects!" <br /> <br /> And Sonia Braga was excellent as the girl friend - besides a very hot number: "You have to get an Oscar tonight!" <br /> <br /> Let's not forget Johnny Winters as the CIA agent and the various guest stars who play themselves: Sammy Davis Jr., Ike Pappas, Dick Cavett - all done perfectly. <br /> <br /> All in all, an unforgettable skirt under the Paradorean moon. <br /> <br /> -R.
