There is an old saying related to the exciting new movie by Joe Johnston that goes like this: "The man who thinks he can and the man who thinks he can't, is right." It is a highly suspicious statement that refers to self-motivation and belief in an individual, which remains true in this movie, even after roadblocks and family problems stand in the way. <br /> <br /> "October Sky" is about a young man who believes in himself called Homer Hickam, growing up in a strict, traditional family in the 1950s. Homer loves a small coal mining town where almost everybody becomes a miner. All his friends, Quentin, Roy and O'Dell, all think their lives will be different to high school like everyone else. Homer is not excited about the future. <br /> <br /> One night, while everyone stares at the air, a Russian spacecraft, Sputnik, heads over. It's something new for Homer, and he finds it spectacular and overwhelming. From this point on, his gaze on life will never be the same. <br /> <br /> First, he tells everyone that he wants to work for a career in the missile science area. Flabbergasted at what he says, his family passes that idea over their heads and continues with life as usual. However, his friends think this idea may have potential. Quentin is after all a very clever individual when it comes to this kind of thing. <br /> <br /> When the four friends start to test rockets, and blow a white poster fence to smithereens, it seems like a forest fire is scared for them, they are being forced to progress to end. <br /> <br /> The performances in this movie are absolutely from beginning to end. All the actors are performing as if it were the right mumbo jumbo here. Stand out in all the glory: Laura Dern as Miss Riley. It can be very good if an academic award material if the judges can recall at the beginning of the year when this film is released. <br /> <br /> The characters are also extremely well developed. Not only do the filmmakers give clear, clear reasons why Homers are interested in the subject, but they also explain to the audience how they succeed in following their missile work. We clearly understand all the characters' motives and beliefs, especially the father, who is bent over the eternal tradition. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the movie loses some of its momentum at the center of a stupid, regenerated romantic subplot regarding Homer's love interests and how his brother stole her from him. This type is becoming so common in high school movies, not that this film is aimed at high schools. The actors stared at each other unnecessarily, as in a trance. I did it without complaining in 1997's "Inventing the Abbots", but I had so little. <br /> <br /> But it's just a minor complaint. With an authentic watch period, cinematography worthy of an Oscar and real-life clips Homer and end-of-life friends, all of which grew up with the dreams, especially Homer, is the first major film of 1999 > <br />
