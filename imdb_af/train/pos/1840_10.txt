Great script and some of the best actors the world has ever produced. Montand gives the concept of police detective a sole wolf a whole new dimension of intensity and, above all, credibility. <br /> <br /> When a typical Hollywood policeman loses family, friends and pets to murder, he is usually given his minute of grief. But if the sixty seconds are over, he gathers himself, grabs his rifle, and throws his enemies one by one spectacularly. <br /> <br /> However, Montand's Marc Ferrot was really ruined - by his girlfriend's murder, of course, but also to find out she had another lover. In his confusion and anger, he does not seek revenge, but must find the true offender of a crime where his fingerprints are everywhere on the scene. So all his actions become inevitable logically. This is the main reason why this movie is sticking to our seats, but certainly not the only one.
