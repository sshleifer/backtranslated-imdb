I enjoyed this movie but hated it because I wanted to help this guy! I am in my fifties and have many friends in the music business ... who are still trying to become adults .... no more fans, groups, money etc. Not. And they have such a hard time adjusting. to a regular life ... if they see the new bands, etc. get the spotlight. It's almost like they have to start again. This film is proof of what many of the old rockers of the 70's and 80's are going through .... and that's where I find the movie sad and depressed. But it depicts the life of an old rock star abandoned and lost-in a credible way. The young girl arriving at his remote home reminds me of Hollis maclaren (Outrageous) ... and she is one lady in a movie you will listen to. This film is a must for people in their 50's who have seen the rise and fall of bands, people who knew the members and watched as they crawl over age and fade popularity. It's an almost perfect movie ... but in a way positive ... because of the whales. A MUST SEE!
