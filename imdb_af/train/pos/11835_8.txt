While watching this movie since I first watched the trailer, I was a deep surprise with this movie. While some of the elements and actions of the characters were a bit too cartoony, the dark nature of the movie really made it a completely different experience. Instead of the feeling-good-happy story, this movie takes you in a different direction that seems to be exciting but also disturbing. Most children do not understand the darker moments in the movie, which makes this movie more visible to adults. I was also impressed with cinematography, using animation and digital animation to create a seamless network of pans and tilts. The musical score was solid again, proving that Hans Zimmer is the go-to man when it comes to animated scores, and I never thought I'd say I really enjoyed Brian Adams' music.
