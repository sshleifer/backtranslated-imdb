Many people hated this movie, but I blame two facts. 1 - They want it to be too much like the first few American Pie movies. and 2 - they are trying to take it too seriously. <br /> <br /> This one I found was the best of all six, and I absolutely love Dwight. The plot is predictable, I will say, but then which teenage comedy IS NOT? Road Trip, Dirty Deeds, etc., they are all incredibly predictable, but still damn funny! I say it's worth watching, I love it, I find it hilarious. Do not look at it while comparing it to the first, for it is nothing. <br /> <br /> After looking at Naked Mile, it became clear that all the American Pie movies were over, and just about, the stiflers What is fine about me. <br /> <br /> Look. Enjoy. To love. xD
