Vonnegut's words are best experienced on paper. The stories he weaves are gossemar, silver strings of words and expressions that are not easily translated into a world of Marilyn Manson or Jerry Bruckheimer explosions.

I could go to a desert island with Slagthuis-5 and Bluebeard. <br /> <br /> The movie version earns 10, but the books are so permanent part of my interior that I can't do ... some of the screens left out of the movie are part of my memory. ..
