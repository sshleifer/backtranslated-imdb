I never met a single person (out of hundreds) who hated this movie. Say that someone who pushes it down is a small saboteur, or a victim of one. This movie has everything. Ask yourself: "Are you a fan of ...?" Then look at "Laputa". <br /> <br /> It's not my favorite movie, but my favorite IS was directed by the same person (Hayao Miyazaki). Anyway, this one is under my top five. And I saw quite a few movies.
