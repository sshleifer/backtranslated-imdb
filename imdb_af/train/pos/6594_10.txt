The two-person professor types thought they had invented it all. Today's people living in Polynesia have come from migrant Asians, who moved indifferently from the Far East, island to island, eastward in Tahiti and all the other exotic tropical islands of the Southern Pacific over thousands of years. But the established thinking just didn't sit with the young Norwegian ethnographer Thor Heyerdahl. If that explanation was true, how did some people born and bred in those islands, traditions, artwork and physical features not come from Asia, but South America? How can the vegetation of Ecuador, Peru and Chile look as much as you would find on the island, a few thousand miles away? Is it just coincidence that the islanders point to South America and say this is where their ancestors come from, led by Tiki, their equivalent of Adam? Meanwhile, how about Norwegians talking about Scandanavian precursors measured from the South American continent that they colonized, and, along with some of the indigenous peoples they befriended, were on the sea - WEST? It's too much to happen to Heyerdahl. With an incredible amount of moxie, a handful of crew members and the local know-how for traditional rafting, an expedition begins. It is so much a journey in human imagination, as it is a pseudo-scientific demonstration that such a journey is possible with only the basics of tools and seamanship. The Oscar-winning documentary can be dated in its tone and anglo-ethnocentric approach, but it boasts an adventure spirit, even the space program that began a decade later, as men are prepared to dare it all for a theory testing what they think is true. Great. Do yourself a favor and read the book first. It's a great page rotator and the perfect option for news line style movies.
