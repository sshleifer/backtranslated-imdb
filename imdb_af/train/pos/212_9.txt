Much like the comedy duo of his title, "The Sunshine Boys", a forgotten classic 30-year-old became later. This is almost called with other great movie comedies of the 1970s. It does not make sense that the simple detail of this film is given. Perhaps the best Neil Simon ever wrote. <br /> <br /> Walter Matthau plays Willy Clark, once half of a legendary vaudeville comedy, known as Lewis and Clark, now a bitter 73-year-old solo act not a work in a can get potato commercials. His cousin and agent Ben (Richard Benjamin) is sure he can get a job if Willy will only agree to reunite with his alienated partner Al Lewis (George Burns) for an ABC TV show of show business nostalgia. <br /> <br /> Nostalgia is what "Sunshine Boys" used in spades for it, from the beginning when a series of 1920 filmmaking showed several entertainers from a long time ago, before joining Cole Porter's "Be A Clown". Then there is the current introduction of the film in Manhattan, where swearing pants and wide polyester bands are abundant. The periods clash in Willy's glamorous mess of an apartment in Manhattan, where framed photos and cartoons of long-standing celebrities are staring at the lurid tabloid headlines and empty Zabar groceries. If you were like me in the 1970s, you might even feel like you were in that apartment. <br /> <br /> Willy clearly lived there for too long. He sleeps in front of the television when the kettle boils in the other room. Willy wakes up and picks up the phone. <br /> <br /> "Hello, who is it?" A break. Older men who live alone can be in almost anyone else's hands, but Simon's smart white and unashamed character changes this adaptation of his 1972 stage hit in the comedy. gold. The amazing thing about "The Sunshine Boys" is how much it rubs your noses in Willy's almost existential condition without even turning you off. "89 years old and just like that, he dies of nothing." Willy says of one old songwriter, before deciding the man probably died when he wrote a song that a "lady" had with a baby. <br /> <br /> Burns won an Oscar for his understated performance as the soft but sturdy Lewis, but it is Matthau who brings this one home, his makeup and proud but worn carriers, really sells you the idea that he was 73 when he made it. Willy is zealous in the extreme, full-fledged Ben's description, "Crazy Freakin 'Old Man", but you root for him throughout, enjoy his little victories even when they come at the expense of others. His lines also kill you, especially if he tries to kill Lewis, for whom the TV reunion seems to be a bad idea. <br /> <br /> "You're out of control!" Willy tells Lewis at one point. "I'm still in demand. I'm still hot!" <br /> <br /> "If this room was on fire, you wouldn't be hot," said Lewis. <br /> <br /> Director Herbert Ross shoots all in a very casual and understated way with low lighting and mid-range shots even in emotional moments, leaving space for comedy and film's overall message of grace by silent acceptance. You never get the feeling you are watching a movie, one of The Sunshine Boys' many charms, and Ross's direction, like the acting of the three principals, goes a long way to achieving it. <br /> <br /> Comedy is tough, especially when the subjects are watching the life go by, but "The Sunshine Boys" makes it all fun because it's for us to watch.
