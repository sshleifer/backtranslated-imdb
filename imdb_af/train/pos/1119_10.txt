Sandra Bernhard's Without You I'm Nothing, the movie released in 1990 followed on the heels of her 1988 Broadway stage production ... which she and others referred to as her "smash-hit one-woman show. "<br /> <br /> There were several changes in monologues and one-liners, and the movie version visually reveals the story, and takes Sandra from a wonderful life as a successful stage artist in New York, during what she call. her "superstar summer" to an illusory, almost desperate existence in her home in Los Angeles. Her fiction director in the movie refers to it as getting Sandra back to her roots, to ... food dinner clubs like the Paris room. <br /> <br /> There's a point to be made here. Sandra tries to focus her liberal worldview and her sometimes critical criticism of American pop culture on an audience that doesn't quite see it. In L.A. she plays to a predominantly black audience, who tries to relate her ideas when all these people want, "Shashonna", a Madonna look-like stripper. And even then, with Shashonna dancing to drama-like looks like "Like a Virgin", there's not much to say about the audience's enjoyment of the show. The scene in the club throughout the movie is drier than a leg. A funny scene to catch is from a round man helping Shashonna out of her pants. <br /> <br /> But if she goes down, Sandra does it with style and strength, and carries everything from false confidence to the hole vulnerability ... to the point where she is naked (literally), advocating acceptance and somehow swimming in the pool of her own transparent stars. Her portrayals of interactions with Calvin Klein, Jerry Lewis, Bianca Jagger, Ralph Lauren and (leading us to believe) are Warren Beatty's fiction and hilaries. <br /> <br /> Sandra starts her performance in her most uncomfortable moment, with a quiet but mistrustful version of Nina Simone's song Four Women, dressed in a mufti and other African clothing, singing lines like "my skin is black," "my hair is wool" and "they call me Sweet Thing." <br /> <br /> She revives and celebrates the ghosts of underworld art in an amazingly funny description of Andy Warhol, the exaggerated estate auction: "Allow Andy the wisdom and sensitivity of hours and hours of effort and labor in the Indian product ... that they were so fortunate to pay into this whole Santa Fe thing that happened . <br /> <br /> She explains Hollywood's exaggeration, comforts a disturbed friend and admonishes him and says, "Sir, if it's about Ishtar, I'm standing up and out of your life forever, because it is too self-sufficient, even for me! "<br /> <br /> Sandra illustrates the expectations of women in the era of feminism. Dressed as a Cosmo girl, Sandra tells her young girl fantasy to become an executive secretary and marry her boss. She eventually ends up in relief, "I'll never be a statistic, not me. I'm under 35, and I'm going to be married! "<br /> <br /> Sandra elevates the opening of sexuality in society:" When he touches you at night, does it feel right, or does it really feel? I say it really feels ... POSSIBLE REAL. "<br /> <br /> Finally, she cries for change in progressive American society by channeling and declaring disco greats Patrick Cowley and Sylvester," Eventually everyone will funk! " <br /> <br /> All this comes in the form of glamorous, quirky but wonderful cabaret performances of songs written and created by Billy Paul, Burt Bacharach, Hank Williams and Laura Nyro, to name a few. At the same time, the idealized fictional incarnation of Sandra - her self-generated mirror image - drives the town, a beautiful black model with flowing gowns and tight busters that read Kabala reading, chemistry and listening to NWA rap music. In Sonder Jou I am Nothing, Sandra Bernhard explores emotions and exists that until then she played as a regular guest on Late Night With David Letterman, her almost childish enthusiasm for shock, exhibited by the 80s be in the face of a subtle thrown away, and her confidence in the face of materialism and American celebrity remains refreshing. This approach to comedy will change Sandra's direction forever and mark the more mature, more pleasant entertainer to come. <br /> <br /> If you like subtle humor, you should be joking about glamor, celebrity, sex, loneliness, despair and level expressions of love and kinship, this movie will keep you in stitches. It should not be meant to be funny on the board. Maybe it's a little upsetting or even maudlin for some. But consider the emptiness of the world that Sandra is painting for you, and you'll just understand how funny and brilliant she really is. <br /> <br /> But seeing without you, I'm nothing with a friend "in the know" because it's definitely even worse. Before you know it, the two of you will trade Sandra hair and confuse hell.
