"Moonstruck" is a movie I liked for the first time watching. I really liked it the second time. I loved it for the third time. Now it's one of my all-time favorites. <br /> <br /> The humor is subtle but really good. The movie offers very warm humor. The story takes place in an old school Italian neighborhood in NYC. Cher's quest for love is enjoyable to watch. This film is by far the best work Nicholas Cage did on film. The old man's character is fantastic. He lights the screen without saying a word. The scene with his dogs crying at the moon was fantastic. But perhaps the best character is the one played by Olympia Dukakis. <br /> <br /> The movie's climax is a scene where the main characters protrude over a breakfast of oatmeal in the family kitchen. Exceptional direction and wrapping.
