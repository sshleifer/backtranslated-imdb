"Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey" is one of those wonderful old movies about pets. Earn a place among the big movies of his genre and even the theater world in general, along with other animal films such as "Old Yeller", "Napoleon", "Fluke" and "Air Bud". That means it's more than just a movie about pets. <br /> <br /> Could it just be a "remake"? It's too good to be a "remake"! I know this one heartily since my early teens (when I was 12). <br /> <br /> It's a family movie to treasure. It is emotional, exciting, adventurous, exciting, entertaining, humorous, charming, sweet, nostalgic, beautiful, heartwarming and sometimes dramatic. It's one of those movies to put a smile on the faces of those who appreciate these kind of movies. <br /> <br /> This movie does not have qualities. It has a good thought story, nice characters, excellent and relaxing instrumental soundtrack, brilliant landscapes / landscapes of the beautiful Sierra Mountains (in Oregon). In view of the views, it is not all the mountains: forests, trees, rivers, waterfalls, sunsets. Finally, all the wonders of pure nature - truly a full panorama. <br /> <br /> The most important human characters are nice, well-developed and well-portrayed by various actors. Robert Hays is wonderful like the friendly dad, Bob Seaver. Kim Greist is good as Laura Burnford. Veronica Lauren is just as good as Hope. Kevin Chevalia is conventional as the youngest and cute brother Jamie (his appearance really reminds me of Kevin Corcoran in "Old Yeller"). Benj Thall is wonderful like Peter Burnford. <br /> <br /> When it comes to our four-legged pals, Shadow is my favorite. Shadow is the loyal, wise, mature, beautiful, caring and loving old Golden Retriever (brilliantly pronounced by Don Ameche). Chance, the American Bulldog, is the opposite of Shadow. He is careless, stupid, impatient, anxious, clumsy, hilarious and loves to play (pronounced by talented Michael J. Fox). Chance cannot stop. Sassy is the hallmark of the cats' image: elegant, independent, very confident and confident, with a typical cathedral, but with a certain cat-like charm. Sassy is a Sealpunt Himalayan cat, one of the most beautiful cattresses. Sassy Field, who also does good work, is Sassy Field. <br /> <br /> Our four-legged friends, themselves, are great "actors" by nature: Ben as Shadow, Rattler as Chance and Tiki as Sassy. <br /> <br /> It's an underrated movie, but a classic one. The successor is clearly inferior. <br /> <br /> It should definitely be on Top 250.
