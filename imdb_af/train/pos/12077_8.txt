Many enjoy this 1945 riddle film about a young woman, Nina Foch (Julia Ross) who is out of work and fallen behind in her rental and is desperate to find work. Julia reads an ad in the local London newspaper looking for a secretary and hurry to try to get this position. Julia gets the position and is appointed by Mrs. Hughes (Dame May Witty) who requires her to live with her employer in her home and wants her not to be involved in male friends and Julia tells them she has no family and is free to spend all her time on this job. George Macready, (Ralph Hughes) is the son of Mrs. Hughes and has some very strange desires to play around with knives. It was a low budget movie and most of the scenes were close-ups to avoid the cost of a backdrop and scenery for scenery. This strange family lives all in a large mansion outside the Cornish coast of England and there are secret doors and lots of tension.
