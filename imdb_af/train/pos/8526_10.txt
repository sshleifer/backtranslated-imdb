I loved this movie! Chris Showerman did a wonderful job! Not only is he an incredible actor, but he is wonderful with a wonderful body! He did a good job on delivering his lines, and in George better than Fraser did. A great show for his first big role! This movie is full of hilarious scenes that every child will love. My kids have watched this movie many times since we bought the DVD on the day it came out. In addition to the movie, the extras on the DVD are just as hilarious. Two thumbs on this one! I recommend it to everyone!
