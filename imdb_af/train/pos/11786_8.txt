It's almost typical Lynch. However, what makes this movie a little unusual for Lynch is the fact that it looks very raw, almost amateurish. But I believe Lynch deliberately does it to give greater realism, which increases the intensity of surreal moments. <br /> <br /> However, there are many typical Lynch motifs present, such as: swinging camera work; haunting music; long (rude) breaks; hanging curtains; dull light grows darker at a slow (almost indelible) rate; extreme close ups; themes of women in trouble; Familiar, irreconcilable, all-known characters challenged with characters, temporarily unaware, in the dark and so on ... <br /> <br /> The performances are wonderful and the short is memorable. As usual, Lynch leaves almost everything for interpretation. Many questions are left unanswered and it ignores the imagination. <br /> <br /> Another brilliant effort by Lynch. I just hope he makes shorts, more in line with his Sony Playstation 2 ads. They were inspired.
