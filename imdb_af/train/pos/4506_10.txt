I would like to add the prize for the production of this film, especially the light cinematography. Firelight shimmering of smooth and muscular skin creates beautiful beautiful images. The film was nominated for (and won) a single Oscar - the first to be edited. Mala's performance is moody, pervasive and powerful.
