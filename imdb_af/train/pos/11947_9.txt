Simply written, directed and acted ... Woody's best of the 2000s, if not his best since the 80's !! Hugh Jackman was the perfect choice for his role. Scarlett Johansson's skater with Woody proves how good an actress she has become. <br /> <br /> It is refreshing not to be in a romance on the screen, with the front lady. He plays the perfect bumbling wizard. <br /> <br /> There were some reviews that made this movie difficult. Don't let them prevent you from seeing the wonderful movie. People in the crowd I saw here laughed in some regions, I missed the next line. If you like Woody Allen movies of the 70's, you'll be sorry to miss this one. <br /> <br /> I suggest you watch this movie with open minds, if you do, you can run smiling.
