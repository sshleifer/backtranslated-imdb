To prevent her homosexual friend Albert (Perry King) from being deported back to Belgium, Stella (Meg Foster) decides to marry him. The only other problem with this is that Stella is herself a lesbian. The two have their own lives when they fall asleep one night after Albert's birthday party and then in love. Later in the movie, after falling in love, Stella suspects Albert of fraud and appears one night late after his work at work. Whatever she finds, the viewer will be astonished. It's a good movie, very original. Perry King and Meg Foster are so good at their roles that it is wonderful that they are not better recognized for their work here. Many in the 1978 release, the "R" rated movie is now "PG" in this much more liberal time. <br /> <br /> Recently released on DVD, the disc contains a "Making Of" segment on the special features and states that the movie is based on a real story so that viewers who say the movie not "real" is wrong. Everyone is an individual and different people fall in love for different reasons. These are the problems explored in this wonderful movie for anyone who has ever loved!
