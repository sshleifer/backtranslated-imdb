I love the new episodes with CJ and Grandad. I also had the storyline with Kate falling for the principal. I want to find out what happens to Rory and Kerry and Bridget and the next family. I think CJ is very funny and I like his screens with Grandad. I always loved James Garner in everything he does, and it is a recognition of his acting that I never think of him as James Garner or Rockford in this series and in Kate's Dad totally believes in him. This family is so real and funny. It was terribly sad when John Ritter / Paul Hennessey died, but as in real life these things and the way it was written and treated in the series, both were funny and sad and always treated extremely sensitive and loving. But generally a very funny show with lots of fun and fun.
