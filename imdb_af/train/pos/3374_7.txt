"Soylent Green" is one of the best and most disturbing science fiction films of the 70's and still very convincing even to today's standards. Although flawed and a little dated, apocalyptic touch and environmental (typically for that time) touch still feel very disturbing and distressing. This movie's quality level surpasses the majority of today's SF movie because of its strong cast and some intense rows that I personally consider classic. The New York of 2022 is a depressing place to live, with overcrowding, unemployment, an unhealthy climate and the total scarcity of every major food product. The only form of food available is synthetic and distributed by the Soylent company. Charlton Heston (in a good shape) plays a policeman who investigates the murder of one of Soylent's leading drivers and he stumbles on scandalous and dark secrets ... The writing is sometimes a bit sentimental and the climax doesn't really come Not a big surprise, the atmosphere is still very tense and rude. The riot series is really disturbing and easily one of the macabre moments in the 70-year-old cinema. Edward G. Robinson is ultimately impressive in his last role and there is a large (but too modest) supporting role for Joseph Cotton ("Baron Blood", "The Abominable Dr. Phibes"). THIS is science fiction in my book: a nightmare and inevitably fading for humanity! No fancy space ships with hairy monsters attacking our planet.
