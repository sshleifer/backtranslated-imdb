This movie was more of a transition to masculinity for one gay man, and how to deal with everyone. His mother is depressed, his younger sister is a pain, his older sister accepts something. The relationship looks good with his boyfriend / exhooker and he leaves his family to try life with this first guy. Unfortunately, the new man scorches him and says it doesn't matter. Our young gay man goes bonkers and ends up in the looney bin and finally ends up, pours his new lover and starts over. We stayed with him and started to stay over, not to participate, in happiness. Maybe things will be better for him in the future. The end was kind of a downer, but the whole movie was quite realistic and therefore I would drop this real ending with a high rating.
