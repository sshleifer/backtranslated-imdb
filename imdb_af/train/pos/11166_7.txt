George Raft as Steve Brodie, the carefree, dancing-gambling player who can never venture, explodes against the lumbering, sentimental Chuck Connors (Wallace Beery). A soft touch for every panhandler, take Connors impulsively to waifs and straws, especially runaway orphans "Swipes" (Jackie Cooper complete with kittens!) And the homeless Lucy Calhoun, an out-of-town innocent with ambitions to " become an author. <br /> <br /> In this man-dominated culture, communication mostly takes the form of violence (one sees why the BOWERY is a Martin Scorsese favorite). Explosive cigars offer a running tuber. "Swipes" enjoy rocks by throwing windows in Chinatown, at one opportunity to fire a laundry. (The simultaneous arrival of both Brodie's and Beery's voluntary fire companies leads to a noise, during which the building burns to the ground.) Beery incidentally enters an awkward girl and throws everyone who is not with him, including Brodie He defeats a night-time fist fight on a moored ship, gaining control of his salon, losing on a bet that Brodie does not have the courage to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge. (Brodie makes the jump, but just because a dummy with a dummy at the last moment fails.) <br /> <br /> As usual, Walsh fills the frame with detail and illustrates it with the daily life of the tart. singers, pacifiers, whores of the suicide hall hung in the black mary, tailors who carelessly come from the street and compel them to buy suits they do not want. A lesser but admirable little film.
