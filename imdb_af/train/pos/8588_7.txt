This may not be the best movie of 2006, but it was just a movie to get excited about and think about. The Sentinel is a good political thriller movie that looks as if it is even alike to other elements of other political thriller movies such as In the Line of Fire and Manchurian Candidate. The basic plot of this movie is similar to other movies like this: A plot to kill the president of the United States. Michael Douglas died as a secretary agent, Pete Garrison, who only mirrored the operation to find out later that he was in the forefront. Kiefer Sutherland is co-star as a kind of rival named David Breckinridge and Eva Longoria as Jill Marin who is a newcomer. agent led by Agent Breckinridge and Oscar winner Kim Basinger as first lady Sarah Ballentine. One improvement for this movie could have been more action, as some sources consider it as much as an Action movie as a Thriller movie, but a good thing about this movie is instead of just an assassination kill the US president. go over a mole (traitor) in the Secret Service that leads the President in the wrong direction.
