Again, Jet Li brings his charismatic presence to the film screen in the movie Black Mask. In this movie, Li Tsui, an escape from a super soldier program that mankind is trying to regain what took the program away from him. To do this, Tsui decides to become a librarian to live a normal and peaceful life, but fate requires him to clear up his past problems before he can continue to seek peace. Other members of the super soldier program escaped simultaneously with Tsui, but they even want to get to the world rather than find inner peace. So Tsui becomes the only thing that can prevent his former teammates from releasing information that many innocent people can cost their lives. This movie screams across the screen with a furious fit and never lets its audience go. The martial arts are wonderful, but because they use wires, they are not appreciated much more than they are earned by American audiences. If you like action movies that have an interesting story and require good acting because they deal with both psychological and physical conflicts, Black Mask is for you. I'm delighted to see that some of Jet Li's movies eventually get the mainstream release in the United States and watch the changes that the release requires (things like dubbing and soundtrack) affect the movie. It's one of Li's best films, go out and see it on May 14 when released in America.
