It's a great movie. The non-stop patter takes several watches to fully appreciate. Busby Berkeley's music productions will never be duplicated. I think this movie easily leaves all its other efforts. Joan Blondell and James Cagney are incredible together. Some of the humor would almost push the boundaries of today's movies. Set out a rational explanation of how they set aside and enjoy it for the spectacle it is.
