Holly deals with the issue of childbirth of children around the world (about 2 million children are traded each year) and does so sensitively and without manipulation - a long-standing order that the team at Priority Films is doing very successfully. American actor Ron Livington starred in the movie with newcomer Thuy Nguyen, a Vietnamese actress playing Holly, and together they bring the screen common to the people in the infamous K11 Redlight district in Cambodia. Though it tackles a heavy subject, keep the film at moments of laughter and hope as we get to know the characters, the two-hour movie keeps in the one that is too difficult to watch. I'm glad a movie like this brings the world's attention to the problem. Child prostitution should be stopped and this is a very good first step. It's BIG and a movie that everyone should see.
