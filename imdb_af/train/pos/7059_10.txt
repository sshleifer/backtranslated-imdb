I was shocked and surprised by the negative reviews I saw on the web. I thought Cinderella 2 (as well as 3) is a very cute and funny sequel to everyone - children and adults. Like me, I'm 22 years old. <br /> <br /> I also find it and very informative film, it shows lessons to be true to yourself and to follow your heart. I thought it had great animation, and the voice was very good; the songs also performed by Brooke Allison. Since this film is divided into three flashes / stories, my favorite of the three, the story of when Jaq became the mouse became a man for a day, thanks to Fairy Godmother and her magic.
