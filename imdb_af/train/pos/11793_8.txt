I look back to the series as fast as possible. I try to see everything Star Trek. It's month 3 and I'm now on TNG Season 3 and I've been through DS9 altogether. Star Trek is the biggest television feature ever achieved. <br /> <br /> "Shades of Gray" is the first repetition section in the TNG series. After watching the programs, these tracks were fresh in my mind, but I noticed how some of them were shot again because the movie looked better. Season 1 was always dark and ugly to me - and the actors looked silly as they didn't fit in their own skins. <br /> <br /> The show is basically made only of the biggest hits of the happiest and saddest moments in Riker's life on the Enterprise to this point. The Data and Riker scene in the holo deck is a classic moment of new friendship. My other favorite is when the 2nd officer on the Klingon ship challenges Riker's authority as first officer and Riker hit the live CRAP from that Klingon. Then the admiral kicks his a $$ but good. This whole episode is a reminder that a lot of crazy, big things have happened in just 2 seasons with 5 more to go and a handful of movies! At this point in the series, they actually start developing the emotions that Riker joins Deanna Troi as Imzadi. Up to this point they mentioned the fact, but they still have to exploit it. Let the record show that the ST Wiki - Memory Alpha claims that Imzadi means "first" and indicates that she had intimate relationships with Riker and also remained deeply emotional. This episode also shows that there will be a long romantic interest in each other. <br /> <br /> Here's the article: http://memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/Imzadi At this point in the series, production value is accelerated and Star Trek TNG is busy in the fi behemoth to establish. It was destined to be. Looking again as an adult, I now see what GREAT ACTIVITIES offer the Star Trek universe. They should really make a new ST show made after all the current shows. A DS9 movie would also have been nice.
