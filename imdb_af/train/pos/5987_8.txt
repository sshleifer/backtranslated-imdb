Gabe Ryan (Frankie Thomas) comes from the reform school and goes back to the slums. His sister (Ann Sheridan) does her best to keep him out of trouble, but it just seems to follow him. Apart from its associations with the Termite gang, Gabe is being followed by real gangsters who have a scheme to set on fire arbitrary buildings to collect the insurance. They need someone to blame the arson, and Gabe is. It is up to the Termites to work the law in their favor and just give the gangsters desserts. <br /> <br /> The scene that the Dead End Kids introduces is really pretty good. The boys wander over to the new resident's furniture on the street and continue to make it themselves. They talk to each other in a haunting accent and talk about drinking tea together; Bernard Punsley takes a nap in a chair. The boys then continue with a fight with the new boy, but after proving him a good fighter, they ask him to join their club. <br /> <br /> The initiation scene is also pretty good, filled with mischief that first looks dangerous, but is really smart and innocent. <br /> <br /> Later, when Billy Halop is studying to become the boy's mayor, he has a dream about schoolwork. It was performed wonderfully, with small holograms of the children walking on his face and shooting questions on him. <br /> <br /> Angels Wash Their Faces is a great title because of the success of Angels With Dirty Faces, and really tells what the kids are doing. Notorious for bad behavior on and off the set, make these boys fine in this movie. But rather than look rude, it makes some big laughs. This is a preview of what many of the boys will become in The Bowery Boys series. We even get some curly words from Leo Gorcey.
