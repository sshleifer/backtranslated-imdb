The first von Trier movie I've ever seen was breaking the waves. Certainly a nice movie, but it's definitely in the shadow of Europe. Europe tells a story of a young German-American who wants to experience Germany just after the Second World War. He took a job that his uncle had arranged for him as a dessert on a luxury train. Because of his work, he travels all through an almost totally destroyed Germany, met with the death of traitors and hunting for former Nazi party members. Society is suffering from corruption. His uncle narrowed his dedication by focusing on the work he also had as a trainer on the train. Coincidentally, the main character becomes involved in bombing and terrorism by a group called whirls. They put pressure on him to help them put bombs on trains. The atmosphere is amazing. The viewer is taken from scene to scene by a man who tries to put the viewer under hypnosis and then counts to stir you up in a new scene. Just when you think you've seen a lot !!!!!!! Europe !!
