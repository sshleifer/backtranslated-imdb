I've never seen a quiet movie until July 24, 2005. I've never seen a movie with Mary Pickford in it. I saw thousands of movies. Very few are hypnotic to me. I found that Last of the Mohicans and memorable (Ray Liotta) is hypnotic, so consider the source as you read it. I started looking at Tess of the Storm Country on TCM just to see who this Mary Pickford was, which was highly credited for the launch of Hollywood. I didn't know what I was for. Two hours later I cut it out and realized I had seen one of the most beautiful women I have ever seen, a role that suits her perfectly. Imagine a movie fan in 1922, never seen anyone who is wonderful and expressive. You'll see her again. The environment was perfect for a girl who was expressive. She was a poor sticker, couldn't speak the King's English, but you had to admire her. What a movie ... time to start my Mary Pickford movie collection!
