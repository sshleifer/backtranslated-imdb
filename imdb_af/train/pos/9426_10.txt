This is one of the funniest ranges ever! I laughed until my sides split and rolled on the floor. If only someone in America would release. Region 0 or 1 - Non-PAL please. <br /> <br /> I know it's released in the UK, but it's also region 2 and PAL! Let's give this series his fair shake. America must know this series. Moffat is a genius. I loved Tracie Bennett's strange, goofy role in this. Of course I love Fiona Gillies! But Tracie was a treasure! <br /> <br /> Release this show in America! Or show it again at the PBS stations. I have to laugh and laugh again! Please welcome us! Please! <br /> <br /> Thanks for reading.
