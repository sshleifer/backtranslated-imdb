This is a pretty strange movie. It does occur as an exploitation term with violent and unrealistic situations, but uncommonly it is built around warlike rural characters, as opposed to an invading "other". <br /> <br /> The movie is an excessive stereotype of Vietnam veterans, in a long series of films depicted by war veterans as dangerous psychopaths. Kris Kristofferson's last line is "I have not lost a war yet", as he is experiencing a long road of murder and destruction, including the police chief and his brother's girlfriend in a very different scene. Kristofferson, however, is a good actor, and charismatic enough to carry this villain with a surprising depth. Vincent is clearly the golden boy, but with enough intensity over his clean cut goodness. The movie is similar to Winchester 73 where Jimmy Stewart tries to tolerate a criminal brother until he is forced to act against him. <br /> <br /> The movie has b-film-grade action, although the presence of Kristofferson, Vincent, a beautiful Victoria Principal and Bernadette Peters gives it an A-grade lineup. <br /> <br /> I give it a 7 for a long lost view in a US psyche of post-Vietnam / pre-Reagan introspection, paranoia, and confusion, and a film industry that was prepared for such topics address at that time. <br /> <br /> On this channel, a huge network appears that plays many old movies from the 70's to the 90's, regardless of political bow.
