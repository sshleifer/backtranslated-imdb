The best way for me to describe Europe, which is high on the list of my favorite films, is the exclamation that came from a companion after the movie ended: "I didn't know movies could be made that way." Quite original in its visual style, this is one of the best examples of what cinema can be. It's so far away from the "master and cover" style of shooting as you can get; perfect integration of very low image, sound, effects, props, dialogue, voice, execution, editing, lighting, etc ... all equal, no dominant. Despite Hollywood's "dialogue" myopia, theater is not about dialogue, and it's not about beautiful lighting, action or music. It works best when all the elements are on equal footing, where only the BLENDING of the elements, in the order or combination in which they are presented, will communicate the idea. Reduce or eliminate one element's contribution, and the movie has no meaning. "Europe" is what cinema should strive to be.
