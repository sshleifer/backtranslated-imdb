I watched this movie for Practical Magic, and the older movie was much better. I liked how the lighting, makeup and costumes changed, as Gillian changed the story. Jimmy Stewart's ways didn't do me much in this movie, but I thought they highlighted the Gillian's reserve. I was also hit by Nicky's and Gillian's ways - it was as if the director wanted to make him look and Gillian would look masculine. The gestures Nicky makes when he shows Redlich, especially his powers hit me. I have never thought of warlocks as effeminate, so it was an interesting way to contrast those characters.
