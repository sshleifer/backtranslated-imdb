I was deeply disturbed by this movie in many ways. First, I just want to say that Clara Lago was the most precious thing! Such a pretty little girl. Her performance was also excellent. True to life and very human. Even though I didn't like the part she had to smoke; I hope it was just a false prop. Anyway, she was absolutely wonderful and the story so moved. I noticed myself in the story and her character. <br /> <br /> It's very interesting how I discovered this movie myself. I ran into a clash and I just saw her pretty smile on the front as I walked. Luckily I looked in the downward direction that this movie was in! I thought to myself, 'Grandma, look at her!' So I picked it up and saw that this movie was described as such wonderful things as a little gem. "I read the plot at the back and then thought that, well, maybe I'll look it up on IMDb and then come back later and rent it later. I'm glad I didn't, because I would definitely miss it. After searching for a movie with my friend, I knew I would regret the end of not renting this movie, so I returned to the place where I originally found it and cut it. <br /> <br /> It has been a week at my locker room, as school started for me this week and I really didn't have time to see it, but tonight it was the perfect opportunity. I plucked it and glued it to the beautiful cinematography, wonderful score and moving plot from start to finish. I was so fascinating and must say, some parts have almost moved me to tears. <br /> <br /> I would also like to make a special mention to the young boy in this movie, Juan Jose Ballesta. He was remarkable. Also, the actor who played Carol's father, whose name is unfortunately not listed on the site. His voice was just as loving and soft that I could really feel his love for Carol. Although his appearance is not prominent, I really felt his character's presence. <br /> <br /> It's really a great movie. If you are a person moving through light but emotional movies, then this is definitely one for you.
