Nicolas Roeg's projects are the least variable, but are never less than interesting. "Insignificance" is, of course, first and foremost a custom play: it is decent and pretty much room-bound. BUT, it pays to watch this movie more than once: the underlying themes are not openly presented, and it takes a while to adapt to the underpinnings and role reversals of the four protagonists: Einstein, McCarthy, Munroe and DiMaggio. <br /> <br /> Einstein is intrigued by the blame over Hiroshima, yet the simplicity of a sexual relationship with Munro seems fine. Munro is sick of being seen as a bimbo and seeking intellectual credibility; Senator McCarthy is at the height of his witch-hunting forces, but is an impotent sleazebag; DiMaggio is uncertain about his well-known personality, self-controlled and prone to violence. Each of them contains the seed of their own destruction. Every character has a troubled, abused / abusive past and a dubious future. Gradually we see that obsession itself is the central theme. America's obsession with its post-war cultural icons and mores; the obsessions of the protagonists for something no one can have: peace of mind and / or happiness. <br /> <br /> Compared to the theory of relativity, a proposed unified field theory and indeed the cosmos itself, all the aspirations and interactions of Roeg's protagonists seem unimportant. Yet these aspects of the physical universe (that is all quantum, trust me!) Influence us when applied to the development of the means to destroy us. Monroe's reference to the principle behind the neutron bomb (without mentioning it as such) is not an anachronism, but can only be understood by a contemporary audience. Indeed, all the references within the script are only accessible to an expert viewer: once with 50-year-olds / personality cultures and how it affects us in the 21st century. <br /> <br /> This movie and its screenplay are either very, very clever or extremely opaque and pretentious. Eventually, however, it is unlikely. <br /> <br /> Live long and prosperous :) <br /> <br />
