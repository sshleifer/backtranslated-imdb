The Bible teaches us that the love of money is the root of all evil. The love of money leads to greed which can lead to pride and ultimately to destruction. Andy Hanson (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and his younger brother, Hank (Ethan Hawke), did not know how good the money was for them and those who loved them most. <br /> <br /> Two brothers, Andy and Hank, this is no different. Andy apparently enjoys the success of the work in New York's real estate market and is married to his beautiful wife, Gina (Marisa Tomei), who is the idea of ​​a trophy woman if anyone ever existed. However, Hank is a divorce found on the mercy of his ex-wife, his daughter's expensive school accounts and endless amount of child support payments. A man who has good intentions and good intentions, Hank can't escape the water she's slowly raised above his head, no matter how hard he swims to stay up there. <br /> <br /> But Andy has his own problems with the only difference between him and his brother is that he hides them better. He committed fraud against his company and is very involved in drug use to escape his fears. The pressure of his life and the lies he needed to keep his appearance, made him think he had to flee the country with Gina to start again. Of course, like Hank, he needs money to do it and believes he knows how to get it. How? By robbing the jewelry store that their parents own and run. This act of betrayal is where the Hanson brothers, their families and various other lives, will be destroyed because of greed, pride and fear. <br /> <br /> The uniqueness of before the devil knows you are dead is the way the story is told. After the robbery went wrong, and Nanette Hanson (Rosemary Harris), who is Andy and Hank's mother, is murdered, the story is told from different views of different days before and after the robbery attempt. We learn more about the motives of not only Andy and Hank, but also the reaction to their father, Charles (Albert Finney), to the death of his wife. The relationship between Charles and his two sons, especially Andy, is also being investigated and another possible motivation of the species is discovered after it is revealed that there is little love between the two men. Nanette is loved by her sons, but their father is a different story. <br /> <br /> Philip Seymour Hoffman once again proves why he is one of the most impressive actors in Hollywood by Andy as not only a greedy criminal with a lack of morality, but also, in a contradictory manner, as a man with whom we can sympathize. Ethan Hawke also brings Hank alive, not only as a loser, but really as a man who is just desperate to hang on to what little he has left. Andy and Hank are so realistically brought to life that it is easy to think of them as not just characters, but also the real images of lost and confused men now experiencing the consequences of their actions. <br /> <br /> Before the devil knows you are dead, a moral story is about how our actions lead to consequences we otherwise don't expect to face. More than that, our choices can also affect those around us in ways we never expected. In what was the best picture of the year, we see how lives are broken easily when the love of money is the ultimate pursuit to relieve our difficult lives. In other words, there are no easy solutions or answers to our problems and trying to find them can only make things worse. <br /> <br /> 10/10
