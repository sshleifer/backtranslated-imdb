What happens in the late 1990s to clear up rock-n-roll stars? They start a return / reunion tour. At least, that's what the members of Alien Fruits, a (fictional) 70-stadium rock group do. <br /> <br /> Tony (Stephen Rea) has the concession on condominiums when he runs into the boy's promoter. from a well-known music festival. It was at the feast in the 70's that Alien Fruits broke. The 70's are "retro" and the time is right to wide the wave. He is pushing for the other members of the group. <br /> <br /> Sharing what the band broke was the death and replacement of Keith, the lead singer and brilliant songwriter. The group was known for its excessive lifestyle and now they are all back from the working class they came from. Beano, the drummer, played by Timothy Spall (who was brilliant in Secrets and Lies) is a layabout, the bass player is a roofer and their lead singer is still a rocker. While having a large house, he was forced to sell it as his fortune didn't last. Brian, the lead guitarist, is dead, so a young guitarist is named to replace him. <br /> <br /> Somewhat unwillingly the group agrees to give the reunion a try. They leave their day work, start rehearsing, and their manager approaches their label about re-issuing their albums. But he wants them to start to tour again. And so they hit the club circle in Europe. The club scene is not good for these overweight, dated, old rockers. <br /> <br /> It is on tour that the movie really begins to develop. All the old conflicts back, with the figures of Keith and Brian right across the crossbar. They all hold together because they are all looking for a second chance for the greatness they disrupted earlier. And they rediscover some of the so-called interpersonal chemistry. <br /> <br /> Still Crazy begins as Spinal Tap II, but gradually becomes a more dramatic focused movie, based on the relationships of the band members. While it's still a very funny movie, it's the developing characters struggling to handle Brian and Keith's death and their own personal demons, which make the movie work.
