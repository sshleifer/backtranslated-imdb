The Ghost Train is a surprise to those who appreciate the typical 1940's humor. It includes the Second World War in the plot, but not as much as I initially believed, and the characters are a unique combination that plays their roles fairly well. Askey, who plays Tommy Gander's role, is what brightens the story for the parts that could be portrayed as boring or "dragged". <br /> <br /> The story of the ghost station is actually haunting, even for today's day standards. It's unique and the way the characters interact with each other is great to live out the secret that the Ghost Train is. Gander is actually a nuisance to all the other members, while the rest are pretty good. He is always the center of attention and can be regarded as "annoying", but it is by those who do not appreciate the humor of 1940. His humor is innocent and childish. It makes it fun to watch. <br /> <br /> If it wasn't for Askey / Gander, this movie would be shorter in action, enjoyment and the result would not be so effective. my opinion.
