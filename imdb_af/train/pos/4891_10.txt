A good concept, a good role, and what a pity there was no more time to rinse the story. I loved it and wanted more. Dench, Dukakis, and Laine, now there are some real women! Yet, Dench and her character only had enough material to carry the writing about some of his short moments. I put it on tape and will continue to see it, hoping there will be an idea that will end up being a sequel. <br /> <br /> Top Loading! - No Question! - No argument! <br /> <br />
