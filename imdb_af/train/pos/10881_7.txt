"Cut" is a full tilt-spoof of the slasher genre and accomplishes what it constitutes. Most of the standard treasures are there; the old, creepy house, the forest, the anonymous indestructible serial killer, buckets of gore, and of course, the couple interrupted by the killer while they were having sex (it's almost not a fairy tale). <br /> <br /> The set -The simplicity itself: film school nerds have completed an unfinished slasher masterpiece, unfinished due to the murder of some of the cast. It's also neat - okay, nasty - features Kylie Minogue in the first line. They are joined by one of the survivors of the original film, played by Molly Ringwald, who absolutely steals the film because she gets all the best lines. The rest of the players fit their roles well, especially the beautiful Jessica Napier, who plays straight while chances and gore fall out of her. <br /> <br /> There are many red herons and false exciting moments, and there is very little time to try and find out who the killer is because the movie is moving so fast. It also has an appropriate low budget view, including some awkward editing that is likely to be deliberate. Good soundtrack too. If there is a problem with this movie, decide whether it is a call or a tribute to the scary genre. Probably a bit of both.
