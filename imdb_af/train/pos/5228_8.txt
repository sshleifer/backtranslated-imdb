I found this movie hilarious. The spoofs on other popular movies of that time were some of the funniest I saw in this kind of movie. Give it a try. If you've seen the movies spoof this movie and you get the humor, you'll have to enjoy the movie. <br /> <br /> I (and the others watching the movie) felt the funniest part in the movie. (It's not a spoiler because I won't tell you what actually happens) was a scene with the "flashy thing" of MIB. When they first discover the device and don't know what it is ... and then later in the movie ... you'll understand when you get there. <br /> <br /> My only complaint about the movie is that I could never find it in DVD so I could buy a copy.
