It was incredible, which meant it was hard to believe that the "forgotten tribe" would make this astonishing migration twice a year and that the filmmakers, Cooper and Schoedsack, did not progress from the screens and shots. But what shots are they! The cinematography, under mostly extreme conditions, is brilliant, and the score of Iranian music added to the video edition adds an extra wealth to this memorable documentary. <br /> <br /> I had the pleasure to see it and Kon Tiki On the same weekend, which was a thrill and made me sure how difficult and hardy and brave people could be, whether primitive survival or need on adventure or in the name of science.
