This movie draws you so deep into the two main characters. I plucked it into my laptop without first reading the cover (let alone reviews) and was shocked for two fixed hours. Two lost ships of two different worlds collide. The sexual tension between a secretary and a criminal is almost tangible, even without any physical contact. By the end, I couldn't decide what I wanted anymore: our hero and heroine to pick up their hair or just fill their passion. RML could have done without a curious subplot and a traditional 100 minutes would have been enough. However, I'm nitpicking. After a series of Netflix, Blockbuster and local library, this movie has restored my confidence in good movie entertainment.
