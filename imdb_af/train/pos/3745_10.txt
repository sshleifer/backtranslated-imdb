Many mysterious stories follow the standard whodunit path: murder is the most dirty, collect clues, slap of possible perps, sprinkling of red herring, and inevitable pop-up between smart and even smarter crime solver. <br /> <br /> "Forgotten" leaves the good faith and gives us complicated characters who may or may not have done wrong. The fact that we have no easy answers at the end of three episodes and no neat package can frustrate some, but to me it was an intelligent story that disturbed and followed sin with the question: What does an evil man looks like? <br /> <br /> Excellent acting and production combine to make a mystery not easy ... forgotten.
