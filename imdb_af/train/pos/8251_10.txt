And this one is me. And not just me, as I can see here at IMDb or when the theater is abandoned. Why did the people like it? This is obvious: Everyone now knows zombies (at least the Horror fans of heart and the other through the "Dawn of the Dead" rediscovery or Resident Evil movies, etc.) <br /> <br /> Or At least they thought they knew everything about zombies ... this was until this movie came. And you might see zombies in a new light (maybe). It's not a horror movie, though it does contain violent scenes, but rather a comedy. A Satire to be exact. And it never runs out of steam! That's why I rated it so high. Pacing shows it's amazing, the acting is great and the writing has no (obvious) errors ... On the contrary, it's a jewel and if you're just a little bit interested in zombies, you should see it! And even if you don't like them, watch it! Because it's a big (comedy) movie!
