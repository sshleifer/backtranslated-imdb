This review is for the extended track of this movie. <br /> <br /> I first watched Dragon Lord when I bought it on DVD many years ago. I always liked this movie and you can read some of the more positive reviews to get the general idea. <br /> <br /> This is said. I always found the storyline a bit confusing. The movie is after all a love story. And it was always strange to me that a love story should end with a 20-minute battle scene. <br /> <br /> Well, in the extended version it's no longer so. The old "original" version starts with a giant run / rugby-like sequence that is the new end series in the extended version. The opening order is Dragon (Jackie Chan) who hangs around his house and pretends he has training and recitation when his father is there. <br /> <br /> Other sequenced are also shifted or extended in the extended track and the story makes much more sense when you see it. The pacing is also better and overall it just works better. It feels more like a love story and doesn't ask you questions as to why it is so drastic and dramatic as the regular version. <br /> <br /> I suggest anyone who is a Hong Kong movie or just plain Jackie Chan fanatic to get hold of the extended version and watch the movie as it was originally intended. (Or at least, that's how I think it's meant. Why would they make it different and rearrange some of the screens). When I did this to see it. I felt I had watched a completely new Jackie Chan movie, although most of the rows were the same.
