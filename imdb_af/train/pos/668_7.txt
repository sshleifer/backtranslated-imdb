I just watched "The Last Wave" in my school's visual arts library. It's intriguing, like all of Peter Weir's things, but it's not always as important as I wanted. I was intrigued by the ideas thrown to me (because they are very well handled by the film director Weir), but at the same time I am not stimulated enough by them. AKA, I got a bit bored in patches. <br /> <br /> The plot surrounds an Aussie lawyer who becomes obsessed with certain dreams he has, which links him to an Aborigone group he defends. <br /> <br /> It starts with an intense weather series and has quite a few awesome mood effects throughout (especially the bizarre, belching sound design) and strong direction; but it just didn't entertain me as weir's later movies. I might have to see it again. <br /> <br /> Good movie about obsession and secret. Because ultimately the riddle that exists between the whites and the Aboriginal causes very serious consequences. <br /> <br /> But God bless Peter Weir. For him alone, this movie is worth watching ... many organic director. Like an Aussie reaction, Malick! I give it a 7 because it has enough ideas to overcome its boring moments.
