This story was probably one of the strongest I've ever taken. John Singleton certainly has over and above this educational masterpiece. Brilliant performances throughout the role, but Epps and Rapaport have become the best and most convincing of the youngster's career. <br /> <br /> But as a college student himself, many of the issues that Singleton has touched are taken. to the extreme. In the sense that, while dealing with many college campuses, they are not being offered as big or out of the open as this movie will make one believe. In some cases, it was almost ugly to think that something of this nature could actually occur. Aside from the fact that it was a bit dramatic, the film was brilliant and I was stunned, unable to speak, just think. One of the things of this photo I will remember forever was a quote from Lawrence Fishburn's character: "Knowledge is power, without knowledge, you cannot see your power." Brilliant, not brilliant.
