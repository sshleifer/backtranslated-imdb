This movie plunged my heart. The acting was wonderful, the erotic music and the beautiful women came up to make this one a winner. The main actress decides to join a coaching service when she realizes that her husband doesn't have time for her. She walks into a whole new world, her first client is another woman. It's a movie you definitely don't want to succeed.
