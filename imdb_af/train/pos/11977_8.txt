OK. Who brought the cheese. I love it. During this run it became a phenomenon. The anorexic twins have become popular. Bob Saget started a payroll (instead of his VERY funny site). And people knew who Dave was. This is when life was good and simple. It is one of the great American classical artists. It was humorous and always brought a good lesson to home. And that's where I differ from the norm: I've been holding the last few seasons. Like Home Improvement, when children get older, there is much more that you can do with writing. That's why I dare say ... It could have gone much later than it did. But anyway. I gave it an 8/10 because of its healthy, funny story lines, and because of Bob Saget!
