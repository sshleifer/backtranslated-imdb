It's a good movie, it shows what our government wants to do to other countries if we don't like their government. It's not as bad as Reagan and Bush did the number one in South America, but the US still has no operations with other countries like this. These movies also prove that US media spit government propaganda. This is exactly what they did to Aristide in Haiti. The reason why this coup against Chavez failed has been Chavez with over 90% of the vote. <br /> <br /> This movie is not just a political documentary, but it will still be a good movie if it's a drama, it's amazing that it really is. <br /> <br /> The other reviewer says when he says, "Chavez grabs the airwaves," the private media constantly runs anti-Chavez propaganda.
