Very good martial arts film and Jet Li has been the best since the master himself Bruce Lee. Li is excellent as the low key librarian / cop who saves all the time. He has a presence and a look that is sound and credible than the kungfu king you didn't mess up. Francois Yip is simply beautiful in the mixed race original way that is unique because of her mixed heritage, she has an innocence and an allure at the same time I found unforgettable. The villain, the man with the sunglasses and long hair was also very good, but I can't get his name on the credits. Can anyone help me with that? Thank you! Enjoy Hak Hap or Black Mask, in any language it's a good entertainment!
