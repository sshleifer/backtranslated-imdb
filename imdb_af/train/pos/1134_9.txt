The only part missing in this movie is Shue's share as the daughter who wants to follow in her "aunt "'s footsteps as a day's soapstone. Otherwise it would be a perfect 10. <br /> <br /> It seems that every actor enjoys their parts and persuades them to fulfill their own enjoyment as well as the writing - I have to wonder if a little ad lib'ing doesn't happen in parts. It was well thrown and there are a few classic lines that will stick to you. <br /> <br /> It's a fantastic movie that everyone should see at least once. I would recommend not drinking anything sticking out your nose. <br /> <br /> You'll definitely want to see the last scene now, "Nurse Nan" has a little secret, she doesn't want to share. with you. <br /> <br /> If you like daydream soap or despise it, move it to the right places.
