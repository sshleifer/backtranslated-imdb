Of all the movies I've seen, and that's most of them, it's by far the best one that falls mainly on the American Navy (Blimps) in the WW II era. Yes, there are other good LTA related movies, but most use special effects more than any real-time shot. This man's fleet has considerably more real-time footage of blimps etc. True, very stingy dialogue, but it makes even more interesting Hollywood movies today. P.S. I have 10 years (out of 20) and have over 5000 hours in Navy Airships of all kinds, from 1949 to 1959. Proud member of the Naval Airship Association, etc. [ATC (LA / AC) USN Retired]
