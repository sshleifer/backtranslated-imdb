This movie upset me so much that I watch it at least once a year. Sometimes I find it uncomfortable. Sometimes I find this empowering. And I always find the characters human and real. It's a movie that shows you the eager reality of life in LA. It starts with the recurring helicopter searchlights that investigate the dangers carried so close to ordinary life by characters. It's also a movie that shows how a stranger's friendliness can change your life and empower you to make a difference. Grand Canyon reminds you that every action you do, whether intended or not, has strong consequences. I liked this movie in many ways like Robert Altman's movie Short Cuts. Both had a star-studded grid of perfect role players and actresses, and both movies have gradually shown you how the characters are related and influenced each other for better or worse. Grand Canyon did a better job of providing a coherent message (hopefully in the face of desperate reality), as Altman's film, although I both intrigue them in their own way. This movie is a definite must see !!!
