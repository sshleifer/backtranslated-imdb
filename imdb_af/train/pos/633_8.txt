Stardust Another Guarded Review (originally written June 15, 2007) <br /> <br /> The marketing machine just started for this one (no site? Wth?), So I doubt most of you heard about it. In fact, I didn't have (kind of) either. When I received the post, I thought it was another code name and was actually worried that it was Transformers, one of the movies I want to see when I'm not working, and I enjoy it 100% as a mere mortal filmmaker. It didn't seem to be Transformers and I was aware that it was a return to that "Neil Gaiman movie". What is it about? Well, in short, this is a Gaiman fairy tale about a boy and a fallen star. Any more than that and I give away intrigue information that (a) is a breach of contract and (b) spoils your fun. If you really want to know what it is about, buy the book. Rumors have it, Gaiman can be something of a writer. <br /> <br /> Not knowing what to expect in a movie can be so nice if the surprise is worth it. And for this one it was definitely. This show was "special" because it not only included film critics, but also exhibitors (they rarely have mixed performances) and local sci-fi / fantasy people. So, you know the expected audience, right? I mean, with this crowd and the title Stardust, I knew what to expect. <br /> <br /> Oh, how nice I was. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's a fairy tale written by a writer famous in the comic book. But it wasn't Lord of Rings. It wasn't even another Lord of the Rings wannabe (Ahem, Eragon). It was much more intimate than everything. <br /> <br /> But, like Lord of the Rings, it was, but humanism of the movie, selling the fantastic features. It is definitely a romantic story, but with great humor. And that humor is of the kind that is not a slapstick Shrekism. It's more like drama and comedy. Before I go on, let's do this movie review thing. <br /> <br /> It's at least good. It's always hard to say more than fantasy movies, but I believe there were significant roles. Michelle Pfieffer is unfortunately not one of them. She plays a villain, and she does the job. Nothing special. However, Rupert Everett was a real jerk. It's a big villain. Peter O'Toole is, Peter Frickin 'O'Toole - who is wonderful. Ricky Gervais was thrown perfectly and showed why. Robert De Niro seems too much fun for the most part. However, when he wanted to deliver the goods, he did so. And Charlie Cox (who?) As the main character was a good surprise to a man I never heard of. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes. Claire Danes. Claire Danes. I've always been mixed with her. She can be good, and then she can miss the point. Here she is the former. And she's literally the star of this movie. Sure, her accent stumbles here and there. And yes, she's not as good as she can be if Cox isn't in the scene. But ... well, see for yourself. <br /> <br /> Special effects are muted but only achieved, and only significantly where it should be. Best flying ship yet - sorry Potter. Direction is light and flows nicely. Cinematography could have been better, but not all, in New Zealand. All the others are top brackets. <br /> <br /> Now it's finished ... <br /> <br /> ... the writing. Oh, the writing! Neil, you devil. In today's climate it is difficult to do anything original and only start wondering. A kingdom, a dying King, a boy to prove his own worth, witches, ghosts, a quest (or three) - what's new? But Gaiman's story draws you on the surface familiarity to exchange it all in a lovely original story of a boy and his heart. And although you suspect how it will all go, you start wondering in the third action and if you are, you find yourself in the exciting climate confrontation and hope for the best. In the end, you will find this story, this movie is what all fairy tales should be, but all too often it is not. Fantastic and really. <br /> <br /> (I wish I could talk about Septimus vs Tristan, but I won't ruin it for you. For those who read the book, it's sure it's done properly.) <Br> <br /> Those I spoke to had the same impression. A great movie for all ages to enjoy, and the new {HEAR} for this generation. The empty one is only filled in after the movie is released in broad release, because you can expect it. You will know when you walk, anyway. I sincerely hope Stardust does not get lost under the tent poles. Even if it is, it will be my pleasure to be in the hands of everyone I know. <br /> <br /> Forget the {HANDLED} disclosure. I'm a few years late, but ... "A great movie for all ages to enjoy, and the new PRINCESS BRIDE for this generation." <br /> <br /> Maybe a little elevated assessment, but I'm still confident that years now form, there will be the same. "Oh, I love that movie," responded, because there is now The Princess Bride.
