"The thing about my people" came as a surprise. We had no idea what to expect. The film by Raymond DeFelitta, and based on a screenplay by one of his stars, Paul Reiser, was a pleasant time at the movies. Although the movie is predictable and we know what the outcome will be, it is a discovery series where Ben gets to know his father, and Ben sees his father for what he really is, and not the first time in his life. mythical figure he has in his mind. <br /> <br /> The movie is a vehicle for his star, Peter Falk, and he walks away with the movie as expected. Mr. Falk, one of the most impressive actors who has been working in movies over the past few years, is an actor of such a stature, he must be reckoned with. As Sam Kleinman, Ben's distant father, he is a clearly misunderstood man, not only by Ben, but from the whole family and his wife of forty-seven years. <br /> <br /> When Muriel, the Matriarch of the Kleinman tribe walks away, everyone is panicking because this woman, who is the strong figure of the family, is essential to keep everyone together. She doesn't know where she went, Sam appears in Ben's house confused as he feels, suddenly, by the woman he has been faithful and has been faithful for years. <br /> <br /> The youngest son, Ben, travels his father to look for a home he wants to buy, so he can get his own family from Manhattan to the country. The trip excuses Ben for joining his father in ways he never knew, because the old man always projected a pre-set figure to his younger son. Along the way, father and son realize how much they love each other and how wrong the old man is with his children. The love of Sam for Muriel extends over the years they know each other. they seem inseparable. <br /> <br /> Peter Falk is great in the movie. He made an excellent Sam Kleinman, the man who suddenly realized his life was going to change the worst. Mr. Falk shines as the older man and there is never a false move in his interpretation of the man whose whole world crumbles under him. <br /> <br /> Not as a Paul Reiser fan, we have to confess it like Ben Kleinman, he's right. Ben and his father discover how much they have in common and their love for Muriel, the mother who sacrificed her life to keep the family together. Olympia Dukakis is only seen at the end of the film. She makes a good contribution as the flying mother. Elizabeth Perkins plays great style Rachel. <br /> <br /> The movie has a beautiful look thanks to Dan Gillham's cinematography and Steven Argila's outstanding musical score. Eventually, the film shows a great team effort between his director, Mr. DeFelitta and Paul Reiser, who wrote it for the screen. <br /> <br /> Although this film is clearly targeted for an older audience, it should please anyone.
