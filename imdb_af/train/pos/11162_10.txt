High energy Raoul Walsh classic of 1933, The Bowery farm salon owner and operator Wallace Beery against bitter rival and dandy, George Raft, with adopted street child Jackie Cooper and finesse Faye Wray in roles playing between their big rivalry. It's not clear exactly what the rivalry is about, but everyone follows it in the daily tabloids. Many wisdom bars at the beginning, but the characters soften as the film progresses. In addition, the sheer exuberance of the scenes in Beery's salon. The various characters, sexy chorus, lots of drinks, a perfect creation of an injustice gift, not opposed by so-called pre-code restrictions, and then the Carrie Nations themselves come through Carrie Nation. It all creates a very lively picture of a long-lived life. I don't like comparing periods, but this movie is quite different from what you would see today. The film has a lot of heart and long lost innocence and is absolutely a must see.
