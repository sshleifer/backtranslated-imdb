When I first saw this movie in London in 1958, I was bowling over. I have never seen such a film before. It had a strange hypnotic effect, quite different from the movies I saw before, and it has a lasting impact. <br /> <br /> I believe Odile Versios & Marina are Vlady's sisters, if not twins. Surely the interaction is immense in its ability to influence the viewer. <br /> <br /> If converted to DVD - in Region 2 format - and in the original French language, I would love to hear and where it can be purchased.
