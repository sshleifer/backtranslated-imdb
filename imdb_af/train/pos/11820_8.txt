Heh, if I tell you to compare the Dark Knight with an 18-year-old cartoon-adapted movie rated 5,9, would you call me crazy? It's just to get your attention. Every day I meet people complaining. There are no good movies, which only know the recent blockbusters. Searching and exploring old movies is never a bad thing, especially those with good artistic values. Dick Tracy is one of those who cannot be easily aged, in terms of technology. <br /> <br /> The negative reviews mainly complained about DT's "disturbed" story. But it seems to me that the storyline is very clear, and I had no problem following it. I didn't see the comics, but I'm not a big American comic fan, but I appreciate the top-notch movie-making and performances. Perhaps the expectations of most people were too high on the story it would tell. But, if you see a movie that Madonna and Warren Beatty throw together, what would you expect? I had scrapes on my head, and can't help but wonder, did we really see the same movie? The title role, though not as competent as it sounds, could still dress him and charm the audiences. Madonna was more explicitly less than "breathless" in her seductive role, but added a lot of fun to the story. All Pacino was funny and wonderful to himself. He is apparently brave enough to go sarcastically on his previously successful roles. We can see a hybrid of Scarface, Michael Corleone, Adolf Hitler and Robert De Niro to bump our stomach to make us laugh. And thank you to make-ups. <br /> <br /> It's not bad for me at all. The surrealism really got me.
