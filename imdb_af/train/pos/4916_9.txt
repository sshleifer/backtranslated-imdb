Pest replaces femme fatale in this highly exciting noir shot in New Orleans by director Elia Kazan. Kazan always gets good performances from his actors, but also shows a visual flair for claustrophobic suspense with a combination of stiff compositions and beautiful single shot chase scenes. <br /> <br /> A man entering illegally is killed after a card game. It seems that he has a form of bubonic plague, so it remains essential not only to arrest the murderers but to collect all those who have contact. Urban and health officials are implementing a plan of secrecy rather than warning the community because fear that the perpetrators will flee the city and spread the disease. A watchman and an epidemiologist on the watch is an uncomfortable alliance, combining the waterfront that uses their contrasting styles of investigation. <br /> <br /> Streets raises a great ethical question about the public's right to know as the medical officer argues for a media exchange, which may create a greater risk to the community. Regardless of the outcome, you may notice the second time the actions of the film's lead role. <br /> <br /> Richard Widmark as dr. Clint Reed and Paul Douglas as Detective Warren appear briefly tempers and arouse respect for each other in their quest for the killers. Barbera Bel Geddis as Reed's wife has some good moments with Widmark in some domestic scenes that bring the right touch of (quiet more than comic) relief from the tension of the desperate quest amid the turbulent New Orleans waterfront, impressive by cinematographer Joe McDonald. Zero Mostel as a small criminal is clever and reprehensible, but sometimes sympathetic. Walter Jack Palance as the skeletal Blackie (Black Death?) Is simply outstanding. With a resounding intensity, Palance dominates every scene he has not only with great threat, but also the agitation of the charm. In addition, he is displaying a formidable athletics that allows for more tense continuity, especially in the movie's powerful final allegorical moments. <br /> <br /> Panic in the streets is probably Kazan's best non-Brando movie. It is filled with tension, filled with tension and edited. Surrounded by the local environment, Kazan offers a sense of reality that gives flexibility to display its visual style beyond the film stage, and with Panic he manages to aplomb.
