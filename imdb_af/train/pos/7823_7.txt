An excess but compelling narrative of the friendship between civil rights leader Steve Biko and Donald Woods. The first half of the film is the strongest we see the bond between the two men and how they help each other, but the second half is not so strong due to the elimination of the Biko character. Yet, it is a compelling movie with great performances by Kline and Washington, in the film that the latter puts on the map. Washington has also been voted Best Supporting Actor for the first time. Overall, a well-made film that could be trimmed a bit. 10/07 .____________________________________
