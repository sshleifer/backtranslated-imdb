I played this short on a DVD of the best New Zealand shorts, all good, but The French Doors was wonderful. It starts slowly and you wonder if something is going to happen. Just as you relax in the drum of the house renovation, the most haunting thing happens. <br /> <br /> EEEEkkk, I wanted to stop watching, but I was stuck. <br /> <br /> The films fall into the original fear of the dark and with little, if any, special effects. It chews your right to the bone. A simple but brilliant concept opened all the memories when I was young and dreaming of the most unlikely but haunting situations. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers' visual style is scared and the main character convincingly takes you through the story. It's a quality short I haven't seen before. <br /> <br /> The French Doors have all the features of a good feature, unfortunately, it ends after ten minutes or so. Nevertheless, a great end that desires you to know more. <br /> <br /> Thank you for the ride. These New Zealanders really are the talent. <br /> <br /> A new fan.
