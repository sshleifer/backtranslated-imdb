Four stories written by Robert Bloch about different people living in a beautiful old house and what happens to them. The first has Denholm Elliott as a novelist who sees the murderer he writes about life. Some ghostly moments and the end of the turn were good. The second obsessed Peter Cushing with a wax figure that looks like his dead wife. The third has Christopher Lee who has a child (Chloe Franks) and is scared of her. All this leads to a reasonable end (although the end in the story was much worse). The last is an out-and-out comedy with Jon Petwee and Ingrid Pitt (both cold) and a canopy that changes people into vampires! There is also a cute line about Christopher Lee playing Dracula. <br /> <br /> It's a good horror anthology - nothing scary, but the first and the end of the third gave me some nice little chills. The fourth is actually very funny and Pitt makes a very sexy vampire! Also the house itself looks pretty ... and very creepy. It is well-aimed with some nice atmospheric touches. A very good and unusual movie score too. All in all, a good little horror antology is worth looking out for. Try to watch it on DVD - the Lions gate looks great with strong colors and good sound.
