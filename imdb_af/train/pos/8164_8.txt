This movie was very enjoyable, but you will just love it: - you hate going to the dentist, but not afraid of a movie where one of them gets busy - you love horror movies <br /> <br / > I especially like the fact that some care has been taken to explain the brutal actions of the main character. The fact that he is completely obsessed with cleanliness (especially in the mouth) and then catches his wives, which gives the mud-covered pool man overnight, is a reasonably credible reason to go overboard. <br /> <br /> Prefer it. . I give it a 8.
