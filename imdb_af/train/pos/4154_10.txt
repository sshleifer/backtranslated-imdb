It was one of the best episodes of all time. Officer Sean Cooper was killed in his patrol car in '68. A dying conviction in the state official reveals that after the shooting he stole a block of heroin from the car. His case was reopened with the suspicion that he was damaged as a policeman. <br /> <br /> Further investigation into him as a police officer and one reveals a war veteran involved in a forbidden love. This kind of love was regarded as shameful and at least hidden at that time. <br /> <br /> While not the kind of love I personally support, he was still a policeman and a man and shouldn't. It wasn't killed. The soundtrack was excellent (watch me watch the DVR), and the selective use of black and white mixed with color to emphasize one object or give a particular feel to a scene was especially appealing. I'll follow this one repeatedly!
