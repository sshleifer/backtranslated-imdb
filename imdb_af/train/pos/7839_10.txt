The film was supplemented by critics at the time, but loved by the fans. This movie has now become a classic. Mix so-called 'surrealistic' footage at John Lennon's home, with lively footage from Marc Bolan & T.Rex at its best. This movie is not just a must for anyone who likes Marc Bolan, but gives a fascinating insight into the era. . <br /> <br /> These were the times when Marc was aware of Ringo Starr of the Beatles [who managed it] and you could even get a short spot from one Reg Dwight [Elton John to you] bashing the ivories in an amazing [and never officially released] version of Tutti Frutti and rocking and ballad versions of Children Of The Revolution. <br /> <br /> There are also wonderful scenes with Chelita Secunda [said that "glam rock" was created. with her use of glitter, etc.), Mickey Finn and even the actor of Catweazle !! <br /> <br /> The best scene for me is in the garden when Marc leaves the dining table, puts crossbones in front of a string section and beats acoustic versions of classic like Get It On and The Slider. <br /> <br /> Highly, highly recommended !! FIVE stars [out of five]. <br /> <br /> Rory
