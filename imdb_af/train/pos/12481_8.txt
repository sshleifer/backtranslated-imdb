OK, so I don't watch too much horror movies - and the reason for that is movies like 'Dark Remains'. I caught it on (a surprisingly feature-filled DVD) and it made me dirty. In fact, the only extra thing I think the DVD was missing was some new pants. <br /> <br /> The next day I told someone about it when I realized I only had about 10% of it. For the rest of the time I watched the pizza on my coffee table - nervous that my girlfriend would catch me if I actually covered my eyes. The few times I became brave to watch the screen, I jumped so hard that I decided not to look back. <br /> <br /> The movie recording is solid and the characters' situation was very compelling. The simplicity of the movie is that my bud button really caught up - it's just a bushveld, a cabin and a vanished jail - and a lot of darkness. Most surprising to me was the fact that it was clear that it was not a multi-million dollar production, but the makeup effects really looked like it was! It's also clear that it's a movie made by someone with a great love for movies. The sound design and the music really made use of my surround system, like many Hollywood movies, have never done. I noticed that this movie won the LA Shriekfest - a great achievement, and I think the festival saw the filmmakers' clear talent - and much more of this movie than I did. <br /> <br /> Beat the sound, turn off the lights, and if you want to keep your girlfriend - order a pizza.
