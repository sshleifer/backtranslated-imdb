This film came out 12 years ago, and was a revelation even to people who knew something of the drama in New York. The textbooks on drag performance say nothing of these vogueing houses. Anthony Slide's 'Great Pretenders' says nothing. Julian Fleisher's "The Drag Queens of New York: An Illustrated Field Guide", with his flow chart of influence that Julian Eltinge, Minette, the Warhol Queen and the 90's club center have washed away, completely ignores the homes. Even Laurence Senelick's "The Changing Room" - the closest thing we need to get to a definite book about carrier performance, beyond the film and does not provide the background information that would be expected. <br /> <br /> I understand from the movie itself, and several articles I've found on the web are that this home system goes back decades. The main film of a member of the house before 1990 appears to be Chrystal La Beija in "The Queen", 1968. The historical context is the largest missing part of Paris Burning. <br /> <br /> The movie is valuable because it focuses on a scene that is otherwise ignored. This is a valuable snapshot of life in 1989. The unfortunate fact that Venus Xtravaganza was murdered during the filming is a very dramatic end, but it is not the only movie about transsexuals that includes a lifelong murder. As we now know, Dorian Corey had a mocked body in her literal closet, but it didn't come out until three years later. <br /> <br /> Of historical interest, but we still need someone to create a book or documentary film that offers more context.
