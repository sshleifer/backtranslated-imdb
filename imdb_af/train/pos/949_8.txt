"Telephones" tend to fall under the pitfalls of a low budget and a hurry shooting schedule. Therefore, this film always tends to give the tendency. <br /> <br /> George C. Scott embodies Ebenezer Scrooge perfectly and comprehensively with all his cold tendencies, and still makes him a sympathetic character. The production value for this film was extraordinary, and never relied on boffo special effects or soundtrack set-up, but still relied on the depth and clarity of shooting at the site and strong background. A movie that definitely stands alone.
