Take a pinch of GOODFELLAS, mix it with the godfather, add some Roman mythology and many low mad comedy, and you have THE SOPRANOS, about an evil clan working from northern New Jersey. It's almost as entertaining as pro-wrestling. I'm not the biggest fan of this show, but I admire James Gandolfini's very intricate conscience Tony Soprano. I also came to admire the contributions of people like Gravelike Dom Chianese as admired but murderous Uncle Junior, silver-haired Tony Sirico, as Paulie and the very beautiful Edie Falco became confused as the double, tough-as-nails Carmela soprano. The violence is sudden and graphical, the body figures slow down every season, but it is often the small moments that matter most here. Look at Paulie and Tony's cousin Christopher (Michael Imperioli's late LAW & ORDER) as they get lost in the Pine Barrens and leave a bitter cold night in a deserted trruck, both convinced they've had it.
