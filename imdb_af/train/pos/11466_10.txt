I was happy to see Zero Day last night. It's an amazing movie. A very disturbing one to that. <br /> <br /> In a way, Zero Day is very similar to "The Blair Witch Project". It is shot completley with handheld camcorders. It's about 2 kids. Just your average kids. André and Calvin. They start a campaign against the High School titled "Army of 2". <br /> <br /> The entire story is told in the Video Diary of the 2 children. It shows relationships with parents, among other things, that show that it is just ordinary children, just like people we know or have knocked. We find out The defense force of 2's last mission will get Zero Day right. They plan to shoot high school there. <br /> <br /> You see how they get access to guns, how they plan everything, everything. They emphasize that the media didn't touch them at all, and there is no reason to do so. As I said, it's all called in Video Diary, and then they store the tapes in a safe to see Zero Day. <br /> <br /> Survillence cameras show the real shooting throughout the school. . Chilling indeed. The movie is very cold. Some of the things they say, how they plan it, you just have to see for yourself. One quotation I remember is the only time that Calvin is himself. He says: "Andre thinks it's just going to be a breakaway car, and I do it to many schools across the country. I don't know what he thinks, but the only way I get out of school is in a black plastic bag. " <br /> <br /> I'm probably not even giving you the right idea of ​​this movie. You must see for yourself. It's about festivals now. <br /> <br /> A +.
