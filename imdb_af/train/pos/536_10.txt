Few movies can be viewed nearly 60 years later, but remain as staggering as this. Technological advancement has not dated this classic love story. Special effects used are remarkable for a 1946 movie. The acting is wonderful. David Niven, Kim Hunter and especially Roger Livesey do an excellent job. The use of black and white / color adds to the creative nature of the film. It has not been seen on television for 20 years, so few people are even aware of its existence. This is my favorite movie of all time. Waiting and hoping for the DVD release of this movie for so many years is in itself a matter of life and death.
