Okay, let's start by saying this movie is not an exact version of Andrei Chikatilo's crimes and legal practices. While in the Politburo, having been "official policy" that the USSR had no serial killers, the judicial system has indeed dealt with other people, and "Killer X" (as he actually called) has already been sought when Fetisov Burakov brought the case . In fact, once they realized that they had several murders on their hands, the authorities awarded a task force of decades to detect and end the deadly spree of a man who did not fit into what is considered a normal serial killer no. borders. It's good that the director and writers consistently remind the viewer that the story is "based on actual events" only for a docudrama. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS FOLLOW **** <br /> <br /> It is said, this is a good example of a fast-paced Hollywood thriller that still has the basics of what happened. It's easy to follow and has just enough truth behind the version of events that make for compelling viewing. Yes, Chikatilo rapes and kills both children and adults, both men and women. Yes, clumsy laboratory work allows him to kill for years. Yes, innocent men were accused of murder and reported to their police. Yes, the gay community was harassed while the crimes were committed (although with Burakov's dedicated help). And yes, Chikatilo was made confession, not by the harpoing of the special prosecutor, Gorbunov, but by the gentle understanding of a psychiatrist named Bukhanovsky (although Gorbunov was really nowhere near the egoistic martinet depicted in this film) . Truths and Truths aside, all these events are dramatized in a way that consistently intensifies tension and fear. <br /> <br /> It doesn't hurt that director and co-writer Chris Gerolmo has a great role to play. Stephen Rea's increasing emotional involvement in the murders and the development of clues in the search for clues, Donald Sutherland's snarky manipulation of the Soviet party hacks and subtle backbone that becomes apparent when needed, hid Jeffrey DeMunn's infamous rage of anger Through a terrified attitude, Max Von Sydow's painful excitement of being part of a criminal investigation, enhances the sharp dialogue and sharp editing in ways that cannot be underestimated. <br /> <br /> For what it is, "Citizen X" is almost perfect (the "almost" due to one moment of self-happiness at the end that just doesn't fit). Highly recommended as fiction that is well-spoken, and no fact is suggested ... but considering the awkward "serial killers" movies that rinse out Hollywood is good enough for me.
