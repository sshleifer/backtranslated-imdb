Ho, ho, murderous mania! This enthusiastic adaptation of a great EG Comics horror story is undoubtedly one of the best episodes of the cable TV series ever made. Director Robert ("Back to the Future") Zemeckis makes the most of a spectacular script by Fred ("The Night of the Creeps", "The Monster Squad"). Dekker, focusing on a ruthless two-time housewife (played well by Maria Ellen Trainor, who was married to Zemeckis when she played in this episode) on Christmas Eve, set her on fire with a rocket. Complications arise when a depraved murderous man is dressed as Kris Kringle escapes from a nearby asylum and decides to pay Trainor a definite unfriendly visit. Alan Silvestri's haunting, moving score and Dean Cundey's typically polished cinematography further enhance the macabre fun. And Larry Drake (the lovely gentle giant Benny on "LA Law"!), With his creepy hiccup guffaw, a demented shine in his shiny green eyes, and a teachings, truly wicked smile, make for a sensational, sanguinary Saint Nick.
