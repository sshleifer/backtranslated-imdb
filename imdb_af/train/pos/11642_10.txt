'Intervention' helped me with my own addictions and recovery. I'm a middle-aged married father of two. I am very functional in my personal and professional life. Yet, I have pain from my past that I use to calm down, and issues from which I slowly recover. When these addicts and their families share their lives with me, they help me improve my life and relationship with my family. <br /> <br /> The show, unlike many others, is digging past the addict and revelation events that probably caused their addiction. Many of us suffer because it is too scary to go back and do, as Alice Miller says, "the discovery and emotional acceptance of the truth in the individual and unique history of our childhood." The show earns a lot of credit for at least starting this process. These digs are painful and difficult, but worth it. So much coverage of addiction - fictitious and non-fictitious - seems to ignore the underlying issues. It is often assumed that the addict just starts shooting one day or whatever for fun or pleasure or self-interest, and now they can't stop. Not so: addictions are about the death of pain. I can relate to the different events and hardships in people's lives. There are general themes and surprising exceptions. Many addicts suffered miserable abuse. Some children do not respond well to divorce. For those who think addiction is an over-reaction to a hardship, I would just say different people respond differently. Although some children are going to divorce well, others, like Cristy in the show, have fallen "in a heap on the floor" and their lives have changed forever through the event. <br /> <br /> For example, last night's counselor said that beautiful young Andrea is seeking confirmation from men. She strips cash for a 75-year-old neighbor and lets men abuse her. Does anyone sound familiar? The series is filled with information we can use to understand our own motivation and make adjustments to our lives. Often, we have the longest suffering with smaller issues. As they say, even a stopped watch is right twice a day, but a slow watch may remain unnoticed for a while until it makes your life miserable. <br /> <br /> To the producers: Thank you for pointing out the past upgrade for the follow-up. The graphics, format and theme music are also brilliant. <br /> <br /> To the addicts: thank you for your courage to share. Whether you helped yourself or not, you helped me.
