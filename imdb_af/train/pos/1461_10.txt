The film exposes the blatant exploitation of the Chinese worker - generally female - footage from the Chinese business owner who shares his unashamed and delusional point of view, his American counterpart also unashamed and daring, the oppressed workers who get a voice and of course , the drunken Americans wearing the beaded necklaces, celebrating unnecessarily in New Orleans. <br /> <br /> The brilliance of hope comes when some Americans are actually outraged that people making their beadwork chains are paid like $ 0.10 per hour to do so. You also have the feeling that the workers can have a chance to escape into the kraal factory, but will probably do so if they are tired and / or tired of working out the punishment that is popular with the factory shareholder. . up to 20 hours a day of hard work. <br /> <br /> I wondered where the necklaces came from, not realizing how utterly disturbing and difficult it would be to make them. I really appreciated this movie, as it exacerbated the impact of the American cartoon on something that we considered relatively innocent in our society on the other side of the world. Honorable mention goes to Wal-Mart. It's just wonderful. And clearly, just the tip of the iceberg!
