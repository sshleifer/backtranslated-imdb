Greetings again from the darkness. Insight into the mind and motivation of a wonderful artist. How strange for most of us to see someone who MUST work ... no matter what the circumstances are, otherwise his reason for life stops. To see Goldsworthy's sculptures come alive and to see his response to each is extremely voyeuristic. This artist creates because he has to - not for money or fame. This is his life force. If you see its failures, it looks like energy from its body looks like a roasted hot air balloon. It is not the fear of starting again, that is, he is taking off his energy from his work. To see him create just to have natural names and to remember his work is somewhat painful, yet breathtaking. He discusses stream and time in the minimal dialogue and there is little doubt that the artist and the earth are one in the same. When he says he needs the earth, but it doesn't need him ... I want to disagree. Only complaint is the musical score seems to slow down a pass that relaxes at its best.
