This animated movie is a masterpiece! The narrative, music, animation and storyline where everything is remarkable. My girlfriend and I saw it again for a second time and we got more insight from it. We invited some friends to see Spirit with us and they enjoyed it very much. When I asked them to come along to see it, they thought it was a movie about horses, but then they realized it was more than that. I love Esperanza, Spirit, Rain and Lil 'Creek, which reminds me of Nathan Chasing Horse, who is a lot of smiles in dances with wolves. Spirit has deeply symbolic meanings and metaphors that I find and inspiring. <br /> <br /> I saw Spirit for a third time and I want to see it again. I enjoyed "Spirit" tremendously because his portrayal of American Indians is realistic, dignified and non-stereotypical, unlike the movie "The Road to El Dorado", which was a total cargo because it was American Indians on a disobedient and stereotypical manner. But Dreamworks saved themselves by making Spirit a good movie I found acceptable! I hope they continue to make more animated movies like Spirit, and I want to see persecutions or spinoffs to Spirit if done with respect and without stereotyping American Indians. <br /> <br /> I recommend it to others who have an open mind to pay to see Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron.
