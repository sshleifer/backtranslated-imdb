It's just funny, watch it !!! <br /> <br /> OK they want 10 lines there: It's a 50s / 70s werewolf spoof. Many satire, some political. Feel like an early Clouseau movie (probably due to Alan Arkin), but with less flapping stick. If you like the Naked Guns movies, you'll love it too (again less slapstick in this one). <br /> <br /> Actually, the humor of light sexual innuendo (inevitably in a teenage comedy) varies into a very gripping socio-political satire. The transformation of the Moon High School from 50's to 70's is really funny. The sequence with the changing presidential portraits is brilliant! OK, maybe not brilliant, but still hilarious. There are tons (historical) cracks that start from the 50's cold war paranoia and late 70's inflation. <br /> <br /> Anyway, just look at the movie if you get a chance!
