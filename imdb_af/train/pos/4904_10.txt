Charming in every way, this movie is perfect if you are in the mood to feel good. If you like jazz music, it's a must see. If you like to see lovely characters that make you smile, bring a tear to your eye and swing as there is no tomorrow, this movie is for you. If you are looking for an intense, deep, heavy piece of art that is analyzed and analyzed, you might be the best at Darren Aronofsky (in other words - judge djjohn lights up, you don't know a good time when you don't see!) My only complaint is that the movie was just too short. I think I'll just have to look it up a few times to get my fill.
