"Panic in the streets" was a decent thriller, but I was disappointed. The central theme of a city attacked by a plague in modern times is fascinating, but the film never really investigates or develops it. It's well made and entertaining, but it's not as interesting as it should have been. The script for this one is very poor and brings the whole movie down. None of the central characters is really compelling or credible. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the film was made very well so it was reimbursed for the poor essay. The direction of Elia Kazan keeps the film tension and moves at a fast pace. There are some outstanding ranges, especially the memorable chase climax. When his direction was combined several years later with better scripts, the man couldn't do the wrong thing. <br /> <br /> The acting is also very good. Richard Widmark has always been a waiting man and does what he can with an underwritten character. Paul Douglas spends his time screaming too much, but also a decent job. The standouts in the throw are the two villains. Zero Mostel, known mainly for his comic roles, is effectively slender as one of the leading characters. Jack Palance is unexpectedly a cold villain. "Panic in the streets" is disappointing but still worth watching. (7/10)
