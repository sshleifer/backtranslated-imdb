There may be a special reason why The Fox and the Child hit a special note in my heart. I had just said good-bye to my new fiancee - from oh ... someday - for an unknown period I was a little overwhelmed with different emotions and I had the fall to see the brave face she needed. /> <br /> I watched a few movies and TV shows, but my interest went down from what I left behind for what's out there and what I didn't see. For this I thank this movie. <br /> <br /> If a nature lover and in advance heard of the movie, I was sure I would like it anyway. But I didn't just love it, I loved it. <br /> <br /> The technical mastery is amazing. How did they do that? How did they catch the animals as they did? It's just wonderful. <br /> <br /> The morale of the story is a good one and while the end is oh so French and ambiguous it is a happy / sad one. Again, it caught me a little off guard. As a man who usually keeps his emotions for himself, the end was difficult while on a plane full of people I would see for the next 15 or so hours! Maybe it's because the end makes me think back to what I've left. <br /> <br /> But for those few hours on the plane I was happy to see something new and original. And it's life. Sure, there are those things that you love and feel comfortable with. But the great outdoors loves a mystery. So next time I see something out of the ordinary while I'm in the open; I'm going to explore it, observe and embrace it. This is exactly what happens in this movie and that's exactly what you need to do with this darn movie / nature document. 8/10 <br /> <br /> P.S. It is two months of the plane trip. We do not know when we will see each other again, but we will.
