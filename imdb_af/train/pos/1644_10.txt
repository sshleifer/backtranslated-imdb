I saw the last half of this movie over a year ago and was delighted to finally make it available on DVD. Recently I looked at some of the reality series on PBS about farming, etc. None of them came so close to telling the story like this movie. Based on real reality, without bumps, dark, happy, tragic and enlightening, it is a movie that has to be shown to students or to everyone who is interested in early border living. Fine acting on the side of both Rip Torn and Conchata Ferrell adds a well done script. The opening credit states that this has been done even though funds provided by the National Endowment for Humanities. If this is the kind of product, tax can go on. I'll be glad to see more. I highly recommend it and encourage people to tell a friend if you saw it and enjoyed the movie.
