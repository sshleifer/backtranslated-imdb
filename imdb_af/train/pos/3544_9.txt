Guys and Dolls should be one of my favorite music films. It's a very fun movie to watch and nothing more. it embodies what people have forgotten about musicals musicals made to entertain, not to preach. Nowadays we rent and Chicago are good musical and good movies, but they fail to bring our solid entertainment without any strings. The only thing that bothered me in the movie was Marlon Brando, the man can't sing! It was very annoying to listen to him and sing when I couldn't understand him. If it wasn't for Marlon, I'd have given these 10 stars. Guys and Dolls offer fun entertainment that we seldom get. Look at having a good time!
