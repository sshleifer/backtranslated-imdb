It's a generally good movie, with good story, good actors and good songs. The cinematography was unfortunately bad. One of the worst points of the movie is the annoying chain of rows copied from Pretty Woman. Why? Does it hurt to try originality, Abbas? Mustan? Anyone? <br /> <br /> The movie is about a newly married couple, Raj and Priya (Salman-Rani). Priya cannot get pregnant after an accident she had during the previous pregnancy, and they eventually decide to use a surrogate mother, who will carry their child. They choose Madhubala, a vulgar prostitute played by Preity Zinta. The movie isn't really realistic, I mean, isn't it easier to accept? And even if they choose a girl, does that mean the man has to sleep with her? Have you ever heard of insemination? Anyway, if the writers heard it all, the movie wouldn't be made, so the concept is obviously intentional. <br /> <br /> Salman works very well. It's nice to see him play a serious character. But his character suffers from unnecessary and inexpensive dialogue about his great love for his wife and how difficult it is to sleep with another woman. Come on, it's cheesy and unrealistic. Rani is just about OK; She is generally effective and tries to do something with the role, but is completely overshadowed by Preity Zinta. <br /> <br /> The film belongs to Preity, which steals the show in a big way with its flawless performance. She makes the transformation of a loud prostitute easy and natural to a sensitive woman. She lives the film, emotions and loves her and, at the same time, admires her, partly because of her role, partly because of her magnetic and positive personality. This is one of her career-best achievements. There is no doubt that she is more talented than her contemporaries. She just has to do such roles. <br /> <br /> The movie's ending just highlights what I said above. It is tear-proof, exciting and very well done. Watch it for Preity. <br /> <br /> 7/10 for the movie! 10/10 - for Preity!
