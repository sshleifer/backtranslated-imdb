The biggest reason I had to watch this movie was that it died Susan Swift, an outstanding and all-under-sung actress. Time travel movies don't usually interest me and not movies about witchcraft, but this movie was fascinating and creepy. It did not rely on far-reaching special effects and it did not focus so much on the journey that the viewer gets lost and confused. It was a very creative film that was kept simple and focused with great acting by everyone.
