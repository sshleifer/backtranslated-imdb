In all my 60 years I learned that when we watch a movie, there is an identification (whether we like it or not) implicitly with a specific character. <br /> <br /> Sometimes because the character exercises some gesture, sometimes because the character speaks a definite word or sentence? what we use or what we would like to use? in definite situation. <br /> <br /> The movie in question must be viewed through this standpoint. Who now gets a parking spot? in a shopping mall, in the city center or in the street - taken by a car whose driver cannot remember thinking that he is not the only driver in the world? <br /> <br /> Who doesn't have the urge to "rub out" the sickly spit? <br /> <br /> The port said I was asking: - Did you identify with DELLA (played by Kim Bassinger)?
