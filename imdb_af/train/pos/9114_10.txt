Considering the lack of art with African cinema (or Black American Cinema). The Idea offers a multidimensional look at a community dedicated to hats and dealers. But the funny thing is it is not the focus or even the subject of the short. But this is the most unexplained claim of independence from these themes. The genre is unique and not the typical expectation. It is almost this room that first gets the eye, so it looks critical twice. The film has an aesthetic quality that lends itself to the real art of theater. <br /> <br /> And this is the true art of having an African voice that is extremely scarce. The movie does not copy to reach its message, innovate and evoke subtle stereotypes (not racial but character-based stereotypes). From a writer's perspective, the film is brilliant. It carries multiple messages that include a very fast character development. It should be remembered that this movie is less than 10 minutes away and it is very easy to establish character. The use of color texture and music should also be praised. But considering the director, Owen Alik Shahadah's last venture 500 years later, is expected music. But from a theme point of view does it seem like the idea is a departure, but the satire indirectly evokes a social problem? Brilliant things!
