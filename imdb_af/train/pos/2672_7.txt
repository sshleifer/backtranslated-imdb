"Journey of Hope" tells of a poor Turkish family and their odyssey of hope coming down in despair as they travel to Switzerland in search of prosperity. Although this Oscar is quite well-made, it is not in substance and has a lot of incompetence. Much of the movie's 1.7 hour run time is on the bus, get off the bus, get on the boat, get out of the boat, get in the bus, get out of the bus, etc. time that could have been better spent or left out. The story has a predictable conclusion, especially for those who are aware of the general crime of trafficking in illegal immigrants. A valuable and reasonably entertaining watch, but overestimated.
