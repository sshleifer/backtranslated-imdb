When I was little, I loved this movie as a gift and my sister and I loved it. we'll see it all the time. When our friends were over, we had a place to sleep and we would look at big rock tuck mountain and grandfather's magical toys. I am 21 now and I still love this movie, old friends and I recently met and watched, we knew all the songs and we danced and talked about how much Prophecy we hated when we were little. One friend bought this movie and grandfather's magical toys for her 2 year old daughter because she wants to share our love for this movie. It's really a movie that lets your kids see and feel safe, no violence, no bad language, just very good songs and important lessons.
