Like Talk Talk, the Boat is actually predictable (TALK RADIO because we know the truth of what happened, THE BOAT because we see it - the genre and the basic setup). This is not necessarily a bad thing, in this case. In essence, this means that the movie makers ultimately do not pick the way they can have in an American version of this story. THE BOAT moves relentlessly to its (finished) conclusion, but is so beautiful at every level you can enjoy the ride, the way you can enjoy a well-known cruise along a well-traveled (very nice) road. It reminds me of Harlan Ellison's haunting short story, FLOP SWEAT. The claustrophobia is at times almost palpable. Must have a nice long look.
