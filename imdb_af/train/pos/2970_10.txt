I thought Baseball was one of the funniest movies I've ever seen! This is spiritual humor that makes me giggle, and the fact that Trey and Matt are so over increases the movie's comedy. <br /> <br /> I just bought Baseketball on DVD and it's just one of those movies where you'll never get tired of watching it. I have a very short attention span and I think this movie has such a funny bit that keeps me entertained. The humorous quotes are memorable and can make me laugh for hours when I remember them later. <br /> <br /> Overall, I think Baseketball is a brilliant movie that everyone should see, especially if you are younger than I will make you laugh for a long time. <br /> <br /> Pse. Does anyone think it's strange that I both love them? hehe
