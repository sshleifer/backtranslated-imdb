The key to the joy and beauty, the pain and sadness of life is our ability to assume that life is basically what it is so that we do not constantly struggle with that single compelling truth. So we find peace. Elegant in its simplicity, but so difficult for most of us to understand. <br /> <br /> In this film, the director shows us this truth but lets us discover it in our own way. It's a beautiful but simple story, more of a fable, played very well. Watching the actors is more like being in a room with real people than just actors. <br /> <br /> I was having trouble writing a review of this fine movie so others would be motivated to see it. I have a loss. The story is about men in a bathhouse. Sounds like a real switch, right? But nothing can come further from the truth. The American title for this film is The Shower, but it is almost an antithesis for an important thematic element in this movie, which is the bath. I still have a loss. Talking about the story, or the characters, they will not do justice. <br /> <br /> So I'll just tell you how much I enjoyed watching this movie and how enjoyable and moving the experience was. I was also very entertained. I cared deeply for the characters and I care a lot about what happened to them. For any story, this is the highest form of praise. <br /> <br /> If you were moved by movies like The King of Masks or Not One Less, make sure you see The Shower. Netflix has it and the DVD video and audio quality is excellent. I watched it in the original tranquility with well done and well-placed English parts. <br /> <br />
