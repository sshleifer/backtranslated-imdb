Sarah Silverman is like a completely manic Zooey Deschanel and I think I'm in love already. Yes, if you love Jesus is Magic, you'll love it. If you didn't, what's wrong with you? Kudos to the comedy channel to kick it in my face. My life eventually has meaning, and "Your car smells like a farts" is my kind of humor. I'm a happy guy. The first episode laughed me hysterically and I look hungry for next week. It's like Grease meets South Park. Completely outrageous. Sarah Silverman is someone I could see reading the phonebook. Her delivery is exactly and o so funny. She never beat a rhythm. Think about it, it's not so much her choice of material. what are some very good things by the way, like this is the way she chooses to deliver it. Thanks, Sarah Silverman! Thanks, Comedy Channel!
