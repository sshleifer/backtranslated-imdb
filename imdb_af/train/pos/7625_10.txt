Although Kurt Russell was and probably the closest person to look like Elvis in show business, so many things were fake in this movie. First, the manufacturers claimed that Elvis opened his famous live performances in '69 after a 9-year-old haul for film by a white jump suit made in 1972. He also said he had sung "burning love" which he first sang in 1972. 'the wonder of you' he first recorded in 1970. They also claim that he got his first Christmas guitar when all Elvis fans know he got it for his birthday. I know that all the films based on the past have something wrong, but these things are so obvious to people who love Elvis.
