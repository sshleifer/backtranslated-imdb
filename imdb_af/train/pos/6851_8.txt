De Palma's technique hit his high maturity by the time of this film. This is a wonderful representation of his classic techniques, but unfortunately, as with many of the films that De Palma wrote himself, the story serves to perform the meta more than the interests of an emotional compelling story. <br /> <br /> The story begins with a CRAZY scene in which Angie Dickinson masturbates in a shower while looking at her husband. She is then grabbed and raped while his husband is unaware? - and the whole thing is revealed to be Angie's fantasy, as the man ceaselessly pumps her away in bed. She has a short scene with her son, a dead ring for Harry Potter, who ends with a joke she will tell grandma what he is playing with his dad. She then goes to her therapy session, where she complains about her dead marriage, before trying to seduce her therapist, Michael Caine. He refuses, and she is hurting and feeling unattractive and unfinished. <br /> <br /> Then a bravura 22-minute almost wordless sequence may be the highlight of the movie. Among the many things that De Palma collected from Hitchcock is the understanding of film as a pure visual medium to tell stories ?? And in the typical De Palma fashion, it makes it a way to show its formidable skill. The problem for me is that in this case one feels that scenes are unnecessarily stretched to merely show the director's skill. <br /> <br /> The sequence begins with Angie at an art museum. She looks at strangers, everyone involved in sexual or family activities, and then comes to sit next to a man next to her. De Palma tells a very complicated story without a single word about Angie's appeal, embarrassment, retreat and finally to the stranger in the back of a taxi cab. It puts everything on a wonderful lush score by Pino Donaggio, who also played Carrie. <br /> <br /> In the second part of the series, Angie slept with the man and got up to return to her husband. Again De Palma speaks a lot of narration without a dialogue being spoken, as Angie realizes that she doesn't have her panty, that her husband is already at home and no doubt wondering where she is, that she has probably contracted a sex disease , and somewhere in the shuffle she lost her engagement ring. It's all very admirable, but one starts to feel a bit alongside, as we are forced to do things like a long elevator ride from the seventh floor, then again, almost in real time. <br /> <br /> Spoilers from here! When Angie reaches the seventh floor she is killed by a big woman with blonde hair. The woman hooked up to her to the ground floor, when the door opened and Nancy Allen saw her there. There is a wonderful slow-motion sequence as Nancy gets in the elevator, Angie reaches to her, and the killer's blade gets ready to cut Nancy's hands. Then a few electrifying shots follow as Nancy looks up and sees the killer in the lift's convex mirror. It's all good, and by the time we enter into a dialogue again, you think; "Woah, it was just 22 straight minutes of pure visual narration!" Or maybe you don't, but me. <br /> <br /> A younger Dennis Franz has a great deal as a messy and difficult New York detective who rather wants everyone to do his job for him. He maintains Michael Caine and makes the outrageous implication (though so common) that Angie wants to be killed. Angie's son is also there, and he keeps Nancy and they are going to look for Caine's therapist and find out who the killer is. <br /> <br /> Again, there is a strong tie to a Hitchcock movie. , in this case Psycho (just like Obsession is a reworking of Vertigo). You have a woman we supposed to understand secretly a slut who is murdered in an enclosed space in the first 30 minutes, in this case an elevator rather than a shower. Then the deceased's family carries out an investigation, revealing that the killer is a man who is dressed as a woman to kill. De Palma even throws a doctor at the end explaining the psychology of the whole thing. <br /> <br /> It's very interesting, but at the same time, a viewer can start to feel a bit around, which is my primary discussion on this movie. It is definitely essential to watch and show some of De Palma's biggest objects, but the feeling that the story is a solid third behind the need for De Palma and its somewhat relentless sexual fantasies make it difficult to return. look at this one with cordial love. <br /> <br /> --- See other reviews on my website for bad and cheese movies, Cinema de Merde, cinemademerde.com
