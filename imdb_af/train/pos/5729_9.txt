It's a bit of a puzzle for many Lynx crowd. They tend to write it off as a kind of meaningless, rough, Lynch lace project. Like this, Lynch is gas between his real pieces of film art. Well, this can be a leap, but it is one of those intriguing flights you catch from a flute and ashamed to admit you enjoy. <br /> <br /> Dumbland distances itself beyond art. What can you do with aspects of modern life, but laugh at it. If you took it seriously, you would go nuts. You hook it in, smell it, taste it, feel its agonies, its unreasonable stupidities, and print it out in any medium you choose. It called art, and art is not stupid. But that's Dumbland.
