This is a wonderful story of debt-driven obsession. <br /> <br /> Matiss, on a lonely night walk in Riga (?), go through a woman on the wrong side of a bridge carriage. He passed by without a word. Only the splash in the water, followed by an auxiliary call, causes him to act. And then not too little and too late. <br /> <br /> The film chronicles its efforts to find out more about the woman. On a trolley of local bars he finds her pocketbook. He combines more and more of her life together. His "look" changes as his obsession grows. He must fix things. In a wonderfully filmed dialogue with the bastard ex-boyfriend, he forces Alexej to confront the debt they both feel. <br /> <br /> Haunting long tasks, a sharp soundtrack to emphasize blame, barking dogs. Footprints. Beautiful film noir with a beautiful twist. A good indie end.
