First, I just want to say what a great fan of Bette Midler is who I am. Stella is a very good movie with a wonderful movie (Bette Midler, John Goodman, Trini Alvarado, Stephen Collins, Marsha Mason). This is one of my favorite movies of all time. It's about a mother who raises a child herself, goes through many things outside her way to find her daughter, Jenny played tremendously through Trini Alvarado. This movie is very good and I suggest you pick up a copy to see it. Roger Ebert gave 3 1/2 stars! And it deserves 4! Great! I give it 4 out of 4!
