I saw the Thin Man series - Powell and Loy are definitely big, but there is something very sweet about Powell and Arthur's chemistry in this movie. Jean Arthur shone as she looked at Powell. There is an undeniable undercurrent between them. This movie may not be the white of the Thin Man series, but it is unmistakably charming. While I watched it, I probably thought Powell was on an off-screen relationship with Arthur. My friends thought the same. It's a movie where I wish I could go back in time (to close Lippe with Powell!) There is no end to his lovely playful smirks! Powell's character, Lawrence Bradford, is probably the closest thing to the "perfect man." Okay, it sounds too good, but I can't help myself.
