A very enjoyable movie that tells you how to watch old musicals / mysteries. It may not come close to Agatha Christie or even Thin Man mysteries as a film noir, but it is much more interesting than your typical "boy meets girl" or "let's play a play. or Freed unit, but it can enhance the classic "Coctails for two" and the strange "Sweet Marijuana", which runs in real time during a stage show, opening night of "Vanities", where a murder - and soon Another - discovered behind the background - finds out the murderer before the curtain falls? Sure, but the search is fun, though somewhat predictable and ruined by outbursts of comic enlightenment (fortunately in the form of the good-natured goddess of the choir girls Toby Wing) The stupid cop is just a little too stupid, the leading hero is just a bit too nice, the front lady, a little too gracious, the bitchy prime Donna bit to bitchy, and the enamored waif is a bit too self-sacrificing, but going as stereotypes, they are pretty stylish. There is a gift of really beautiful chorus girls, who are even better selected as the girls for the same Busby Berkley musical of the same period, which sometimes tends to be a little on the side. Yes, this movie could have been much better than it is, and the Duke Ellington number is embarrassing, but if you want to dive into old movies, it will be a great trip.
