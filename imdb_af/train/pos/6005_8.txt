Although this film is somewhat purified (because it was made at a time when people did not talk about sex), it is a very useful short film to show prepubescent girls so they know what to expect during menstruation. Not surprisingly, it was paid for by the Kotex company, although it is surprisingly much that Disney has made this film - as they made many educational films during the 1940s and 60s. However, the film was made good, but I think the movie maker missed a real opportunity. Instead of the pretty female narrator's voice and the relatively mere visual, it would have been BIG if they used Minnie Mouse and the rest of the Disney gang !! I know it would have given Old Walt a heart attack, but wow it would have been a wonderful movie! Incidentally, although the idea of ​​sex is almost indicated in the film, it is generally explained clearly menstruation. However, it does not have a lack of details (especially about community relationships) that I have included in the accompanying booklet. <br /> <br /> Now if I can figure out just why I watched a cartoon about menstruation.
