The creators of this fine film have done a tremendous job of engaging with the characters, as they suffered through this terrible ordeal. The terrifying scene in the woods was done so amazingly that you forgot that these men were just actors and play parts. Burt Reynolds and Jon Voight have never been better on the screen, as well as fine performances by Ned Beatty, Ronny Cox, Bill McKinney, and although he first appeared James Dickey, the man who wrote the book based on the movie , as the sheriff of Aintry. It is somewhat disturbing and children must be protected, of course, but it is a great dramatic theater.
