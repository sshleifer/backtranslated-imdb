I admit, the first time I watched, even Cowgirls Get the Blues, I didn't think it was anyway memorable. But now, having seen it the 7th time, I admit it has grown a lot on me. The characters of Sissy, Mrs. Jellybean, and the Countess became very engaging. And the romance between Sissy and Jellybean looks very sweet. Although the plot is very poor, I think the satirical humor is more than it does. Then there's the kick-ass soundtrack that contains the incredibly talented K.D. Long (who reminds me a bit of Patsy Cline) at her best. I can't think of a movie that woke me up to an ominous first impression, as much as Cowgirls.
