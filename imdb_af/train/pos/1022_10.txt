Stargate is the best show ever. All the actors are absolutely perfect for their roles. I love the relationship between the characters. If you didn't see this show, I strongly recommend it. Although this program is compared to Star draws much of the time, it can't really be because it's completely different. I'm a star draw fan, but I'll definitely be this show well above any of the star treks. Unfortunately I live in New Zealand and we do not get Stargate on our TV, so if I want to see it, I have to buy the DVDs and season 10 is not here, so I can't see it for some time depressive). However, this program is very good and is a must see, but be warned it is highly addictive. So in summer I like Stargate (and Amanda Tapping).
