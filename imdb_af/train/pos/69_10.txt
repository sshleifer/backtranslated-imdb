I was in the late-running cable channels once and ran about 10 minutes after the start of the movie. Every time I even thought about going to bed, something went on and said I had to keep looking, even though it was far away from bedtime. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been another easy slam thin anti-rifle movie, but instead they chose to investigate the aftermath of the shooting. And even better, the movie continues with the real life - just when you think they're going to take out the easy and naturally confronted way, come together and change the whole look of the movie. This film not only follows the formula, it shows how other events often emerge and / or affect what happens next. <br /> <br /> I just wish the filmmakers were investigating anti-depressant issues. more - the Columnbine children who did the shooting were on them for years and it was scary to see how Deanna had cut them every time the nightmares started. Until recently, they were giving up things like candy and first they started to understand the long-term effects of the drugs. It was very refreshing to see that the mental illness aspect of the story was given a little film, with a family member suffering from mental illness, I can say that the film was dead in all aspects of mental illness. Bravo to the director and writer who made their homework clear. And for those who think certain things can't happen in a hospital (I don't want to provide details), you're also dead on it. I'm there. The writing was so real it was incredible. <br /> <br /> BUY this movie and show it to your teenage children before it's too late. One day they will thank you for that.
