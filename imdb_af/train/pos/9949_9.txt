This one is quite a good surprise. Nice little story of the heroine's quest, very surprising metamorphosis of the four-eye-prize-gold-to-spin-type in a racial DD cup six queen. <br /> <br /> Visually a sight for sore eyes, not only for two spectacular actresses, but also for most of the actors' costumes and make-up. An unnecessary bit of cheapness came in a ridiculous caste elimination. <br /> <br /> Back to the positive: The movie is seasoned with some exceptionally explicit camera shots that you wouldn't expect in a soft core. Love that scene with the icicles, absolute classic potential. A slight minus only for (many) some strange scenes where bad behavior by minor roles briefly suspended suspension of unbelief. <br /> <br /> 9/10, including an extra credit for the serious loose effect.
