THE MAN IN THE MOON is a warm and moving drama that centers around a farming family in the 1950s. The main story follows a 14-year-old girl (Reese Witherspoon) who developed a loved one on a 17-year-old neighbor (Jason London) who eventually falls to her older sister (Emily Warfield) and how an unexpected tragedy is this dynamics dynamics change forever. The 1950s are lovingly elicited here and the script gives characters that you almost immediately care about. Witherspoon is already starting to show the Oscar-winning talent she will develop in this early role and London is a beautiful leading man. Warfield gives a quiet maturity to the role of the older sister who is also effective. Kudos to Sam Waterston and Tess Harper who play the girls' parents and Gail Strickland, who plays London's mother. I was unexpectedly moved by this quiet and influential drama that gained strong emotions and aggravated the meaning of family ties.
