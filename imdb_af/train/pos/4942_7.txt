I have to admit that for the first half hour or so of this movie I was basically lost. There was a little funny humor, but in turn was a bare bone plot and a general sense of futility about to make me think I was wasting my time. Then I suddenly realized I was enjoying it, for good reason. There was no blinding moment of realization and no sudden dramatic scene that grabbed me. In fact, not very exciting happens throughout the movie. It was as if I had suddenly realized that the film was meant to be largely useless - and it was in its very senselessness its charm. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman was an unnamed actor who started a "small project" for his career. He is going to play a supermarket manager and spend the day in a neighborhood supermarket to investigate the role. While meeting there and connecting with Scarlet (played by Paz Vega) - a cashier who wants more from life. He helps her prepare for a job interview as if she is playing auditions for a role while introducing him to real life. It's really funny to watch "him" (because that's how the character is identified in the credits), being overwhelmed by a visit to the local Target Store. <br /> <br /> Freeman and Vega were great together, with a weird but totally credible kind of combined romantic but dad daughter chemistry. If you feel lost at first, stick to it. In the end, it seems to be a wonderful movie. 10/07
