With the death of GEORGE NADER, on February 4, 2002, I thought of this most interesting program, which had been a short while, was a great idea with good story lines throughout. Generally unseen for more than 40+ years it is worth seeing again. The opening credits showed many different images, one of which was an exchange of COLONEL JOHN PAUL STEPP, driving his famous rocket, at the point where he is often called the "Fastest Man Alive".
