It is ironic that in the fifties, when Douglas Sirk succeeded best in hearing aids, he was virtually ignored by the critics? He is now seen as a director of formidable intellect who achieved his best work in melodrama. <br /> <br /> "Written on the Wind" is about the demise of a Texan oil dynasty surrounded by worthless reputation, alcoholism and nimfomania? It's about the twisted, deadly connections between sex, power and money ... Stack destroys a compelling portrait of a plagued drunk through frustration, arrogance, jealousy, madness, and some deep insecurities? <br /> <br /> Does Dorothy Malone succeed as an attractive woman with an excessive sexual appetite, enduring herself for Hudson and other fellow people in town? Her best rule: "I'm dirty." In a beautiful scene we see her shaking, drunk and sweating to a challenging mambo? In another who just cries about a model oil rig at her father's desk? Symbol of excessive wealth and male tyranny? <br /> <br /> The frenetic atmosphere is both palatable and enhanced by Sirk's beautiful use of colors, lights, and careful use of mirrors ??
