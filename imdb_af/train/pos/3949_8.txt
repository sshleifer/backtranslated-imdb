Like many people on this site, I only saw this movie once when it was broadcast in 1971. Certain scenes are in my memory and an overall feeling of unrest is how I remember being affected by it. I'd be thrilled to see it again, if ever made available for home video. <br /> <br /> Possible spoiler: I wonder if anyone else would agree that the basic plot setup and characters of a 1960 British movie, originally titled City of the Dead, embarked on Horror Hotel for the US release? There are some similarities to a later British film The Wicker Man. <br /> <br /> One detail stays with my years after watching the movie. It's a small but significant moment near the start of the movie. As I recall, a minister and his wife stopped helping people along the way, about 1870, somewhere from the West. The friendly apparent Ray Milland presents himself and his (daughter?) Yvette Mimieux a beautiful young dumb woman. While pastor Ray Milland helped with the wagon, a rattlesnake ran in the face and flushed, unaware of any of the characters except Yvette Mimieux. She didn't look scared at all, but stared at the snake with quiet concentration until it left. With this strange little moment we have already realized there is something extraordinarily unusual about these seemingly normal people, although the possible danger to the minister and his wife remains vague and uncertain for a long time. <br /> <br /> That one small scene stays alive with me after all these years, along with many others. The film has a ghostly quality about it that will not leave, and it is not surprising that people remember it so sharply. Someone should make it available for home video!
