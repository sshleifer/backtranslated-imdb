A super-comedy series from the 1990s (two series were made in total) that suffered in the British ratings due to poor scheduling. When you act against established comedies like 'Less', even the best new comedies will struggle to be noticed. <br /> <br /> Luckily I caught the episode 1 series and followed it diligently. I mentioned it to friends and family at the time, but everyone seemed to be looking at something else. Very, very frustrating. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I loved both series and never forgot about it. <br /> <br /> Then I looked it up on the internet and found that an ultra fan was trying to get both releases released "on its own". <br /> <br /> Well, both series are now available on DVD. <br /> <br /> http://www.replaydvd.co.uk/joking_apart_S1. htm
