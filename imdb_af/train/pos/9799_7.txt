An enjoyable Batman animated movie. Not on par with "Return of the Joker" or "Mask of the Phantasm", but solid. I love the movie guessing who Batwoman was. There was nice turning. Fun action series. I've always thought the Batman cartoons are better, then any of the avid Batman live action film is prosecuted. The trend continues here. <br /> <br /> 7.5 out of 10
