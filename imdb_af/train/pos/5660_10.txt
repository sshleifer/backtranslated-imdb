I may have seen an episode of 2 when the show was originally broadcast, but when I watched an episode on netflix, I was also addicted. I saw the whole series as 2 days. :) I really had Gary Cole's character. First, he is thoroughly rejected, then you start with the character ("These things have a thousand uses")! His folksy Andy Griffith meets Charles Manson meets Satan is wonderful. Charming, charismatic, smarmy, and uh kind of dangerous and with "kind of" I mean "really". I want to be like HIM when I grow up. Lucas Black is also good. The accent is also good. Anyway, I thought it was one of the best TV shows ever and you owe it to yourself to see it.
