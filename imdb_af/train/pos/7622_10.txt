I love this show! It's like watching a mini movie every week !!! The first episode was so gripping and terrifying ... so was part 2 of the pilot ... I'm definitely going to be in this exhibition! This is the true survivor! I looked at some of the other comments and I can see it after just one or two episodes the morons here are already crying ... Sorry if it's not another reality program, kiddies! Once upon a time there was ... now brace yourself! Real TV shows! And this one is actually good, unlike most of the crappy sitcoms today or the ump-tenth carbon copy of a Law & Order or NYPD Blue or CSI series they make up. See it yourself to form your own opinion, don't take one of the boneheads here!
