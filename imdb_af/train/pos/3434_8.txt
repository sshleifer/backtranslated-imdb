If the Australian Post Office ever needs a promotional film for recruitment, that's it. It is one of those movies whose heart is in the right place and you can look again. Miranda's show is on the rise as it shows an aspect of Australia that is unpredictable by many Europeans, as it can be cold, wet and dark, just like any other place, and just like any other place that is important is the people around you. The characters in the movie are warm and welcoming, and the prospect of a career in a 'dead post office' is a thought to be considered. Miranda started doing bigger movies, but I hope she always has a thought for this one.
