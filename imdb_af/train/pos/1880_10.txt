Dudley Moore is fantastic in this largley unknown classic. This film is a very witty movie that relies heavily on actors talent. Without Dudley Moore, John Gielgud, Liza Minnelli, and a few others, this movie could be a disaster. It is not always well shot and sometimes a very stingy music that has a state of mind (the "psycho" like music at the wedding struggle), but the play overcomes it. The character Arthur is hilarious, with his drunken comments. But he develops well into a more mature, well-rounded character, as he learns to live according to his own free will. However, the end is pretty bare. I don't give it away, but it can be improved. Worth to see.
