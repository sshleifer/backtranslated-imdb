I'm sure a movie about Carl Brashear's wonderful life story was made. As it did during the Civil Rights era, Brashear became an inspiration to people from all minority groups who were not prepared to pay for an expected status. <br /> <br /> Brashear as played by Cuba Gooding, Jr. leads by example in the behavior of the life he chose. Very similar to Jackie Robinson who integrated the baseball and left it out of his character and behavior. Like Brashear, Gooding knows he doesn't want life that his father Carl Lumbly has and Lumbly makes it really clear to get more out of life than he got. <br /> <br /> But while Harry Truman's Armed Services after World War II, the fleet still has its limitations. A black man can only be a cook or an official's valet, the real fighting parts are denied him. It is not good enough for Gooding who is applying to become a Marine Deep Sea Diver. <br /> <br /> Once at the Bayonne diving school, New Jersey, Gooding gets everything thrown at him, mostly by the Master Principal in charge, Robert DeNiro. DeNiro may have some remaining prejudices, but he is a hero and one who can inspire if one can reach racial division. <br /> <br /> The best thing about Men Of Honor is the chemistry between DeNiro and Gooding. They certainly come from different places, but as they get to know each other, both become honorable men. <br /> <br /> Other good performances are Charlize Theron as DeNiro's wife and Hal Holbrook as head of the diving school, a man who wants the fleet, will retire for reasons you'll see. <br /> <br /> Men of Honor is an inspirational story about people with courage to save and the ability to change.
