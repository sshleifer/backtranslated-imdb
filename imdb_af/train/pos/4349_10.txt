Sam Kleinman (Peter Falk) comes to his son's place unexpectedly. His son Ben Kleinman (Paul Reiser) is quite surprised to hear that his mother, Mr. Muriel Kleinman (Olympia Dukakis) left his father. Ben's wife, Rachel (Elizabeth Perkins) and his three sisters are trying to find Muriel while Ben and his father see a farm for sale. But this is not the end of their journey. The road trip becomes a long therapy session between Ben and his father. Raymond De Felitta is the director. of the thing about my people (2005). Paul Reiser is behind the screenplay and he has done a remarkable job. The dialogue between Ben and Sam is just amazing. And he has been working with the writing for twenty years. So it's no wonder it's good. Who would be better to play the father than Peter Falk? No one can tell you. And I really love the story of why Paul wanted Peter Falk for the party. Peter was an actor who made his own father laugh. And Peter surely made me laugh in this movie. It's just hilaries when they go fishing. And how does the old man play the younger one in the pool game and then hit him with the stick. The movie is often very funny and I've been laughing myself several times. But it can also change from time to time. You can't tell a story better than being told here.
