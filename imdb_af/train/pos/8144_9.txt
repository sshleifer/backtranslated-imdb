Having seen both "Fear of a Black Hat" and "It's Spinal Tap", I can honestly say that both movies really should be seen. There will be many times in "Fear" that will have you hysterical. It's no wonder why both movies follow such a great cult. "Fear" will soon be available on DVD. Rent it if you need to, but the only way to fully enjoy this movie is to have it for yourself.
