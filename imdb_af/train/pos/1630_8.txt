I can very well be one of the few who really kept this movie. I also saw this movie when it came out, and I agree with the latest report that Up The Acedemy was far from his time. The humor in the film itself is pure MAD magazine. I don't see why MAD stands behind this feature. It was also one of the few films of the early 80's to have a murdered guided soundtrack with the punk and new wave bands then made by L.A. originated. I own the soundtrack and I play it constantly until today. What can I say? There are definitely the worst movies out there. I don't see Porky's as funny as Up The Academy, there are a few good laughs throughout the film, and the jokes fall into stereotypes or are laid. Hey, nobody said it was going to be the Maltese falcon.
