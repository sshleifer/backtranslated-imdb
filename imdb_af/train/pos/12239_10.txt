Excellent farce! This is, of course, everything it intends to be. Fortunately, there is no social or political message, nor is there the slightest attempt in that direction. Can the plot actually take or take place in any particular time or place? Unlikely, because it is simple, just a movie, and movies jump out of imagination, not of reality. The only purpose of this movie is to entertain, definitely not to educate, and entertain it, with the truth being lovely and gently thrown to the winds. I think most will agree that documentary documents expect our relief and authenticity. But for entertainment I want what is described today as a "no-brainer", which is The Mating Game in all respects. For some chuckles and a sincere laugh from time to time, it's fine food fantasy.
