An unusual movie of Ringo Lam and one that is strangely underestimated. The blend of fantasy kung-fu with a more realistic representation of swords and spears driven by bodies is shooting in the first ten minutes. A diamond knife is cut in two and its waist and legs are riding the horse. Several horses are chopped. It is very unexpected. <br /> <br /> The story is very simple, Fong and his Shaolin brothers are captured by a mad maniac general and captured in the Red Lotus temple which looks more of a torture chamber than a temple. The general has an agreement with Kurtz in the Apocalypse. Now he sprayed the philosophy and made scary paintings with human blood. <br /> <br /> Production is very impressive and the environment is dark. Blood is everywhere. The action is very well done and mostly coherent as opposed to many HK action scenes from time to time. Sometimes the movie is absurd or the effects are cheesy, but it's never bad enough to destroy the movie. <br /> <br /> Find this one, this is one of the best HK kung fu movies from the early nineties. Just remember it's not child friendly.
