"The Mother" is that extraordinary piece of filmmaking - it reminds you, it doesn't push - and ultimately it makes you think. Very open about the main character's fate. Anne Reid (who I just thought of her appearance in some Victoria Wood LED projects and thought of a good comedian) is really great here. Not the stereotypical widowed housewife who was perfect in marriage and motherhood. And not everyone who was free-spirited and adventurous. She plays her character just with the right note that rings true (well, it did me). Powerful throw. Great writing. Renaissance of the European film indeed;)
