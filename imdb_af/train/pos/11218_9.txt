This anime is a must-see for the followers of Gospel. This is a previous work by Anno Hideaki, but its unbridled, dramatic style is quite in place. Also, those who did not keep the Gospel might find this issue a little more palatable. Gunbuster is quite unique to sci-fi anime, because it is actually based on true science. In fact, the show has some small "Science Lesson" interludes that explain physics behind some of the events in the movie. One of the great dramatic points in the film is the relative time of speed at speed near that of light. The series does a wonderful job of dealing with the conceivable traumatic experience of leaving the earth on a six-month mission near the speed of light and returning to an earth where ten years have passed. The main character remains the age of 17 or 18 throughout the series, while almost all other characters age significantly. Be warned, this display is sometimes heavy on the juice. It also has some of the most unimproved breasts I have ever seen. I found it pretty easy to ignore the skimpy uniforms and boo-hoo scenes, because the series is otherwise very good, but viewers with low juice tolerance may want to stay away from this one. On an interesting note, as always, Gainax has managed to run out of money in recent episodes. However, they managed to use black and white movies and more action sketches to make a good resolution anyway. The end is a bit stupid, but it left me feeling so good in my gut. I couldn't help it, but I love it. Gunbuster is, in my opinion, one of the best pieces of Anime.
