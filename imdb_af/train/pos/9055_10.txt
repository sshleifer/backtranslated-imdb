It's an amazing movie and all the actors and actresses and very good! Although some of the actors and actresses weren't very popular in the business, they seemed to have been around since 1 year! It was funny, rough and just a very good movie. In most parts I just didn't know what was going to happen! I was like I think it's going to happen, wait I think it's going to happen. All age groups will love this movie! In some parts I couldn't stop laughing, it was so funny, but in some parts I was completely paid out and I couldn't believe what I saw! I'm definitely going to see this movie again! It's one of those movies where it can't get boring. Every time you see it, it's so exciting. I definitely recommend watching this movie !!
