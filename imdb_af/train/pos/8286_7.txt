Larry Fessenden was beaten by most of the comments on this forum. Well, the worst mistake is obviously the marketing of the movie and the way the DVD could be targeted. Obviously, this is not a real horror movie, at least not for people who expect something that will be greedy and will be immediately satisfying. <br /> <br /> "Wendigo" is basically a movie apparently said from the minds of young Miles. Things that are not easily understood by children remain in their young minds and ultimately dominate their fears and the threatening world they cannot understand. It is obvious that Kim, the mother, is a psychologist, but she has no idea what is going on in her son's mind. It is also a story of alienation. Obviously, the father, George, is a distant figure, perhaps a workaholic, who seems to be in another world. <br /> <br /> Mile's fears reach a point of crisis during the week-end in the country. . The part of New York State, with its winter landscape, barren trees, plays havoc on the child's imagination. It doesn't help him to meet a strange figure in town, it creates even more doubt in his young thoughts. Eventually Miles's world comes down to him and he can do nothing, even the Wendigo spirit. <br /> <br /> The movie was well played and performed. Patricia Clarkson is excellent, no matter where film she is. Jake Weber is perfect as the distant dad who has the opportunity to get closer to a boy he doesn't understand. Erik Per Sullivan, like Miles, carries the inner turmoil in him. I thought he was extremely efficient, as the whole movie is Miles' own, which is about him. Finally, John Spredakos is perfect as the threatening Otis, a man who twists the world for the way he turned out. <br /> <br /> Instead of putting off this movie, future viewers should approach it with an open mind.
