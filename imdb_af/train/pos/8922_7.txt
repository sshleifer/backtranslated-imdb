The only noteworthy thing about this movie is that it was Steve McQueen's first major lead. <br /> <br /> McQueen's talent is undeveloped and raw, but refreshingly honest in this little sci-fi horror champion. Steve shows himself as the anti-establishment, hot rod car loving actor who would become a polished icon of the film industry, just five years. <br /> <br /> Later, McQueen would say he hated this movie and "he was the blob". But everyone has to start somewhere and The Blob is cute, fresh and innocent. We would all have stayed that way. <br /> <br /> The plot is fast and predictable, still an entertaining hour or so. And it's really fun to see Steve McQueen before he became the King of Cabbage (and Anita Corsaut before she became Andy Taylor's girlfriend). A blessed friend sent me the DVD back for a while and this is a valuable addition to my Steve McQueen movie collection.
