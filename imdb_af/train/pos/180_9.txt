When Gundam0079 became the movie trilogy, most of us are known, many of which were pure action and less of anything else. This OVA is similar to the opposite. Although there are only half a dozen episodes, it is not filled with action, but emotional stuff. The two main action series in this, I believe, are enough to satisfy me. After seeing so many Gundam series, movies and OVAs, I was completely ready for a civil esquire movie. This movie did it fantastic. What this film stands for is that both sides of the war have good and bad people. As a result, the Zones look more human, rather than the original films depicted as the second emergence of evil Nazis. Most people who do not like anime that I forced to watch this movie (lol) love it. So, I would recommend it to many people just for the anti-war story. If you're a Gundam fan and haven't seen it, don't read it; You have to watch it now.
