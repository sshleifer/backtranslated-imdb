This movie is one of my favorite foreign films, some of which are Amilee and My life as a dog. The similarities with those movies, as with so many foreign films, is that it takes an everyday cut of life and transforms it into a profound, thorough lesson. <br /> <br /> In Japan, a man who is bored with his everyday life and the trump of his married life, sees a beautiful Japanese woman staring out of the window of a dance studio. The moment it takes his train to succeed, he is surprised by her. But is it just by her beauty, by her distant glance, or by a connection that they will both discover that they are sharing? <br /> <br /> Our dance will have unforgettable wonderful characters who have to deal with painful realities by surpassing them through the world of dance. By breaking the traditional forms and stereotypes of Japanese society, they all dare for happiness and find that joy is not too far. It is one of those movies that is so magical and meaningful and in itself surpasses everyday life by showing the true magic and miracle that life can be.
