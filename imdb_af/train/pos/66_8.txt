"Home Room" came as a total surprise. Not having an idea of ​​what it was all about, it paid a lot of time because it didn't bump and what we see is how lives are changed by the act of a disgruntled young man who decided to sacrifice his classmates are the innocent victims of his rash activities. <br /> <br /> Paul Ryan, the director who works and edits his own material, is a talented man who is rewarded by a wonderful play around his role. <br /> <br /> Alicia Browning is an older girl trying to make high school. She's been away for a few years and doesn't look like the same wavelength for the other students. For one she is a rebel with a punk look, lots of makeup and a mouth that someone who dares to get close to her orbit. Alicia was one of the students in the home room where nine students died, presumably killed by her boyfriend. Alicia, we realize, is a wounded girl who has experienced a terrible ordeal in her life, but we have no clues in the effect. <br /> <br /> What follows is the aftermath of the tragedy, as it focuses on a young woman who survived. Deanna Cartwright is a wealthy teenager who doesn't have to be at school at all. When a ricochet bullet hits her, she is hospitalized with more than one wound. She tries to get into her mind over this dark period, but the nightmares don't forget her. <br /> <br /> Alicia is taken to the hospital by the principal. As she doesn't work with the police, the principal wants to see her Deanna in her terrible state and maybe she'll soften and tell the authorities what she knows. Alicia doesn't like Deanna, but in a few days both girls will make peace. We do not realize the last sequence that really happened that day in the school. <br /> <br /> Busy Phillips makes excellent Alicia and Erika Christiansen are just as good as Deanna. Victor Garber, James Pinkins, Taylor Holland and the rest of the role play as an ensemble. <br /> <br /> The movie has an intensity because it is not explicit to show how the shootings took place, which helps show what Mr. Ryan wanted to give this movie.
