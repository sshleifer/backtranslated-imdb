Riding Giants is an amazing documentary describing the history and stories of three influential wavewaves, Gregg Noll, Jeff Clark and Laird Hamilton. Stacy Peralta has made a wonderful job of taking on the role of director and should be congratulated for such a brilliant job. The structure of the movie is brilliantly edited and works perfectly with narration, interviewing, animation and surfing. The music soundtrack only adds to the overall satisfaction of watching this movie, which makes Riding Giants brilliant. Personal highlights include any of Greg Noll's remarks, featuring his straight-on-the-point frankness, Laird Hamilton's footage at Teahupoo, and the end-of-movie look. But really this whole movie is one big, highly recommended highlight that is highly recommended if you have the opportunity to watch. It is a pity that this is no longer known, but it is a gem that deserves attention. 10/10
