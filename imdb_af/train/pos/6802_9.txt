You see this episode better from the beginning because if you start watching it later you will be confused about what happens to Clark's life. <br /> <br /> However, it is the turn; Clark is stuck in an alternative reality. Lana is devoted to him. Lex lost most of his legs and was in a wheelchair due to the bridge accident when he was heavy to miss Clark in the series pilot. Martha is married to Lionel. About the only constant is his most loyal friend, Chloe, who still believes in who he is. And, oh yes, he has no superpowers. He is in a spiritual setting to place himself in a fantasy world where he has powers, and is mocked to believe it. Apart from Chloe, there is one mysterious figure who believes in Clark: a black man who, in alternative reality, is also a resident of the institution, who believes he is from Mars. <br /> <br /> Clark must stay true to everything he believes is the real reality and is not reviewed by the institution's psychiatrist, who is actually the fourth Phantom Zone escape. <br /> <br /> This episode is quite sensible and shocking. Plus, it offers a fresh twist from the regular type of Smallville episode.
