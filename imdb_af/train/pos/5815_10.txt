I was a kid .. crazy about Michael Jackson. His music, his dance. He was and is the greatest of all time. A few days ago a friend gave me a gift. "Moonwalker" DVD .. I just couldn't believe it! So I took my time and saw the movie again. After many years, it kicked me back. I almost cried. Not because of Michael Jackson, but from the good old times I came back as when I went to his concerts, enjoyed music and dancing. The film gave me a different perspective than when I was a child. You can really see the parody of Michael's life. Thank you Michael Jackson for bringing me back to those wonderful times, to your great music and dancing. It's a pity people have forgotten you. I didn't because you gave me good moments with your music. All the best for you wherever you are.
