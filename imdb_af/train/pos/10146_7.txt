As we all know a romantic comedy, the genre is already known. The two leaders must always come together. Late in the third action I was finding out how it would pack and how they would end up together. A clue has been given from the beginning, but you will never realize it until the end. It's a simple hook, but it works. It had to be. You cover a lot of the usual land, but always take a fresh turn. I love all the NY characters and I loved the places. This is a postcard from NY. It was also nice to watch a movie and find nothing about it. So, if you want a good old fashion romantic movie, then it is for you.
