I was about 11 years old and found out I was living 0.48 miles from the home. the home is at Westway Dr, Hert Park, TX. They have added houses since the movie was made. I don't know the house number, but you can go and see. I'm 21 now and I enjoy watching this movie. The bar at Spencer is no longer theirs. Pasadena ISD wants a school to build their own. I drove home last week and the house still looks good. My dad and uncle go to the street where the house is and watch the actors come inside and try to make the movie. where John broke across the railways, they made 225 higher. When I heard of John losing his son, I started thinking when he made an urban cowboy, he was 26 or 25.
