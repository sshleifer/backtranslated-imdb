Suraj Barjatya is the best in movies about marriage. And here he is; back to his basic principles on Vivaah. As the story goes, it's a story of involvement in marriage. A movie that you can see with your whole family around you. A movie you will hate to watch alone. The story is simple, but the music is good, filmmaking is excellent, direction is the best, everything about the movie has a class of its own. There are many scenes that will make you cry and be sure to watch the movie with your loved one, both of you will hold each other's hand to the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Shahid & Amrita jodi previously made movies like Ishq Vishq, & Shikhar. Although Shikhar was a good movie, it was not well accepted by the public. A real Shahid & Amrita movie.
