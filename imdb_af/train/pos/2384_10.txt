It is a well-known fact that when Gene Roddenberry first beat Star Trek to NBC, the original pilot episode, The Cage, was rejected because it was "too cerebral". When the series was given another chance, Roddenberry thought it would be fun to record the events of the rejected episode as a cannon, and did so by writing The Menagerie, which has the unique distinction of being the successor to was still at that stage. , an unaired episode. <br /> <br /> This time, rather than exploring a new planet, Kirk and his crew on Starbase 11, now visiting the former company commander, Christopher Pike (Sean Kenney), are now horrible defamed and paralyzed because of an accident. Pike joins his successor on the star ship, where an unpleasant surprise awaits: Spike, who served under Pike, hijacked the ship effectively and the course for Talos IV, a planet beyond Pike and Spock's last. visit there, 13 years earlier. Of course, as a logical being, Spock becomes involved and arranges a martial law so that he can justify his actions. <br /> <br /> There is no longer any need to say more about the plot as the rest will play in Part 2. What really impresses Roddenberry is the connection between The Cage and the rest of the Star Trek universe, by seeing a particular kind of flashback (with more than too much to say) allowing everyone, on the screen and off, to see what might have been from Trek, NBC did not reject the original project. In particular, it's fun to see Jeffrey Hunter (who couldn't return to The Menagerie) Pike as a more serious captain than Kirk normally and Nimoy's early days as Spock, whose personality has not yet been fully established : It's the Only Time in the whole series that everyone's favorite Vulcan spontaneously grins. <br /> <br /> In short, not only a great "mysterious" episode, but also a surprise to those who can't be bothered to find the Cage. in its original form (it is available as part of the Season 3 set).
