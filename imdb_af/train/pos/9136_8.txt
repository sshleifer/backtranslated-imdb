This is not a movie like some reviewers, and if the summary on the IMDB page for this movie says it is. Why? Firstly, the filmmakers were brave enough to confront in 1984, as one of the plural elements, the issue of domestic violence - such complainants who complain about the plot, unfortunately becomes one of the main points! Secondly, without the plotting element of Prince's movie relationship with his abused father, the musical climax would not work so well - so the judges who say that only the music is good have missed one of the points - specifically, why it is so good is ... because all the music in this movie has a plot element background that makes the music more effective. Third, give this movie a break! For the first time film producers and directors, it's just not that bad! There are far worse movies out there by perfect movie people !! And lastly, the judges who say the music is good also missed the point - look at the variety of stylistic music treatments, the variety, the musicality and the stage performance of Prince - truly one of a kind, going musically where no one else the 1980s, and with a style that is seen in the work of other artists (clothing and movement: what costumes came first, Michael Jackson's or Prince's? Also see if you can see the split fingers before the eyes of Prince in do this movie long before Quentin Tarentino's "Pulp Fiction". As the sum of its parts, not a bad movie at all.
