I get tired of my 4 and 5 year old girls who are constantly subject to Nickelodeon, Disney and so on. It looks like it's the same old tired cartoons that are repeated over and over. When my daughters couldn't go to the fair this afternoon, because one of them was sick, I wanted them to just rest and rest. I sat on the TV and looking for something else, I overturned the channels. My finger stopped channel is navigating the moment I heard Harvey's voice. I adore every single thing this man did and when I saw that he had done some voice work sometime ... well, I couldn't change the channel! My daughters were immediately verified by the cartoon and the more we saw the show, the more I grew to love it with the message depicted. It is not necessarily a supporter of 'gay rights', but rather for anyone who has ever been wiped out as a child for something. I had friends picked up for some thing ... too fat, too thin, too feminine, a bully, not smart enough, just had one parent .... you call it! Children, as a rule, can be very cruel to each other, so I was happy to see an entertaining cartoon that actually conveyed a LIFE message to his audience. My daughters already accept others as they are and do not choose others to be different. My older daughter is actually up to her friends when they are picked up (one has a single mother and that girl is picked regularly - it warms my heart when Kassie stands for her!). <Br /> <br /> So, those of you who condemn this show because you feel it is a supporter of "gay rights" or are forced to "accept certain views", you have the point of this little bit cartoon clearly and completely missed. . <br /> <br /> And if you need it, it explained to you. Well, you need more help than any television program could ever offer.
