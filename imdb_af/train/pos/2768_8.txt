Unlike Susan Hayward's woods throughout this film, it was as good as any Biblical film made. Henry King treats this film with the respect of an epic in all the small screens, and Peck is as always impeccable. The rudder Alfred Newman's sound score, with the moving twentieth third psalm, is unforgettable even after these many years. The scene with Goliath is a bit on the hokey side, but not all that was bad for the era in which this film was made. It goes well with the lesser Bible stories of the day, "The Song of Ruth" and "Esther and the King." It's worth looking at, and Raymond Massy is excellent as Nathan's prophet. The film is rounded off by the always fine James Robertson Justice as Abishai and Jayne Meadows as Michol, David's estranged first wife.
