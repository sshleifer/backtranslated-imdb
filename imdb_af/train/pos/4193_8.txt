Director Sam Fuller has something of a cult that follows, especially in Europe. Yet, most of his films are more than forgotten. However, he really did a wonderful movie in "Pickup on South Street". During his career, he took place early in the year. The movies that followed were very inferior. <br /> <br /> "Pickup" works from all levels from the first to the last frame. It is filmed with flawless fluidity, with good performances all around. Richard Widmark and Thelma Ritter are both players with a fine record of leading performances. Widmark, who was not a stranger to playing villains, while at the heart of the game, still manages the slightest humanity that makes his character fascinating and makes the Jean Peters character more credible. <br /> Fuller doesn't like bumps in this really difficult movie. There is a scene in which Jean Peters is raised by Widmark. It's really shocking in his reality. This is not a case of carefully corroded photography. <br /> <br /> Less self-conscious than many movie noirs of the era, it remains a good example of the genre.
