Since then I can remember and I'm just 18 my mom and I are and continue to watch older movies, because I find them much more rewarding in the long run (but hey doesn't make me wrong, I love the movies we today just as much as I love movies of the 40's and 50's.) Anyway, now I have to say the moment I start watching the movie that stuck my eyes on the TV. Of course, my favorite character was the grandmother played by Lucile Watson. But I loved how Betty Davis and her family were portrayed. The children ... didn't look like kids in the slightest. But there is good reason why you had to hide and run most of your life as the terrible things children have seen have destroyed their innocence those days. So people say "oooo I hated how the kids acted ... blah blah blah" read between the lines and know they saw things children shouldn't see. <br /> <br /> Paul Lukas ... dear Paul has a wonderful job !!! Now I know a lot of people are crazy about going to the Oscar and Bogie, but not hey, they both did amazing work, so I think both could have gone. But Luke's performance was so incredible that I was reduced to tears by the end of the movie. I loved this movie and recommended it to anyone !! :-D
