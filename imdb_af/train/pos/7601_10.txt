Lost is one of a kind ... it's so captivating and full of excitement, excitement and emotions all at the same time. I have never seen any TV series like this before. It's full of jungle tension and has a good script. The actors in such a natural way felt life on an island, which I lost in the island while I saw it. This is an excellent piece of work that is told in a very intelligent form. The series is like a movie that lost the lives of survivors on a deserted island. I am tempted to watch one episode after another and I recommend this series to all TV show lovers. Look at the magic to lose nothing.
