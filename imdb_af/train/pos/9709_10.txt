I accidentally listened to the lure while I was taking television. I've never missed an episode ever since. <br /> <br /> It's humor, very funny, like a cross between Brass Eye's social commentary, the Fast Show's excellent one-liners, and a wonderful plot that develops every week without ever going. The best example of this was Hillary Briss's special things. What did it all talk about? <br /> <br /> The humor won't appeal to everyone. Some will say it's just too sick, and it's easy to see where they come from. Still, try it. If you don't like it, don't look, but if you like, you'll be glad you asked my advice.
