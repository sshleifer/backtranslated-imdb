To be honest, I expected a car hunt in this movie. There was actually only one, but 'Freeway' was also a big movie I would like to own on DVD. The only major names in the film are HOMICIDE's Richard Belzer as the radiographer and B-Movie villain-pearl excellence Billy Drago as the Revelation quotation by Freeway Killer. But the rest of the film generally gives good performances. I especially liked how Darlanne Fluegel gave her character, Sunny, a little intestine. She may be a helpless victim, but she is fully rounded off because she is looking for Drago with bounty hunter James Russo. <br /> <br /> Russo, I'm scared, comes over rather than wood, but then again, the character he plays, Frank, is not very well-filled except for a back story. Sunny is given by his former commander. Threatened by the film, the scene of the lonely LA highway at night with the murderer wearing its sinister gray sedan is a great way to build tension. The music used to emphasize the movie is appropriately compiled. I don't know why there are some people who hate this movie so much. Different strokes for different people, I think. But I absolutely enjoyed "Freeway" and I highly recommend it.
