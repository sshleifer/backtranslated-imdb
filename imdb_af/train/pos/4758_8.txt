After an anonymous call on a spacecraft crashing into a frozen wood, two police officers find evidence that the event really happened and one Martian apparently left the place. They drive to the nearby Hi-Way Cafe and they get a bus and seven passengers are waiting for the snow to reopen in the bridge. However, the driver said he had only six passengers when he parked the bus. While the travelers are being interviewed, strange things happen in the dinner, with the lights on and off and the turntable on and off. When the passengers are released and the bus follows its journey, one passenger returns to the meal and reveals a plot of invasion of the Earth. <br /> <br /> "Will the true Martian please rise?" is one of the best episodes of this great series. The intriguing story has ironic and witty dialogues, funny characters and situations and a surprising and totally unexpected plot point in the end. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Marciano" ("The Martian")
