This is the second film based on the life and times of the ultra-hardcore pornstar, John Curtis Estes, better known as John Holmes. Boogie Nights is also thoroughly based on his life. Maybe someday somebody will be going to a movie about Tommy Byron's life. <br /> <br /> The problem is that the story is not told very well. There are many Law & Order episodes that turn more and more than Wonderland, and the director never gets the criminal case with any kind of gusto. Val Kilmer has two problems. He's not nearly as hungry as Holmes (and no prosthesis this time, unlike Boogie Nights), and he's much better looking for Mope Holmes. <br /> <br /> The director does not include one single beloved individual under the cast. The racist, immature runners he hangs on, or his wife, and the police don't get much in the way of characterization. <br /> <br /> The best part of the movie is Eric Bogosian, who tells Paris Hilton to "get lost". <br /> <br /> To put it all, anyone interested in the most beautiful side of the porn business in the eighties or true crime shouldn't miss it.
