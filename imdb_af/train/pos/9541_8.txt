Wow baby, it is indeed some good Asian horror / gore, and a crazy outlandish movie. It's a Japanese splatter party that reminded me of Tetsuo, except in this case with all the blood and guts, there is a bizarre love story. It's hard to imagine how they even dreamed of this visually stunning movie, with some unique alien creatures infecting humans as parasites, turning them into a sub machine or thinking of cyborgs. The only thing wrong with these creatures after they have taken over is that they have to kill each other and eat the other. hmmm, yum yum. It will probably be called an industrial splatter or something with an excellent soundtrack to add to all the fun. The film also lends a bit of Carpenter's "The Thing" in creature design and effects. I will be in the must-have category for gorehounds, because there is non-stop massacre and some very good gore. And a must-have for stoners, because you don't even have to read the subtitles, but the visual images alone are enough of a thought journey. The design of the little creatures inhabiting the human body like a fetus reminds me of Frank Henenlotter's movies. It's another tribute to some great gore movies with a sense of humor. "Meatball Machine" is great fun for ghore, there is no doubt about it, and I just loved it.
