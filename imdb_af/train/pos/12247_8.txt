I really love this version of Emma the best. Kate Beckinsale was wonderful as Emma and strong were very good like a knight. The only complaint I had was on Mr. Woodhouse. I can't believe a man can curse so much or be so selfish with his daughter's life. She was finally a smart daughter. As always, I love the places where these Jane Austin movies were shot. the settings are so spectacular. It allows me to visit England so much, as well as Ireland and Scotland). I think the actors selected for this movie were also a good choice and all the other story lines between Emma's finest! I'm glad to see this one too.
