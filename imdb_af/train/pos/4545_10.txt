I saw this movie recently. 2 hours later my head was still hurt by the laugh. The plot was so horrible, the jokes were so bad, but what I didn't think was: <br /> <br /> 1. The 2 scenes before and after the movie Pat and Jay had (more than caused enough laughter. <br /> <br /> 2. The kick through the windscreen that seized the culprit. <br /> <br /> This movie is about 20 times better than the Rush Hour series, and my copy even came with a writer saying if you don't like the movie, send a certificate to HBO. Considering this, the date you had to send it was in January 1991 (which also made it impossible).
