In 1943, a group of RAF officers, including Eric Wiiliams, decided to escape from a POW camp with a gym in the courtyard. In 1950, it was decided to film his account, and it began a peculiar British Film Genre - the Military Prison Camp story that reached its appearance in Danger Interior (1959). <br /> <br /> The Wood Horse is one of the quietest movies I've ever watched. There are no great dramatic moments, but a steady storyline eventually builds into a climax that has more tension because the story does not allow for unlikely drama, jumping cuts or casings. It is completely out of time and beautiful. <br /> <br /> Leo Glenn, Anthony Steel and David Tomlinson lead a strange low key throw of extras and (I suspect) non-actors. Without exception, everyone is constantly monotonous and silent. They keep emotion out of their roles. As so many have been until recently, I suspect they have recreated their war roles as "officers and lords". <br /> <br /> This unemotional approach does not detract from any dramatic tension. On the contrary, unlike most Wartime Escape movies, the story doesn't end with the barbed wire: and the fact alone keeps me glued to the end.
