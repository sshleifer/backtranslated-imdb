No one can better spoil this piece of work! Awesome movie! Written expertly by Ira Levin and portrayed with the best performance of Christopher Reeve's career and one of Caine's best, it's simply excellent. I wish I could catch a raised version somewhere ... maybe I'll someday. I hope it is much underestimated, but it won't be too difficult to explore, as it is a 'must' for any Hitchcockian, Agatha phile or good movie lover. One of the few movies I couldn't immediately fix or predict and was worth a second or even third show, "Deathtrap" gets a 9/10 and earns every iota of it. We need and earn more movies like this!
