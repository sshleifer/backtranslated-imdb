This movie went home for me. As 29, I remember the 80's and my dad worked in a factory. I thought, if I worked hard, if I was proud and never gave up, I could also have the American Dream, the house, a few kids, a car to call my own. However, I noticed, without a degree in anything (as opposed to my father stopping in ninth grade) and a sharp sense of greed and laziness, you can't get there. <br /> <br /> I would like to know if anyone has this movie on DVD or VHS. It was made for TV, and I only saw it an hour ago. I find it nowhere! I would like to show it to my friends, my pseudo-friends, family and other relatives, see what they think and remind them that the Americans will one day work for the sake of honor and that we were proud of what we achieved !! I think the feeling is still there, but in a heavy downward spiral with so many things made overseas ...
