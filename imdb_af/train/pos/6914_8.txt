This movie features one of Richard Dreyfuss's greatest performances, as an actor playing a dictator and so convincing that his own mother does not detect the fraudster. Also, this movie is funny but also has a serious side. What is particularly concerned with this movie is the character Madonna, who is the dictator's mistress, but eventually becomes the leader of the country. Madonna's evolution from mistress to political leader has largely added to the quality of the story and to the film's entertainment value. And the main character, who at the start of the movie is a struggling actor and a bit of a buffoon, also develops and at the end of the film commands respect. I like this movie.
