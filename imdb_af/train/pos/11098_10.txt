Brendan Filone is the absolute best character in The Sopranos. He died by being shot in the eye. It was the best and well orchestrated scene ever in Sopranos. Brendan Filone is too good. Brendan Filone will haunt Uncle Junior in his dreams until Uncle Junior can't take it anymore. Brendan Filone is the best character. Brendan Filone was killed in episode # 3, Denial, anger, acceptance. But his legacy will live forever. Brendan Filone is the best character on Sopranos! Brendan Filone is the best character ever. I recommend this show to anyone who likes Drama and wants to see good deaths and good directing and production because it doesn't get any better than this series. Brendan Filone is the best.
