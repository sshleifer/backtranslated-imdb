I really like Star Trek Hidden Frontier. This is an excellent fanfiction series and I can't wait to see more. I only watched this movie series last week and I just can't get enough of it. I also recommended watching other people as it is worth it. I've been watching all the episodes many times and waiting to see more episodes come out. I classified it a ten, but I think it deserves a 12 loll. My compliments to the Star Trek Hidden Frontiers staff on a great job. If you like Star Trek, I strongly recommend watching this star fiction movie. The details related to this series of films are excellent, especially the ships and planets used in them
