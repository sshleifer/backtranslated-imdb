I was all ready to tackle this episode, as this 'Master' really has no horror movies under his belt. But it's easily the best episode of the season. <br /> <br /> The play was good !! I don't know how he curled it, but we have some real talent in this episode! And while you could see things coming from a mile away, at least it was entertaining and I could keep for the full 56 minutes, something missing in the series so far. <br /> <br /> I especially chose the end, not a twist, but just a funny bit where he gets, as always, the rooster-packed man. <br /> <br /> Great effort. As I said in other reviews, this is not true, the masters do many of these episodes. But they can one day be masters in the future.
