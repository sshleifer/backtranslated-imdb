You know? Our spirit is based on the revolution, it sleeps ... I can explain, I think !! Well, until April 25, 1974, our freedom was limited, we had no speech freedom, but when we got it at the revolution, it seems that Portuguese people have lost their opinion, we don't use our freedom of speech! It's all a result of the revolution! I think it's clear! ... About the movie ... I think it has some flaws on the character of a character, but with the way I watch Portuguese movies, it's pretty good !! I like it a lot!
