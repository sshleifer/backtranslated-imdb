The unlikely duo of Zero Mostel and Harry Belafonte team to give us interesting achievements and topics in The Angel Levine. This is an interesting twist on the themes of This is a wonderful life. <br /> <br /> Zero is married to Ida Kaminsky and the two belong to a special class elderly Jewish poor in New York. Mostel was a client and proud of his trade, but his back and arthritis prevented him from working. Kaminsky is mostly bedridden. He was reduced to apply for welfare. In despair like Jimmy Stewart, he calls for help from God. <br /> <br /> Now, maybe if someone got someone like Henry Travers, things could work differently, but even Stewart had trouble accepting Travers. But Travers had one thing for him, he was over 100 years of this mortal coil and all his ties with earthly things were gone. God sent Mostel something completely different, the recently deceased Harry Belafonte, who had at least a basic training for angels before giving a command. <br /> <br /> Belafonte did not accept that he was alive, he has many problems. He also hit a wife, Gloria Foster, who didn't know he was successful, hit by a car right at the start of the film. You set its issues and Mostel's issues and you have a good conflict. Start with the fact that Mostel can't believe in a black Jew named Levine. <br /> <br /> It was the farewell performance for Polish / Jewish actress Ida Kaminsky who received a nomination for best actress in the main street shop a few years ago. The other prominent role here is that of Irish actor Milo O'Shea who plays a good Jewish doctor. Remember O'Shea's brogue by The Verdict, I was really surprised to see him and hear how he was the doctor's part. <br /> <br /> The Angel Levine raises some interesting and disturbing questions about faith and race in this society. . It is brought to you by a star cast and of course created by well-known writer Bernard Malamud. Be sure to catch it when broadcast.
