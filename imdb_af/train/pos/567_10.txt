Jimmy Stewart and Anthony Mann worked together to make some of the best westerners ever, and this is one of the best. <br /> <br /> However, the real star of the movie is the spectacular Canadian Rockies that serve as the backdrop to the story. Some of the best films ever made in the history of the movie. <br /> <br /> In all five westerns Stewart and Mann did together, the supporting roles were thrown perfectly. No exception here, right down to parts that may have just a few lines, the characters are firmly etched with the lines. <br /> <br /> Stewart is a cynical, hard-won one-time in this movie whose only true friend is his sidekick Walter Brennan. It is Brennan's death in the hands of the villains who have made him free the golden settlement of the bad guys and loosen himself in the process. <br /> <br /> John McIntire is the chief villain of the piece and he was an undervalued actor with a wide variety. He can play nice old codgers, authority figures and in this case a particularly nasty and clever villain. <br /> <br /> One of the best westerns ever.
