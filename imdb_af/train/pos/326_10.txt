"I'm curious? Yellow" is a lot of fun. Like at least one other reviewer, I have laughed out loud several times. Yellow is energetic, playful, self-conscious, exploratory. Don't expect Bergman here. This film is about a youth in the early to mid-60s in Sweden and on issues, read * contradictions *, which face the nation and the world. Sometimes Geel appears to be a serious social-political documentary, with Lena, the main character, and others who question both general and politicians (eg Olaf Palme at home). At other times, Yellow seems to parody this type of documentary. Yellow acts all the time as a personal documentary exploration of Lena's life - her home life, her love, her political views, her view of herself. She is a full person ?? complex, defective, contradictory, happy, sad, curious. And this is the wonderful additional dimension of the director, Sjöman, and his crew documenting themselves to document Lena. This is what really gives me yellow wings. Not only do they suddenly appear in some very funny times and in some funny ways, but remind the viewer that it is fiction and artwork, but their presence is another layer of the film itself; they filmed themselves to film themselves. I am reminded of a Bjork music video of the same quality ?? a music video about making a music video, ad infinitum, with every repetition that gets usier and more cartoon. I think Sjöman might have had something similar in mind. While "Hunting is Curious" Yellow "may not be everyone's cup of tea, it is definitely intelligent, spiritual, refreshing, ebullient and authentic.
