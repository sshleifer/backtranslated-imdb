"Still Crazy" is without a doubt the biggest rock comedy of all time. This is incorrectly compared to "This is Spinal Tap", to which it has no connection. "Spinal Tap" is a satire (and frankly, not a very good one, despite being very rock-clicked). Unlike "Tap", "Still Crazy" is populated by great actors, good songs and good human situations. You care about the people in "Still Crazy". This is all that matters. Oh yes, the music is also nice, good, written by Mick Jones or Foreigner and Chris Difford of Squeeze. American audiences were already familiar with Stephen Rea (The Crying Game) but only later became known to Bill Nighy (Underworld, Love Actually, Pirates Of The Caribbean II) and Timothy Spall (the Harry Potter movies).
