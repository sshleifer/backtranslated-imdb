Rock Star: INXS was the best music TV show I've ever watched! It has some of the greatest rock n 'roll songs ever written by 15 very talented singers / artists. It also has (in my opinion) the most sad, feeling-good, surprise ends in all reality TV. It really made me tears of luck for the winner! Over the 13 weeks of this television competition, the viewers heard and became known to all the participants. After 30 episodes, the remaining participants were more like friends than just a few strangers competing on a reality TV show. And the fact that INXS, and still, was one of the biggest rock n'roll bands, just added EVER to the emotional tension created by this amazing reality series. If you did not record the series, ROCK STAR: INXS is a good alternative to the DVD.
