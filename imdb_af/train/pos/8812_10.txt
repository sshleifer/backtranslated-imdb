I saw this series when it was posted worldwide at the Toronto Film Festival. I like the idea behind the movie, where two men came together and told a director of each country to direct a movie about 911. These directors have never met before the project is completed, and they've seen it all look. WARNING: SPOILERS AED !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! All the pieces were very powerful, and some were controversial. If you're an American, you can't like it, as some of the pieces are anti-American. However, I know a few Americans who enjoyed this series. The piece I got the best was the one from India. It's about how a Muslim family living in the United States had 2 sons, and one of them was missing. The Americans gave them the cold shoulder and automatically assumed he was linked to the terrorist bombing. It catches the mother's despair and humiliation of these accusations so well that it brought tears to my eyes. Eventually, we see her son die while trying to save the many victims from the towers crash. It was a real story, and it made it so real. There were many emotional and powerful pieces, and the African piece was one of the best. It was humorous but just as powerful as the other. A must see for everyone, and hopefully America will detach it and play it in their country.
