This evening I saw an advanced show for this movie. I absolutely loved it. The movie kept me on the edge of my seat all night. Cillian Murphy is extremely creepy like the villain. For those of you who saw Batman Begins, his character was much rarer in this movie. He played his character very well. The scary "bad guy," I've seen for a while. Rachel McAdams was wonderful. Everyone in the audience laughed, said, and listened at the same time, as if we were aware. The tension is kept by the film. The incredible part is that the end was not anti-climate. I was finally not disappointed. I feel satisfied. The trailer does not do the film justice. The movie is much better than the trailer indicated. Don't wait for this movie to come out on video. Go see it. Although I didn't have to pay to watch this movie, I would have liked to give it 10,75 to see it. Enjoy it!
