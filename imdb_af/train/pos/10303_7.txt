Bruce Almighty is the story of Bruce Nolan, an average man who feels that God is confusing his life. God confronts him and shows Bruce the error of his ways. Of course, someone can turn God's powers to the worse. Bruce Almighty is a good comedy, Jim Carrey is good, as always Morgan Freeman is first-rate and looks right at home like God and the throw brings the plot together well. The jokes are almost always on the target, though they sometimes put a little too much on Carrey's facial expressions. I like the fact that the movie actually portrayed God, not just that, but also as a black man. I thought it well, especially with the brilliant Freeman. There are some hilarious scenes, for example the opening cookie scene, others miss the target a little but still a good movie. 6/7 out of 10
