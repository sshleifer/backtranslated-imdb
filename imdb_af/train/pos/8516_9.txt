This movie is a very funny and heartwarming story about an orphanage in financial trouble. When the director goes on vacation, his father agrees to go in for a moment to do things. <br /> <br /> It is positively the best work Leslie Nielson ever did. His idea in the movie to hire children is immediately innovative and his selling techniques will definitely make you laugh. <br /> <br /> The girl in this movie is so sweet and charming that I know I will never forget her. . Make sure you don't miss the first five minutes of the movie! <br /> <br /> Nowadays, such a large family entertainment is rare. If you're going for slightly corny photos with happy ends, go for this one! I could look it over and over, and I often do it! My only complaint about this movie is that it's so hard to find a copy.
