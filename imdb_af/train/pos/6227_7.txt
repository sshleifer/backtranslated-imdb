Definitely one of the fewer of the Astaire / Rogers musicals. It is just very poorly planned and fit. For example, it just takes a few minutes longer than Swing Time, but it feels much longer. This is partly due to the secondary romance between Randolph Scott and Harriet Hilliard. Scott is seldom interesting. I like Hilliard. She is sweet, and I love at least one of her songs, "But where are you?" ('Get Tea Behind Me Satan', her other number, is a poor remnant of Top Hat, gratefully cut from that masterpiece). Following the fleet would actually be a bad movie if not for at least three brilliant dance series between Astaire and Rogers. The dance game dirty for the top end of any of their numbers. The dance is just fantastic. "I put all my eggs in one basket" the two rehearsals offer a dance they have not yet completed perfectly. The imperfections make it all the more perfect. And "Let's Face the Music and Dance" is easily one of Irving Berlin's best songs. So the movie is worth watching for its great moments.
