So the neighbor killed his neighbor. Remind me of Iraq. Watching the American flag (50 stars in 1864) dragged behind the horse, I found out why I burned that piece of red and white, not as much as our destruction / indifference to the Bill of Rights. I'm a Southern, and need some historical memory. <br /> <br /> Watching the Tobey McGuire character, learn to respect the dignity of a former slave, as he plays the blacks and Germans' shells (his ethnic background) on a poker game ..... was interesting. A lot of turns in this movie. The woman, forced into her marriage, shows both lust and strong will, qualities that we have not seen in a respectable Victorian southern belle. <br /> <br /> The crazy-haired renegade south has given me some insight into why my cousin, head of Copeland Horse-Thieving Bende, Inc. in Mississippi, was hung over that time. Ties of homeless men trembled in the countryside, armed. Remember Iraq? And how similar are we to the facade of religion and ethnic background? And why southern people are still fighting civil war today. <br /> <br /> We cannot use the same knowledge in dealing with the country we have just invaded and occupied, anywhere in the civil war. This is Mesopotamia, now called Iraq, who has the misfortune to put on oil. The wild game killers in Missouri, who guess Lawrence, Kansas, can easily be the rebels who are now unsuccessful. <br /> <br /> Another anomaly was the father's tribute to the Yankees moving in Lawrence and moving upright. a school "even before they set up a church. And therefore they will win." Huh ????? I learned history in Birmingham, Al and learned that the North was much more industrial and richer ..... therefore they won. Course, they also had literary God on their side. As you see here, when the liberated slave indicates he is cutting off to release his mother, sells in slavery in Texas. God, who has given us a horrible legacy. <br /> <br /> It's pretty good, lots of blood and gore while the warriors are riding in the fight (but didn't shout a rebel, so reminiscent of Alabama games). You also get a real sense of how stupid the war was, as the forester and jayhawkers gathered their troops for another attack. They lost sight of why they were fighting, and so are we. Just more senseless slaughter. <br /> <br /> You are also informed with the relentless children coming from Iraq, because the forest waker (ahh, what connotations) first put his arm off, trying to save it. , then it amputated, and then died. So much is suffering for such a stupid cause. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is fantastic. Now I need to get back to the DVD and get the production notes, one of my favorite parts of any movie. I suspect this movie was written by a Gore Vidal, since the spoken language is of a kind you would associate with that era, if you know History. The dialogue is definitely tempting. Not your regular blood and intestinal war movie. You see the wounded but still active soldiers are still fighting because they have nothing else to do. You see the southern raiders, who stay off the land, without stealing. Yet, in the beginning, you have stopped the fight, so that the women of danger can be evacuated. As I read the growing number of women and children in Iraq, I think, "Where did we lose our honor as a people?" I forgot why I searched for this movie and bought it after 20 years, but a book praised it somewhere. For good reason. Tobey at his best, pre-Spideyman. Buy the DVD or rent it. And tell me why others praise it, not just the liberal cest.
