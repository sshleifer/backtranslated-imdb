Damon Runyon's world of Times Square, in New York, before his Disneyfication, is the basis for this musical. Joseph L. Mankiewicz, a man who knew about movies, aimed this nostalgic tribute at the crossroads of the world, which shows us the bottom of New York. Frank Loesser's music sounds good. We look at some amazing role-playing characters typical of the area. People on the sides of society tend to overcame that area because of the lights, the action, the possibilities in that part of the village. This belly of the city made a life out of the street life that was so intense. <br /> <br /> Some of the songs from the original production were not included in the movie. We don't know if it makes sense, but it's not uncommon for a Hollywood musician to change and change what worked on stage. The original movie included the amazing Vivian Blaine and Stubby Kaye, and we wonder about the decision not to have Robert Alda, Sam Levene, Isabel Bigley repeat their original roles. This is a special actor who could make a wonderful contribution. <br /> <br /> The film, visually, is incredible. The look now follows the fashions of the times. As far as deciding Marlon Brando, otherwise known for his singing ability, Frank Sinatra and Jean Simmons, apparently work in the film. Sky Masterson is after all a man's man, who otherwise looks like he has another look. Frank Sinatra is good as Nathan Detroit. Jean Simmons, like Sarah Brown, does a good job depicting the woman from the Salvation Army who suddenly finds satisfaction with the same kind of man she tries to save. <br /> <br /> Vivian Blaine is a pleasure. She never stops as me. Adelaide, a woman with a heart of gold who has Nathan Detroit's love interest. Mrs. Blaine makes a fantastic impression as the show girl who is wiser than she comes out. Stubby Kaye does a great job of expressing his beautiful Nicely Johnson. <br /> <br /> The great production is very much due to the talented Abe Burrows, who made the adjustment on the screen. The costumes by Irene Sharaff were the right ones.
