Doctor Mordrid is one of those scarce movies that is completely under the radar, but is totally worth it. It really reminds me of the old 30's and 40's magazines. That's why I wanted to see follow-up movies ... but judging by the rest of Volman's output, there simply wasn't enough tits to satisfy the typical audience. Unfortunately, thanks to a completely unnecessary sacrifice, two are too much for a family audience - it's a shame because without it, it could be a Harry Potter style award that children would have gained. Both Jeffrey Combs and Yvette Nipar are wonderful - I don't know if Mrs. Nipar did not have an A-list picture on this film, she was very credible. No, seriously! Anyway - it's a pity they didn't have the money to dr. Strange to license, because I think it could have been a total kiddie phenomenon.
