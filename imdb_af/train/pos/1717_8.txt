The story is about Ankush (Abhay Deol). He is briefly a witness for couples in the marriage registration office - and Megha (Soha Ali Khan) who drove away from her home at Nainital to marry her interest Dhiraj (Shayan Munshi). The story begins with Megha waiting for Dhiraj's marriage registration office to appear, but for some reason he doesn't turn up. So Ankush comes here in the picture, which Megha approached for the purpose of earning Rs. 200 works for his Witness and he ends up helping her by offering shelter to her. Ankush grows on his side by working in a bank as Agent. Ankush falls in love with Megha and she also falls in love with him (or kind of love). Both agree to the marriage and Dhiraj comes back in the picture. Unexpected circumstances happen, I actually expect expected conditions with unexpected reactions and then .... <br /> <br /> Actually, the movie story is a bit different from the movies we see and I don't think so, it will accepted by the masses, but if you are a movie freak like me and like to see something else, then you will definitely like the movie. The movie is just an innocent love story set up well by the characters of Abhay Deol and Soha Ali Khan. The characters are so natural that you feel like things are happening to the man next door. The background music of the film also plays a very good role, it is just too good. The way Delhi is shown is very good and gives a fresh feeling. <br /> <br /> So let's cut it out and sum it up. <br /> <br /> Story: A very common story has performed very well and transformed into a wonderful experience. <br /> <br /> Music: Well, it was Himesh Reshammiya's creation, and I didn't expect much, but I liked quite a few songs from the movie, including the Qawwali. <br /> Acting: Abhay Deol was the most impressive, natural and innocent actor, but he had to stay away from the songs in the songs. Soha Ali Khan, she's a doll, a very cute doll I have to say. Again many innocent and natural acting and these two actors fit perfectly into their characters. Apart from these two, Shayan Munshi needs some acting and there may be a few low fat to cover the legs. Other actors did their job well. <br /> <br /> Stars: I will also give it 3,5 stars out of 5. You will enjoy watching the movie in the theater, I recommend watching it in the theater if you are a movie freak and accept unusual stories. Otherwise, wait for the DVD to arrive. The film will certainly not be held by the masses and the business that can do so is from mouth to mouth.
