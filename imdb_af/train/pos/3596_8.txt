I finally sat down and saw this movie completely, and I have to say I was very impressed. Michelle Rodriguez is probably one of my new favorite actresses - it's not just the fact that she can act * but she picks the roles that are best for her that are meaningful and important than before. I read a few comments that expressed their relief that it was not a terrible feminist thing as they had previously thought, but I definitely do not agree. Princess is a feminist. She follows her dreams and believes in herself as opposed to what almost everyone thinks about her (with the exception of her caring brother Tiny and her coach and manager, Hector, who proves she is a father figure as her older parent), what is what The word "feminism" is about. It is nice to see movies like this that show the real side of feminism - that they have not lost a lot of men, but that they have dreams and can do something. Princess is true to herself as she still falls prey to love, and she and Adrian have a more realistic, intricate relationship rather than just magic. Girlfight is a real taste of reality and it gives a little faith in my perception of people. Thank you, Michelle. <br /> <br /> 8/10 - A very important movie related to not only young women, but everyone wants to go far in their lives.
