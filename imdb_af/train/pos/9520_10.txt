It's a beautiful movie. The true story of relationship between father and son. This is by far Tom Hanks at its best. Tom Hanks is really out of the box in this movie. He usually has the nice old roles. Yet, in this film, he emerges as a bit angry, but still gets up like a rose, even to the last scene, the assassination of his character. The movie of this movie is well composed. I also love the part when there is a total silence when Tom Hanks's character shoots and kills all the men in Mr. Rooney's group. There is something cold and yet deep about no sound in that scene, just merely emotion. I love the appearance of John Rooney, Paul Newman's character's face when he realizes, even before he saw it, that it's Tom Hanks's character to take revenge, and he knows his fate has come. The first time I saw this movie, I was blown away and knew I had to go out and get the video and I have since added it to my collection of my favorite movies. <br /> <br /> Tom Hanks is my favorite actor, so this movie has a special place in me.
