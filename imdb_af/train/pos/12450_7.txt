Hire and watch these short (<90 minutes) work. This is by far the best treatment. Modesty got on film - and her creator, Peter O'Donnell, agrees as a "Creative Consultant." The character and us who love her are treated with respect. Spiegel's direction is the best he has done to date, and the casting was very well done. Alexandra Staden is almost physically perfect as a match with Modesty's original Jim Holdaway illustrations. A great find by anyone who throws her! Raymond Cruz as a young Rafael Garcia was also excellent. I hope Tarantino & co. will continue in the series. I am especially interested to see who will choose to be the incomparable Willie Garvin!
