Despite what the title might imply, "Pigs Is Pigs" doesn't stare at Porky Pig. On the contrary, it contains young pigs with an appetite that are insatiable than John Belushi's character in "Animal House". His mother repeatedly scolded him, but it didn't do well. So much so that he goes to another home where a stray scientific power feeds him more than just a mortal man (but there is a surprise at the end). <br /> <br /> I usually say this cartoon looks like a place between the very big cartoons (Daffy Duck debuts three months after it came out). But make no mistake about it, they do neat things here. The whole power supply sequence looks more relevant today, given the obesity epidemic that overwhelms our country. <br /> <br /> Anyway, not the biggest cartoon, but worth seeing.
