Back when musical did not show up for choreographers, we have wonderful movies like this. <br /> <br /> To be a big fan of both Wodehouse and Fred Astaire, I was delighted to finally see this movie. Not quite a blend of Wodehouse and Hollywood, but close enough. Some of the American vaudeville humor, the slapstick, not the witty villain, clashes with Wodehouse's British sense of humor. But in general, the American style banger makes the American characters look rather like cardboard cartoons. <br /> <br /> Some ingenious staging for the dance numbers, including the amazing fairground with fun waves and funhouse mirrors, more than make up for the lack of a Busby Berkley over the top dance number. They look much more realistic if you ever thought people were singing and dancing so realistically. <br /> <br /> The lack of Ginger Rogers and Eric Blore doesn't hurt the movie, instead allowing them different character dynamics. to emerge. It is also nice not to have a sensible, creaking, major love affair. Instead, we have a gentle strength of love, much more in keeping with Wodehouses' young aristocratic women.
