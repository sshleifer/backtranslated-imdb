The books of James Michener who took readers to remote places with strange sounding names were probably at their most popular in the 1940s and 1950s. His stories from the Southern Pacific have become a huge outburst of Broadway hit for Rodgers & Hammerstein. South Pacific was run by Joshua Logan and he was, of course, the film adaptation of another Michener success, Sayonara. <br /> <br /> It was only a decade before American films were not portrayed by Japanese films during World War II. friendly. I'm sure it wasn't easy for people who fought the Pacific war to change attitudes overnight. That and a common non-breeding policy with occupied people in general is at the heart of this story of interracial romance. <br /> <br /> Today, Sayonara is a relevant movie. The army has always entered the personal life of its staff in a way that no civilian employer could legitimately get away from. In America when Sayonara was made, there were still laws of disregard for books in many countries. Today, gays in the army are a big problem. Someone can one day make a Sayonara movie about this issue. <br /> <br /> Joshua Logan was on familiar ground. South Pacific also had racism as part of its plot. With a certain hand, Logan made a beautiful story. <br /> <br /> Marlon Brando, Patricia Owens, James Garner, Kent Smith, make the former players a great job. But the picture is stolen here by the orientations. Miko Taka strikes the brand beautifully as Brando's love interest. But the real stars are the two that both support Oscars, Red Buttons and Miyoshi Umeki. <br /> <br /> Buttons are your allman-designated man Air Force member. He falls passionately in love with Katsumi played by Miyoshi Umeki. They marry and the military cruelly does everything they can to break them. They are supposed to know what is best for Knoppies and Umeki. Knoppies was a TV comedian and a fair talent, but he never had much of a career. <br /> <br /> And Miyoshi Umeki's Oscar was the first to be given to an Oriental. It received a lot of attention, as Miyoshi was at the time of the Academy Awards on Broadway in Flower Drum Song. I was fortunate to see it on Broadway, it was the first Broadway show I've ever seen. I carry the memory to it. <br /> <br /> That Oscar also symbolized something else. Our war with Japan was really over and we saw a great nation in Sayonara with a proud tradition and culture. <br /> <br /> Ricardo Montalban plays Nakamura, a Kabuki theater actor. If Sayonara is done today, Logan will never get away with it. But Montalban is good. <br /> <br /> Good location photography and a great story. This film must be revived more often, it has a great moral.
