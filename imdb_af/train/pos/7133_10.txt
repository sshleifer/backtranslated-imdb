Absolute masterpiece of a movie! Goodnight Mr. Tom is one of my favorite movies of all time. No one should miss seeing this movie, it's just too good! Mr. Tom is perfectly portrayed by John Thaw as the tough old man who becomes a gentle father figure when William Beech (Nick Robinson) is sent to him for evacuation, almost like 'The Town Mouse and the Land Mouse'. A real heartbreaking movie. The director knew exactly how to change the book into film and he did it very well. The film is so superbly shot that the emotions of the characters and what has happened make the audience feel a variety of emotions of love to fear, and these emotions can turn a six pence on. In a time of unrest in World War II, this film also shows the difference between the cities and the countryside, they are almost like different countries. An absolute must see, those who don't miss out on a truly wonderful and brilliant movie.
