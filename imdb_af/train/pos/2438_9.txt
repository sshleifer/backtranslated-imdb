It was a gem. Wonderfully acting on the leadership of Liam Cunningham, Orla Brady and all the supporting role players. The movie is a topic that not only relates to Ireland and Irish history, but also to many communities around the world and many marriage units within those communities. With intensity and sincerity, the film shows how religious beliefs and traditions drove a wedge on a loving and passionate family. The title "Love split" couldn't catch it better. Although it was a true story and event in Ireland from the 50th seeing how the life of the whole village erode and "pogroms" begin, reminds me of Russian history. The intolerance and prejudice are still too powerful in the world and unfortunately hidden deeply in human nature. As in the film, Liam Cunningham's character says: "The hate has always been under the surface." It was interesting to see the moral choices made in this story. The character of a Catholic priest and what happened to him was also quite significant. The story, however, gives hope that love for two people can overcome everything and love makes us better, stronger. Liam Cunningham's character goes through the whole transformation throughout the story and becomes a man he always wanted to be. Again acting is a top speed. Story is fast. Irish countryside is as beautiful as ever. Highly recommended.
