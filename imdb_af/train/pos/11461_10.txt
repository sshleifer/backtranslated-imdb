In addition, it is rude in all respects, but this movie has gone beyond all my expectations. This masterpiece of theatrical history portrays over-exploiting crappy filters at its finest! Paul Johansson and Craig Sheffer show a brother's conflict with all that is on it. As usual, a woman gives her true intentions. The end was as surprising as fearless as Keith Scott's death by his older brother. <br /> <br /> The scenes in 'wiking land' are just as I remember it from my early journey. - To be honest, my strong passion for garbage films is this one a must in my never-completed collection. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to all the people who fall in love with the most beautiful brother from One Tree Hill. . <br /> <br /> -Odin-
