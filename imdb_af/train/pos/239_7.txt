I watched it on the movie with my girlfriend at the time and I can say I didn't have the best time, especially since I didn't know Ned Kelly or his story. <br /> <br /> But since this is a biopsy, it's important to at least know what to expect from the character. <br /> <br /> I don't know if the way the events are told is true or it's all fictitious. But the way Ned Kelly is portrayed as a hero and a fighter for justice really makes me believe that everything is true. I don't think he's portrayed as a redhead or a thief, but it's just my opinion. <br /> <br /> It's a solid Western-style movie for everyone's taste. Heath Ledger is great as always and the sexy Naomi Watts charm the screen. <br /> <br /> Give this movie a chance when flying on the air. Otherwise I don't think I can recommend it.
