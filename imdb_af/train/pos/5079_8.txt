Well, first I want to explain that Kaakha Kaakha is part of a Tamil prayer and roughly translates it "to protect". Khakhee, on the other hand, refers to the color of the police uniform (which is Khakhi!). <br /> <br /> The Tamil film industry is also full of pure commercial enterprises. Any Rajnikanth or Vijay movie will stand the testament to that statement. <br /> <br /> Now, Kaakha Kaakha is an excellent movie with a good soundtrack. Certainly very beautiful in the final scene, especially love the end (which is definitely unexpected!). The gore is sometimes too much, but it's definitely a good movie!
