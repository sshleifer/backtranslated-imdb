I was amazed at the improvements made in an animated film. If you sit near the screen, you will see the detail in the grass and surface structures. The detail, colors and shade are at least an order of magnitude better than Toy Story. How they could shade, I will never know. I hope PIXAR will give a documentary on how the film was made so I can find out how it all has been achieved. Based on this film, I think, animated films of the future are judged by this film.
