Late one night on a deserted road, in an empty salon, Martin Sheen spins a yarn for Robert Carradine of Hopalong Cassidy and friends who find a group of murderous cattle farms, killing some men and kidnapping Cassidy's girlfriend . <br /> <Author / director Christopher Coppola Perhaps the anger of William Boyd purists has gone by daring to make a modern low-budget film with their beloved Hoppy, but I'm glad he did! No character should be so tied to an actor that no one else will ever allow him or her! <br /> <br /> I thought it was fun and an interesting update to the classic programmers of the thirties and forties. Although I'm guilty of some bad acting, it's serious enough and unpretentious. It makes it hard for me not to like. <br /> <br /> But the whole production is a bit strange, but I enjoyed the screens between Sheen and Carridine. The fact that we are watching a story in a story makes the strangeness and exaggeration more palatable.
