One of the great classic comedies. Not a slapstick comedy, not a heavy drama. A fun, satirical movie, a buyer be a guide to a new home. <br /> <br /> Filled with great characters, all of whom Cary Grant is convinced, must flee into the building of a dream home. br /> <br /> A good look at life in the late 40's. <br /> <br />
