On the surface it is an above average post-war romantic comedy. Underneath the veneer it is MGM-character actor-stunt casting at its funniest. <br /> <br /> The lead is straight, but all the secondary is very much thrown at type. Edward Everett Horton (Edward Everett Horton), and Sig Ruman (the Marx Brothers nemesis in _Night In Casablanca_ and the always wonderful _Night At The Opera_), are playing a deliberate gang trying to bring the two clues together to disassemble them as their ordinary characters would do. <br /> <br /> It also pleases many romantic comedy conventions, which is another indication that it may not be so much a "straight" romantic comedy, as it is a furious record of the very near war romantic comedies and their two-dimensional stock characters. <br /> <br /> I saw it only once, with interruptions, so I can't be positive, but this movie can be one of those that worked better in the context of the time it was created. but is less successful as viewers "see" these secondary characters through a completely different lens. I assume this is the case when I give it 9 stars. I thought it was hysterical.
