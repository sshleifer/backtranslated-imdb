The emotional powers and characters of Dominick and Eugene are the things Hollywood does not make. This is one of the most emotional, sensitive and cordial movies I've ever seen! Roy Liotta, Tom Hulce, and supporting actress Jamie Lee Curtis, deliver Oscar's caliber performance! There are not enough words to express how good this film is. Sure, people who are not in sentimental movies, cannot care about Dominick and Eugene as much as the rest of us, but for the rest of us, this movie goes straight to the heart and partly to compassion and humanity. You will never forget this movie! <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILERS UNDER ***** <br /> <br /> The simple but eloquent story is told masterfully. Eugene is a co-school intern who stares for long hours and a demanding workload at the hospital. His fraternal twin brother Dominick (born 12 minutes earlier) is a bit slow and uncomfortable due to brain damage due to a father's victim of abuse. (A sad moment when it is invented in the movie that will leave you in tears!) Eugene (aa "Geno") has a painful dilemma. He has to decide whether to complete the medical school, which means he accepts his residence in another city and leaves Dominick (aa Nicky) or forfeits the rest of his training to care for him. Nicky helps pay his brother's fellow schooling by working as a trash collector. <br /> <br /> The questions of ethics, morals and responsibilities are masterfully blended into this landmark movie. Just when Gino thinks Nicky can move forward to independence, Dominick turns around and turns up to do things like helping a drug dealer or using a faulty cord he finds at an electrical appliance at the dump . <br /> <Larry is the character and Nicky's partner on his rubbish trail that fills bodies Dominick's head with all sorts of stories like Geno and Jennifer (his girlfriend, who he is in clinical pharmacology), going to Atlantic City and playing away their money. But deep, you can see Larry caring for him. On their laps, Nicky also finds a little boy, who invented us was also beaten by his father. An end result is also tragic and the pain you see on Nicky's face when it happens, speaks volumes. <br /> <br /> The sensitivity shared by the two brothers cannot be over-emphasized enough. All Nicky wants to do is love and look for acceptance anyway he can. (ie, he goes to church, likes Hulk Hogan). Geno likes Nicky more than anything in the world. But can his brother become independent enough so that Geno can follow his dream of becoming a doctor? A brilliant movie that received more recognition than it deserved, but unfortunately came out at the same time as Rain Man, who dealt with a similar issue. However, I like Dominick and Eugene better because it has a stronger emotional component. Be warned that this movie is right at the tear channels. Kleenex is therefore useful! What a movie !!!!
