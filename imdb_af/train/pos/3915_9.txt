I've seen this movie at least 4 times since '84 and it's still fantastic every time I see it. It is a very compelling version of the opera Carmen, with incredible Flamenco dance, bare bones, and of course wonderful music. <br /> <br /> This story of Carmen is a story in a story, with every parallel of the other, to the double tragic end. It is clear that a low-budget Spanish production contains the dance of some of Spain's leading Flamenco dancers. The combination of the rising opera music and the sound of the dancers boosts the boots, making the story of the story even more powerful. <br /> <br /> This is independent movie show at its best and probably my favorite time foreign film.
