Big, big, fantastic! That's all I can say about the movie, but imdb wants to have at least four lines of text so I'll expand. The movie was great (Jerry O'Connel is soooo cute!), The music was wonderful (the sixties had the best music ever, imho), the historical material was interesting and so was the way they made the actors of the 90s Looks like they were actually there in the 60's. And above all - the stories of the main characters brought tears into my eyes, and that is the greatness of any drama. BUT IN A WORD: GREAT!
