A terrifying, shockingly intelligent piece by talented British writer Hanif Kureishi, who wrote "My Beautiful Laundry" (that's the best thing he's done since then). It's about intelligent people whose lives don't add up much. They destroyed what they were given and are largely empty vessels. The only character on the screen that is alive is the mother of the title, but she feels dead inside, until a rough man shows her love and wakes her up to the joy of sex. He has his own motives, but Kureishi treats him with much compassion. It is a movie in which people and places are known, where characters are outside the scenes. In some ways, it's a bit like "Sunday, Bloody Sunday", but it's a much tighter job. The director, Roger Michell, allows the scene to build instinctively. And it was beautifully performed. <br /> <br /> As the equal mother Anne Reid betrays her lost life in every gesture. There is no false note in her extraordinarily innocent performance, and that very good actor Daniel Craig shows shade for his character as even Kureishi did not pack. If the film hits a fake note, it might be in the character of the talented daughter, in a messy relationship with the man who seduces her (or otherwise) played so well by Cathryn Bradshaw that she still hooks you. The film is also extremely beautiful to watch (DoP Alwin Kuchler) and must undoubtedly be the best British film of the year.
