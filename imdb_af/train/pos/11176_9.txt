Okay, first I have to point out that when I first saw, I was 9 years old. If I saw this one for the first time two weeks ago, I probably noticed that it's just another cheaply made cable TV horror movie with some well-made scenes. But if you're nine, you just don't care. It left hell out of me, especially the former Zelde scenes (and they still do). These days I love this movie. I have to see it once a month and on every New Year's Eve I watch it with a 12 pack of beer and lots of friends. It's like a starter for a good feast! I did agree with the people who said that the acting here is pretty unconditional. Midkiff and Crosby seem like I wanted Louis and Rachel to look, but one cannot see much dedication or feelings on the faces of these two. Hughes and Gwynne reasonably save the screens that "the believers" undertake. What I really want to say about this is the fact that there is really no other movie similar to Pet Sematary, and I don't mean the zombie stuff here. THE ATMOSPHERE OF THIS FILM IS DETERMINED A NEWS AND ONE OF A CHILD. Honestly, how many times have you seen a movie that looks superficially like a cable TV, but leaves you with a cold compared to the best horror chillers out there? Okay, well, I threw some of the balls a few minutes ago, but I have to say that all the pieces at that level will also turn off the overall play to perfection. But hey, tell me if you really know a movie similar to Pet Sematary! I would really like to know ... And I don't mean the night of the living dead here ... this one is much further compared to intelligence compared to those things.
