If you are a fan of film noir and think they don't make them as they were used to, here's your answer. They just don't make it in Hollywood anymore. We must turn to the French to remember how satisfying, subtle and immensely a well-made film from the genre can be. Read My Lippe is a wonderful little gift to the believers of director Jacques Audiard, with sharp storytelling and fine performances by Emmanuelle Devos and Vincent Cassel. <br /> <br /> The basic plot could be written in the 40's: stupid but pleasant ex-con and a clever but dowdy femme fatale (who seems to be recklessly ambitious) discover each other while living lives of painful despair and Desire, manipulate each other to achieve their own goals, develop complex love / hate relationship, cook up criminal scheme with regard to elevator, double intersections, close calls and lots of money. All action takes place in depressed, ugly and / or poorly lit places. <br /> <br /> Of course, Audiard made a modern twist. The femme fatale is a subordinate office worker who is almost deaf and uses her lip reading ability to take revenge on those who marginalize her. And where you expect mighty love scenes, discover that both characters are sexually uncomfortable and immature. Add a little bit of modern technology and music and it looks like a contemporary movie, but don't make a mistake - it's old school movie noir. It's as good as any movie from the genre and easily one of the best movies I've seen all year.
