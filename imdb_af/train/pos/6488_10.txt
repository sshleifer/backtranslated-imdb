War is hell. But this documentary of World War II is heaven. <br /> <br /> Not only is this series a breathtaking, almost exhausting look at World War II, it is a closer masterpiece that is clearly and beautifully told by Laurence Olivier. /> <br /> This documentary series defines the genre. It is very long, no doubt, but you will enjoy all of them and want to come back more and more. (I have the series on DVD and I probably watch the series three times a year.) <br /> <br /> Surely this is a flawless bit of movie-making. Unlike Olivier, the best part of the series is listening to the veterans who tell their stories; Whether it's a real fight or a pig, so they can get something nice for dinner. <br /> <br /> I'm going to watch it now (again, me ... 11th time).
