I was delighted to finally see the release of Amazing Stories on DVD the first season. I just forgot what star actors and actors starred on this series. For the longest time, the only way you could see this remarkable series was at the VHS 2 or 3 episode collections or when Sci-Fi would run the episodes again. But when Sci-Fi offers the re-runs, they usually hold the same episodes. There were some outstanding episodes in Season One like the Mission they did not repeat. Does anyone know exactly how long this series is running? It says IMDb above 1985 to 1987, but I thought it would take more than two years. If you loved the Twilight Zone, Night Gallery and Outer Limits, you'll love this series and you won't be disappointed with your purchase.
