This film tells the story of a romance between Albert Einstien cousin and a gas station servant. To get the two together, Einstien agrees to help Ed (Hudsucker Proxy's Tim Robbins) act more intelligently. It impresses Catherine (Meg Ryan). Unfortunately, Einstien is going too far and Ed is considered a genius. Happiness follows. Not to be missed. Filmed in Mercer County New Jersey at Princeton University, Lawrenceville Prep School (doubling for Princeton University) as well as a beautiful former gas station in Hopewell.
