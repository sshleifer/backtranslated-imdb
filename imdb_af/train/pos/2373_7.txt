Pendragon Pictures 'new movie "H G Wells' World War", the first faithful adaptation of the original novel, has been under development for about 5 years. A theater release was meant earlier this year (March 2005), but it never happened. The DVD is rushing to coincide with the release of Spielberg's version, which hits the 29th theater. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie, with some reservations. <br /> <br /> How faithful is the adjustment? It's not quite 100% true to Wells's book, but 90-95% faithful is good enough for me. At least several scenes were completely new, such as Ogilvy, the astronomer's confrontation with a farmer, and the nameless writer / narrator had uncomfortable tea with his cousin. But overall, this film follows very carefully - certainly much more than the classic 1953 version by George Pal. <br /> <br /> The biggest mistake is that it's made clear on a very cheap budget. Most of them look blue screen shot and are compiled with digitally rendered backgrounds. This is particularly irritating during most indoor shots and scenes of crowded city streets. The 1898 London reviews look like something from a video game. Several scenes in horse-drawn carriages were over - I think they couldn't afford to rent a horse. The only scenes shot for "real" look like those in open land or forests. <br /> <br /> But within the budget constraints they managed to do a lot. Artically, the film looks right. The Martians and their tripods are fairly well done, and very true to Wells's descriptions. I was especially impressed with the heat jet. Although the Thunder Child series, which was one of the highlights of the film, is very disappointing. It is a pity that they can no longer afford real sets or better quality animation. <br /> <br /> The acting and direction won't win Oscars. For the most part, they are competent, not bad, but not outstanding. The music is also pretty good, though not on one of the great Hollywood composers. <br /> <br /> I'm actually glad it didn't get a theatrical release because the budget constraint would have made it. Looks much worse on a big screen. As it stands, I will be similar to a BBC TV adaptation of classical literature. <br /> <br /> A few nitpicks: Most of the scenes are presented with different colored filters (mostly red). It may have been an artistic choice, but it is very inconsistent, and looks more like a messy job of mastering the DVD. And the author / narrator's obviously false mustache changes from scene to scene. <br /> <br /> Bottom line - Is it worth seeing? If you can overcome the technical and budget constraints and come into the story, I think you'll enjoy it, especially if you've actually read the original H G Wells novel. However, if you are easily switched off by cheap production values, you will do the best for this (unless you are a MST3K fan). Be warned though, that the movie lasts a full 3 hours, so I don't recommend watching it all in one sitting. <br /> <br /> VAT: A completely different version of World War (aka "INVASION") came out on the same DVD that Spielberg hit the theaters: http://imdb.com/title/tt0449040/ . It's also made on a budget, but has been updated to date like the Spielberg movie - but it's much better! And, moreover, Jeff Wayne makes an animated film of his best-known album from 1978, but it won't be until 2007.
