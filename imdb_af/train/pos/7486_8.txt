I really like this movie for some reasons, I'm going to leave, but I want to argue why I don't think people like it. First, there are people out there who just want to hate Tom Cruise. I don't really understand it. Secondly, Cameron Crowe I think successfully, two groups of filmmakers are filming this film. The casual, relaxed, "not to think too difficult" group of moviegoers is confused as the plot takes a full 180 at the end of the movie. And the deep, philosophical, mysterious supporters are devastated when Crowe has one of his characters, explaining the riddle fully. <br /> <br /> It's a good movie. And Tom Cruise does a very good job in it. I think it's probably his best performance of what I've seen, although I haven't seen all his movies, or even a majority of them. The supporting role is also good. Penelope Cruz gives a solid performance and Jason Lee was nice. <br /> <br /> I like the story, and I think that's what Vanilla Sky is more than anything. It's a mystery, an adventure and a romantic comedy, but it's usually just a good story. And it has many philosophical undertones on it, and many similar ideas and stories like this take place in historical philosophy. David Aames (Cruise) is the man who had everything he wanted, more or less lost, a second chance with a catch to get it all back and finally his demons and the full extent of what happens, choose reality, simplicity and normality to see if he can finally get one thing he could never get: happiness. Many people were disappointed that Crowe finally explained the complete riddle. I think it's necessary. The audience then knows beyond doubt that David is aware of his circumstances and that makes the choice at the end more powerful. <br /> <br /> And the music in the movie is great. It's probably what makes the movie as enjoyable as it is. In particular, "Njosnavelin" by Sigur Ros, which is a wonderful song. <br /> <br /> All in all, I'd give it 3 out of 4 stars. It's a movie with a little dust for those who like to think things through, and a wonderful story for those who want to relax. The "moderate" approach is probably why people don't like it so much because it's not a full blown secret or a full blown love story. It mixes and adapts to different elements and genres.
