This movie is one of my favorite top 10 movies. Many people see it for the first time and few of the movies in the movie probably do not understand why I find it so attractive, so I will try to explain ... <br /> <br /> The movie is rich in historical detail and cultural insights, and while it has a few minor anachronisms, they are completely forgiven. The story is a tale of the well-known duel between Monk Benkei and the young Prince Yoshitsune on Gojo Bridge. During the battle of legend, Yoshitsune manages Benkei and becomes the monk's prince's loyal holder. However, this film is a review of the story, and involves war, dark prophecy and political maneuvering. <br /> <br /> One of the main themes in the movie is Mappo, which is the Buddha's prophecy that after 1000 years would fail his teachings and the world would fall into chaos. It was believed in Heian Japan, after the eruption of Mt Fuji and the civil war between the Taira (Heike) and the Minamoto (Genji) that the world would fall into anarchy and everything would collapse. It's a time of demons. <br /> <br /> Next is the way the film solves the problem of Yoshitsune's sword training by Karuma's Raven Goblins. Overcoming tribes have often escaped into the mountains and disguised themselves as scares to scare the locals. It is said where ninja clans have historically started. Yoshitsune's portrayal in Gojo involves it all. <br /> <br /> Then there is Benkei, and the various tribes of Buddhism depicted, including many Esoteric Buddhism of the Shingon sect. It's all fairly accurately portrayed, and just to add a little extra, the movie drives the power of meditation and Ki energy in a way that makes it integral to the story, using magical realism to make a extra dimension to the movie, but it makes it tactical and threatening. <br /> <br /> All-in-all, it is filled with fascinating cliffs and rings that are surprisingly lifelike for the period. The scenery and costumes are also completely inaccessible and very authentic. The soundtrack is huge, very fragile and ominous. I also thought the actual performances were surprisingly good. Benkei is a great devastating anti-hero, Shanao (Yoshitsune) is portrayed as a young man testing his boundaries and becoming more drunk on his own, and Tetsukichi, the abusive murderer for and interesting representation of the " ordinary man "and his less-than-flattering opinion of the murderers who feel themselves to be his socialists. <br /> <br /> Regarding the plot, to see why it is so good, I really suggest you dig an old book on Japanese history and see how this resale is an almost noisy Robin Hood versus Little John's story turns into a greedy story of intrigue, violence and infernal karma.
