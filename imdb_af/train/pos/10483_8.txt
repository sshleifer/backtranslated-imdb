Yes, this movie is predictable and certainly not awards. But then it doesn't try to be, it's not. A fun skirt with real, funny one-liners, a star and very funny show by Peter O'Toole, a groundwork and finishing of Joan Plowright. The band's performance was on the spot, each playing their part in a smart, comical way. The music was good, but not good, but filled the film nicely. From some of the negative comments I deduced that the subtle of some of the humor had gone over their heads. A good example is the remark about the "strange baseball-like game", well my dear American, it was cricket - from which baseball was derived - and the explanation to the ignorant American band was very funny to those who know cricket. . Also no, you weren't supposed to win when Carl broke a window; It was funny how Lord Foxley said "oh yes!" to get more money for the break and the driver said simultaneously "oh no", even after the money. Jeez, every joke seems to be explained to some people. All in all, I enjoyed it and laughed a lot! Well worth seeing.
