There is a certain genius behind this movie. I laughed throughout. The scene in the phone sex office, discuss how love the doppler healed, was a beautiful attempt at this genius / humor. Performance is poor, but you can see the author's message and they have talent. The doppelganger slit at the end was like ... "OK, didn't really expect it, but let's see what the movie should say." Definitely ridiculous, but a lovely idea and actually very coherent with the story. <br /> <br /> Is the point of a movie logical or is it entertaining or communicating at an emotional level? I was very bored by many movies, but this one kept my interest throughout. <br /> <br /> I think the story may have some autobiographical roots, but it's just a guess. Terrible, but good. I'm looking for other movies that this person might have done (with more experience).
