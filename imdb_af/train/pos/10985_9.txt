I was speechless and devastated after my first show - many parts of GRAY GARDENS are very funny and incredibly surreal - documentary of it, it really gives Fellini or David Lynch a run for their money in the weirdsville whip. I focused on how these women (who are clinically beyond eccentric) reveal their own humanity in the most surprising ways and I wonder if their withdrawal from the world is caused by something beyond the viability of the unreal blue blood universe, perhaps some of abuse, or perhaps just a streak of resistance and uprising that washed away from their control and adopted a life of its own. It can be one of the biggest movies that come dangerously close to exploitation, without going over the edge - as the Edies do their thing, I found things like the empty gin bottles in the litter room, cats on the bed, racoons coming out of holes in the walls, and the final scene looks incredibly sad - as a child's birthday party went badly. Definitely worth seeing and looking out - you will never forget it, but very disturbing.
