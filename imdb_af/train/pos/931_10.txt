I enjoy all the versions of this story, but this one is my favorite all the time. George C.Scott gives a depth to the Scrooge character that the other does not give. The movie shows more about why he gets so bitter. The changes in Scrooge appear gradually as he meets the various ghosts and the incidents they show him. <br /> <br /> This movie has the best Tiny Tim by far. He is the right age rather than being played by someone who is almost teenager, as in other movies. Anthony Walters still has most or most of his baby teeth. <br /> <br /> David Warner is great like Bob Cratchit. He is such a versatile actor. He portrays a man who clearly loves his family. He also plays the role with dignity not as a wimpy man who cherishes under Scrooges'thumb, but as a man who builds gracefully because he has a family to provide. Susannah York and the other actors do a good job of bringing the characters to life. Edward Woodward is the best Christmas ghost I've ever seen. He is often played as a very Santa character. In this he shows anger at Scrooges' attitudes and really makes Scrooge again. <br /> <br /> The costumes and sets really bring the London or Dickens time to life. A wonderful movie.
