I saw it this morning at Legacy Theater in the Joseph Smith Memorial Building in Salt Lake City. I will assume that one's level of enjoyment during this movie will be mainly based on the level of acceptance of Joseph's story. <br /> <br /> However, it was very well done, well done and had a good score. Coming to Salt Lake City is a must see in the Legacy Theater. I have never been to a best theater as far as image quality, sound quality and ambiance throughout my life ... I wonder if the Church will let me see Batman Begins there! Because I am LOS and I see Joseph as a prophet, I have been touched in several places and have been brought to tears several times ... what I am supposed to do, as they have been dispensing tissues before the movie started! In any case, I am told that this film is available in several LDS Visitor Centers around the world. If you have 70 minutes, look it out because if you believe Joseph Smith or not, he tells a fascinating story.
