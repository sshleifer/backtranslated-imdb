This is one of the better comedies ever on television. Season one was hilarious as was most of the following seasons. The only reason I give this show 9/10 is because of the unfortunate final season. The only good part of the final season was the final. My favorite part of this show was the scenes that were cut to people's imagination, often portraying the characters in well-known TV shows or 70's movies. It's a rare show in that I enjoyed every character (with the exception of the final season ... too late to try to develop a new character and FEZ wasn't nearly as funny). Red's foot in your ass's reactions never got old, nor did he have Kelso's stupidity. Bravo to fox for such a good show so long, too long.
