Los Debutantes is the story of two orphans who moved south of Santiago after their mother died. The older brother, Silvio's self-confident and street-oriented, gets a job for a bad strip club owner after taking the naive Victor there for his 17th birthday. If Silvio blooms under his boss's supervision, both brothers get involved with the owner's sexy and manipulative mistress, Gracia. As the film unfolds, characters are redefined as we begin to manipulate the subtle and overt ways that each manipulate the following. <br /> <br /> The movie is well-made, with good cinematography and fast pacing. It's also pretty sexy, with lots of nudity and some pretty explicit sex scenes. It uses the newly-used technique to create different scenes from different points of view, from chronological order. Many people hate movies like this because they don't understand what's going on - Memento, Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, and many other good movies use this device. The plot itself is really nothing new, there are elements of Body Heat, Pulp Fiction and many other good movie noir. As the different layers are revealed, we develop understanding of the characters and their motivation. While the plot may be somewhat clich√©, it is also clever and entertaining. <br /> <br /> I call it a fun movie worth watching, but nothing less. I have not seen many films from Chile, and it is always interesting to see film noir from other countries. Other than that, rent it if it's available, but don't lose sleep if it isn't.
