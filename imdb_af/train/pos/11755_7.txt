I like this movie, but the music at all alumni events is just stupid. <br /> <br /> The fatal game took place in 1972. This means that the protagonists graduated in 1972. But almost all the music played at the dances etc. is from the 1950s and early 1960s. <br /> <br /> After attending my 30th high school reunion, I can assure you that the last music played during a reunion or dance of former high school is their parents' music. <br /> <br /> I understand the difficulty of finding relevant 1970s music - we all know what a deserted time it is musical. But it wasn't completely robbed, and the producers of the movie had to take more care. I found that the dance screens were very scared of my otherwise willing suspension of unbelief in the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> It was a bad director and / or producer decision.
