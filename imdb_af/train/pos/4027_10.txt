A very good adaptation of the novel by amrita pritam. Urmila and Manoj Bajpai did their best. <br /> <br /> There is a natural flair in the movie and I felt it throughout. Bollywood seemed to have finally given the sound of the sound and showed some quality artists on the screen. <br /> <br /> Table of Contents, the film depicted many what happened during the partition by showing the suffering of a particular family and also showing that trust in your life goes beyond religion. <br /> <br /> The best part was that they didn't make a drama with a lot of tear and melodrama. <br /> <br /> I just loved it.
