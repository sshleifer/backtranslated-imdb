Not only one of the biggest Jackie Chan movies, it is also one of the greatest kung-fu movies of all time. <br /> <br /> We expect crazy stunts and quick, creative action in Chan's movies, and this one sets the benchmark for others to follow. It's two hours of beautiful entertainment, which impresses the whole way. <br /> <br /> As well as the wonderful action we have a viable story and credible characters, with Chan being a more western approach to writing, blending oriental resolution methods (ie kicking ass). <br /> <br /> Overall, it's funny, serious, entertaining and groundbreaking. A must have for any kung-fu fan, while at the same time being accessible to the wider reach of the movie community.
