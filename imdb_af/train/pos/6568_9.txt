I enjoyed this movie as a child when it came out, and still to this day. A simple story that includes the search for a kidnapped girl and an adventurer literally straight from the paper feedback. It has actors who were more recognizable in the day. It should not keep the viewer giving it a whirl. Wayne Crawford stars as the main character Jake Speed. Sure, it can bite into some elements of Romancing the Stone, and Indiana Jones. But this movie is done well enough to keep it out of the basement. I'm surprised not too many people know about it. It should be overshadowed by other movies in the '86 theaters. I saw it again on cable TV. It can be hard to find as it is printed on both VHS and DVD. I managed to get an ebay DVD at less than $ 8! Cool flick.
