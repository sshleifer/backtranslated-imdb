I loved this movie. I only saw it when I was 20 (just four years ago) and I enjoyed it very much, the next day I took my own copy. The comedy is played well by everyone involved. I always have to rewind the scene where Mr. Tsanders explained why he found water at 6 feet in one area and 227 feet in another area. Also look at Jason Robards's father Play Retch. Talent ran into that family.
