I was absolutely blown away by John Cassavetes' Opening Night. It is the first film she has ever seen that looks larger, so it feels more mainstream, but it still doesn't feel like he's basing itself more than he did in his previous films. This is perhaps what makes it so intense. There is also something that is undoubtedly catholic to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> It's about what Cassavetes actually made a staple of his career, an ideal that he has expressed throughout his career as a director and is being presented here. Rowlands' character, middle-aged stage actress Myrtle Gordon, can't make herself play in the upcoming production. She follows unfinished impulse after impulse, leading to chaos on stage until she finds the right one. This is an urgent abstract representation. <br /> <br /> It is a movie that does not capture the innate management that goes through the emotional cleansing. No one understands why Myrtle does a lot of things she does, and it is seen and even portrayed as something devastating, but it can only be the best thing for her. It can be a cleansing rather than a collapse. A withdrawal, a cocoon, a rebellion, everything leads to a collapse. Cassavetes gives her character a brutal real touch, and it is early on that she does nothing with her character, but she is quiet, but emotionally satisfying that the opposite is true. <br /> <br /> The last scene, the climactic show that Myrtle shares with a character that is painfully alienated from her acting with her, is one of the most interesting, hilarious, hard-hearted, enlightening and enjoyable moments I still have ever in a movie.
