Author / director Henry Brommel did a wonderful job with his film, Panic, from the year 2000, which includes his cast of cast: William H. Macy, Tracy Ullman, John Ritter, Neve Campbell, Donald Sutherland, Barbara Bain , David Dorfman. Brommel has definitely rolled Ullman and Ritter into incredible roles, and the unfair casting is a welcome change than we normally see. <br /> <br /> "Panic" is the story of a hit, Alex (Macy) who really works for his father (Sutherland). He covers his real profession by doing mail order work; At all appearances he and his wife (Ullman) and their son Sammy (Dorfman) are a typical suburban family. Dissatisfied with his life, Alex looks for the help of a psychiatrist (Ritter), and only tells his mother (Bain). In the waiting room he meets a young woman (Campbell) whom he is immediately attracted to, which complicates his situation further. His mother broke her promise and told his father about the psychiatrist. When Alex receives his next command, he discovers that he must kill his psychiatrist. <br /> <br /> It is a profound story of a gentle, good man who was murdered by a father's monster, with his mother's knowledge killing to please his father, but also can't stand up and stop. His anger has gone so deep that he lost emotional attachment to just about everything and everyone except his son - and that is ultimately his son who wakes him up from an almost lifelong repression. When it's time for 'panic' to move, do it - fast. <br /> <br /> "Panic" doesn't seem to panic at all. In fact, it moves very slowly. But it does not move slowly, as it is poorly made - the inertia is deliberate, reflecting Alex's own psyche, slowly coming out of the mist. By making a decision on Sara, the character of Campbell, and by seeing his mark, his own psychiatrist, as a living, breathtaking person, Alex begins the relationship between what he does and who he is - and how it does not jive. And the difference between the two can lead to the loss of another psyche, Sammy's. <br /> <br /> William Macy gives another brilliant performance, such as a loving father, a distant man and a cold, the child of two monsters who never cared for a damn for his feelings or desires , a man who eventually realizes that he must walk on the board or repeat the cycle. <br /> <br /> It's not the kind of drama that plays well. in a kiosk. It's too adult, too small, too subtle, too character-driven, and too good.
