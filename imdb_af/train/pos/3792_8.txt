I saw this movie earlier today and I was amazed at how accurate the main characters dialogue is. It didn't feel like a movie - it felt more like a documentary (the part I liked best). The top ladies in this movie were really like any fifteen-year-old girls I know. <br /> <br /> All in all, a very enjoyable movie for those who enjoy independent movies.
