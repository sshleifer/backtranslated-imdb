I always tell people that "Enchanted April" is an adult movie without cussing, no sex and no violence. One can think of it as "the ultimate chick spot", but I know there are one or two enlightened men out there who also like it. Don't invite the kids. This movie is very low key. <br /> <br /> The view of "Enchanted April" is a very healing experience. The soundtrack and beautiful scenery, along with the ladies' gentle ways, bring in the peace and beauty of a pre-Raphaelite painting. <br /> <br /> Let somebody think it's just one kind of movie, I will paraphrase a line I once heard on Saturday Night Live and say that my two favorite movies are "Deer Hunter" and "Enchanted April" is.
