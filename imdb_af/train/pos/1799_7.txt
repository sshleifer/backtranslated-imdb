I'm 14 years old and I love this cartoon. Burt Reynolds and Dom Deluise make a good pair. This movie is really funny and I love the songs. My favorite songs are: "You can't keep a good puppy" and that song about the part, I think it is known as "What's mine, is yours". It was the last movie with Judith Barsi, who played Anne-Marie's voice. My favorite character is Charlie, but I find Itchy's voice so nice to hear. Although some scenes I actually found scary, I still have a hard time watching the scene with Charlie's dream, and Carface scares me shit. Other characters like King Gator, I really found funny. The end was adorable and was actually sad, made me cry. I give this movie 7/10.
