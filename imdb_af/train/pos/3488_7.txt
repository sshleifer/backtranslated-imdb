WWE needs a savior because Wrestlemania rolled 14 around. The departure of Bret Hart and the subsequent evaporation of the Heart Foundation left the Vile D-Generation X-stable unattended in the WWE. Their contemptuous leader, Shawn Michaels, stole the title of Hart, thanks to Vince McMahon's interference. With the help of his cohorts, Triple H and Chyna systematically pulled out someone who challenged his rule. But at the Royal Rumble a new rival emerged. Stone Cold Steve Austin. Hate by McMahonagement, Austin worried the DX. So worried that they were the special coach of "The Baddest Man on the Planet", Mike Tyson. Austin really has a chance against him in his title match with Shawn Michaels. <br /> <br /> But first, there was an undercard to go through that started with the Legion of Doom and won a forgotten 15-team game. Royal to become NO.1 contenders for the tagitems. I actually forgot that this game existed until I watched the PPV. Not very good and emphasized the lack of depth in the branding department at that time. <br /> <br /> Next game defended the lightweight heavyweight title by champion Taka Michonoku against Aguila. The WWE founded the Light Heavyweight Title to compete with the strong Cruiserweight division in WCW. It was not successful and it was the only time that the title was ever defended in Wrestlemania. Short game, over five minutes, and actually too short to reach. What did little was exciting and it was a nice game that Taka kept. <br /> <br /> OK, our next game has defended DX member Triple H defending the WWE European title, which he won. Farcian fashion from Shawn Michaels at RAW in December and did not defend on PPV against Owen Hart, the Sole Survivor. Triple H had a great entrance with the DX band there to perform his theme song. Chyna accompanies Triple H to ring, but is then handcuffed to the WWE Commissioner Sgt Slaughter. Triple H and Owen have a nice little game, before Chyna intervened, causing a low blow on Heart that kept Triple H. Good game, could have been good if it went a little longer. <br /> <br /> But of course we don't want to take away from our next game, who saw Goldust's real life mate and wife, Marc Mero and Sable. and Luna Vachon in the first mixed brand competition in Wrestlemania in 8 years. And in all honesty it was not worth the wait. While it wasn't terrible, the game wasn't memorable either. It was the end of Mero's only run in the WWE, and the main goal was to prosecute the breakdown of his relationship with Sable. <br /> <br /> Next we see Ken Shamrock flip and himself the Intercontinental Championship while destroying the IC champion The Rock, but then refused to abandon his one-loop supply team, which led the referee reversed his decision. It was a short game, but decent for what it was. <br /> <br /> Next saw the first good game of the night as WWE Tag Team Champions lost the New Age Outlaws to Cactus Jack and Chainsaw Charlie in a fun dumpster game. The decision was overturned the following night, as Cactus and chain saw threw the Outlaws into a dumpster backyard, rather than the one used in the game, but it was still a fun game. <br /> <br /> Now is the time for the highly anticipated first meeting between Kane and his brother, the Undertaker. Kane cost Undertaker the WWE Championship at the Royal Rumble and then killed him when he closed Shawn Michaels in the coffin. He set him on fire for the Undertaker who burned their parents' home and murdered him years ago. It was a decent match and told a nice story, as the Underataker understood everything Kane could throw him and then knocked him off with three tombstones to end the game. <br /> <br /> It was just the main event that WWE saw. Champion face Steve Austin with Mike Tyson as the gas enforcer. In his match with the Undertaker at the Royal Rumble, Michaels suffered a debilitating back injury and was notable in this match despite his physical limitations. Three hundred H and Chyna were banned early in the rear. The match ended with Austin attempting to hit Sweet Chin Music and the Stone Cold Stunner with the ref down. Tson then got in the ring to count the three, celebrate the victory with Austin and then knock out Michaels after the match. It seems that Tyson and Austin were together and the cat has been playing with the mouse. <br /> <br /> It was the last PPV match for Shawn Michaels for four and a half years. It helped establish Austin as the biggest star in the wrestling business and the mainstream publicity acquired by Tyson's appearance was a major turning point in the WWE's struggle with WCW. Austin continues to become the largest star in WWE History, and along with Rock, Mick Foley, the Undertaker and Triple H, the WWE is leading through the era of achieving its highest level of cultural relevance. And it all started here at Wrestlemania 14.
