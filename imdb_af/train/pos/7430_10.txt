Personally, I really loved this movie, and it surprised me especially. The two main actors give us such a great performance, it is finally very sad to know what eventually happened to their characters. <br /> <br /> The alchemy between Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson is wonderful, and The song is just as good as they are. <br /> <br /> So I didn't feel surprised when I learned that it won five gold globe awards (the most rewarding movie at the Golden Globes), an Oscar and even a Grammy. This movie is a classic that is earned to be seen by someone. A big movie, often criticized (perhaps because Streisand dared to get involved, certainly as a "co-director"). Her artwork is the greatest, and it will please you!
