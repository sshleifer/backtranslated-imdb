A true classic. Beautifully filmed and performed. Uncover an area of ​​Paris that is alive and filled with comedy and tragedy. Although the area of ​​'Hotel du Nord' and the Hotel itself still exist, it is not so gay (in the original sense of the word) and joy as it should ever have been. The film makes a longing for the past, which is lost, with a sigh and bittersweetness.
