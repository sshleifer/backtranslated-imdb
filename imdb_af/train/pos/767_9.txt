Being a true product of hip hop and electronic dance music generation, it is without a doubt one of my favorite movies of all time. Beat Street, although not as "authentic" in some respects as Wild Style, is a movie guaranteed to draw the heartbeat of anyone who prides itself on the culture of urban sampling / DJ-based music and electro club culture. br /> <br /> Although I will admit that the dialogue is sometimes somewhat cheesy, you can't help feeling for the characters, and finally "wish you were there" for the start of hip hop culture in New York City in the early eighties. The b-boys battle scene at the Roxy Night Club (a real-time, real-time competition between the legendary Rock Steady Crew and the NYC Breakers) is just as essential for a hip-hop fan's archives as any classic album. Look at some of the breakers' slow-motion movements, if possible, to truly appreciate the athletic and stylistic expertise of a seasoned B-boy / B girl. All praise because of the Zulu nation !!!
