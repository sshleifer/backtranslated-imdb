Before I saw people, my impression of quiet comedy was actually slapstick, and just slapstick. I couldn't imagine how screen comedy would be possible without relying heavily on spoken word or numerous pratfalls. But this masterful movie proved wrong to me. Davies, in my opinion, was probably the biggest comic actress to meet Lucille Ball. I call Lucy mainly because Davies's ways and facial expressions remind me of the point that I wonder if Davies wasn't one of Ball's primary influences. It comes from a 21-year-old who has never seen the quiet comedy, and I have to say that no matter how many of the time-specific references you actually get (I don't seem to have), you won't be bored Movie. You will probably even laugh more than you would at most talkie comedies. It is not only my favorite quiet comedy, but easily my ten favorite comedies of all time.
