In truth, it's really not a "movie", as much as an extensive final episode; By this I mean that if you did NOT follow the TV series (Murderousness: Life on the street), I suspect you would have a hard time following this made TV. That said, "Homicide: The Movie" is still a good look. I think it's a lot about a television production that every single cast member returns, many years of absence, to portray their characters again and bring it to an incredible program. The movie brings out that sense of "family", not just among the characters, but also between the actors. It's all very bittersweet and knowing it will be LAST time, we all see them again under the title HOMICIDE. Story-wise, I lacked this movie a bit. Giardello's Mayor Candidate Candidate looks particularly busy, and I felt his shooting could be within the parameters of his regular position, as the Leader. Also, Det. Bayliss's extreme plot twist, which hangs at the end of the series, is finally resolved, but I never felt it needed to be forever; I enjoyed being left with a mystery (let's remember that the first episode's first case was also unresolved for the entire series!). As a DEVOTED fan of the TV series, I can love this movie and the fact that it was even made after H: LOTS was canceled, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who didn't have the slightest exposure to the series . Now, if they just release it on DVD ...
