I don't want to spend that long, and I've seen the trailer, and if you're not online. However, I don't recommend it - it was poorly crafted and didn't pack any of the laughter or magic from the movie. So those who avoid this movie due to the bad trailer should give this one a chance. It's really funny. I was blown away by the ingenuity and originality of this film. The first 40 minutes had me in the hysteria on the floor. My only problem was that it unnecessarily developed into a bad Austin Powers movie in the last 20. However, this is one of the few movies where the champion ends, doesn't like me The rest of the movie (which is usually the case ). Everyone gives a good performance (especially Joan Cusack) and there are really good moments. I personally plan to see it again when it comes out - just to catch all the details I laughed at at the first sight!
