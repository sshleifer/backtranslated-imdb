Possible spoilers: late-appearing <br /> <br /> Rare you see so many fine and memorable character characters (almost completely actresses to be exact) in one movie. Although some only appear for comos, each one is a gem. The British do this combination of comedy and real pathos better than any IMO, so it is no surprise that most of the actors are Brits. <br /> <br /> The music is wonderful; undoubtedly it had to be baptized (plays Leslie Caron * really the bass so well? Maybe - who knew?) But Clio Lane was unmistakably herself - her hot visceral sound still twists my crutch like some other jazz singers. <br /> <br /> As an aging musician himself, not quite as old and certainly not in that class, it was also a hearty movie - a great movie for anyone wondering if they were in their profession past or adjourn whatever it may be. And of course a great celebration of the life of the stage. <br /> <br /> I missed a little bit of the opening, but a tentative 9/10 - and definitely sure we want to see the whole thing.
