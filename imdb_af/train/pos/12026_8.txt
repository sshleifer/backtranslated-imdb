I must say that this TV movie was the work that really showed how talented Melissa Joan Hart is. We are so used to seeing her in a sitcom and I really hope a TV station will show this TV movie again soon, as it will show the Sabrina fans that MJH is in a drama. Since we've been watching her for Sabrina for 5 years now and giving the viewers a taste of her unused talent, it will be a plus. Melissa plays her role so well in the fact that her parents have to be "chased out" so that she can be with the man she loves. One thing that all Sabrina viewers will see, Melissa works with David Lascher in this, before taking Josh's role on Sabrina. It will therefore be neat to see it now when it is broadcast again. Hopefully MJH will play good roles in movies or even in more TV movies, such as Kellie Martin who has always shone in TV movies. Many unused talent waiting to break out when it comes to Melissa Joan Hart, you always pour Melissa !!!
