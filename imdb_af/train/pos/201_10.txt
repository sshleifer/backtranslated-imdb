The big and underrated Marion Davies shows her things in the late (1928) silent comedy that also shows the wonderful William Haines. Davies plays a hiccup from Georgia that collapses Hollywood with the help of Haines. They appear in cheap comedies until Marion is "discovered" and becomes a great dramatic star. A huge lampoon on Hollywood and its predictions. Davies and Haines are a wonderful team (too bad they never made a talkie) and the guests of Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, John Gilbert, Elinor Glynn and Marion Davies (you should see it ) is a hoot. A must have for any serious movie buff or for anyone interested in still malignant Marion Davies!
