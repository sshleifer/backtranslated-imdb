This movie is a bit unusual because it has a very scanty plot and the movie itself is done at a very slow and quiet pace. While making it very different from the average Grant movie, it is still highly viewable and entertaining. It's like someone said, "Let's just follow Cary and see how he is disturbed by all the little problems that arise when you rehab a house." Mostly what a fun actor he is in the movie and the great support he gets from Myrna Loy and Melvin Douglas, the film works very well. While the movie has pretty modest pretensions, it makes the most of the material. It's a great movie for Cary Grant fans or for the whole family.
