Okay, let's face it. it's a god-fearing movie. The plot (as it is) is terrible, the acting worse. But the movie was made for some reason and just one reason, just like all the terrible Mario Lanza movies ... just to hear the voice of the star, in this case Pavarotti in his first. Well, so maybe the Lanza movies were an excuse for him to hit women, but this movie is about Luciano. It alone is worth watching the movie. A grand opera star jammed on himself faces fears, finds humility and love along the way, and also many hit numbers. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I'm being disadvantaged at a number of levels. I'm Italian. I'm a big Pavarotti fan (is there anything about Pavarotti that isn't big, including his fan base?). And when I first saw this movie, I went out alone and saw the height and depth of life's possibilities and love for the first time. As horrible as this movie is, the beautiful voice and memories are enough to allow me to breathe deeply and love again. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is stingy and awful. But the voice is immortal and timeless, and the voice is what it is all about. So I give this movie a high rating in the hope that someone who has never heard Pavarotti will listen and watch and enjoy a new level of music and love, especially as he is now gone. Like Italian food you've never tried before, try it! You may be pleasantly surprised, as a Luciano lover or prospective Pavarotti peep.
