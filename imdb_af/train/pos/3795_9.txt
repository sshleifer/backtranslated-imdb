After watching this movie at the SF Independent Film Festival, I couldn't wait to hear how to get a copy. Jim McKay talks about the film, which then presented his ironic situation: how to get a film depicting minorities (women, non-whites) who are solving controversial issues (teenage pregnancy, teenager motherhood, racial identity, single-parent households) and how to write a faithful script on all these topics is a mid-thirties white man. The multiracial, versatile audience of mostly adults painted on the film's fantastic story, detailed characters and a fantastic depiction of a true teen life. However, most of the teenagers left the building. It made me think it is a movie that is best seen by adults with children, as a starting point for discussion rather than, as many adults felt there, a movie teenagers should see because it's about them. "So, distribution questions - how do we get our hands on? The internet (retail) will be a good way - this is a film that will be buried, such as" Pups "or other radical modern teenage films - and McKay responded. His credits as a writer / director, McKay was sensitive and detailed in his work, working with the actors in the Crown Heights area where the film was set, portraying characters in their own vision of what they think was - with the results sobering realistically.
