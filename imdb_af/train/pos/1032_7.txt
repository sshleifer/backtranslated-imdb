A message movie, but a pretty good one. Outstanding throw, top to bottom. Interestingly in that Bette Davis plot line is basically recovered! The extremely negative reviews (name on the screenplay / playwright, who somehow object to many negative comments about 'Angles in America' etc. Etc.) are objecting to the film being preached about Germany in World War II. Gosh, it's just a bit too sophisticated understanding of morality for me. <br /> <br /> Theater and filmmaking and acting styles vary over time and of course 70 years later this particular movie will not be made. this way. Yes Casablanca is a better movie (I think), but although it was made in the same year and both had Nazis in them, Casablanca is mainly a love story. The love story in this movie takes second place to the spy plot - more of a thrill. Both have a very large number of somewhat cute accents and wonderful character characters. The kids are a bit boring and could be edited
