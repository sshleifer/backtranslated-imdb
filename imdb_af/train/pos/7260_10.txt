Hi everyone my name Larissa I'm 13 years old when I was about 4 years old, I saw curly summons and it knocked my socks. I've been watching that movie a long time ago, about 30 minutes ago. . Alisan porter is a very good actor and I love that movie. It's so funny when she handles the cards. Every time I see the movie in the end, I cry it is so said I know I'm only 13, but it's such a touch story, it's actually strange, it's Alisan now 25 years old. Every time I watch a movie, someone is always young and the movie comes out like a year after they made it and when you see it and find out how old the person in the movie really is, you're wondering how one age after the next. Like Harry Potter. The movie was also fantastic, but Daniel was about 12 years old in the first movie and I was about 11. So, how can he go from 12 to 16 within 12 years and I'm just 13. I'm not sure if he is 16 Now, I think he's almost 18, but it's so strange when you watch one movie and the next there about 4 years when you were first. I'm not sure I have a great imagination and I like to relax it. I'm kind of a computer person, but I also like to do many kids. I am very clever as curly summons in the movie, but one thing I don't like in the movie is when the man calls the foster home and sucks curly, it is taken away. I'll kill that man if he really did it in real life. . Well, I'm going to stop writing, I know sometimes, write a lot, but kids have a lot in the head that needs to come out and if they don't, children will never learn. <br /> <br /> Larissa
