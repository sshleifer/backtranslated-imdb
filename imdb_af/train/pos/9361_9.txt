Rule over me (titled after the song) is a movie that will surely bring a tear to almost everyone's eye. It was a moving story of a man (sandler) who lost his family in the attacks of 9-11 World Trade Centers. Years later he runs into an old college roommate (cheadle) whom he does not even recognize because of the post-dramatic stress resulting from the loss of his family. The two recognize their old friendship and Cheadle's character, Johnson, realizes he must get Sandler's character, Fineman, before it's too late. <br /> <br /> It was the first movie that made me cry a long time. time. It is totally worth watching and after seeing it, I am positive that the viewer will appreciate his or her family a lot more.
