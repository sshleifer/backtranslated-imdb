Stephane Rideau was already a star for his tour de force in Wild Reeds, and he is one of France's biggest indie stars. In this film he plays Cedric, a local boy who meets on the beach holiday, with Mathieu (newcomer Jamie Elkaim, in a beautiful, nuanced ethereal performance). Mathieu has a complex relationship with his sick mother, claim and sister (with whom he has a competitive relationship). Soon the two will fall in love. <br /> <br /> The movie's broken story - consisting of long flashes, pieces and pieces of the present and real-time forward-moving in the future - is a little scary. Director Sebastien Lifshitz does not indicate what period we are, and the story line can be difficult to follow. But stick it out: the last 45 minutes of the movie is so staggering that you can't take your eyes off the screen. In turn, heartbreaking and uplifting, this movie is accompanied by "Beautiful Thing" like a cinema.
