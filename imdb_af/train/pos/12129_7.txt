It is a well-directed film by John Cromwell, who was not a good director, but who made fine films, including the 1937 version of 'The Prsoner of Zenda'. In a London that can only manage Hollywood, atmospheric but nothing like the right thing, it's a story of obsession and the love of the novel, by Somerset Maughan. <br /> <br /> I look forward to seeing it on DVD, as I have never seen it before and as a great fan of Bette Davis wanted to see her in a role that one of her early grandes considered has. So I bought it. Well, she looked good, but I'm sorry to say that her London cock accent just made me laugh. Bette Davis was one of the greatest film actors, making no mistake, but here she made one. It was impossible to take her character seriously. It wasn't as horrible as the Dick Van Dyke's 'Mary Poppins' cockney accent, but close. <br /> <br /> In the other important role was Leslie Howard and he did very well. He was a subtle and intelligent actor. The supporting actors free themselves well. Worth watching despite Ms Davis' vocal gymnastics.
