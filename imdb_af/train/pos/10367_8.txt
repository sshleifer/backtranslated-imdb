When I first saw "A Cry in the Dark", I had no idea what the plot was. But when I saw it, I was shocked at what it depicted. When I saw it a second time in an Australian Cinema class, I realized a second point: communication problems. You see, when a dingo hit Lindy Chamberlain's (Meryl Streep) baby, she and her husband, Michael (Sam Neill), were sad, but didn't show it. As Seventh-day Adventists, they believed that God wanted to do it, and they couldn't grieve it. But when people across Australia saw their lack of sadness, everyone began to believe that Lindy did it herself. <br /> <br /> The point is that the wrong message was communicated to the public, and that changed people against Lindy. Although it was a pure accident, it still happened. This can be one of the biggest disasters arising from the existence of mass media, regardless of the political views of any media sales. <br /> <br /> Regarding performances, Streep does a very good job with an Australian accent (no surprise). there), and Sam Neill is the same size. You will probably be blown away just by what you see here. Definitely one of Fred Schepisi's best movies ever.
