The only reason I saw this movie was for Jimmy Fallon, whom I loved since the 9th grade, which was his first year on SNL. I'm a hard-working Yankees fan, and I didn't find the movie painful until the last 15 minutes when they started showing clips of the ALCS games. I had to cover my ears and make small sounds so I didn't have to hear what shouldn't be heard, but otherwise it was completely portable. <br /> <br /> I thought Jimmy played the role very well, because the character was supposed to be nervous and strange, and he was a nervous and strange man. I know it can't be an Oscar award, but the movie is just a light, fun, romantic comedy that is actually suitable for both women and men to watch. <br /> <br /> Jimmy and Drew worked well together, and they had much better chemistry on camera than other actors in the past. (Ed Burns and Angelina Jolie in that silly movie? What?) I think Jimmy has a positive career ahead of him and thank you, because Taxi could have killed it. I think Fever Pitch will help him a lot. Everyone should stop being so critical of his acting ability because he is just starting out in movies. I think it should be difficult, and if you look at any of the other great actors of our time (Tom Hanks, Russell Crowe, etc.), you'll see that they started in some flops. Busom Buddies? Australian soap operas? Here Jimmy wants a successful career on the screen. I never wanted to leave him, but what can you do?
