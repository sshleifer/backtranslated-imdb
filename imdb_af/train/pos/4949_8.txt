10 ITEMS OF LESS is one of the 'under the radar' images drained by the simplicity of most independent movies: honest, ad hoc performances by its two leaders - Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega creating a fairly complementary form if it is unlikely that duo. The big thing is, this whole movie seems unlikely despite its 'road movie' roots. How Morgan Freeman's nameless character comes psychologically (not physically) to where he meets this extinct lookout girl, who has an unhealthy relationship with her current supervisor (which also happens to her husband who is facing, played by Bobby Cannavale in " a small role) is somehow left for us to witness more than to deduce and their spectacular banter - two people on the opposite sides of the coin of society - is deceptively simple. So, in a nutshell, while there is no bang! Moments of Earth-Spreading Revelations, this movie is a peculiar little mood piece that probably lost in the collapse of Indians that came out in 2006, but needs to be earned, even if it's just for honesty.
