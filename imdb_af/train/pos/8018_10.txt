In this Muppet movie, Kermit, Miss Piggy, Fozzie, Gonzo, Rowlf, Scooter, Camillia, Dr. Teeth, Floyd, Animal, Janice and Zoot University graduates who decide to bring their successful college musical, Manhattan Melodies, to Broadway. Unfortunately, no producer will even meet with the Muppets. After refusing too many producers, Scooter suggests that the Muppets decide to continue. However, Kermit still believes he can get his performance on Broadway, but after he finally made it and told everyone that he was selling the show, Kermit gets amnesia and the others don't know where he is. <br /> <br /> It features great scenes, including a live action series launched by Muppet Babies, a wedding series filled with Muppets, including the Sesame Street cast and Traveling Matt (from Fraggle Rock) , Scooter as a movie writer and a scene where Rizzo and the other rats cook breakfast. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is that more characters are no longer included. Sure, many of them appear at the wedding, but there had to be a significant role for Bunsen, Beaker, Beauregard and Sweetums. Lippe had to be part of The Electric Mayhem in this movie as he was in the Muppet Show's last season. and The Great Muppet Caper, a Mrs. Piggyshond Foo Foo also had to be with her. (Rizzo The Rat, also performed by Steve Whitmire, had a major role in this movie, and he wasn't very familiar at that time).
