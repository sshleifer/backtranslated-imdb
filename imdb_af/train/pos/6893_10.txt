Gerard Phillipe is absolutely perfect in this movie, funny, gentle, brave and lover. He gives a superior dimension to a movie that is even a masterpiece, so much by the other actors (Gina Lollobrigida: miaoooou !!) as by the story or the rhythm. Never sow, always create new emotions: for me, the best French movie of all time.
