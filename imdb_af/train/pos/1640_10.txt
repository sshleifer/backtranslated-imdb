"Heartland" is a wonderful portrayal of how it really was to stay on the border. The hard work and individual power needed to survive the climates of the climate and the lack of medical care are mixed with the companionship and the interdependence of the settlers. The drama was especially significant because the story is based on the diaries of real people whose descendants still live there. It was also nice to live in the west by seeing real people. No one was glamorous or seemed to have spent a session with the makeup or costume department. Conchatta Ferrell is just wonderful. She is an example of the strong, persevering people who came to Wyoming in the early 20th century and who are not confronted by a new life in a new country.
