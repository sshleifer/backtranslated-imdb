Just watched this movie on DVD and thought the play was very good, but the whole story left a lot to be desired. This movie has the same texture and look of Panic in Needle Park or Drugstore Cowboy. Hard to believe people can live this type of lifestyle; on the lower body of society, in which their total existence is based on hardcore drug use, crime, violence, sex and a complete lack of self-respect for anyone or anything, including themselves. <br /> <br /> Val Kilmore is outstanding in his role as "burned" former porn star, John Holmes. The supporting role is just as good. However, it is a dark, dark, disturbing and depressing film. The murder was brutal, but the daily lives of these people were also brutal. Unless you were interested in these murders or being a "fan" of John Holmes, it's really not a movie to watch. If you want to see a drama drama on murder, Truman Capote's 1960s in Cold Blood with Scott Wilson and Robert Blake are much better.
