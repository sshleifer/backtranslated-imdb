Carlos Mencia was excellent, it's an hour special. He worked hard to show everyone that he was the right deal. I know people said he was stolen material in this special, but that's not true. Carlos brings comedy in front of the way he wants it, not how anyone else wants it, so he's so good. People say he is not funny, because he says they are too much, and they have not yet realized it is part of his act, and they do not want it, but he does so in any case and succeeds in it. to make people laugh. For all the haters out there, here's a message, Carlos is here to stay, you have no point in bringing him down.
