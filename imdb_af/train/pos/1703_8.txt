Being from a small town in Illinois myself, I can immediately relate to this movie. In view of the era in which it was made, the townspeople seem uncomfortable as many as I grew up. Yes, the plot is so-so. And yes, the acting will not be nominated for an Oscar soon. But that's not the point. The point is to suspend reality and just have FUN. And this movie has fun aplenty. From the greedy, unashamed banker to the good sense, but subdued deputy, this movie is made to make fun at the SciFi genre and small town that is the best. Who can't smile at the eyes of the Enforcer Drone or the Vern Droid? and I loved the FarmZoid. Wish I had one when I grew up. Generally speaking, considering the technology they had available at the time, it's a pleasant skirt in your childhood, when you can put Popcorn in the hand on a Saturday afternoon, and laugh at the small town's foibles. It's a movie I will watch over and over again, for no reason other than having fun on myself and my little towns.
