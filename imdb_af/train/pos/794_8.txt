I was very surprised how much I enjoyed this movie. I thought it was funny, sexy, painful and hot. Andie MacDowell's performance is nuanced and vulnerable. For once, the director of a MacDowell movie did not make her beauty a different character in the film. The romance between Kate and her young man is fun to watch and it plays very well. Her relationship with her friends is a thorn and a balm in her life. Imelda Stalinson, who was an MVP in so many British films, does a good job in this. There are some tragedies in this, but I think the movie was finally saved by the brilliant scene, clear direction and witty writing. The film quality is excellent and the music is also good, although it is not available on the soundtrack.
