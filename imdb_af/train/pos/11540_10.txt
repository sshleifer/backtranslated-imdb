This is the Neil Simon piece of work that receives a lot of praise! "The Odd Couple" is a kind of jewel that goes inside. You have Felix Ungar (Jack Lemmon); a hypochondrial, fassy neat freak, and a big thorn in the side of his roommate, Oscar Madison (Walter Matthau); a total demolition. However, these men have great work. Felix is ​​a news writer, and Oscar is a sports writer. Both men are divorced, Felix's wife is near, while Oscar's are across the US (West Coast). Well, what can you say? Two men living together in one roof without making each other crazy are impossible and unlikely. It's a lot of laughter and fun. I liked the part where the two British neighbors talking to both men and after Oscar kicked out Felix, he became happy and stayed with them when he didn't eat with them the night before. It's about time Felix needs to lift. I think all the neat freaks are neat to lift. They can be picky, but they must also be patient. A very fun movie, and a nuevo classic. Neil Simon's "The Odd Couple" is a must see classic movie. 5 stars!
