Just like wine, "Johnny Dangerously" gets better and better every day. This clever, witty, well-directed film can stand very well on its own - but as a parody of the gangster genre it is truly outstanding. In fact, this is, of course, the best movie of its kind ... the funniest spoof of mob movies and even the various period - although this position is probably easier to reach if its main competitors are such primitive, vulgar and dull pseudo-comedies. as "Jane Austen's Mafia".
