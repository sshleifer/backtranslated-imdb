The Herd was unfairly tortured as a lesser "Se7en" ripoff. There is really no reason to compare the two, except perhaps for the similar scenery in the final revelation. <br /> <br /> Now that it's out of the way, I go into why the herd is in some ways very interesting. Mostly it is a drama piece rather than a full blown thriller about a very vigilant social worker who monitors sexual offenders. At first you can clearly see that his work has the better of him. Apparently in two scenes where he first interrogates an offender and embraces him and second when a woman tries to pick him up and everything he can think of, his standard questions are from his questionnaire. Gems are very good. such as Errol Babbage, the aforementioned social worker. His way of doing his job is no different from that of a police officer, he is carrying a gun and is constantly looking at newspapers and providing legal officers with information if his "herd" can be responsible for sexual crime. He is also a person who has lost all the happiness of life and seems to be his only relief to do his own vigilante justice on his flock. Twice you see him smile, once when he apologizes for the exchange of his partner and the other after hitting a member of his flock. <br /> <br /> As a brand new movie, The Flock is not that successful. Something confusing and with some annoying plots, but it does have a number of striking pieces. <br /> <br /> Overall The Herd is a solid drama about a man who performs a dehumanizing work and in the end he has to work hard To prevent him from being swallowed by the abyss, he surrounds him . The world we live in is a pretty sick place and the further one can be far from the worst, the happier that person is. The herd gets the point pretty over.
