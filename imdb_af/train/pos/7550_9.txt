Wow. A really fantastic movie with many super-surreal images, dark intent and a black, funny sense of how cartoon animals should see the world. It is populated with a lot of cute world-wide characters that bend and flow with the warped backgrounds.As with all cool fantasy, the immersion chart is secondary to the obvious visuals and we follow a small cat and his zombie sister as they encounter , flood, water elephants, samurai swordsmen and pigs that fish. I have never heard of it, but now I love it - probably because it reminds me of the surreal pencil work of American cartoonist; Bill Plympton. It is a demented joy for fans of strange, beautiful things and it glued me onto the screen of fear that I would miss something unbelievable. Simply put, it is 'Hello Kitty' without the 'o'.
