Valentine is now one of my favorite slasher movies. The deaths have been expanded and most of the acting is good. Marley Shelton grew up as the female lead (much better than Jennifer Love Hewitt in the "I Know ..." movies). David Boreanaz, who is the main reason I saw this movie, played a small role, but he played well. The exception to the list of good actors is Denise Richards. She was horrible in this. The only scene I was happy to see was SPOILER * her dying scene. All in all, it's a good movie to watch. You should definitely watch it before looking again at "Scream" or "I Know ...".
