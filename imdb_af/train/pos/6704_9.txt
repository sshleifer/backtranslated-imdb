For the first three seasons, Sabrina was a jewel hidden on TGIF (and later, early school afternoon boys). Every episode has a maniac, zany energy and fast fire pacing that overwhelms the occasional awkward joke. Melissa Joan Hart expressed a great talent for physical comedy, especially in her facial expressions. Her two aunts, who play the straight men, or as straight as two witches, have a great comic timing and general chemistry with Hart. Salem, as a talking cat, was free to venture into what crazy scheme he was interested in, and could laugh and let it all down because he was a talking cat. Sabrina's friends have completed the social experience at school, including the typical "evil cheerleader" and "totalitarian principal". Perhaps the most interesting and unique aspect of the show was the ability to collect pop culture (eg Bands of the era, Jerry Springer), archetype human condition / morality (eg, the importance of friendship, the spirit of Christmas) and the literal representation of such related metaphors in the Magic Empire. Unfortunately, like so many other programs throughout the age of television, the show hit its peak during the first three years, coinciding with Sabrina who attended high school. Beginning of the season four, the move to the college marked a decrease in the overall quality of the show, especially when the authors preferred to propose Josh as Harvey's rival and thin excuses for Aunt Hilda and Zelda keep the screen as key players. The last season, where Sabrina worked at a pop culture magazine, was undoubtedly disappointing. But ultimately, Sabrina (especially the high school years) remains a unique entry as a hybrid situational comedy with magical elements that elevates it beyond the tiring price produced each year in this genre.
