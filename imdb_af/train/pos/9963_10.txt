I saw this movie when I was a girl. And I enjoyed it every time. Sure the graphics are a little cheese, compared to now, but back in the 70's it was wonderful. I only saw it in the original Spanish version and thought it was wonderful. That was how I remembered my Christian cases with my family - magic. Santa was wonderful and I couldn't wait for him to come back every year. <br /> <br /> If you have a child / children and speak Spanish, bring them to this old-fashioned version of "Santa Claus". This is a different version from what we used today, but who says there is one way? <br /> <br /> It's a fun movie to watch. It teaches children well vs. bad. I don't know how the English subtitle version is or if there is an English one, but the Spanish is the best. Enjoy and happy holidays! Merry Christmas!
