I love Satan Pit !!! David Tennant is such a good actor and so is Billie Piper !!! Who else will Will Thorp be in pieces? He's so cute, isn't he? I hated the pieces where he was occupied by the devil and where he was said to "go to hell", as Rose put it so irreversibly. Remember, he was pretty funny when he said, "Rose, do we have a favor, would you? Shut up!" Mr Jefferson was so brave, wasn't he? To die to save the others. I really felt sorry for Toby (Will Thorp) when he came out of possession for the second time because he was so scared. I was like, "Oh my god if I was Rose, I'd be so scared of him." And when she embraced him, I was like "grrrrrr, he's mine! Hands off!" but I thought it was really sweet. And the doctor .... Well, I thought he was going to tell Ida, "tell Rose I love her," but he didn't. Oh good.
