Petter Mattei's "Love in the Time of Money" is a visually stunning movie to watch. Mattei offers us a lively portrait on human relationships. It is a movie that tells us about money, strength and success for people in the different situations we experience. <br /> <br /> This is a variation on the Arthur Schnitzler's play on the same theme. The director transfers the action to the present day New York where all these different characters meet and connect. Each one is somehow connected, or another to the next person, but no one looks like the previous point of contact. Stylish, the movie has a sophisticated luxury look. We are taken to see how these people live and the world in which they live in their own habitat. <br /> <br /> The only thing one gets from all these souls in the picture is the different stages of loneliness that each one lives. A big city is not exactly the best place where human relationships find true fulfillment, as one distinction is the case with most people we experience. <br /> <br /> The play is good under Matthew's direction. Steve Buscemi, Rosario Dawson, Carol Kane, Michael Imperioli, Adrian Grenier and the rest of the talented role-players alive these characters. <br /> <br /> We wish Mr. Mattei congratulated and waited anxiously for his next work.
