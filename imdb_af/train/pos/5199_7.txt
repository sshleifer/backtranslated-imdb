Not only is it a great African American classical comedy, but one of the great American cult classics. I recently bought the collection edition of Rudy Ray Moore. If you like the old karate movie and black comedies, this is for you! They no longer make movies like this. My whole family is movie buffs, so this site is a great help to solve many debates. I am currently deployed in Iraq. It helps me to stay with the world I know in the states. Thank you IMDb. I recommend this site to all my friends. Dolomite rules! Don't just take my word for it, make sure it's for yourself. Ten lines are much for commenting on one movie I think, but if that is the point, I'm all for it!
