This film seems to be a border - on the one hand, those who love it, on the other hand, those who find it unbearable. <br /> <br /> In the beginning, there are a large number of comedies in this movie that many viewers aren't "getting". Of course, Jet Li's Mask looks like Bruce Lee's Kato - it's supposed to be a joke. The guy who dedicated a time bomb to his heart - shameful? Of course, this is a joke! Some readers will probably ask, if this movie is supposed to be so funny, why all the excessive and greedy violence? Well, for one thing, tolerance for this level of violence is actually different, from culture to culture; And while Hong Kong audiences admit that this violence is extreme, it's definitely just a little more than the average for a HK action movie. <br /> <br /> Also, Black Mask is really the kind of movie that takes a genre's conventions and bumps to extremes simply because the conventions themselves are completely unrealistic. After decades of viewers, people were shot without any obvious open wounds, and many were shocked to see Bonnie and Clyde and the outrageous of the Wild Forest sprayed blood all over the place. But the fact is that when you shoot with a fast metal projectile, it is almost certain that blood will sprout, especially from an artery. <br /> <br /> This movie is a Chinese cartoon movie. It is true that the Spiderman movies never get this gory - but if they were true to reality, it would be! Well, despite its comic-book origin, this film is true to reality. <br /> <br /> The only complaint I have is the flashy, over-styled filming and editing. If the creators of this movie shot it for Hollywood nostalgia (such as The Rocketeer or the recent Sky Captain movie), I doubt anyone who finds it offensive. <br /> <br /> But as it stands, I still have a much loved look at this movie.
