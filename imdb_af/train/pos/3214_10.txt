I fell in love with this silent action drama. Kurt Russell and only Kurt Russell could have played it so well. Todd (Kurt Russell) is thrown on a planet after being obsolete by genetically modified soldiers. <br /> <br /> The stage is set and another classic action movie icon was born - SELLER. Not Rambo, not Schwarzenegger, not Bruce Willis, not Mel Gibson, not Jason Statham. Kurt Russell owns this role and makes it completely his - original, daring and all human. I miss the fact that prosecutions have never been made. <br /> <br /> 10/10 <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> my belief: http://www.angelfire.com / ny5 / jbc33 /
