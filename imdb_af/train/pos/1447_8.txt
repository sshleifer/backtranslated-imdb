I read the negative comments before I watched this movie and got unsatisfied, went ahead and started watching. I admit that I had to rewind quite a few times, as the movie is incredibly complex, involved and full of detail. This is a good thing, but also quite unexpected in this culture of car hunting, explosion, free sex and general violence replacing substitute for plot and character development. In fact, what is a welcome departure, but I am so used to not paying much attention to what I am looking at. <br /> <br /> This movie is full of character development and plot line; the kind we used to analyze when I was in high school. This requires real spiritual participation on the part of the viewer. What a good change. I will compare it to 'All The President's Men' in terms of generic topic. That is, it is a mystery about intense misconduct on the part of elected officials and those with enough influence on officials to actually "own" them. <br /> <br /> Unlike All The President's Men, this film makes an effort to give some of the characters' real personality. In this sense, the film is a character study such as 'The Negotiatior' with Samuel Jackson and Kevin Spacey. In that movie, their characters are both city staff and the plot is extremely intense. Still, the plot depends on the ability of their characters to work together, trust each one and eventually unite with the corrupt police department. There is more gun fire in this movie and the specific plot is different, but generically there are many similarities. <br /> <br /> I would say the city hall requires a lot more concentration. In fact, I hit how parallel it was to the past and current political scandals I saw in my life, returning to Watergate. The thing is, the public knows there's something wrong, sure! but the details are hard to do. This movie is not even as complex as real life, but it is actually realistic for life in its complexity. I think this is one of the reasons why previous posters criticized the film: unrealistic expectations. <br /> <br /> If you see it and know what it's all about, it's really great! I watched it 3 times in a row! The acting is wonderful and directing is flawless. The weakest link is John Cusak's accent.
