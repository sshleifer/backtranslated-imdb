Gray Gardens were staggering and crazy and you just couldn't really look away. It was so strange, and funny and sad and sick and ??????? really no words to describe. The Gray Gardens move is barely over. I found out about this movie that my uncle John's Great Big Bathroom Reader read through the Bathroom Reader's Institute and it was worth buying and renting the rent at the top of my movie queue. This movie is about the most useful eccentric people ever to be filmed. One should look for their favorite Edie outfits, which I'm sure include curtains. As I grow old, I almost want to be like Big Edie, my nose on normal and society.
