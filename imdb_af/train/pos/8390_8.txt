My first Fassbinder was a wonderful experience. Movie and alternative theater (small hall, with awkward seats, the public had to wait while movies were changed). Perfect game. <br /> <br /> There were many clicks used in the movie, but Fassbinder gave them so cleverly that I found them really amusing. Sound was also brilliant (sometimes harder than dialogue). <br /> <br /> Everything was in the right place. And I loved how the post-war era was offered. Really fun! <br /> <br />
