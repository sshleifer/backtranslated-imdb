Don't believe all the negative reviews this movie receives. Yes, it's made cheap. Yes, the gore is laughing. And yes, the acting is sub-par. However, this is a textbook example of an early slasher flick, and if it's your "thing" (she's me!) Then you'll enjoy this one. There are plenty of good aspects for this movie to compensate for the disadvantages. For one, the count of a then unknown Christopher Young is very creepy and perfectly accentuates violence. The end is a welcome break from the predictable exciting ends of most movies. And finally, but not least, is the institution that made the movie for me. The creators of this film could have done a much better job drawing the set to make it more credible than a college dorm. However, if you can think of this mistake, the environment is wonderful. Four are all collegues alone in a large, abandoned, condemned building just waiting to be demolished .... it speaks of possibility. If you look, allow your imagination to do the job and enjoy this movie as much as I did.
