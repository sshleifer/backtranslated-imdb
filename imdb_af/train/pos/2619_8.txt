If the Lion King was a Disney version of Hamlet, then the Lion King 3: Hakuna Matata is a Disney version of Guildenstern and Rosencrantz is Dead. Like Tom Stoppard's deceptive film, we see the action from the point of view of two of the minor characters from the original: Timon, the meerkat with a love of breaking into the song of a hat in song, and Pumbaa, the warthog with flatulence issues. By following their story - rather than Simba's - we see why all the animals bowed, as Simba of Pride Rock was offered. We find out what Timon and Pumbaa decided to return Simba to Pride Rock to drive Scar. And we find out how they handled the hyenas once and for all. Nathan Lane, as Timon gets most of the best jokes, but he is much supported by Ernie Sabella as Pumbaa. It's also good to hear Matthew Broderick and Whoopi Goldberg portraying their roles. Julie Kavner and Jerry Stiller lend their distinctive voices to two new characters: Timon's mother and uncle. The only downside is the constant stop-speed-speed-forward device that doesn't always help to advance the story. In addition, there is a brilliant zoom near the start of the movie. With more laughter than any other third-in-a-Disney movie, Hakuna Matata is worth watching - even if it's just for the hot tub scene that's still funny, though it's a bit predictable is.
