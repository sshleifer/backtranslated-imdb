Did anyone buy this movie? My uncle "Hutch" was a pilot (Real Reel) who saw his wings in the air and then hit his fist because he awarded his pilot's wings. <br /> <br /> He's only a few seconds on the screen, but my family would like the movie. He was killed in Italy in a daughter fight. He was only 24 at the time. Do we know the film studio that made it? <br /> <br /> Has anyone seen it at a video store like Blockbuster? I wish they would make full catalogs of these old movies available because it is so cheap to make DVDs. <br /> <br /> Please email me at nfny40@yahoo.com if you know where to buy a copy. Thank you.
