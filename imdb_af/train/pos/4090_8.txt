This movie is simply incredible! I expected something other than the movie I actually saw expected. However, it is very informative because it shows the aggressive nature of human sexuality and its relation to animal behavior. Let me warn those among readers of this article who are easily offended by content that is too sexual, because the explicit sexual nature of this movie feels like a pornographic type of pornography. It even contains a scene that comes very close to rape. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, I strongly suggest seeing this rare work of "sexual arts". Every minute of the picture, the sexual spirit of the seventies, by the way, breathes. One should not forget how times have changed! <br /> <br /> See it! It's worth your money and time!
