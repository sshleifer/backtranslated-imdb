The surprises nominated this year's Best Animated Feature Race at the Oscars. It's an Irish movie of heart, but it's co-produced by Belgium and Brazil. I guess, animators work in all three countries. The product is one of the most beautiful and unique films in recent memory. The character design is a small reminder of the French animated film Persepolis of a few years back, with many simple characters with thick, black outlines. This film is not black and white. Oh no. What makes this movie great is the use of color, just one of the most outrageous and exciting colors I've ever seen. The general design of the pictures is also much more geometric, with characters that are basically rectangular or oval. Much of the movie can be spent finding the circle. An important aspect of the visual design is a circle in the center of the image. All these geometric designs have a purpose. The story is about a young boy who is an artist working on enlightened manuscripts. (The Book of Kells is a true enlightened Bible; the art of the film is based on the drawings in it). The story of the movie is not very deep, but it is a pretty good fantasy story. Brendan is a young boy in Kells, a city surrounded by huge walls, built by his uncle to hold out the Vikings. A newcomer to Kells, brother Aiden, inspires Brendan to record illustrations. He also inspires him to leave things like Kells and explore the nearby forest, where a nymph lives. Bruno Coulais offers a fantastic score, almost as good as the one he did for Coraline, which I consider the best of the year.
