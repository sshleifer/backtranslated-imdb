But if you like the muppets, I defend you to keep this one. Basically the same plot regurgitated (this time New York, not LA) it contains a lot of fun cameos and muppet hi-jinx. Many of the muppets leave the movie fairly early because it centers around Kermy and Miss Piggy. I enjoyed it a lot. Nice to watch with your kids.
