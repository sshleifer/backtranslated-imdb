We looked at it in my Women's Health Issues class to show how women are treated inferior to men in many societies, and I absolutely loved this movie. I plan to get a copy for myself. The story is very touching and I would recommend it to anyone. I am a fan of different cultures and this movie was just what I needed. This is a movie for the whole family despite its rating. This is a movie I will show to my children. The professor in our class meant that the film was mostly too to be about women, but this movie was more than that. This is one of those movies that will stick out in my mind forever and will be a favorite.
