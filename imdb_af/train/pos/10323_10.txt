It's a very entertaining movie. Some of the reviews I read on this forum were written by people who believe the movie was an attempt at serious drama. This is not the case. It is a very pleasant film that is performed in a tongue on the cheek. Of course, all the actors have fun while we entertain. The battle order is alive, alive and above all not free. The so-called "Green Death", which is used several times, is not, as I read in one review, "horrible". A few judges were very critical of the martial arts battle between Doc and Seas near the end of the film. Hey, light up ... Again I remember one and all that it's a fun movie. Each phase of this "battle" was subtitled, which added to the fun aspect. The actors didn't want to imitate Bruce Lee or Jackie Chan. It is NOT one of the martial arts movies. Ron Ely looks good in this movie and is the perfect choice to play Doc. Another nice touch is the unique way the ultimate fate of the "bad man" (Seas) is treated. I promise you that if you don't want to take this movie very seriously and just look at the entertainment value, you will spend 100 minutes in a pleasant way.
