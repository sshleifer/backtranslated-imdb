This film moves without being sentimental - meaningful without being pretentious. It tells a simple story of a family in danger of falling apart, as the infringement of technology and the advancement of society still make the family industry untenable. <br /> <br /> The acting is great - though none of us in the West will probably have heard from these actors. We had to play their characters with honesty and reverence long ago - they are defective characters, each with great weaknesses, but with such extreme humanity and kindness that it is impossible not to get engaged in the story. <br /> <br /> We need more movies like this - we need more Western movie makers who create movies like this.
