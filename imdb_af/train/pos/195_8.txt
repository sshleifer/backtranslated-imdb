"Show People" is an absolutely delicious silence directed by King Vidor and Marion Davies and Billy Haines. Which jewelery is both of them in this beautiful comedy about a young girl, Peggy Pepper, whose play is the talk of Savannah to make it on the big screen. Although she is a success in comedy, what she wants to do is make 'art' so she goes to High Arts Studio. Soon she will be Patricia Pepoire and it's too good for her friend Billy. <br /> <br /> Many silent-era stars came in "Show People," including Davies without the curly hair and makeup. I'm sure when people saw the movie in 1928, they recognized everyone who appeared in the extended lunch; Unfortunately, this is not the case even for movie buffs. In one part of the film, however, she meets Charlie Chaplin; In another, writer Elinor Glyn was shown on her, and Vidor herself has a cameo at the end of the film. Other stars appearing in "Show People" include John Gilbert, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, Leatrice Joy, Bess Flowers, Renee Adoree, Rod LaRoque, Aileen Pringle, and many others. <br /> <br /> Davies was adorable and a lively comedy. It's a shame that William Haines closes the movies - he was cute and energetic, deservingly a huge star back in the day. <br /> <br /> "Show People" is a simple story that is told in a witty way. It is also a glimpse into an exciting era in Hollywood's history and features performances by two wonderful stars.
