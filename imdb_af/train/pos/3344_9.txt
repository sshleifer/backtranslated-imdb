I went to see a fever peak with my mother, and I can say that we both loved it. It wasn't the typical romantic comedy where someone was hurting and blah blah ... You weren't waiting for the climate's first kiss or for them to finally get together. It was more real because you saw them through the relationship, rather than the whole movie coming over them. People can actually relate to the movie because it doesn't look like extraordinary circumstances or impossible situations. It was really funny, and I think it was Jimmy Fallon's best performance. All in all, I would definitely recommend it!
