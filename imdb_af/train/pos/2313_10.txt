This "Upcoming Age" movie deals with the experiences of two young girls, Dani and Maureen, as they learn about life and the love of a fatal summer. <br /> <br /> Targeted by Robert Mulligan, famous for his beautiful work in "To Kill a Mockingbird," the film never touches a fake note. All the plays are wonderful. As Dani, Reese Witherspoon makes a beautiful movie debut. When I watched this beautifully photographed and wonderfully directed and modified movie, I felt like I was looking at a reality through a window, rather than watching a movie. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie at least 5 times and can honestly say it is one of the best movies ever made to be young, to fall in love and to feel, challenge and change of young adulthood. Families with children between 10 and 15 need to see it together, and use it as a discussion item, as it causes a number of issues about sibling rivalry, how to deal with love, the responsibilities of a parent, and so on.
