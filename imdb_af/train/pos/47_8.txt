It breaks my heart that this movie is not appreciated as it should be. it is much underestimated. people have forgotten what movies really are about. Today they only think of bum bum movies. It can be quite fun with popcorn and friends, such as transformers, oriented movies, with high mega-high budget like 300ml or even higher, on special effects only and what's silly movies without storyline. It's the kind of movie I do despite most. Of course it is fun to see mostly CGIs, but we get nothing from the movie that is needed. <br /> <br /> I honestly think the show was excellent. Especially busy Philipps, along with Erika Christensen and Victor Garber (who I respect) made this movie an Oscar worth. Emotional performance by Busy Philipps was amazing. It's so sad that our Oscar doesn't see her in her hands, which she deserves.
