Castle in the air is undoubtedly a Hayao Miyazaki movie. Having seen it for the first time, I'm happy to say it's not disappointing. On the contrary, you get your time's worth, which means (as far as Miyazaki's films are concerned), it's nothing short of excellent! <br /> <br /> Produced early in his film career, Castle in the Sky expects many of the brands in its later movies, with strong (but young) female characters being forced to grow because of external circumstances, helped by many interesting (and sometimes sweet) supporting characters. And of course, the usual battle of nature against civilization, flying machines (many of them !!), beautiful painted sceneries ?? but unfortunately, no pigs (at least I noticed, I only saw it once). No less, Miyazaki had had his theater debut two years earlier, with Nausic√£a, who was a rehearsal for Princess Mononoke, his magnum opus. Castle in the Sky is a bit of these two, with a soft action packed first 30 minutes, which resembles his TV series Conan, and his directed episodes of Meitantei Holmes. Here we are introduced to Sheeta, a girl who literally falls out of the air, only through Pazu, a young boy living in a small rural village. As she is heard by her memory and suspects a connection between her and the mysterious flying city of Laputa, Pazu is trying to help her find out where she came from, while the army escaped and a gang of airplanes escaped. As the film progresses, the plot becomes heavier and more interesting, and Myiazaki reveals at its best. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is very reminiscent of Spirited Away (or vice versa, as the Castle was first produced in the air) and much like its director, Joe Hisaishi, the composer starts with a very light score, This is more complex and beautifully adjusted as the plot moves forward! <br /> <br /> A note on English dubbing, with a good interpretation of the two main stars, although Anna Paquin's Sheeta has a very strong emphasis (which the actress had at that time in her career ) and a head for Mark Hamil and Muska, make for a gratifying but devilish villain! <br /> <br /> Don't miss this one!
