Aro Tolbukhin burned seven people alive in a mission in Guatemala in the 70's. He also declared that he killed another 16 people (he killed and then burned pregnant women). <br /> <br /> This movie is a documentary that portrays the personality of Aro through various interviews with people who have come to know him and played by plays by actors based on real facts. <br /> <br /> "Aro Tolbukhin" is a serious job, so analytical, it's not at all scary. Such a terrible testimony to how some children's drama can turn a man into a monster. <br /> <br /> * My rate: 7/10
