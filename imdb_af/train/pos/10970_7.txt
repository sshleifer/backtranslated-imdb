Fascinating, but disturbing look at Edith Bouvier Beale (Big Edie) and her daughter (Little Edie) aunt and first cousin after late Jacquelyn Kennedy Onasis. They live in a rodent-contaminated, rounded home that is considered a health hazard by the city. It quickly becomes clear that these two things are outside eccentric. Little Edie seems to be the best, as she has a ten-year-old attitude, though she is 53. The content consists of two things. The first is the talks were Little Edie laments, Big Edie, who drove away all her potential writers and ruined her prospective career as a writer, actress and dancer. These discussions are usually very rhetorical, stupid and often amusing. The second part consists of long bouts of attempted singing by both parties. Of course, everyone thinks that they are singing perfectly and it's just the other that sounds bad. In a wonderful scene, Big Edie, actually physically Little Edie claims with her sugar cane just to get her to stop her warbling. Very fascinating, but the feeling is that they are a serious exploitation here and the subjects just went too far to know it. The filmmakers look like a freak show at the circus, and come up every day to detect (and harass) any bizarre behavior. Ultimately, it's a sad picture, as it shows how the world has simply passed these two. Their hopes and dreams fall away as the house where they live. Despite their fret, they need two more than ever. For without the others there would be no refuge from loneliness. The most wonderful line comes from Big Edie, whose many cats relieve themselves throughout her bedroom. Her reaction to a complaint about the smell is simply incredible.
