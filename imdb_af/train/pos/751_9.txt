It is one of the best Jodie Foster movies out there and is largely ignored because of its public perception of it as a teenage movie. It has wonderful performances, especially a battlefield between Jodie and her mother, played by a convincing Sally Kellerman. The three girls playing Jodie's friends are somewhat amateurish, but I think it's worth seeing.
