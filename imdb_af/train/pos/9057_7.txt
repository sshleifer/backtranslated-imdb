Let's keep it simple: my two children are glued to this movie. It has its flaws from an adult perspective, but buys some jelly worms and just enjoys it. <br /> <br /> And the Pepsi girl was excellent! <br /> <br /> And Kimberly Williams was pretty gosh-darned hot, though she wasn't much in the movie, so don't get excited. . <br /> <br /> It's not really a bad thing, but it's the kind of movie you just see once. Don't buy the DVD. <br /> <br /> Enjoy! <br /> <br /> Did I mention Kimberly Williams? (That was for the fathers.)
