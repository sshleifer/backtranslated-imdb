And this is a very disturbing movie. I might be wrong, but it's the last movie I saw Burt Reynolds as a real actor, who changed the role and delivered a message. <br /> <br /> Jon Voight and Ned Beatty are also excellent. They are modest and unaware; businessmen who want to enjoy the country. Little did they know what would happen next. <br /> <br /> Photography and sets are realistic and natural. It was before Wes Craven's days. <br /> <br /> What is most disturbing about this movie is the fact that such sites still exist. In America, people still deprive people of the city; It's been almost a century and a half since the Civil War. <br /> <br /> You'll enjoy this movie. It is filmed in the rural parts of South Georgia, which still exist. Just don't drive past it to Mobile, Alabama; That area has not been restored since Hurricane Katrina. 10/10.
