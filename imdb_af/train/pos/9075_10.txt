I almost missed the whole season, but when the other shows were going on, I started watching. I finally bought iTunes for the entire first season. It's now one of my favorite comedy shows. Patrick Warburton is the key. His dry sense of humor has kept me going all the time. David Spade is funny, but sometimes Russell drives a long way. I enjoy the other rolled more (but didn't say he didn't add to the show). <br /> <br /> Make yourself a favor. If you haven't checked this one, try it. If you can catch the episode where "Jeff" goes to the sperm bank, you'll see how good this show is. <br /> <br /> I hope this series has a long term.
