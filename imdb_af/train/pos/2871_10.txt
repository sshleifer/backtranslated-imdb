Give an answer? As my comment is needed? We are talking about masterpieces of all time, for all seasons and generations. It's just kind of movies I still have the patience to watch. In this, like in other Disney's movies is a kind of magic. All characters are somehow 'alive' and 'right' so it is easy to understand the message, even if you don't understand language (as I didn't understand when I first looked because I was about six years old. Perhaps my English is not so good, but I have learned what I know most about these movies, and this is another big dimension of this kind of movies, which is scarce at present. But there is a great shame. In my country it's now impossible to see it, or any other Disney movie! We do not have copyright, so our children are unfit to enjoy and learn from these movies. So, we'll see this movie again "Once upon a dream" or ...?
