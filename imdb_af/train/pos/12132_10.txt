Enjoy Leslie Howard's performance. Mr. Howard plays Philip as a flat, uninteresting character. One is supposed to be sorry for this man; However, I find Bette Davis's Mildred. Me. Davis gives one her best performances (she received an Oscar nomination). Thanks to her performance, she brings this nice dull movie to life. ** Make sure you don't miss out on Mildred telling Philip exactly how she feels about him.
