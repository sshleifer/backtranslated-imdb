In addition to Star Wars and The Wizard of Oz, it remains one of the greatest fantasy films ever made. It is a real shame that it is not as well known as the former films (perhaps because it is a story based on legends rather than contemporary or scientific institutions, and that it is British, which means a smaller market for movies ), but it is wonderful to know that it deserves the reputation. <br /> <br /> Like all the big family movies, one can be a child, an adult or even a teenager to enjoy this movie (I'm currently 18), but one should appreciate classic movies first. I absolutely love this movie. It has an extraordinary music score from Miklos Rozsa (perhaps my favorite classic movie score) featuring any John Williams Star Wars score, fast but not flashy, beautiful sets, dialogue and color usage (both sets and cinematography) won Oscars), and the latest Oscar wins special effects (for the time being, and some are still stunning). And, of course, June Duprez's sultry looks like the Princess is competitive from Catherine Zeta-Jones' (she even looks like Jones in a way!). Finally, this is one of my all-time favorite movies (next to "The Adventures of Robin Hood") and it deserves more attention. It's a real adventure of magic throughout, and with Robin Hood, it's my desert island movie that I could see over and over without getting annoyed. <br /> <br /> Stars: **** Excellent)
