VIVAH IS IN MY BOOK THE 2006 BEST FILM! PERIOD !!. In my book, it's one of the best 100 movies ever made in Bollywood. It's sad that this movie doesn't have so many reviews and doesn't have so much popularity. <br /> <br /> Once again, VIVAH is a true achievement of a director who does so again. After HAHK and Maine Pyar Kiya Sooraj once again drew a brilliant VIVAH. <br /> <br /> It's the most simple and cute movies I've seen this year. After seeing Don 2 who was CRAP and later Dhoom 2 who even beat Don, I finally see a movie so close to my heart and culture. <br /> <br /> I don't know why Bollywood is moving away from the beautiful culture we have and making Hollywood remake style crap movies like Dhoom 2 and Don. <br /> <br /> The story is beautiful and closely related to the Indian system of regular marriage that I also want to be a part of. Our system that teaches us to obey elders, follow them, and of course obey them, is so brilliant in this movie! Of course, there is no power in choosing your partner and it should be a brief encounter between the couple and it is up to them to decide as brilliantly shown in this movie. <br /> <br /> Come back to the movie ..... VIVAH is a story of Travel between the beautiful period of engagement and marriage. The phase where the man meets the girl! .... Both understand each other. But try to determine if they can love each other for seven generations (as our system says) and the different ones that occur during marriage. <br /> <br /> Amrita Rao is brilliant in the movie ....... Shahid is OK ..... and Alok Nath and Anupam Kher are awesome !! The songs are BRILLIANT. ! I especially like the HAMARI SHAADI HEAD REH GYE CHAAR and Do Anjaane Ajnabi ...... <br /> Overall, a MUST SEE for anyone who still believes in Indian culture and tradition and I definitely do it! <br /> <br /> Go see this movie ...... I just have to say one word ....... <br /> <br /> BLISS !.
