This video is so hilariously funny, it makes everything different. Eddie Murphy looks very disappointing (even Beverly Hills Cop and The Nutty Professor, who are just going to show how good it really is). To be honest, I don't think I've ever laughed at such a thing, including Naked Gun and the rarely seen Bargearse. This show is great, although it has to be said that it is certainly filled with the word starting with F, it is four letters long (plus the extended version starting with M), but it didn't bother me. See it, the funniest thing I've ever seen and probably the funniest thing you have.
