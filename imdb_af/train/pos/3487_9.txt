Wrestlemania 14 is not often regarded as one of the great Wrestlemania's, but I will personally put it in my top 5, if not the top 3. It has so many great things, and it has the birth of The Attitude Era, which was WWE 's best era, in my opinion. HBK has the heart of a lion, and he has Austin as he did, on his way out, pure class from his side. It has one of the hottest crowds you'll ever see, and it has J.R and The King at their best announcement! <br /> <br /> Matches. <br /> <br /> 15? team battle royal LOUD doll for L.O.D's return. I'm not a fan of the royal's fight, and that's another average one. Very predictable, even when you first see it, it is obvious L.O.D will win. Look at Sunny for 8 or so minutes, but definitely help. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> WWF Light Heavyweight Championship <br /> <br /> Take Michinoku | C | Vs Aguila. <br /> <br /> Taka gets a surprising doll, with its entrance. Fast, high-flying, and very exciting. If these two had more time, they would surely have torn the roof with their stuff. Taka wins with the Michinoku driver. <br /> <br /> 3 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> WWF European Championship. <br /> <br /> Triple H | C | Vs Owen Heart Stipulation here, Chyna is bound to Slaughter. Nice pop for Owen, mixed reaction for travel. A real, really underrated game, which actually falls under one of my favorites for Wrestlemania. The two mixed very well, and Owen could go with someone. Journey wins, with Chyna interference. <br /> <br /> 4/5 <br /> <br /> Mixed Tag game. Marc Mero & Sable vs Goldust & Luna. Definition of doll for Sable, unheard of at that time, for woman. Sabel actually looks hot, and the crowd just eats her up! Constant Sable chicks, and they almost burst every time they come into the ring. Not bad for a Mixed-tag game, it has entertaining entertainment, and has passed the time well. Sable's team wins when Sable hits the TKO. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> WWF Intercontinental Championship. Ken Shamrock Vs The Rock | C |. Before reviewing the game, I would like to note that The Rock showed its great potential, with his interview with Jennifer Flowers, before his match. Beautiful doll for Shamrock, great time heat for The Rock. Too disappointingly brief, and I thought the end was a bit stupid, though Shamrock's budding fiancee was wonderful to see, and the crowd touched it. Rock holds the title when The Ref reverses the decision. <br /> <br /> 2/5 <br /> <br /> Dumpster game for the WWF Tag Team Championship <br /> <br /> Catcus Jack & Terry Funk vs The New Age Outlaws. The Outlaws are not that far, as they are now. Crowds are actually a bit dead for this, but I thought it had some good hardcore bits, with a few sick lookouts. Cactus and Terry eventually win the titles. <br /> <br /> 3/5 <br /> <br /> The Undertaker vs Kane. Big time ovation, for The Undertaker. Much better than that at Wrestlemania 20, and for a big man against big game, it was really good. It was a huge outward noise, with The Undertaker looking through the table with a sick bump. WWE was smart, making Kane strong, even by defeat. After two tombstones, Taker finally puts him away, with a third one. <br /> <br /> 3 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> WWF Championship. <br /> <br /> Special Guest Enforcer "Mike Tyson" <br /> <br /> HBK | C | Vs Steve Austin. Great heat for Tyson. Crowd is going to ape sh * t for Austin, definitely one of the biggest pops I've heard. Mixed reaction, for HBK. It's really a special game, one of the greatest wrestlemania events in history, you can see when J.R is even out of breath. HBK gave it its all, in what had to be its last game, and Austin was rarely better. The hostility and electricity of the crowd is wonderful, and it's as exciting as it gets. Austin wins with the stunner, with Tyson knocking at Michaels at 3:16. Austin's festive victory is a wonder to see, with one of the most beautiful crowds you'll ever see, King said it right, they had nuts. <br /> <br /> 5/5 <br /> <br /> Bottom line. Wrestlemania 14 is one of the biggest for the rights. It has everything you want in a Wrestlemania, and really starts the Attitude Era. It's very special to me because it was the 1st Wrestlemania I've ever seen back in 98. "The Austin Era has started!" <br /> <br /> 9 1/2 / 10
