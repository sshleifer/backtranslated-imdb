I can understand why some people like this movie, and why some people don't. For me, though, it's really that way, even though I've noticed some good pieces, and not so impressive pieces. The animation was really great, like Charlie's dream. The characters were a mixed bag, the best being Anne-Marie, pronounced by the late Judith Barsi. (I was physically sick when I read what happened to her). Carface is also a very convincing villain, especially pronounced by the wonderful Vic Tayback (I especially loved "Morons I am surrounded by Morons") and along with Rasputin and Warren T.Rat are probably the most memorable of all the Don Bluth villains . Charlie and Itchy just had the same sparkle, but I loved King Gator and his song. Some of the film is very haunting, like Annabelle's "You can never come come back", which kind of scare me still. Unfortunately, there was little I didn't have that much. The story had a tendency to become clumsy and unfocused, but Disney's Black Cauldron had the same problem. There were also some dark scenes, which would make young children disturbing, but the end is very gripping. But the biggest mistake was the rather mere songs and the way they were sung. None of them particularly stand out, with the exception of "Let's Make Music Together" and "Love Survives", and Burt Reynolds can't sing and Dom DeLuise has done much better. All in all, a viewable movie, it could have been more, but it's definitely memorable, and I'll definitely see it again. 10/07. Bethany Cox
