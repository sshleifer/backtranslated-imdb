Three flashbacks announce the main characters (Abu, Jaffar, and Princess) who will respond to Ahmad; three are the songs, each linked to the same characters. Three times, Ahmad speaks the absolute word 'Time' in his statement of love to the Princess, and answers her three questions during their first of three meetings. So strong is the impression he has made that the Princess will resist the three attempts of Jaffar to conquer her - by erasing three consecutive ploys: deceiving, hypnosis and memory. Yet Jaffar possesses what he describes as the three inevitable instruments of domination over a woman: the whip, the power, and the sword. Three are the number of flying entities: the mechanical horse, the genius, and the genius and the magical carpet. The Genie offers three wishes to Abu at their first three meetings; Three times the Genie laughed hard in the mountain gorges, and three were his human deficiencies before leaving. Abu dominates three obstacles in the Temple of Dawn (armed guards, giant spider and giant octopus). Three are the instruments of justice: the magical eye that shows Abu the future, the magical carpet that transports him in time to save Ahmad and the Princess, and the bow and arrow to run Jaffar. There is magic in the number three, and there is magic in this movie.
