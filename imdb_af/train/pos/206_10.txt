I'm 14, so you'll probably think I've never heard of George Burns or Walter Matthau or anyone else. Son you're wrong. I heard that George Burns was in this movie and that he won an Oscar. I was a fan of George Burns since I was ten. I recently saw and loved the movie Oh, God. This one was also fantastic. George Burns did a good job. So Walter Matthau (it's the first time I've ever seen him). And although they had really little roles, Phyllis Diller and Steve Allen did a good job. The specials they would have filmed were great if they were really done. Let me say this, if you're a fan of George Burns or Walter Matthau, you should see this movie right away!
