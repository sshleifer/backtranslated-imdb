This is a better adaptation of the book than the one with Paltrow (although I also liked it). It's not so much that Beckinsale is better - they're both great - but the script is better. Davies is a master to customize Austen for filming, and the production values ​​here are very good. It's not quite as bright as the Hollywood treatment, but it's close, and I thought the places and the costumes actually worked better.
