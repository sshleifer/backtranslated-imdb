E! TV is a good channel and Talk Sop is so funny, in a flash you can change the episodes. We want more funny writings by the best writer ever Stan Evans. The patron saint of the senseless masses ... He is a talented, talented writer, actor, comic, producer, director and creative consultant. Anne Nicole loved him, but he was not a billionaire billions, leaving him for a billionaire. Many superstars wanted to make films with actor Stan Evans, who has a "Humphrey Bogart" (Clark Gable) acting style. He has to make much more movies. Maybe with Stephen Spielberg, or maybe many other talented producers. We wish him a moment of FAME with a big fortune to win. Did he produce any mock-u dramas? or maybe a docudrama ??? A project about Bernie Madhoff will be a great TV movie written by STAN EVANS. How many screens did he write ?? Is he under $$$$$$$$$$$$ trillion contract with Disney? He needs to earn more than $ 50m ... He can also write a TV movie about the late KING VAN POP. Michael Jackson. We want to see much more of Stan Evans in the movies and on TV. Thank you very much. Elvis left the building !!!!!
