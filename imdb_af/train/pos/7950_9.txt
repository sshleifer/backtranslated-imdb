First, I loved Bruce Broughton's music party, very lyrical, and added it to the movie's charm alone. The best thing about the movie was the three animals, superlatively pronounced by Michael J.Fox, Sally Field and the late Don Ameche. While Fox has the funniest lines, Ameche plays a rather vibrant, otherwise engaging character (the voice of reason), and Veld adds white to a character that is always seen. The people were not so tempting, and sometimes the movie dragged, but that's my only complaint. It's a beautiful movie, with beautiful close-up shots from Canada, I believe. Although the film itself is rather long, there is never a very dull moment, and it is favored by the voice work and a well-written writing. All in all, a beautiful and perhaps underrated movie, with a 9/10 of mine. Bethany Cox.
