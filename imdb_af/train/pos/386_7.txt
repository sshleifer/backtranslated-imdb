Tsui Hark's visual art is in this movie. Unfortunately, the terrible actions of Ekin Cheng and especially Cecilia Cheung (I felt the urge to strangle her while it was being watched, it is so bad :) have made it difficult to watch sometimes. <br /> <br /> This movie is a real breakthrough in the visual section. When I first saw it, my jaw repeatedly dropped and I thought to myself that I had never seen anything like it, but that is how it should be done to do full justice to the mystical world of Chinese historical kung-fu novels! Without a doubt, it is one of the best Chinese historical kung-fu epics ever made. <br /> <br /> But unfortunately, Tsui Hark didn't improve much in the writing department and the story and dialogue were rather youthful (his apparent obsession with the stupid and exaggerated depiction of the evil guys also didn't help). To make it even worse, this movie is very badly thrown. They decided to use the "hot" popular Hong Kong idols as main characters, but unfortunately both Ekin Cheng and especially Cecilia Cheung are totally unsuitable for historical kung-fu dramas because they do not have the nobility and mysticism that characters are supposed to embody. Adam Cheng Siu-Chow and Brigitte Lin in the 1983 version are infinitely better. <br /> <br /> One day I wish Zhang Yi-Mou and Tsui Hark could work together and produce a movie that has Tsui's visual art, but with the maturity and narrative poetry of Zhang ...
