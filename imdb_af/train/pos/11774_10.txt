Is it a good idea to use live animals to display window shops? <br /> <br /> No, and here's why .... <br /> <br /> In the "Hare Conditioned" the sales that Bugs have been promoted to help are over and the store manager (Nelson) carries him to a new department: taxidermy. Of course, Bugs start objects and fun. <br /> <br /> Use almost every store in the store (children's wear, sports, shoes, costumes, women's nightwear - don't ask.), Bugs come on top of every turn, even referring to the driver as "The Great GilderSeeze". Even when caught in the gates of an elevator, Bugs make the most of the situation. <br /> <br /> Director Jones is on top of his picture game as always, such as Blanc (as Bugs, natch) and Nelson (The manager - who sounds like the radio star Gildersleeves - ask your grandparents.) <br /> And a word of advice: when faced with a fuzzy-looking woman trying to go on bathing suits, always look at her ears. <br /> <br /> Ten Hare Conditioner stars, the best argument still for animal labor laws.
