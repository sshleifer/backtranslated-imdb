It may be difficult for some people to enter Hollywood production styles. The directing is uninspired, apparently just a filming of the stage setup, and the sound quality is bad here and there (the rust of people's clothes sometimes comes with their voices, etc.). My <br /> <br /> <br /> My friends and I started watching without knowing what to expect, and the first scene has almost delayed us. It was very dumb and cheesy. Then we picked up the tone of the content and we really started to enjoy ourselves. <br /> <br /> It is very funny, despite some wheat. Definitely give it a chance if you appreciate a good dialogue. Also, Helena Bonham Carter is of course treasure-rich.
