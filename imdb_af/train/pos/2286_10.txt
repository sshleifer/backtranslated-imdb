The people who made this masterful film have done a good job on a novel that may be the best fiction work focusing on human debt and human responsibility ever published. Nolte takes the role of Howard W. Campbell, Jr. And makes it his own, remains true to Vonnegut's depiction of a man who has lost ALL (through) Love. <br /> <br /> No weaknesses in this fine adjustment.
