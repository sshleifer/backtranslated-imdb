I love this movie. My only disappointment was that some of the original songs had changed. <br /> <br /> It is true that Frank Sinatra doesn't get the chance to sing so much in this movie, but it's also nice that it's not just another Frank Sinatra movie. where it usually does him the singing. <br /> <br /> I actually thought it was better to use Marlon Brando's own voice because he has the voice that suits and I couldn't see anyone with this big voice that the gangster didn't feel his voice. <br /> <br /> Stubby Kaye's "Sit, You're Rockin 'The Boat" is a foot-tappin', sing-a-long I just love. He is a hard act to follow with his version and I still like his best. <br /> <br /> Vivian Blaine is just great in this part and "Adelaide's Lament" is my favorite of her songs. <br /> <br /> I really thought Jean Simmons was perfect for this part. Perhaps I would not even have considered her, but after seeing her in that part, it made sense. <br /> <br /> Michael Kidd's choreography is timeless. If that happens again in the year 2008, I won't change anything. <br /> <br /> Many times, something from the stage version to the movie version is lost, but it kept the feel of the stage. , even if it was on film. <br /> <br /> I thought the movie was well thrown. I have in local versions of this and this is one of my favorites of that time.
