I finally had my wish to see this one in a theater. I watched Fritz Lang's film on video a few years ago. I was hoping that ideal screen conditions will work their magic. <br /> <br /> Conditions were ideal at Cinematheque Ontario. Pristine full-length print. Intertitles in the original Gothic manuscript German with simultaneous English translation, accurate without being literal. Live piano accompaniment. Ideal. <br /> <br /> The movie's magic has been for a while, but eventually it didn't catch me at least. <br /> <br /> This movie has no real connection with Wagner's Ring cycle as I already knew, but some may not. Wagner adapted the 13th c. Non-voluntary song for its own purposes. Part I of Fritz Lang's epic - Siegfried - has many that will be known to Wagner's listeners. <br /> <br /> "Kriemhild's Revenge" is the story of Siegfried's wife, Kriemhild, her marriage to King Etzel (Attila) the Hun, and her desire for revenge against Hagen and Gunther, the Christian Nibelungs, for the murder. on Siegfried. The spectacular confusion in this film presumably developed and expanded in the Wagnerian mythos in his Götterdämmerung, his Twilight of the Gods and the end of Valhalla. This film remains all over the earth. <br /> <br /> Most of the movie is spectacular. The massive gather that of "Cabiria" (1914), which inspired Griffith's "Intolerance" (1916). Their decoration sets a new benchmark in barbaric beauty. There is a large company of scars, mangy Huns and Art Deco Burgundians. And fighting. Battles that never seem to end. <br /> <br /> Kriemhild is very successful in her revenge plan. She manages to destroy everything around her. Her allegiance to her martyr Siegfried does not seem to stop much from love or devotion, but from something closer to psychosis. Lady Macbeth cried out, "Discover me here." She knew she was emotionally unprepared for what she needed to do. But Kriemhild does not show normal human emotions, and certainly nothing matches the female principle. She is already "full of guilty cruelty", to borrow Shakespeare's phrase from the beginning. Margaret Schön and her director give it a glamor. I don't want to exaggerate, but that sparkle is almost the only expression ever Kriemhild's face has to "animate". This is the best in one-note performances. However, this is clearly intentional, not just a case of bad acting. <br /> <br /> What we then offer is a one-dimensional sketch of a rage of anger. Some may see Kriemhild as an empowered heroine. I only see the movie as misogynistic.
