I can't decide if it's one of my favorite movies. It is a good thriller and has an emotional core, but I still can't decide. I definitely liked it. This is Terry Gilliam's first movie I've seen. My first impression? I was busy to the end and it is not so complex (to be confusing). <br /> <br /> The movie is set in the future. A Man James Cole (Bruce Willis) is being sent the future to get past information (1996 to be specific). A virus killed 5 billion people. He is sent from the future to get information about it. Also here is a psychiatrist named Kathryn Railly. The love story is beautifully portrayed and you can really feel the longing in this love and long for a regular life. The loose points are tied to the end in a very interesting way. <br /> <br /> One thing I like about this movie is that, unlike other post-apocalyptic movies, they did not prefer any boring social commentary and instead focused on this one and his longing for a regular life. "You want to see the sea, be with her" is especially a striking line in this movie. It chooses to focus on tension and confusion in the person's mind. Therefore, it is not exactly post-apocalyptic movie, but it can be described as a romantic science film with themes ranging from time to faded realities and so on. This is what makes this movie a special movie of the 1990s. The complex plot runs smoothly without adding too many characters. <br /> <br /> The performances are pretty good. Bruce Willis surprised me here, as he did not do the regular difficult man here, but he gave a good performance of a confused man in love. His despair in certain empires is beautifully portrayed. I have to watch his other movies. The beautiful Madeleine Stowe is quite a surprise to watch. Ever since I saw this movie, I became so obsessed with her. She gave a great performance of a woman who sympathized with her patient and eventually fell in love with him. Brad Pitt is the real surprise with his portrayal of a crazy man named Jeffrey Goines. His Oscar nominated performance is pretty surprising, as he doesn't have many critics who have good words for him. <br /> <br /> The end is very cold and it's another reason to watch the movie. The length or complexity is not that big a problem, because this movie is moving pretty fast and there are enough incidents to get people interested. And every incident in this movie has a meaning and nothing is unnecessary. <br /> <br /> Good thriller 10/10
