Gone to see this as my lady and I had little else to do on a Sunday afternoon, I like movies that are thin, looser characters, and that's full of em. After a slow start we get some good turns from the cast, but it's the actual 'Bellini' that both make and drop the movie. The 'Bellini' is one of the funniest scenes I've seen in a movie long ago, but is too short and could have made it a masterpiece in general. 71/2 out of 10
