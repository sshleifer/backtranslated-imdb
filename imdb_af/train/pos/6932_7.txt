WINCHESTER 73 is the story of a man (Jimmy Stewart) recovering his prized possession, a recurring rifle made by Winchester. The gun is holding hands, and Stewart immediately holds it in. Anthony Mann's 1950's B&W effort is more a crime movie than a traditional western, and the cowboys often look more like contemporary gangsters than old-fashioned cowboys. Shelley Winters plays a woman of dubious virtues on her way to a farm with a man (Charles Drake) who may marry her. She eventually falls to Stewart, but not before she has passed a little. Winters is the most complex character in a movie filled with unusual characters. Look for a young Dan Dureyea as a neutral killer and Tony Curtis in a very small role. A difficult miscarriage Will Geer plays Wyatt Earp.
