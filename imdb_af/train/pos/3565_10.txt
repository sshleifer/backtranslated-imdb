Guys and Dolls is a unique play based on the characters. Sky Masterson <br /> <br /> (Marlon Brando) is a high-class gambler who takes a bet with Nathan Detroit (Frank Sinatra) for a thousand dollars. Nathan needs the money so he can <br /> <br /> run his usual crap game and make a fortune. The bet was that Sky could not only take a girl to Havana, Cuba and the doll he chose was Sarah. <br /> <br /> Brown (Jean Simmons) was in charge of a missionary. Sky bribes <br /> <br /> Sarah is enough to go with him to Havana. They eventually fell in love with each other, but later they accused him of something he didn't participate in. Nathan left the boyfriend in the missionary that evening. Nathan's 14-year-old Adelaide (Vivian Blaine) rejects Nathan's gambling and tries to stop him from doing so. But when the movie ends, everything ends with a double <br /> <br /> wedding. <br /> <br /> The songs in this movie are just wonderful, no matter who sings it. Marlon <br /> <br /> Brando didn't have a singing voice and where could they have called him, but it didn't really matter. He did a wonderful acting job (obviously he sees Brando) and plays his character very well. I saw some movies with Jean Simmons and thought this movie was her worst, she couldn't sing too <br /> <br />. However, the song was made by Frank Sinatra, Vivien Blaine and Stubby Kaye. Vivien Blaine and Stubby Kaye were also in the original <br /> <br /> Broadway production of Guys and Dolls. Vivien Blaine had a tremendous voice and was the perfect Adelaide. If you like music, and even if you don't, I suggest you see it.
