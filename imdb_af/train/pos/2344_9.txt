I am one of those people who usually watch programs and keep my feelings about a show private. However, Pushing Daisies is my exception. I was curious about the program of advertising broadcast, which gave an overview of the prospect of the show. I was first skeptical about it, especially after the final of Six Feet Under was in my head. Here we go again, I thought. I watched the first, second, third and all other episodes. Wow! First, I thought it was the subject of death and presented in a way that was tasteless without being morbid. The characters were alluring and I like the thought that Ned's main character could not touch the love of his life, Chuck, without the consequences of her death. <br /> <br /> Most characters have a longing for things they can't have. Besides Ned and Chuck, Olive na Ned longs. Lily and Vivian long for their cousin Chuck and Emerson always long for the monetary rewards of the mysterious deaths they solve. I think the characters are perfect and credible. I love how Emerson is black playing the rest of the characters as an African American; I like the subtle cultural humor that sometimes comes from him. <br /> <br /> All in all, this visual fairy tale is one of the most valuable entertainment venues I've seen in the 2007 season. I think the show has enough romance for the romantics and enough that-done-for the mysterious buffs. I just wish the writers would work again so the show could continue to evolve.
