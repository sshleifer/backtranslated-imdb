Todd Rohal is a crazy genius. "Knuckleface Jones", his third and most well-known short film has a horrible sense of humor and will make their head scratch. What the movie is about and he would almost certainly disagree with me about this is how a regular Joe finds the confidence to come through life with a little inspiration. Or not. You just have to see for yourself. The short is made continuously on the fair, so keep your eyes peeled and catch it if you can. You'll be glad you did. It's hilarious. And look at Todd's other short films that also pop up from time to time: "Single Spaced" and "Slug 660".
