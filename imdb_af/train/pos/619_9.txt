I expected this movie to be decent and possibly clich√©, but I was totally wrong! Charlie Cox (I never heard of him) played an incredibly good front man; He was so serious and romantic, my friend and I saw the movie with me, completely in love with him. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes, which I previously liked (Love her in Romeo and Juliet) I enjoy her even more. Her acting was fantastic, I couldn't even tell she was American. The chemistry between her and Charlie Cox was extremely good, the casting was quite perfect. <br /> <br /> Robert DeNiro and Michelle Pfeiffer were equally well thrown; DeNiro as that gay pirate ... invaluable, valuable. I laughed so hard at that one scene where Septimus came on the ship ... oh my God, wow. Pfeiffer played a decent villain, I liked her like the grumpy mother in Hairspray. But she had the right amount of melodrama and cut comments throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> Overall, it was funny (but not at all!), romantic, the special effects weren't quite regular, but when they were, they were wonderful; The cameos of Ricky Gervais and Peter O'Toole were also well placed. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone who likes fantasy movies like the Princess Bride or even Lord of the Rings. It kept my interest all the time and I will buy the DVD when it comes out!
