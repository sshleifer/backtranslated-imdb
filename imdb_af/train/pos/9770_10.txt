This movie is excellent and I would recommend offering it to anyone whose local video store owns it. Or, better still, you can buy it because chances are you will look it over and over again. I remember watching this movie as a kid and it was wonderful. But after watching it again yesterday, I found it amazing. <br /> <br /> A good combination of comedy (though not as big as "Mr. Magoo" not one of my favorites) and action. It deserves 10/10 and I hope they will soon make a successor (fingers crossed). If you are babysitting or looking at young children for anything then I would recommend renting this movie as it will be entertained for hours :).
