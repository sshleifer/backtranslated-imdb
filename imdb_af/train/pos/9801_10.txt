The original animated Dark Knight comes back in this ace adventure movie that opposes Mask or Phantasm in its coolness. There is a lot of style and intelligence in Mystery of the Batwoman, so much more than Batman Forever or Batman and Robin. <br /> <br /> There is a new crime fighter on the streets of Gotham. She dressed like a bat, but she's not a big Batgirl. And Batman denies any affiliation with her. Meanwhile, Bruce Wayne has to handle the usual romance and detective work. But the Penguin, Bain and the local mob make things a little more complicated. <br /> <br /> I didn't have a lot of hope for this, because I was dropped, but the bad Batman: Sub Zero (Robin's not so much here!) But I was delighted with the imaginative and exciting pieces, the clever plot and a fiery sense of humor. It's definitely a movie. No fan of Batman should be without. Keep your ears open for a very catchy song called 'Betcha Neva', which is prominently displayed by-out. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that the DVD is not that good. Don't get me wrong. There are some great features (the short 'Chase Me' is wonderful) and a very cool Dolby 5.1 soundtrack, but ... the movie is presented in Pan and Scan. Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman is drawn and shot in 1.85: 1, but this DVD is presented in 1.33: 1 and compared to the widescreen clips shown on the features, the photo is cut off on both sides. I find this extremely annoying consideration Mask of Phantasm is presented in anamorphic widescreen. Warner literally had to recharge dozens of movies on DVD, because people complained about the lack of original aspect ratio available on some titles. Why they chose to make the same mistake here again is beyond me. <br /> <br /> I'll give this DVD 5/5, but the lack of OAR brings the overall score to 4/5. This is a pity because widescreen could complete a good DVD package.
