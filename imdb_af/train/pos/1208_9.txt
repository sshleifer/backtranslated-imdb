Every child has that movie he enters into VHS when he has nothing to do or when there is a babysitter. That was the movie for me. <br /> <br /> I can tell you the whole plot exactly, I've seen it for 100 times, and I can say it's a good kid / family movie. <Br /> <br /> I still have the band, I didn't watch it in 5 years, but maybe I'll be around this week and be a kid for the day. <br /> <br /> Just carry the care and love their messege. <br /> <br />
