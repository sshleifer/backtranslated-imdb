What a fun movie St Ives is. It reminds me of the type of film made in the 40's. Classic story, rounded by characters and a plot that is not dramatic or overly complex. In fact, it's not over. Robert Lewis Stevenson's story - adapted to the screen - reads like Jane Austen for men. We get a story that has a romance in his heart, but there are also lots of fun: fighting scenes, prison escapes, wrong identities, sword games, and the funniest line I've heard in years: "Only in Scotland Guests with a masked ball are particularly renowned. "There is a lot of hilarity, hardship, and not a bit sad, because St Ives is trying to fight and get back to a family and life he barely knew has. <br /> <br /> The throwing is absolutely starring with too seldom seen Jean Marc Barr absolutely perfect in the title role. Anna Friel is a refreshing delight, as the inventive Flora and Miranda Richardson almost go away with the movie as her wise and worldly, there and all-seeing Susan see. Richard Grant offers comic lighting of the highest order. <br /> <br /> It's not going to be the best movie anyone ever saw, but his charm is unmistakable and the whole movie scarcely comes with an energy bursting with life.
