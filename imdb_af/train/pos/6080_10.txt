Othello, the classic Shakespeare story of love, betrayal, lies and tragedy. I remember studying this story at high school. Actually, I found that Othello was probably my favorite Shakespeare story because of how fascinating it was, the fact that Shakespeare caught the feeling of friendship, love and racism perfectly. I mean, if you are really studying this story, you can do so many philosophies as to why Othello went into jealousy with an eye. But later on for my report I also looked at this version of Othello and I have to say that it was absolutely brilliant. Lawerance and Kenneth fit the story so well and understand it dark. Othello is the great time soldier in his city, he is loved by all, including the king. But when the king finds out that Othello comes down with his daughter, Desdemona, the king is rid of it but deprives it. Othello is welcome in the city and makes his best friend, Cassio, his syman instead of Iago, who stood at Othello. Because of his insane jealousy, he is out of revenge. He still pretends to be Othello's best friend, but he only told Othello that Desdemona was cheating on Cassio, never saying they were, but only made Othello think this was happening. Othello is foolish and does not have pleasant plans for Desdemona or Cassio, and Iago is more than happy to help him. <br /> <br /> Othello is an amazing story, I recommend reading it. This is an amazing story that reminds you after you read it. Othello the movie is good too and I recommend it again, it caught the story perfectly and has a great tearjerker type feel, or you can just be quite shocked about what happens between Othello and Desdemona, how fast he believes she is true love will betray him. It's a great movie, good acting, good sets and good direction. That's what Shakespeare meant when he wrote the story. <br /> <br /> 10/10
