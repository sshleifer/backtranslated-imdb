I often wonder why this series was beaten so much. I thought it was brilliant and also very cleverly written and executed. I think it will come in time in the light it deserves, that is if they ever issue it. Many young and upcoming comedy actors have appeared and everyone has gone on bigger things. Perhaps this fact will make people aware of its value and it will have to be issued. Sally Phillips, Simon Pegg, Peter Serafinowicz and not least Julian Rhind-Tutt of the highly successful Green Wing. Authors Graham Linehan and Arthur Matthews are two of the most beautiful comedy writers of the modern era. Anyone who can produce comedy like Ted Ted cannot write something that is not worthy of the publication. If ever it was issued, I would definitely buy it.
