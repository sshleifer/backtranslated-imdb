One thing is for sure ... you shouldn't see this movie if you have a bad day. The story is based on a sad event and follows a character who has to live with a sin he cannot handle. The story is given to you, rather than the usual dumbed-down explanation, so it's wondering what's going on. Eventually, the dots are connected and the performances make sense. All the characters were OK and Wil Smith did another good day at the office. <br /> <br /> There are undoubtedly many moral questions to be asked, but if you just accept and buy in his pain, then it's easier. to accept what he chose to do. Whether you agree or disagree is irrelevant. The trip you turn on is interesting enough, if not overwhelming. <br /> <br /> A good enough movie that sadly leaves you a little sad. I would recommend this movie if you look at the kind you are thinking of and not just explosions and battles.
