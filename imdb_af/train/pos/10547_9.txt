I watched the trailer on the DVD after watching the movie, and I think everyone who saw it before watching the movie would be very surprised and possibly disappointed. It made much of the fact that the film was "by Cube director" and it looks like a horror movie, if it is actually an Absurd comedy (IMDB's spell checker doesn't look like Absurdist is a word, but that is, reminiscent of Rosencrantz and Guildernstern, is dead. <br /> <br /> I love the way the story first builds up and then gradually escalates. I also enjoy the fact that no explanation is given for what happens in the movie. This and the fact that the story plays mostly in just one set is the only way in which this film is similar to Cube. I recommend it.
