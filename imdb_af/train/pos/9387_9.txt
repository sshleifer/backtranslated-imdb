As others commented, I checked it out after Siskel and Ebert listed it as one of their top 10 films of the year. What a gift. I went out to buy it, just so I could lend it. <br /> <br /> Best Quote? Dwight Yoakum stops his truck when he realizes that someone (Cage) is on top of his taxi. When Cage looks down, he apologizes. "I'm sorry if I scared you." Yoakum puts his pistol in Kage's face with "Is It Like I'm Afraid?" Great sense of humor after an exciting (and temporary) escape. <br /> <br /> There was really a pleasure for this. The continuous observation of the "Welcome to Red Rock" sign makes a groan and a smiling headshot. The music has created a hunting, ominous quality for the movie "Twin Peaks". However, unlike Twin Peaks, it doesn't spoil things by going too far abroad, and it has to be "top notch" itself. <br /> <br /> I admit I watch the credits 15-20 times. You see, they had Yoakum's "Thousands of Nowhere" (perfectly chosen) to play as a freight train bent around the desert floor. . With snow-capped mountains in the distance. It was an incredible, fluid framework. Furthermore, I have never seen a better unification of sight and sound on film. Also, it totally fits the story.
