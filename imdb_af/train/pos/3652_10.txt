I watched this TV movie on a Sunday afternoon and thought it was just another dumb plane crash. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> "Pandora's Clock" is an intelligent political excitement beyond the quality of most TV movies. It could just as easily have made its debut on the big screen. <br /> <br /> The film is excellent, including veteran actors Richard Dean Anderson, Edward Herrmann, Robert Guillaume and Robert Loggia. Daphne Zuniga turns in one of her best performances as a medical specialist working for the CIA, and Frasier's Jane Leeves is also very good. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is well written and the story is constantly compelling. In fact, the last hour is so full of plots and tensions that you can't leave your seat for a second. If you get a chance to see this movie, invest the time - almost four hours. You will be richly rewarded!
