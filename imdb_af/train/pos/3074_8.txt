I recently caught up with this jewel of a movie on the cable. It surprised me, although I expected it from the team involved in this movie. <br /> <br /> Henry Bromwell directed this movie with a certain hand, and it shows. One always wonders about the secret life of hits. One does not have to go too far to realize that they are probably your own neighbors, or social acquaintances or even friends; they are no different from us, at least on the surface. <br /> <br /> In this story, the grandfather is a despicable character who does not hesitate to eliminate someone for the right price. He has no rubbish to teach the ropes to his own son and even the grandson! <br /> <br /> Alex, a man living in turmoil. He knows what he has done in the past and suddenly comes behind the consequences of his actions. He must see someone to help him find peace with himself. If he goes to Dr Parks, he tries to find absolute, though he doesn't find it there. On the contrary, there is a dramatic strife when Alex learns about who should kill the next. <br /> <br /> Alex, brilliantly portrayed by William H. Macy, makes us gossip. Not only is he a fantastic actor, but he makes us believe he is that man. One of the best things in the movie is the late John Ritter. He is as convincing as dr. Parks, the man who unraveled the mystery. <br /> <br /> Donald Sutherland, if the grandfather is perfect. He is a natural actor in everything he does. Neve Campbell surprised in her key role of Sarah. She shows an incredible ability and scope. Tracey Ullman is Martha, the suffering woman, and she doesn't get much. Also Barbara Bain, in a rare appearance, is the grandmother of hell. David Dorfman is a pleasure in the movie. He shows a maturity beyond his years. <br /> <br />
