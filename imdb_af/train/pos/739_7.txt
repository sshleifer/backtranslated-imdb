I was a Jodie Foster fan since we were both kids, from her Disney years. <br /> <br /> "Foxes" was such a big deviation from it all. <br /> <br /> Where other young female actors from that era changed to sexual gender. Pudding disguised as comedy ("Little Darlings", someone?), Jodie dragged for a depressing and tragic story of teenagers to their downfall through the powerful speech of temptation and addiction. <br /> <br /> It wasn't Disney. It wasn't Porky's. It wasn't "Halloweed". It was a dark and powerful story of the destruction of young lives. Unfortunately, this is a story that is played all over the country on a daily basis. This movie can be repeated (with a current soundtrack) and still quite relevant. <br /> <br /> It's not the best movie ever made, it's tired on some parts, not all the shows are outstanding. But Jodie Foster still showed her cuts as a true adult actor (a trend started when she was very young in the taxi driver). <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 Barky
