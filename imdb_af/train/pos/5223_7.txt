This movie doesn't seem to have pleased many people. First, it doesn't seem that many people saw it in the first place (I accidentally just knocked it), and then the judgments and ratings of those who did a lot didn't enjoy it much. <br /> <br /> Well, I did. I usually tolerate Gere for his look and his charm, and although I didn't regard him as a good actor, I know he can do well (I like his Mr. Jones). But this show is everything else. He is not beautiful in this one, and he is not charming. His character is quite different from anything I saw from him until that time --- old, ugly, broken, determined. And Gere, in what so far is my best performance ever, makes it beautiful. I think it's a sign of how well an actor does his job if you can't imagine someone else doing it - think Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter, or Washington as Alonzo in Training Day. That's how good Gere was here. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast was also good for me. I think I wouldn't have thrown Danes into this role, mostly because I think she's too good for it. But she is actually doing an excellent job, keeping her own with a Gere in top form, which is not a small thing. Strickland easily delivers the best supporting act, in a part that requires a great variety of hair. Actually, I think she owns the key scene with Gere and Danes, and that's quite an achievement. <br /> <br /> So how about the rest of the movie, apart from some great plays? The story may not be very surprising, but a few 8mm aspects to it, but add the story of the "veteran break in rookie" to the who-dunnit, and also (like the silence of the lambs) the girl and the impending retirement of Gere's character. All that provides a backdrop to the development of the two main characters, as they help each other establish in their respective new stations in life. It's a lot to accomplish in a 100 minutes, but it's done well, and we end up caring for the characters and what happens to them. <br /> <br /> Direction and photography were adequate. I could have done without the modern music video camera movements and cuts, but then I'm an old curmudgeon, and it's really not that bad. I think it helped with the atmosphere of the movie, which, as you might guess, is great and not happy at all. <br /> <br /> Appreciate.
