I only saw this movie at the Berlin Film Festival, and I have never seen the Hong Kong cinema. I felt like sitting in a roller coaster: the action was so fast, and there wasn't one boring moment in the movie. It has martial arts, love, special effects and a fantastic plot. My favorite scene is when Taoists drink, sing and fight for themselves - one of the many scenes that highlight the exceptional musical component of the movie. This movie is a must have !!
