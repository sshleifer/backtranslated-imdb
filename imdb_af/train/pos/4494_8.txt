As a resident of Bolton, this film made me obvious. The location shots are fascinating and show a Bolton transition. There are a number of scenes of apparent deviation, but this means that the town has to be rebuilt and the idea that the old place should make the new is right from this movie. A slight miscarriage James Mason leads a pleasant ensemble in a story about a fuss about a herring that arises in an adult generation conflict, then a pleasurable schematic resolution. Although I am a little too young to remember it completely, Lancashire's songs in the 60's are quite here: a Friday, piano songs, Sunday's constitutional, good neighbor, court's desires, the massive importance of self-respect, and I was delighted to see Naughton's funniest lines of play. There is no doubt that this film should be made available on DVD. It is well manufactured and most performances are well realized.
