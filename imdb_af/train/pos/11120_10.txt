Wow. I loved the whole series and was shocked by the comments of people who thought it ended badly. Perhaps in seasons 4 and 5 it might be a bit waffled, while staying better than anything else on television. But 6 and especially 6b were beautiful permutations on the themes developed in the more muscular first three seasons. <br /> <br /> 6B started with such a bleak mood and Janice's excellent insight into family anxiety - that punitive line about the features of Tony's love of sitting and staring. Anyone who has missed the implications for the rest of the series knows Tony. Melfi's discomfort over the psychiatric study and his references to the sociopath's ruthless sentimentality for pets and animals, goes back to the first episodes of the series, says Tony's panic attack over the ducklings leaving his pool and resonating with Phil's "wave up to his grandchildren before the coup the mercy of the final episode (not to come into the dark humor of Chase). <br /> <br /> I could keep going, but I'll just add that I'm the final show - starting with the opening tribes of Vanilla Fudge to offer the ironic advance ("You Keep Me On") to the end-time moments where Tony falls back into complacency with his family in rope or apart like AJ's SUV or Phil's head was completely completely perfect, the best TV ever. <br /> <br /> Very good in a dying medium that pathologically deviates the "jack-off fantasies" AJ (and then in which he immediately drops). pigtail to Mr. Chase.
