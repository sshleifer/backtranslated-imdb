"Cinema is dead, long live the theater!" says Peter Greenaway, one of the most innovative and productive contemporary directors, during the Romanian film festival Anonimul, which came to the third edition and takes place in the Danube Delta. This year, the fare to Jafar Panahi's "Offside" went. I saw it tonight in Bucharest at the festival's retrospective. Cinema is dead but still very lively. Panahi's film in a compelling way tells how Iranian society looks. Digitally filmed, "Offside" is a story inspired by a real event that happened to Panahi's daughter: the trouble and the risk took when deciding to attend a soccer match. It is banned in Iran, as we are informed. What Panahi manages to do is deliver little resources, but with a lot of work, intelligence and humor, the cultural patterns in a society that places women on a separate level. The absurdity of the laws is comical. The film has a happy ending, because Iran's team goes to the World Cup. What I appreciated most was the concept, the idea behind this movie. I would love to see Panahi's other films that were also banned in Iran. I think he can be seen as an activist director.
