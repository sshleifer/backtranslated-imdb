I thought it was a great movie. The theme song is sweet! :) Anyway, the only thing that bothered me a little was in the beginning when everything should have been normal. It was very strange and unrealistic. The big cable company is mainly what I'm talking about. In addition, the movie was very creative. I think all the plays were well done, the actors worked out their characters' personalities perfectly. Everything fits well together. It is really a pity that they are not a soundtrack. It would have been good! Because it is a Canadian movie, and because it is one of my favorites, I give this movie a 10 out of 10!
