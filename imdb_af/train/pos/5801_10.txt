This movie is exciting, risky and the music is great. The film Moonwalker was meant to coincide with the album Bad (1987). I have Bath. This is excellent (*****). The movie starts with Michael Jackson acting. "Man In The Mirror" on stage. It shows a history of Michael, from his early days in the Jackson 5 to the Bad era. Oh, and Badder is also good (Badder is a music video parody of the music video for Bad the single). It then shows the Speed ​​Demon video. The song and the video are very, very good. Indeed, let me go, which then appears. Then it shows the movie Moonwalker. After a few minutes, he played smooth criminals in a club called club 30. Just as he did the handrail. Now, nice to see you. goodbye.
