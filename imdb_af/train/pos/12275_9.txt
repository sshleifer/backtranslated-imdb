I have never heard of the book, but not to read it, but I will probably see the movie many times. <br /> <br /> This movie is unforgettable with perhaps the richest images I've ever seen in a movie. It was as if I had looked at paintings many times, which I thought was the idea. <br /> <br /> Terrific film, story, actors and cinematography. Full of profound emotions from all angles. Although I don't particularly love romance movies, I loved it and was deeply disturbed by Winona Ryder's plea for her father to the end. <br /> <br /> Mr. Irons deserves an award for his performance and close was never better. <br /> <br />
