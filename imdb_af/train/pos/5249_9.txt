The choice to make this SNL skit in a movie was much better thought than other recent ones. The humor involved in the character is not annoying humor, and is also character-driven enough to be stretched for an hour or two. <br /> <br /> Oddly, sexual content seemed to be avoided, but it may be possible. was because the limitations of live television taught me not to expect it. I think I thought more "Leisure Suit Larry" than the producers were ... Certainly not a PG-13 movie that will probably hurt it than reaching the heights of its more successful predecessors. <br /> <br /> I like it, but I doubt it will be a smash hit ... (which is sad, as Tim Meadows tends not to make characters that annoy me with the frequency others SNL alumni tend to)
