Leslie Charteris's series of novels of the adventures of the slightly shady Simon Templar ("The Saint") was brought to the screen in the late 1930s with the emerging George Sanders as Templar. It was a careful choice. Sanders will usually play villains with occasional "beautiful roles" (ffoliott in FOREIGN CORRESPONDENCE, the title hero in UNCLE HARRY's STRONG CASE, the estimated "best friend" of Robert Montgomery in RAGE IN THE HEAVEN). Here's his willingness to bow the rules and break a law, adjusting his "heavy persona", while his good and pure behavior Templar is a fine shadow hero like Chester Morris's "Boston Blackie" and (to some extent ) Peter Lorre's "Mr. Moto". <br /> <br /> The movies aren't the best series of movie series, but they're useful. Like the Rathbone's Holmes series or Oland's Chan series, the show regularly had actors repeating roles or playing new ones (the movie's anti-heroine was played by Wendy Barrie, who would appear in a second movie in the series ). These, and slightly well-known movie sets make the series a comfortable experience for the viewers, who hear the buzz of the dialogue (which always shows Sanders brain to keep one step ahead of the bad parents), without the obvious take into account lying deficiencies of the plot. All these mysteries have failed due to the fact that even the best writers of the genre can't stop repeating old ideas. <br /> <br /> Here's the moment when it happened when one of the role-players recognized his love for Barrie, of which she was long aware. Shortly afterwards he tried to protect her from the police. But if the film dealt with the identity of a criminal master brain, it became clear that this person was made so noble that it was the mysterious mastermind (ie, the writing had disguised him as the least likely suspect). <br /> <Barrie is proving that her father (who died in prison) was estimated by the actual criminals in the robbed gang. She has several people who help her - cups like William Gargan - and she gets advice from the master brain about planning embarrassment that can't be captured on her. The D.A. who found her father guilty (Jerome Cowan) is determined to get Barrie and her gang. The only detective who has a chance to settle the case is Jonathan Hale, who shadows Sanders, but with unwillingness. <br /> <br /> The movie has some nice moments in the script. Hale (currently on a special diet) is tempted to eat a rich lobster dinner for Sanders by Willie Best. As a result, he had a serious anxiety, so Sanders and Barrie Sanders's apartment could flee. The best should remind him (when he feels better) to look for a place Sanders told him to go at a certain time. <br /> <br /> There is also an interesting role for Gilbert Emery. Usually decent people (like the broken man in between TWO worlds) play a socially prominent weakness here - whose demise reminds them of a character in a Bogart movie. <br /> <br /> Overall, a well-made second half film movie home account in 1939. It will entertain you, even if it doesn't stay in your memory.
