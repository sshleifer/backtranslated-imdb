When I first saw the Romeo section, my first reaction was BRILLIANT! On future views, however, I was much more than masterful film making. This picture has a simple voice that will echo during film history cancellation. <br /> <br /> The opening context offers a beautiful palette using helper JP Sarro to draw his art on this canvas. <br /> <br /> Sarro really uses the camera as she paintbrush while taking us on a ride that encloses the audience in a terrific action movie that goes beyond the traditional format we've become accustomed to and deep in dark themes of betrayal, revenge and the importance of company. This movie is a director's dream in its core. <br /> <br /> But Sarro wasn't alone in this epic venture. The writer, provided by writer Tim Sheridan, was just as awesome. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was so accurate and straightforward that it gave the actors such presence and charisma on the screen. Specifically, the last scene (WARNING: SPOILERS !!! SPOILERS !!!) where Vanessa announces herself to be one of the coalition and a villain has been written for so long that it is one of the most chilling ends what I've ever seen. Sheridan is the next Robert Towne. <br /> <br /> In a final note it is clear that this production was not a small thing. <br /> <br /> Therefore, much praise should be given to producer Scott Shipley. To have the creativity and genius to walk alongside Jerry Bruckheimer. Never before have I seen a production so big with so much attention to every little detail. A producer's job is one of the most difficult in any movie and Shipley makes it easy. <br /> <br /> All in all, this film combines creative writing, stunning production and masterful direction. This is the art of the movie at its best. When the end of the movie arrives, the only thing you want is more. <br /> <br /> The Romeo division is a pioneering work, a masterpiece and, above all, the Romeo division is indeed art.
