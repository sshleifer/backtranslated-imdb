I rented this movie on DVD without knowing what to expect - and if I go to all places in Canada I will definitely bring it to class. <br /> <br /> The story, centered around the probably most unlucky movie team in the history of the film itself, was brilliantly written and the talented actors succeed in delivering every single pun in time. <br /> <br /> If you simply can't laugh at Hollywood North "I suggest seeing a psychiatrist right away - you might have serious problems. <br /> <br /> also the great chemistry between actors Deborah Kara Unger and Matthew Modine - where they really just act? Jennifer Tilly (a hilarious bad actress) and Martin Landau also delivered a very edgy but funny show. <br /> < Great movie, even better cast.
