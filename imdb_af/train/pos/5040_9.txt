I saw the trailer for Frailty on Yahoo for the first time. Movies back in the day, after Stephen King heard it in heaven. Not really a fan of any star, I still wanted to see it, because I'm a big thriller fan. <br /> <br /> I wasn't disappointed. The acting was excellent, especially of the two young boys. Usually I have the child actors, but Young Adam and Young Fenton were excellent. Bill Paxton really did it to fix it. It was beautifully shot. <br /> <br /> One should also notice the plot twists. The three turns at the end hit hard and fast, and I didn't see them. The final twist of the film, along with the gravity of what has just been released, gives me cold fever until today, although I watched the film so many times. <br /> <br /> A real gem.
