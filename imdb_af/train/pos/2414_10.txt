Monarch Cove was one of the best Friday night drama shown in a long time. I ask the author to write a long series and give it to LIVE, SOON. Each person was very interesting and did a wonderful job with their lines to make the plot come true. However, the film must continue long ago. I would like to see Bianca and Jake's child grow up and play a major role in the movie, along with the new grandparents planning for her educational future. Also bring Kathy back to see her cousin and promote her life. It was wonderful that the grandparents worked out their problems, but the family business had to be restored to work status and let us see how Jake and Bianca survived through marriage. year.
