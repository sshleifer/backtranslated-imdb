Not sure you can call it an anti-war movie, it shows war on an elite level. These are elite troops who know what they are doing and are proud of. Even when they are pacifist, they still enjoy the skill level and defeat their enemies, even if it is not a pacifist. The movies are slow and inexorable, and in many ways it is rather tame, because war films are more in line with today's standards. No body parts fly off like in modern movies. It is brutal in other ways, although you are killing on a personal level. It's more of a thinker's movie. Once you start watching, you don't want to miss anything. The thoughts of the men in the movie and their interactions are what the movie is about - not the battle itself or a great exciting story. It may be called a warrior goggle. <br /> <br /> If you are in the war, if you read or watch programs about the SAS and so on, you want to see this movie !!!!! <br /> <br /> Comparable films are The Hill (1965) with Sean Connery, 49th Parallel (1941) with an all-star film, The Naked and the Dead (1958) with Cliff Robertson. Everyone is unusual in their path and point to a personal level war. Enjoy it!
