Half a dozen short stories of varying interest relieve us of life in Finland. These stories are interwoven and each one contains a scene in which a sonic buoy is heard. This indicates that the events depicted are happening simultaneously. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with a bungy jump that promises excitement, but the early stories are pretty low key. The movie improves so stick to it. Two broken marriages in the ensuing stories offer a lot of drama while a hospital scene begs us for a terminally ill patient for pain relief. The last moments with his wife are both convincing and moving. <br /> <br /> While the various scenes of family life are taking place in Finland, the themes are of a general nature wherever you live. <br /> <br /> Short story collections are rarely as satisfying as a good tense 90-minute drama.
