Man, it's a hard DVD to come. I could only find it on region 2, a Spanish import, and it was expensive. <br /> <br /> Was it worth it? Well yes. Not so much, because it is a masterpiece of filmmaking, although director of Curt Siodmak (the credits on IMDb.com read "Robert" but the DVD credits list Curt), or because it is some well-known figures of other murderous Mysteries - Elisha Cook, Jr. and Thomas Gomez - but because my decade of curiosity about the movie was finally satisfied. <br /> <br /> Essentially, a respected but independent engineer (Alan Curtis) was raised by his estranged wife and found himself in a New York bar with two tickets in his pocket. A woman with a strange hat is next to the chair next to him and he kindly invites her to join him at the music review. She accepts a little bleak. The jogging barman gives them both eyes as they leave. <br /> <br /> At the show, the stormy star notices that this lady in the audience wears the same hat and pours out with anger. The drummer in the group, Cook, learns from the silent woman, but doesn't get any reaction. Curtis takes the woman to her house and asks her name, but she won't give it, and she doesn't want to know him. If she was a Longfellow commitment, she would have said something about ships that happened at night. <br /> <br /> Well, Curtis goes home to find that his wife has been murdered in his absence. The chief police officer, Gomez, turned to the DA. His only alibi is that he was with a phantom lady who no one else remembers - not the bartender, not the Latina star, not the taxi driver (Al Alp), not the drummer - and since the lady disappeared herself, it is impossible to dig her up. <br /> <br /> Curtis was found guilty and sentenced to death. But inspector Gomez considered things and decided she was probably innocent because no one with a brain would make such a stupid story. He joins Curtis's love secretary, Ella Raines, to investigate the case informally. <br /> <br /> They visit the alleged witnesses again. The ominous barman is overwhelmed by a car, perhaps by accident, so he is out of the picture. The hot-tempered Latina has left because the show is closed and she is in any case unoperative and ignorant of the source of the hat. Elisha Cook, Jr., is strangled by the real killer, but not before appearing in a scene pumping the drums into an improvised jazz group. His sweaty face accepts an expression that does not indicate intense focus, but rather a monstrous, orgasmic madness. His eyeballs roll to the ceiling, his mouth stabbing, his hammer being indignant. I laughed aloud. <br /> <br /> No one's performance is different, but everyone is professional enough. Thomas Gomez is always trustworthy. However, best performance is probably by Franchot Tone. He is the right killer and he falsifies his alibi. He is reserved and artistic. Even when he disappears, he is decorative. I don't know how to set it exactly, but Tone seems to think and just do his part. Alan Curtis as the innocent engineer is zero on the Kelvin scale and belongs to a B-picture. <br /> <br /> I don't know why it's considered classic. It's really your basic murder story by Cornell Woolrich, not as good as some of his others. But Siodmak's direction is sensitive. A man gets run and his hat winds up in a pit with water running around. His use of shadows is quiet and effective. <br /> <br /> Glad I got it.
