The location of the store around the corner is exactly at the beginning of the film, Balta Street in Budapest, but it can really be anywhere. The small number of sets reflects a mid-European design, but it can be a store around any corner. The film is not about Budapest or the retail goods business, but about the up and down love, which is reflected in most main characters. <br /> <br /> Alfred Kralik and Klara Novak are sparring partners at work, but their anonymous letters are full of hope and aspiration and romance, and the story makes it unnecessary to bring these two aspects together beautifully. Hugo Matuschek, the owner of the shop, has problems with his wife, she is just a voice at the end of the phone. Ferencz Vadas has a secret relationship. Ilona Novodny has a gentleman who buys her fur clothes. Mr. Pirovitch's life is centered around his wife and children. Pepi Katona 'plays Santa Claus' to a girl at Christmas. You even feel that quiet Flora Katchuck while staying home with her mother's dreams. <br /> <br /> The script is a masterpiece of comedy and drama. It moves effortlessly from scene to scene. It is one of those silent films that repeatedly look, but simply, quite deeply. The dialogue reflects the character language that is not common today. <br /> <br /> All the acting is great. Even the little characters like the waiter in the cafe and the street policeman are perfect. James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan play perfectly apart. He really became an actor and has a sweet and sharp show. Margaret Sullavan was a tremendous actor and is valued these days. Some of her other films are worth catching. Like Mr Matuschek, Frank Morgan is wonderful. His moment of truth is moving a lot. Golden stars around the artists. <br /> <br /> It's a well-used phrase they don't make as they used to. (The vague repetition 'You've Got Mail' was dire) But in this case it's true. Unfortunately, director Lubitsch is not in freight mode, but has delivered a classic film of spirit, charm and warm humanity.
