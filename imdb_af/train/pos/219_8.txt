Simon's carefully written dialogues are really electrified by Matthau and Burns. You can literally hear the writing crack. There are few movies out there that can develop such a relationship between the actors and the writing. For example, the famous reunion scene could have been much duller with less quality actors involved. Matthau seems to be born to play Willie Clark (of course Oscar Moreso in the Odd couple), and with all the little idiosyncrasies and ways that Matthau beats in the character (the line he claims he is living in the city While Lewis lives in the country that Lewis is "out of touch" is the hallmark of this, this makes one of the best appearances I've ever seen from any actor in any role, whether comics or drama or whatever . Period. Matthau and Burns work well together; The contrast they portray emphasizes Simon's excellent talent for creating comic conflict. This movie is just one of the ultimate "must-see" and demands a legitimate sought-after place in movie history pages.
