Oh, the sixties. There were some interesting movies. I was more of a movie. Now I enjoy renting movies and relaxing in my house rather than going to the theater. I also saw this short film, "The Legend of the Boy and the Eagle". I've been searching for this movie for years. It was truly inspiring. Surprisingly, I was finally able to gather more information from your website. Thanks ........ I'm surprised to find out that this short film was an opening for a Disney picture. I also didn't remember the Disney movie. I didn't even remember being an opening movie for Disney. I really wish they'd ever show it on TV. I wonder if Disey has the rights to this movie? Is it available on DVD? It's a must see for all generations!
