After some very good ratings to the point of SUPERB, I was very happy with the movie. The film was dark, moving, the anger, the pain, the blame and a very convincing demon. <br /> <br /> Initially, I expected to see many special effects, and like a lover's caress, it blew me away with the subtlety and the realities of it. Brian, I'll be blown away with your artworks telling the story and taking care of the special effects. You will go a long way, my friend. I will definitely be the president of your fan club. <br /> <br /> The best actor award, Eric Etebari was the number one choice. You have Jr. Lopez looks like a child compared to Kasadya. :) <br /> <br /> Overall, the play, story line, the high quality filming and great effects, it was fantastic. I just wish it was longer. I look forward to The Dreamless with extremely high expectations.
