"The woman in black" is easily one of the creepiest British ghost stories ever made. A young lawyer, after arriving in a small town to handle a dead client's estate, is being dressed in black by a mysterious woman. The film is loaded with extremely frightening atmosphere and the fear is calculated for and provides the maximum effect. The action keeps the viewer deeply involved and the final is pretty disturbing. The play is excellent and the tension is almost unbearable. Sometimes if you want to see a really creepy horror movie give this one a look. I dare venture to watch "The Woman in Black" alone at night with the lights. Highly recommended.10 out of 10.
