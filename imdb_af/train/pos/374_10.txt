Rating "10/10" Masterpiece <br /> <br /> A few years ago I heard Spielberg's remark that he would repeat the movie here and there if he had a chance. Well, Mr Spielberg, I think nothing is perfect, but this movie - along with Schindler's List - is your best. Even Oprah does well in this one! <br /> <br /> What I like most is the realism of the story and drama. Such things have happened and still happen in the world.
