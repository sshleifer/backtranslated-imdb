It's one of the best movies I've ever seen. My parents come from rural India and to some extent I have seen the lives of the residents. Peoples are very poor and have financial and social problems. <br /> <br /> The movie reflects exactly the same. Full credit to the director and the actor. They did an excellent job. I just wonder how films like Lagaan and Paheli can go for Oscar and not Doghi. I do not understand the criteria on which the movies are selected. The money that makes the difference or having some big names in the movie makes the difference. <br /> <br /> Hope to see more movies like this in the future.
