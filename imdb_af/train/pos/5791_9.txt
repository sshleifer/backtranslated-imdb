It must be one of my favorite Twilight Zone episodes, mainly for depicting two lonely souls in a post-apocalyptic environment. <br /> <br /> The cobwebs and litter-laden streets are ominous in The special way the Twilight zone is best. <br /> <br /> While the parable may be a bit troublesome by today's drama standards, it is an excellent one. Use the institution to make a statement that is relevant to the human experience. as well as geopolitics, in a timeless manner. The whole drama rests solely on the shoulders of Mr. Bronson and me. Montgomery, who doesn't disappoint. (May they both rest in peace.) <br /> <br /> A true classic.
