First time director Tom Kiesche turns into a winning movie in the spirit of the cut, dark comedy. Shoot at a shocking budget, but have the taste of early Coen's brother Blood Simple ... and throw in some Monty Python scents to get started! Must be seen more than once to appreciate all the elements that carry one scene to the next. Expect more good things to come from this writer-director actor.
