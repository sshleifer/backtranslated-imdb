I do not want to get here * here, but I will only reward this technically excellent, flawlessly acted and observant little movie with an excellent hour and half entertainment. It will entertain, surprise, perhaps embarrassing, and almost certainly drag in the hearts from time to time, as it approaches the inevitable, but not obvious, approach without becoming any clich√© or predictable. Most definitely recommended. <br /> <br /> A previous user's comment gives 8 out of 10 for the movie and 10 out of 10 for both Branagh and Bonham-Carter's outstanding performances. I totally agree.
