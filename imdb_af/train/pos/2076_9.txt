The Good Earth is a good movie !!! Everyone should see ... This is tearing and heart heating. It allows for the improvement of value creation over perseverance, humility and the love of family. The story can relate to our lives today, especially that poverty is on the threshold. The way we respond to such problems is very important. If someone is not strong enough to experience such problems, he can be left vulnerable and useless. I am very happy about how the characters justified their roles, even the young actors ... Their emotions captivated the audience. The movie may have been in black and white, but the story is so fascinating that you don't want to end. It makes it really great! There must be a repeat for this very nice movie.
