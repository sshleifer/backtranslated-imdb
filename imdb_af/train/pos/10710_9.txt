I really disagree with old-yardley giant who (if he watched the whole movie) would have seen a spectacular Scottish landscape (some of the best ever shot in Skye) and have a movie with a difficult start gathered a very gripping whole. <br /> <br /> It's not a big budget movie. On the contrary, it is a film that has a strong sense of community. <br /> <br /> I can't say how many "standard" movies I wear - to express the same polished stuff again. Looks no good at that. It seems to be trying to offer something more real and definitely more Gaelic than any recent Scottish movie. <br /> <br /> OK, so the play is not a block in style. This is because the actors seem to be real people. I actually thought the key roles of the boy and his grandfather were really convincing - and sometimes unusually beautiful. <br /> <br /> Seemed wearing really a second look, as there are many threads that become the second time clearer - which really leads to the end. <br /> <br /> Overall, the combination of music and (sometimes) impressive footage, plus a community approach to the acting and non-normal structure, saw Seachd in a very unique and memorable movie. More of these are please!
