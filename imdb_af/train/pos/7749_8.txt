This movie blows off your feet. This debut film by Tom Barman (known from the Belgian rock band dEUS) introduces you to 8 intriguing people, building blocks of a compelling film mosaic. They survive one day and one night in the Metropole of Antwerp. The bartender paints his characters with a lot of pain and skillfully interweaves their individual stories, a tour that reminds one of the best work of Robert Altman and Paul Thomas Anderson. The patchwork of anecdotes surprise, move, amuse; The dialogues are so natural, they seem to be improvised. Some good performances by Matthias Schoenaerts, Natali Broods and the extremely funny duo of Ghent, Jonas Boel and Titus De Voogdt. Sam Louwyck is the unforgettable "Windman", a bizarre guy dancing throughout the film. Sam is also responsible for the beautiful choreography, and of course Tom Barman himself cared for the ultra-cool Sound Track. We were seriously impressed. Any way The wind blows is a movie that blows you off your feet.
