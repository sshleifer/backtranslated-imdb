This is a German film from 1974 which is something to do with other women who come to the castle and moreover, I can't tell you their purpose or even what the purpose of the movie is. I can tell you that there are several women who also reflect on the moon as servants in this fortress who are building, wearing body color and imitating gallons because they were Goth Kit-Kat Klub, however, and it seems to be a good part of the run of this film . Well, there seems to be something with the devil's worship and vampires, and there is a certain girl on the girl's things, etc., but the main goal seems to be a new builder on the apartment. I did instead of eyeing one of the house-keepers of the devil, who gave the truth to the case and made him worse. What? Wanda District District District (when asked in credit)? No matter. If you are not too much on your devotional movies, you may love this, otherwise it is very good and I could not finish, I was very tired. 3 out of 10.
