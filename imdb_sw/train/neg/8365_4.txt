This is a simple story but it feels a lot of cheat. It lacks pathos so it does not leave for ideas or personal ideas or moments of reflection. <br /> <br /> Animation has been done well but I feel it is a great demonstration. I would like more pictures from the back, more space back and maybe then this can't feel so kitsch. But for Hollywood film films it works the same but it's a very derivative of Aardman film and this is bothering me. Perhaps a long film will try if this manufacturer can do without a loud voice. <br /> <br /> I think the high sound is very glib.
