I have seen about four films of Japanese fears and not very interesting. However, I could see that there was a wise script leading the way. <br /> <br /> Not here, no way. This is about the investigator who tries to link such massacres. When he finds the suspect asking, the suspect goes out because they continue to see the spirit. Then, the spirit begins to follow all the surveillance for REASON which has never been shown and makes more than MOVIE. <br /> <br /> Still enough? No. The movie continues to change the perception of different characters who do not have much to do with stories. I have seen this before in other movies where it shows a different view. It's not here. Also, anything that happens on the screen that really can endure quickly. For example, there are a few cases with a small weapon that builds and ... then takes only to another location. I know that this can be a great effect. Certainly not here. It's just a bad editor. Finally, there is a "spirit" who screams in a non-threatening or non-threatening way. It is very sad and happens in all films. All salaries have been done previously in the best way so that you can see all those coming. Then after one of them, the movie is over. At that time, a wave of frustration struck over the audience if I could see all of us felt that we had lost our time. Someone made a shock and shock shock. It was better than the whole film. Just put, remove.
