It seems like this is the only film that John Saxon explained, and that he had a good sense to stop after that and stay in front of the camera. This movie is a dog, from start to finish, and is lighter and wood without something going on. The Viet Nam war hero takes the job to work with the master of the group, gets very friendly with the wife and then the wife is killed by the group's own boss and the warrior appears and sent to prison, the death line, in particular. Now, this prison has been trying to arrest prisoners and tries to form a form that will turn men into a killing machine (zombie). Of course, everything goes wrong and then there are all infected people bound in prison, and some of them turn into zombies and others who suddenly don't want to be there again. This just continues to continue with anything to show or speak to himself, and when I finish before the end, which seemed like it was coming a few times but no, it seemed just to put in order to turn off the different ways and the same. If someone looks up to the end they can become a zombie themselves, so don't get dangerous. 2 out of 10.
