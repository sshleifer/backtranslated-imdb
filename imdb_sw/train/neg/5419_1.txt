Why do filmmakers always oppose the work of the author? I mean, yes, things should be deleted for the interest of the audience, but see Anne of Green Gables. They did a good job of combining key events in the overall sense of the cohesion that was just interesting. I can't believe that they chose to combine the three novels together with Anne's Avonlea in a terrible mess. See all they missed for doing so. . . Paul Irving, Elizabeth little, widows, Windy Poplars. . . and college years of Anne, for heaven !!! Was it not fun to meet Priscilla and the whole Redmond group? Kevin Sullivan should take things on one movie at a time, rather than beat them all together and mix characters with events as he did. This movie was good, if you come out of novels of it! But the good work of L.M. Montgomery is something that should not be rejected. This film was dropped after seeing a successful way that made Anne's Green Gables life.
