For the most promising film it was a desperate, well-organized and acting intermediate and unusual. The plot had more holes in it than the suisse suit and is the end of the clich√©d I saw in the film for a while. The last part would have given my heart out, if the whole movie was not the starting pain. I was hungry! From the first event - one remained asking, if the sister was trying to reach her twins with help, or simply to shock the death that would be better for the audience and save us from two hours of worst work we have seen so far. It was a fear in the literal sense of the word.
