Okay, the film is probably your favorite. But your average, popcorn munching movie goer who has got to-gether ten or fifteen bucks is the cost of seeing the movie these days perhaps wonder why he or made this choice. Standing "Copolla" is a good straightforward thing, right? Still! It's a good spoof of film displays. But it's "deep" very. I am concerned when filmmakers are more engaging in fun than the public. It is interesting as a curio of the movie and has a chuckle or two in it. But after running their course in movies and on TV, the dust will grow thick on the film cans and the boxes hold. It is not possible either epichal or epic!
