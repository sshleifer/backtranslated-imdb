I saw this movie in the middle of the night, when I was passing through it and nothing else to think about. It's one of those films where you choose to see what - just for a moment! - but you'll know after twenty minutes or so that you can't turn off, no matter how bad. One of those movies that are among the worst is good and very bad, well, just open BAD, it's important to see just to get the experience of frustration to realize that it's all! A great way in the middle of the night, is for a wonderful tennis tennis. Do not get involved to ask why no one can tell Chad Lowe is open husband, because logic is not used.
