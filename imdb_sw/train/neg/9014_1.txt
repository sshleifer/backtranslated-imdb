there are those movies that are bad they are funny, then there are those who shout "I want an hour and a half of my life back" ... that's pretty much what this is. Dean cain tries to be an actor but fails. The sfx is very bad (regular images and rocky rocks like falling paper) and fake plastic guns that are used to light up ... The reduced version of the screen used to show a lot of things happens once it's awesome. This movie is getting even used as one of the most common nightclubs, it's just bad!
