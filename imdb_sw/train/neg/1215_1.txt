Not often give a single star view, but the computer won't make me a negative number. <br /> <br /> Opening names tell us we're in deep water ready. Although this is a small-scale budget exploitation, there are 17 registered producers. No. And at the beginning of the legendary bright husband Kenneth returns home to his family in a gated upscale community. The house is a pig. His wife, Della (Kim Basinger) has allowed children to run amok all day. OK /> <br /> OK. We are ready in deep water. Mrs Basinger was 55 years old when the film came out. Are these children or grandchildren? It's Christmas. Della drives a car at the mall, which can be cut. For bludgeon home the idea of ​​a male-hooded sparrow in the world drives the previous soccer players in a perfect draw in the rainfall on Christmas day. Certainly. For the bonus she sees the car and the deer was killed with it. <br /> <br /> We get a real suspense in driving scenes, though. It's rainy and traffic is bad. First we see Della trying to drive and smoke at the same time. Then Della tries to drive and talk on her phone at the same time, while turning completely around the back seat of the charger for the phone. He / she announces the shops, sees an old friend from the university, trying to buy things but his credit card is reduced - gosh, maybe her husband is grumpy because she is going to break, but that's very hard for the script to follow. <br /> <br /> In a lot of parking he runs afoul of the largest group in the history of the film. One young White (Lukas Hass look at his work down to the toilet), one Black, one Asian, and one Puerto Rico. Think of the company Up and People has gone bad and you will have an idea. If they have guns they give them a view. Street stores come to explore ruckus and beat the head, firing more than once. Parking lots are as full as possible, people everywhere, and no one finds out. Della has run away from his car and instead of choosing a police station or a safe place of safety, he runs on a construction site, where he kills all their bad guys at a time and just a mobile . The most important of the future. <br /> <br /> Offers the car home. The car is moving and so it moves through the rainy rains. Look for the children, goes down, and when her husband asks petulantly what she has found him in the shops shows her guns and triggers him in empty empty action Instead we know that his children will probably spend Christmas in childcare or group work, because the Government will collect it when responding to suicide charges. The four horns can be counted as the actual assassination. Husband, different stories. I am very happy to see this on the cable. If I would like to see it in the theater (did any release?) I would like to be angry. If so, I see only talent as Mrs. Basinger and Mr. Haas gave birth to this waste. One thing very good, though. This is written and led by Susan Montford. Mrs Montford has not received any other text or leading a loan since adopting this turd. There is justice in the world.
