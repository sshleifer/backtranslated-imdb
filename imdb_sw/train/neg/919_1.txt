Although I had to be accepted, I laughed more to watch this film than the last comedies I saw. <br /> Budget must have a pocket change from administrators. Production values ​​are so low that they actually made it fun to look. Reminds me of the Monster Robot organized by a boy in a gorilla suit and a dive hat card card. In one district, the innocent victim is supported by the leg. Geez, hard to believe but the Black Knight area from the Holy Grail was more realistic. I continued to wonder why the victim did not start shouting "No one will" and "It's just a physical wound, I've been bad". It was one of the funniest events I saw last year. <br /> <br /> "gladiator / demon" was sewing too. Among the cheap costumes to the geeky look of the guy in it the final result was hysterical. <br /> <br /> True movie which is bad enough to appear. Such a kind of slow motion auto accident on the film. <br /> <br />
