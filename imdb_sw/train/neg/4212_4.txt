The beginning of this film is excellent and loud with good humor, but once the film changes on animation is quickly losing its appeal. One of the reasons it was, at least for me, was that the color in a large part of the animation was also suspended, and very little different. It doesn't look good, at least on VHS. Once in a while it breaks and looks good, but not often too, the characters come and go very quickly. For example, I'd like to see more than "Moby Dick." When the film begins to entertain, however, it takes again to the dragon's door and then the film tightens. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's not just memorable enough or ability to compete with the great animated movies of the last decade.
