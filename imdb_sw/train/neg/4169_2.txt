I paid only 2 because Natassia Malthe (like Vampiress Quintana) looks sexy sooooo in this film. Really there is a very little logic for this movie, but it's also a vampire beyond sci-fi flicks. Movie may be very trying to stop traditional vampire stories. Unfortunately, it went too far and made the whole story not only wise, but foolish. There is a lot of gas and too much of the body that makes me feel. The beautiful movie of the vampire should be more sensible that you do not need to see too much blood - we all know when the vampire jumps over man he / she will do what the vampire do. A few Moan or blow is all that needs to describe the location (as one last time Quintana tries to have sex to activate Rosa, all it needs is a few moans, others are your thoughts). Otherwise, it is my personal taste.
