I prepared to laugh in this movie as the Secret of Theater Science, but it was just boring. It seems that producers had many friends of the biker website, and from there they decided to make a film. <br /> <br /> It is often unknown. Most bicycles are riding on dirt roads, and the same music is played regularly. Unfortunately, Renee Harmon is very difficult in the film. Harmon would probably livened things up. He probably had another promise that day. <br /> <br /> Of course, bicycles frighten a small town. Fights, murder, fearful soldiers, goofy cells, etc.. One of the bicycles wear a football cap, a weak attempt to distinguish from all other chaos. . One part has a biker mocking the woman, speaking to the woman's face "You're right! You are right!" We return to the scene after a minute and again announces "You're right!". Could not the author think of something else that creativity says? Finally, good people have killed bad people. We also learn that the wedding between the middle ship Joe and the young Susie has been canceled. Susie goes to college, and we learn suddenly that Joe's wedding is still (but with a different bride). Finally.
