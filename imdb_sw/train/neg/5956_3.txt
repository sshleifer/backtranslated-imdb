Another awesome flick where the boy of goof-ball fights with the widow and his usual sidekick who want to take? Yes, but the fact that this is from Canada feels a little different. "Brain" you have trouble young Jim Majelewski enter into a treatment that the leader who turns out to be a cult leader backed by "bad" brain. Jim can stop him? I think that since our northern neighbor has accomplished all that they have accomplished, they have the right to make the movie at least awesome. But still, they probably want to be known for having a national health service and all. <br /> <br /> Bad man had a brain. Why didn't people make this film?
