Yes, I hate hollywood, but love cinema so I must watch these shadows on the movie. And, I was hoping Vanilla Sky would be nice. I was hoping that they could put the first "Open Your Eyes" alike, or they would do it. Well, it happened to be a little bit, and it was stirred. It started well. I love Radiohead. I would like more than that. But in the end we listen to the best Vibrations and Beach Boys. Talk about many types of sucking. They had one or two good songs in the club and maybe two others, but why oh they had to complain GV at the peak. It was more anger than frustration or improper. Especially when it has NOTHING TO DO WITH PLOT. At least put a certain meaning behind the tracks. Little A = base. Anything. It also worked for the club's location. That was cool. Otherwise the movie was a great one of pride. If the audience would get a film. That's what they could read headings, and others couldn't. Its as simple as that. All attractions were full. I did not understand Diaz's incentive (they did not have a chicken soup before?) And some others. And I love Kurt Russell. Stay overboard. Tom Cruise can't act (especially in these types of movie [ie, Wide Shut Eyes]. With elevator. I get it. Anyways tried to reinforce the nature and sound of rock crappy american songs and crappy corners and publish a good film and color processing and would have helped if crowe did not delete. 2/10 Great desire.
