I watched this film, along with all the other changes that I could get hands-including to see-games in the preparation of a certain academic study. The movie is very moving, such as music. Unfortunately all life was taken out of the story. I've never seen such a bad picture of Mr. Rochester. All its basic features have gone. Where is it? What? Where is his passion? Scott's Rochester more closely resembles the foil of Rochester, St. John's. John, than the character from the novel. In fact, St John's acting actor in this situation played a sterling view of St.John's time when Scott deserves to beat things or just look at the ceiling (which he does all the time). I don't know what they thought. I would like to give this film a more advanced vote based on the amazing music and movies but I honestly can't tolerate this film for a very long time because of George C. Scott's performance.
