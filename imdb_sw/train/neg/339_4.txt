Unlike the "Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai", or "The Big Problem in China", or "The Conan of the Mbabi", which is the horrible films that are cool and bothering themselves that makes them a religious feeling, the golden child is bad only. <br /> <br /> The column itself is not surprising, and there is a certain time of interest. But here Eddy Murphy "flip attitude" just delete any feeling of tension or danger in the story. With special effects are silly enough to make more damage to the tension. The "secret" secrets of Tibetan Buddhism are decorated rather than forbidden. <br /> <br /> Without feeling that anything is concerned, or that the characters are faced with real risk, why should we care? <br>> <br /> Who should see this film: <br /> <br /> - A great fan of Eddy Murphy who can't help themselves /> <br /> - I can't think of anyone / I will give you this 4 film out of 10 for a regular joke.
