After looking at Koyaanisqatsi two or three times and loving every second, I finally had a chance to see two life changes. I was really disappointed if it wasn't close to the first level. 90 minutes of people with baskets on their heads are not my idea of ​​a good film. Philip's mirror in this case was neither beauty nor power related to the first. Compared to Koyaanisqatsi this movie seemed slow and useless. The lower Baraka version, which is one idea but has been done well. I believe the third movie in this series will not look at the image of this waste.
