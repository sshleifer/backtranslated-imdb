This is listed as a document, not, it is a type of type as a document but is only suspected because then they leave with a shaky and dodgy camera. This is only released in the UK on DVD as "American comedy style" is not so. It basically follows you next to a young boy during the spring break when they go to Mexico for cheap oil and with an effort to get there a girlfriend was finally put. Throw it a few, and also in the same effort and you have a non-subtle story of young people who try not to try to find other girls. Thinking about this 18th Rating has a very little dirt, and exercise sex zero, especially I think the rating is by swearing which there is a lot. <br /> <br /> If you like the bad habit of Jackass without humor, then this could be your thing, if you have brain cells left then let me avoid this!
