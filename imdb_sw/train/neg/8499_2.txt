This is the kind of thing that now enjoys the film beans. After all, Feierstein's Flex Crush will know that real men don't look at anything with Truffaut. It can be interesting if Truffaut had anything-here-here. The camera-like-voyeur method was not new. Did we all remember "Thief Thief" of De Sica? Or anything to Hitchcock? So everything we find is an example of newborns like Truffaut, who spends all of her free time 'blowing up' on a movie, who breaks school discipline, gets preferential charges (very young sex), and finally runs social barriers make 'his own movie'. Sorry ... you've been there, it has been done so many times for this important thing.
