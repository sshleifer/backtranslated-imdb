I watched this film recently on DVD and told me I had no feelings. I know it's taboo to knock off independent films, but this feels unhappy. <br /> <br /> The column was interesting, but its implementation was short. I found myself thinking "all right, they just come in, the story will take soon". Before you knew it, the film was over and the story did not take it. I can't say I've done everything that is interesting. It was very bad. Not Star Wars prequel bad trilogy, but worse yet. I don't know when it was, I will think about two hours (because it is a safe estimate). However, when the film was finished, I felt like I deserved some kind of recognition for the power I used not to leave the film and walk away half. Again, I was wrong, and finally bored out of my wits. I am not one of those boys who need immediate action and explosion in the film, so don't get into me like that because you don't like it.
