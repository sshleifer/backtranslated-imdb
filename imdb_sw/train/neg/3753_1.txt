Because of the strike of the 1988 American authors they had to beat this section in 3 days. It is a very bright, consisting of cut-off parts from the 2nd season and was described by its author, Maurice Hurley as "awesome, just terrible." <br /> <br /> Why producers could not only wait a decent shot who knows. I think because of the production strike lost money and could only release a flashback or perhaps Roddenberry was very sick at that time to be able to vote this half of the veto. This period also shows the final appearance of Diana Muldaur (Dr. Katherine Pulaski) in a series.
