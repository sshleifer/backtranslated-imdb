I read the review of this movie, and generally were so nice so I thought I should see it. I am a great lover of Francophile film and art, but I believe this is still another case that critics are doing something "arty" or "mentally" in something that is not. I will be clear: it has sexual experiences that I have never been, I have sought to see. Obviously, the piano teacher has great psychological issues, but I did not want to see it displayed clearly. The film is, of course, disgusting. I mean, when I saw Requiem for Fantasy, I was being taken by the last type of place with Jennifer Connelly, but that wasn't anywhere near the kind of hate and ignoring what I heard during this film.
