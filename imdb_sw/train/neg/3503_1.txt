And when I look at Sarah Silverman, I get the same results. I love inappropriate humor. But this woman is very tied to the B-O-R-I-N-G, who is angry, and worthy. He also has absolutely nothing to humorous. The way to the horse he tries to give his line is just dead by arrival because he is not just funny. I looked at the two groups of his plan and I was ready for Novocaine. Geez, my child (19 years old) saw her promos on Comedy Central and said she was "chick dumb." I thought it was thanks. The section where he says "See my show or I will kill my dog," it is really reliable. I know she wants to be comedienne. He comes just as a case caused by nut. I can never see him near MY dog.
