This is a great referral film for the well-known group (which I am not part of). I went to the preview of this movie without knowing what to expect - I finally found the disappointment. The history of dysfunctional dread functional (often descending "misleading") Hungarian Jewish family is not my cup of tea. The epic epic like this should give its audience something else last. Finally, pictures like this are about human nature - this picture did not look around new light on its most important features.
