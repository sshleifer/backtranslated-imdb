I am really surprised at the level of good ratings this anti-Christian pseudo-documentary got. Now, I respect someone's attitude and faith, I am not alone, in this situation, I believe the Christian doctrine. However, anti-Christian propaganda is somewhat different issue. This film has some of the best features, but it is very few and is represented in a highly recommended context. I don't recommend against seeing. In fact, I think everyone should see it and decide for themselves whether they believe it or not. And this is more space than one director offers Christian doctrine. Instead of a questioning technique on the subject, it looks like a personal vendetta at a Christian school that affects her childhood. It also hurts Christians as often without courage or intellectuals, there is no middle ratio. <br /> The director uses films from the Passion of Christ without permission, puts an interview with the headmaster of his former school and offers almost only Christian historians and writers. In fact I have seen the superintendent being the lowest person and thinks that his view was absolutely correct. I am also very doubtful that any of the Christian believers who were interviewed were asked after the words or even told before the interviews of the investigation. To say that, there is a new and interesting truth that found here and some original ideas on the issue of Christianity. But the way this all thinks is often offensive, is very unpleasant and caused by horror.
