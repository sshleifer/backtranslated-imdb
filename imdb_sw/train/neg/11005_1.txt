This film shows a line of drawings, which partly goes inside. I realized it was going on at the end of the movie, the first time just to please me. <br /> <br /> Many events in this film come together without any known punchlines and just try to walk around with that reality, using ignorance and evil. This attempt to stay comedy without any funny bits fails. <br /> <br /> My staff and maybe subjective results after watching this movie (my god, hurts in my head every time I call "movie"): The brave attempt to turn something into something bigger. But it failed. At least the director did something without something. But it's not a good thing. Most movies did not interest as planned, but this beat them all. It is a real-life demonstration of the worst form of film making. No. To adjust yourself, it is worse than that. The movie is so bad that it is not good at all. It is not even desirable to look at the leading actor, author and director (all three boys in the way) perish by swallowing in the sea of ​​bad movies. The movie is very bad for it.
