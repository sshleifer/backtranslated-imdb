It's "FB.I." star Reed Hadley, with all the stars of the cast stars! The film begins with an abduction of an emergency (easily?), Which causes one thing, and another - that does not give a great story, which is "a great house, U.S.A." The story of breaking the prison. Stories impossible, say the least. It's like a TV festival, more just "violence" (at times). <br /> <br /> BUT - cast is a trip! Make this photo: Ralph Meeker is being sent to jail; its builders are the following criminals: Broderick Crawford, Lon Chaney Jr., Charles Bronson (read "Newspaper Muscle"!) and William Talman (read the newspaper "Detective"!). Honesty! You should know that, the early location shows what happens to the "unattainable" young man, responding to the last "voice". If you don't want to have that hangout, do not miss the opening events between "Iceman" and the boy (Peter Votrian doing well as a running asthmatic). <br /> <br /> *** The big house, U.S.A. (1955) Howard W. Koch ~ Broderick Crawford, Ralph Meeker, Reed Hadley
