Let me begin by saying that I fully agree with the basic concept of the film, that there is no possibility that there is no historical Jesus and Christianity. Since he said, this film makes a very bad job to prove that thesis. It makes a good argument - the gap between Jesus' theoretical life and the writing of the Gospel, filled only with Paul's writings, which does not show Jesus of historical - and then cannot persuade them. It provides a brief description of the information that is based on, and carefully ignores the arguments presented by Christian Communists. Mental deception, emotional abuse, and lack of great arguments are clear, and wonderful. The only Christians we hear from the film are the head of the old film film - who comes as a wise, intelligent person trying to tackle the twit and chip on his shoulder - and the various Christians have encountered the obvious in the parking lot. Sorry, but revealing the average Christians do not know much about their religion is not the true evidence of the deception of Christianity. You can also claim that Jay Leno has rejected Michael Dukakis in his Jay-Walking section. Interviews with experts can be interesting, but the film is filled with so much, let's be honest, the only film player who is happy. Within the first five minutes the film has been confused by Jerry Falwell and Charles Manson and the authors of the left-hand side with Davidians. And at the end, the film becomes itself a wise argument left, only an old Christian who was offended by people and places where he laments his childhood. True, maybe that movie would have been interesting, but it has been lost in the document about Jesus' history, and it is so personal thanks as to erase any mercy. This is Michael Moore's film without humor or acumen to make a film with Richard Dawkins's book without wit or rigor mind. Skip it.
