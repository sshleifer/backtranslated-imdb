This film is hilarious, not a good way. The fight is very serious, sometimes they will try to shock him by breaking some bones, and even this happens two or three times, certainly not enough to call it shockmovie. Gunfight means a hero can walk on the open field and 10 people shoot him with fibers, take a gun, start shooting and not hurt. The empty story, the man who rises up, lost his memory, begins to fight cos is what he does. Five years later memory returns, returns to blablabla. It's not worth your wallet, it's not worth your time unless you are drunk and tired.
