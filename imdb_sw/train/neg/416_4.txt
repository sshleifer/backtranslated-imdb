(some of the vendors) - if you can't know how it will end. Very good business, director like Paul Verhoeven and actors like Kevin Bacon and Elisabeth Shue, as well as very unknown season. Each column for a great movie was completed. Unfortunately these things were not even meaningful. The movie was very weekly, without stress and predictable. It is all about a group of scientists who found not visible. After the animal tests succeeded, Kevin Bacon decides to try himself. Once he is invisible, he changes completely, knowing the benefits of being invisible. From this to the kill there is a very narrow line. <br /> <br /> Sneaky person is a bad movie. Suffered by the disease that many new movies have: special effects. From the head of the challenge that can lead producers to a great psychological stimulation, Verhoeven destroys everything focusing on specific effects, without giving damages to the real value of the movie. I must admit, fx is amazing, maybe the best I have seen since Matrix, but that's not enough to make a good movie. That truth is the problem with the movie today. Like Verhoeven, most directors care only about incredible events - and no more. Far is very few, and maybe the Matrix is ​​the only movie that combines special effects of the wonderful and good plot. <br /> <br /> After Troopers Starship, Verhoeven breaks down again. Instead of a good film, HM is cr * p. There are only 2 reasons you can watch this film: 1. special effects 2. joke with Superman and Wonder Woman (I can't destroy this time for you ...) Everything. Let's say what I can remember. It is not completely selected. It should be, but not so. <br /> <br /> --- Also unpredictable. You know from the beginning who will die and who will live. <br /> <br /> --- Instead of focusing on the psychological part, Verhoeven cares only about the effects. <br /> <br /> - - Too many cliche. Of course a bad person rises a few times before dying. <br /> <br /> --- As in every low-down fear, the first rule is to allow different characters as much as possible. Every time there is one alone in the laboratory, the perfect victim of bacon. <br /> <br /> --- Most holes on the field. Example: At first, bacon should test his finger to enter the laboratory. After being invisible, how can he do it? <br /> <br /> --- Completed: quite awesome. After Shue cut the bacon on the head, Bacon falls down to the ground. Then Shue and Brolin leave quietly and slowly, without looking back. Is it normal? Then bacon rises, motivates them, "kills" again. And then Shue screams "I heard the blast" (what happened a few minutes ago), and they run in. What? Didn't hear the blast before? <br /> <br /> --- There is a place that you can see on browsers on top of executives. Come, Mr Verhoeven, I expected much more from you! That is about Hollow Sneaky. What was required to be a great movie turned into a scandal. Vote: 4 out of 10 (for special effects)
