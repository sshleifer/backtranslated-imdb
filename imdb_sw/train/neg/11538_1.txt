A truly horrible video that has left me disturbed for being forty minutes or so I could stand up. It is not the artists' fault, but the author / director, producers, financiers, etc., need to talk more. Maybe it thinks it's great. It is not. This crime and violence of violence, unlike the middle of Orange Clockwork, has nothing to say or increase the total awareness of humanity. Not Dogs, or, which I have seen compared. Instead he feels like something that Pete Walker can turn his hand, even saying that I probably had a little right with Pete Walker. <br /> <br /> Revenge is the desire of human power, but the Bedroom Window has more to say about the transfer and the male than this sad effort. I don't think it's particularly misogynistic, just very good in his description of certain details - blood running under the leg of injury to GA's foot, for example. It's not a challenge or a fight, although I am sure the filmmakers feel that they are "very scared", they are not very happy. <br /> <br /> Is this as high as we can? Is that why those involved wanted to make a film? (I wrote here the Latin words that translate as Oh Times! Oh custom! But the new look spell on the IMDb will not let me after I have been removed. So I had to remove the square fathers. IMDb planned.) > Where is the highest output? Good inspiration? When you watch the British film - the pleasure of Ealing or Boulting Brothers; Carol Reed's work with Graham Greene on the Falling Religion, Our Person in Havana or the Holy Person of the Third (film which has more to say about evil than a thousand Straightheads); Powell & Pressburger function; or if you want to talk about sex, abuse and male transfer look "Window Offense" Sidney Lumet, from the original play by John Hopkins, see "Tunes of Glory" for something worth doing, which has something to say. <br /> <br /> Unlike the previous, Straightheads are, alas, waste of hate hate.
