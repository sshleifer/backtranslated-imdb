Who is good! I have heard tons of mixed reviews for this ... but one to go to me for retired horror horror actually found it to be desperate. Someone was straight on the nose! This movie was done with fresh amateurs. They had to do one take, maybe two in each area, the movie appeared soooo rushed. Script was also poor .... they had attempts to be unique but failed. Unfortunately. "Get your meathooks away from me!" O man, I hate it when films try to do that. It happens all the time with comedies ... but, with a movie of fear and respondents below average ... the result is very amazing pathetic. All the verses and events were predictable. But what made me feel so negative toward this film was, again, acting efficiently. It was very bad. Apart from a young Asian man who made a booth. I thought he was good. <br /> <br /> The movie is about 5 foolish tourists who are on vacation in Asia. They live in the right place and fall into the hands of mafia sex / murder. It looks like a cool story. But looking at someone with a serious diarrhea problem may be more fun and intense. The only reason this is considered to be fear is because of the murder. There was no details to emphasize. <br /> <br /> I would like many other horrible fans died to get their blood drops. But unfortunately with the massive capital U, the movie was very awesome. I enjoyed breaking the leg and the effects of blood. Flabby tablets are also the same. Everything about this girl is screaming. This is the first aspect of Ryan Nicholson's first part, and for many parts he failed. No refusal has the feeling of a sense of humor and the taste of fear. I ask her next film is not recommended as another Flick of fear ... unless she tells us what it will be. Even after this desire I am willing to give Ryan another shot. From what I have seen, he is a true man, dedicated to that kind. Good luck sometimes, because this was bad news.
