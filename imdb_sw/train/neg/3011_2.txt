I was delighted to see this film, expecting the excursus to see about the beauty of art and nature, which has the kind of wisdom that is "Rivers and Water." However, not what I received. Instead, I find an uninpired film about how the human industry is bad for nature. Which is quite clear to demand an imbalance. The painter appears to argue about the beautiful features of his photographs and the "moral" responsibility that he tells the workers regularly photographs, alongside the periphery. And, of course, those pictures were not very interesting. And according to this "artist", the basic level is what does something good. <br /> <br /> In all cases, stupid film. For people who would like to feel better about their knowledge of the environment ... but not for anyone who would like to think about the issues of the issues.
