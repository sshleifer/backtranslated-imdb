Luckily I did not pay to see this movie. Also, I can't even reveal any providers because I liked WALKED OUT after forty minutes of the movie. It was bad. I laughed once, when Yahoo! Billboard fell on the guy, and the theme of the theme came. However, that was just because I thought it was interesting, but I realized that it was still the placement of another product. I love cartoons. I was looking around religiously. (though I missed the last part I heard that they show Dr. Claw and it's nothing more than a lobby, someone who speaks on the show page) Cartoon had Penny and Brain much more than the movie was, for that point. I hated to introduce one thing, reminding Robocop. Then Broderick looks at the whole view of the Auditor General. He is not nearly as painful as the cartoon was. Another fact is its gadgets actually working for sure I see, except for slick oil. He was also beaten by the "Wowsers" sound which was in the sound of excitement. I felt desperate that they killed the cartoon so badly. Everyone else felt that way too. We have 14-17 year old children to remember the fondly cartoon and we loved every minute of it. <br /> <br /> I entered the movie with an open mind, I know that they would be screwed with cartoon. I was amazed at how the movie was hit. It depended on vision to see, and stupid conversation for humor. Disney relies on pain and physical humor to push the children's movie together. The imposition of products is useless in this film, and shows. A sensible car is not good in losing wisdom. Gadgets seem nice, but they were very interesting. Cartoon was looking better. Silly secrets were decorated. In 40-45 minutes I looked at the movies, there was no one laugh heard, and they laughed at Dudley-Do-Right preview. This movie should not be looked at by people who want intelligence in their family's entertainment. I highly recommend "Iron Giant," which was sad, but very good. This film is a shadow for the whole family game .------------ 1
