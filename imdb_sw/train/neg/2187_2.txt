I bought this film on DVD to get the Secrets of Science Secret 3000. Although there is a plot, one story can follow, and a few executives who can act, nothing else. The movie was very boring, I firmly confirmed that I would never look again without Tom, Crow and Mike. As described above, however, it was much better than the film mentioned in the MST3K section before; Mitchell.
