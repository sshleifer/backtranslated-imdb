This is just set, the worst movies I saw. It is between 2+ hours, and the art of the box was completely lost. My friends and I rented it because we thought it was a poor person 300. You know, laugh and laugh. No. There is nothing amazing about this film, just the pain. Then, the movie will begin, and they speak different types of languages. We think, 'Oh it's just the beginning.' But no, from there the movies grow and it becomes more like a very interesting book that you had to read at a grade school, where nothing happens for hours, and the events of war are against 2 children fighting in the playground. Call the cinema details, and this film is located in the compactor of trash. This movie will lead to the world we see in Wall-E, which by way was a good movie.
