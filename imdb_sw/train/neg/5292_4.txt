I can't recommend this movie as a movie of the date. The half-autobiography of Gary Oldman's life of living in South East London's real estate is a brutal account, Beckettian's one of the Dante circles of hell, in fact. Its middle is Ray Winstone, who has done this kind of behavior before but yet. The film opens and ordered drinks on the bar of bars - that's all - and you are already filled with a sense of confusion, self-interest and the evil that he shows in many ways away during the movie. It's a masterclass of acting. Of course the callers and reluctants need a foil in the game such as this with Winstone equals Kathy Burke as his patient wife, who takes and eventually refuses her irresistible behavior. Charlie Creed-Miles can turn back as a child of anti-fibers in Billy though he should have asked himself sometimes what he gave himself. Gary Oldman leads around on administrators, adding claustrophobia of their flat council. 4/10
