In fact this film has one of the most amazing themes in history - up there with an impressive protection of Ed Wood's "cross" or "Glen or Glenda?" <br /> <br /> Lesson: playing grade. Park Avenue puts it; The Shemas are playing. Russians - who say very worried "Russian" and are very worried when they speak English - play in a restaurant where they work. If someone does not care about the bridge, one - - even though it is very cast - it is impossible to have a great interest in this amazing film. Loretta Young and Paul Lukas are welcome. (OK - Frank McHugh is an impossible writer - if Lukas is likely to Russian.) But all are beaten by a fetishistic script.
