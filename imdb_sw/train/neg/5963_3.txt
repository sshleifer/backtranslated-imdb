This movie begins with the practice of a witch doctor and his grandmother. His head is cut off and buried next to his body ... it looks like "Thing that does not die"? Well it's a little play like that, but once the body is connected to the head, all the fascinating and violent deaths are made by the movie is moving very slowly. I mean the movie is only 88 minutes long and I kept thinking "When will it come"? The characters in the movies are ignorant in many places and they are very similar to dying for being too stupid. The striker is also very bad if he is slowly moving and actually you wonder how he can do anything based on he fears gems. The only thing to enable you to look after the head is taken again is the fact that there are many boobs that are increasingly becoming lost. I still want to see a movie of fear, not a soft base of sex photography and as a horrible movie is a way to slow down through many pieces of slowly becoming even enjoyable. And do not read the back of the box as if it were the meat of zombies attacking the city, no ... just a small area where three or four Zombi attack the house and can be easily overturned not a matter in the movie all the time and their location is anything. So for the most part I say you should avoid this film unless you see it at an affordable price.
