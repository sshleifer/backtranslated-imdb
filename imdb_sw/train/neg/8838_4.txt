There is a similarity between Ray Lawrence's "Jindabyne" and his last movie "Lantana"? The body of death and its consequence to a life that has never been damaged. But when "Lantana" gave hope and a certain resolution, "Jindabyne" leaves everything unchanged in a way that will leave many unworthy people, perhaps even being deceived. The story of the story - after the discovery of the corpses of corpses in the distant river - depends on a short story by Raymond Carver. It was a feature in the 1993 collection of Robert Altman "Short Borders". Lawrence uses this theme for observations and demonstrations of relationships within the small Australian sub-community. The movie has ethical questions "Do you allow the discovery of corpses to destroy your good weekend?" and more for Australians "Would it be different if the dead person was a natural person?" Acting, especially by Gabriel Byrne and Laura Linney, is confirmed. And there are scientific things that have been reinforced by senseless music, not unlike "Picnic in Hanging Hanging". <br /> <br /> If all of this looks like a great movie - be ready to stop, speed is very slow and killings are shown at the beginning, thereby eliminating the hidden element. And so we are left with this life of desolation and end end.
