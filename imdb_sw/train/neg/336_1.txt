Why is it that when the star is approaching the sequence of stars, it destroys all good works by making a bad film? Burt Reynolds emerged, then began to make the Hal Needham car's awesome expulsion. Arnold Schwarzenegger became the most hot property in Hollywood, just inviting shy on himself and amazing Last Hero Hero. And here, slick Eddie Murphy takes away the records of Business Places and 48 hours with this flick of a "family" of wonder, which is awesome, of children and usually the misfire misfortune that the opportunity to see the great lakes of Charlotte Lewis in tight blouse is the most interesting feature of the entire film. The story is a fresh humdrum. It deals with the social worker Murphy, who has communicated with wonderful forms and told him that he is the Elect. Why is it chosen, I hear you ask. His task is to rescue the Tibetan boy and the mystical authority from the race of demons who want to dominate the world. As a great demon, the classy actor Charles Dance is very embarrassed to be in the film, but hey, I'm sure he was well paid for his talent gifts. In all Murphy films, this is very simple. I have read some reviews that show that it is good to see Murphy in the role of atypical, in non-type types of film, and when both are obviously really do not forgive the fact that the film - even atypical and non-formulaic may be - is a full load waste. <br /> <br />
