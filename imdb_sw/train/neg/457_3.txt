Indeed, I would like short cartoons, but I didn't like this. Typically, children would like. But again, I am no longer a child (though I still think it is small). <br /> <br /> I will not tell you anything about the story, because there is no simple story. What? How can the cartoon dragon was chosen by Oscar? Well ... I think it's because people in 30 years were more happy and not more than now. Now we live, everything has to happen quickly. Look at these movies today, and you will reach the same conclusion: we live in a society that does not allow men to be slow. That's a real shame. I would have lived in 30 years, because it seems so peaceful. But every time it has ups and downs it, I think ... <br /> <br /> Conclusion: if you like music (and frogs), you will need to see this cartoon. Otherwise, don't waste your time on it.
