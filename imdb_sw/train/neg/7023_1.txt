Okay, my dear and I paid a DVD and 30 minutes on the movie, we could exchange a lot of "ehhh, what this film is and most importantly, I care to know what is leaving and" looking at and deciding we also need drugs to keep us interested in "plot "or just finish the pain there and then look something else. We decided for the last. <br /> <br /> I loved "But I am a cheerleader" a lot, but Mango Kiss is very silly and surreal to my taste, sorry! I certainly prefer "D.E.B.S", "Better than Chocolate", "Fucking Åmål", "Goldfish Memory" and "Fire".
