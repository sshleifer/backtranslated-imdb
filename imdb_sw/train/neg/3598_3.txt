Do you know when you look at your collection of old films, video clips, and realize that there are some that you just saw once or twice, and you can't remember if it's worth the time it takes to see them? Alibi is / was one of these films; I got it, not long ago, and I decided to give a chance. I don't know if I am happy with my decision ... on the one hand, the film is real, very bad, on the other hand, now I've had another free tape ... yes, you get it. The plan is predictable and not originally original. Input is bad. Acting is bad, but that is not very good, as if it leads to two are the old opera's soap ... used. The characters are unwritten clichés. The film will also be able to clear the most convenient way of accessing (through the film): court events. Even those who do not get the same feeling or against any cardboard characters. The film does not have the exact features of redemption ... even the conversation is bad. The thing is, it is very full of clichés that drives. And that's the one thing that raises up here on a rating of 1/10: (if so without giving birth) comic aid of many clichés and displays. I wasn't very much on the film, but almost every time I looked at the screen, there was something to laugh. Remember the last one: I thought to use the line "Tori Spelling can't act" as a single summary of the line, but I think everyone knows it, so I have decided for now, I see if it's more information. All in all, the worst films, but it's not worse if you don't have anything else to do and if it's on TV. Good for a few laughs, if you can stay that way. 3/10
