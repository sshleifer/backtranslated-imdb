The Golden Era of the Disney cartoons died at the end of 90 years. It's about Huey, aged, Dewey and Louie when they are bothering their uncle Donald and speaking in the hip-hop language and fully dressed in DuckTales. I like the younger brothers from DuckTales. There are people in Duckburg and ducks are the only animals living in Duckburg. No reference to Scrooge McDuck. Stories are repeating, the plot is boring but animation is good. If you want more humor slapstick, I recommend this. If you want to view the best Disney look "Darkwing Duck" or "DuckTales".
