Movie never cannot fail to watch. And to tell them directly, it doesn't have anything to show either, except maybe a section of sexy Alicia Silverstone in a non-sexy nerdy character in revealing completely sexy clothes. Stories are very easy to follow or nothing to follow - you can see in any way. There is no doubt, a small step, an uncomfortable conversation, inappropriate feelings, interesting places and acting very much. Kevin Dillon is worthless. Silverstone ... well, I had no more attention on his acting, confess. However, as I said earlier, if someone has nothing to do except watching the film, this will not seem too bad. 4/10
