Annie Potts is the only show in this very inappropriate film. Mark Hamill has a boy who is really angry that someone stole Corvette he and his classmates turned into a fire (possibly a very bad car that appears to be on the film), and that Las Vegas and Annie will track down an evil professional who has been robbed of his pride and pleasure . I would have been taking my eyes off after looking at this if it was not fun to watch Annie Potts in the very early role, and also bad for the Hamill that didn't take several lessons of acting from her. Bonny Bonny also makes goofy cameo.
