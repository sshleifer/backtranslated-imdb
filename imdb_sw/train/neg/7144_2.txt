It was almost worthy to go through all this "bad" movie "just" to know only that I can never get anything wrong as this again. Working - 0, script - 0, anti-events - 0, male leader - 0 (cheddar bob from eight miles as a warrior suave warrior who gets a girl), Nadia Bjorlin - 10 (She's nice and not awesome executive) . These are the criteria I used on average for two. I have lost count but I believe that ever movie clich√©, ever, is in this movie. When the driver who claims to have killed his father for a miracle shows at the end of the race against him, from anywhere he stopped the original statement. Plus she just shows without reason. He has never been named before. I don't know what else to say here. Just look when it comes out of the TV in a few years. At least some of these ways will be amended by advertising.
