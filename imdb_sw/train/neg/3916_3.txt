We all know the movie does not obey the right to the book, but this is unique. Key characters were cut, Blanca and Alba were essentially locked in the same behavior, small parts and great elements of the main plot removed. Clairvoyance Clara was very bad, and made her seem like a very odd one than I know in the book. In the book we learn more about his power and the great impact he has on many people, which was also an important element in family life. In the movie she was no more than a particular woman. The relationship between Esteban and Pedro Tercero (Tercero-third-, by way, is a son and so comes after Segundo-second) and his relationship with that between Esteban and his grandson from Pancha Garc√≠a (not a child, who also made a note ) is chopped by half and its importance has decreased. One of the basic things about the book that the entire film has been deleted: this is called "House of the Spirit." Where are the houses? The story of 3-4 generations of family should focus on "a great house on the corner," the row was often explained in the novel. The primary house for the story, but the movie without the right enters it into something behind. If I have never read a book before, I have never thought that sappy that, an unknown movie could focus on that rich and entertaining novel.
