When I have never been a fan of the original Scooby-Doo (because of its good production standards), it looks like Shakespeare compared to this crap that brought us to Hanna-Barbera! Of course, Scrappy-Doo is on a sad and very bad habit made for children (and this includes Teletubbies with Tommy Tapeworm). What sharp idea was to create some kind of short mutant dog and enable them to chat and then saddle the Scooby-Doo characters? Anyone deserves to die or watch this show (I think death is an option). The bottom thing is that the little dog is just unfunny, annoying and grates on nerves - and this is just in BETTER events! After many years, it would be better to finish just a franchise than to create this mess! I can see why in the live film Scooby-Doo movie performed villain Scrappy-Doo - since usually everyone hates it!
