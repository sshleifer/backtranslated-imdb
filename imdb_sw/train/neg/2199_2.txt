I found the "Lost Disappointment" at the New York Film Festival and Video and I think I had a great hope for this film. Unfortunately, this is another phone number of Visual FX. The story is very good. Bad lighting and camera function, as well as under great editing and all music makes the film appear and low quality. <br /> <br /> What! It is very true to ask that the FX short stories have the best stories and have other technical production to be equal to FX! You can not just leave with FX cool in short, it has been 5 years since "405" made great stripes. At least that quickly, cool and was even a little funny! Nothing can say about the "Lost Pain."
