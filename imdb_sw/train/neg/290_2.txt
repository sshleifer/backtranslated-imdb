Killer movies of tomatoes have this kind of humor - you can love it or hate it. I personally like it, but in this four-story movie has gone. Tomatoes are not the same, jokes are lame, even artists are not funny. Because that's the only thing this kind of movie should be - funny. So now following the program made to laugh, it is offensive. In fact they should not make the fourth part of the trilogy of Killer Killer.
