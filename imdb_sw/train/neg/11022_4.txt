Through him, Mr. Foe (earlier, and more suitable, his name Hallam Foe? I can't see the title of his head as "sir"), is a tax for good acting. Both Jamie Bell, like Hallam, voyeur / creep, and Sophia Myles, like Kate, her boyfriend's kinky in sex with fantasy romance, are lobby. The problem comes when you try to connect their roles to whatever happens in real life. A young man who surveys the details of people's lives how Hallam can be beaten with a donkey. And a woman in Kate's situation would be beaten and scared - maybe she would call the police. These things are not, however, happening in the film. The poor mother of Hallam is dead and her father is married to a woman who has had something. Hallam, of course, hates his mother and allows her to know. He has sex with her. Kate is a kind of an unemployed person who puts Hallam in the work of cleaning dishes and playing sex games. He looks like his mother to be born. All are approaching with joy and Hallam "solving" his "issues". Forty years ago, playing and carefully watching the movie, Who Fear of Virginia Woolf, had the same hope and hope, and the characters became wise and better after burst. Stress is, it doesn't work that way every time, especially when nobody cares. In Virginia Woolf, the end is seen as a result of emotional revelation. In Mr. Foe, emotional revelation does not really do.
