I waited for this movie to play in anticipation. Thinking it will be displayed correctly as a film, "Christmas Box" according to the book of Richard Paul Evans. I sent many emails to friends and family to ask you to look at this show, hoping to better understand a small amount of my "new" life. After seeing this film I was very disappointed. As a mother who lost her only child in November 2003 and really know the pain, I was hoping that this film would give light to parents who “think” understand the grief that the parent goes through who has lost the baby. This movie was a very thin movie and Diane Keaton's heart was hit by the parents who buried the child. It was not quite true from the beginning to stop. I had a few calls after the film, each called the same phone, "That was far from the mark and it made it seem that for a short while riding the road and listening to songs on radio and life is back". A herd of cows! It is clear that the director and Keaton have never lost a child because they will not have EVER made the film so far away. I think that's Hollywood.
