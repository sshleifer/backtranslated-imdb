(First and foremost, my bad English grammar) Of course the movie star Jessica Simpson may include such a heavy loads like this. US / "Norwegian". Even Wikipedia is very accurate during the truth about this country. So I submit my review to my confusion: - The country is called Norway, nor Norway. - "Da" is Russian, not norwegian. The Norwegian kings do not use these black cords and the white and necked paper as the protestant church is very large - It really we have natural nature of ordinary people (which we only spend twice a year) but the dress in this movie is like a dress German. -HAK You can understand what is called "norwegian" in this film. Jessica did not have any feeling. The lovers made "Norwegian priests" <br /> <br /> The only thing I know is the Norwegian flag (and viking caps, but that is a stereotypic which people think about Norway - vikings !: Oosh) <br /> <br /> Well .. I think people who made this film never read these comments. but at least I have deleted some of the items and rejected some of that confusion. I am proud of my country and would like if the American people were under stereotypic and more accurate when they talk about this country. <br /> <br /> That was all. ; p
