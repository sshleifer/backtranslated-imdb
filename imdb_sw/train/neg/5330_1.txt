Some here have answered that this is the movie of WORST Elvis that has ever been done. Well, they're just the right part. For me, this is the MOVIE OF WORK IN PERIOD! I have never seen anything caused, by pride, and evil, and against human nature as this film. The real embarrassment for the Motion Picture Industry, this is not so bad, it's good. There is no fun of the girl being here as in some other bad Elvis movies like Clambake. This perverts to stay in a painful way. Clean waste. Americans Americans should sue for their poor clich√©d and adequate treatment here. Actually, maybe ALL Human beings should sue for crime and leave this film makes it kind of like 0 Stars the whole, for weight. Bridge: F
