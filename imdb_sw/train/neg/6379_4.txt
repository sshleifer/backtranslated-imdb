And the film called "Gayniggers from Outdoor websites" how would you fail? Just throw it to some of the top discrimination to the characters, use the Village People as the main suppliers to the voice, and throw to tons of gay-gags. Plot is not recommended. Unfortunately, this film has nothing to do with each urine loses a spot. All actors seem the same away from the German gaynigger, one or two functions of joke, others fail. The head made me laugh and was prepared to laugh even more about the film. My expectations were very high.
