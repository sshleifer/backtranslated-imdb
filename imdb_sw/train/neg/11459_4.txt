Whale hunters pick up an unsuitable whale. The whales of the whales of the whales catch a woman with her string on her tail. The whale's partner sees the whole thing including when the unborn child grows and gets into the deck. 'Captain Nolan' (Richard Harris) can say that the older man is mad by looking at him as saying, "Get out of town before the high wave." This retaliation story has the presence of Harris and the beauty of Bo, but not more. This was the first Bo 'released' film, although his first job career was four years ago and 'Love Time' released in 1981 as 'Fantasies' (directed by John Derek). Today, the date of this review (November 20), is the birth of Bo Derek. I hope Bo has a 'whale' of a good time ..... get ..... whale? ..... hee-hee.
