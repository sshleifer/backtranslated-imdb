This movie (not a movie - easily restored on affordable cameras) can be one of the biggest movie bombs in history. Beware: The installation announces flick as an erotic search of sexual abuse. The movie is not an observation of anything, and it is not more attractive than looking at one's own tablets. Script is useless and mixed, and all elements of the plot serve as a segway between sexual events. However, even sexual incidents are lame blind. Except for the first, they are about three seconds long (then again, maybe my version was cut) and it was damaged. If you are looking for a good film, you don't want this. If you are looking for an interesting sex flick, you don't want this. Whatever your life goals, desires, or attitudes, you don't want to watch this film. How they found Rosanna Arquette, Natashia Kinski, and Ed Begly doing this hurtful act is very amazing.
