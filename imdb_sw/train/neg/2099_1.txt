WARNING: SPOILERS CHEMICAL (Not that you should care. Also, comfortably with a hat.) That's bad but stable set. We know that space travel is a dangerous business. There is a complicated system with high potential effects, radiation, symptoms related to problems, and unexpected events should occur in many unknown environments. They knew things could go wrong. In fact, things went wrong. It is called learning. In fact, Appollo 11 was not safe for today's standards and there was a strong political pressure, but the overall performance of technology in the mission was remarkable. <br /> <br /> Error / structured comments didn't look up: <br /> <br /> 1) Nixon prepared a speech if something didn't go. Similar duh. That's what I did. It was the peak of the propaganda war, after all. NASA offers green light despite the fact that Appollo 11 will blow. (This is the "only" clear, though.) Yes, that's why they leave people and the authors of the hour in real time. <br /> 3) Ejection of capsule cannot work. As it worked during the chimp was in it. Who was healed? It was the launch of the test and the rocket exploded, the capsule rushed off and became a parachute. There's a video of it, maybe you can find it on youtube or at least make it somewhere. One person interviewed says the explosion would remove the right part of Florida. I can only think it meant as a hyperbole, because if not, I just feel how she can get it wrong. 5) This technology was normal compared to today's standards. In fact, software and natural resources are used even today, because they should not fall. It is even worse for the airplane, because their computers should be built with the corresponding elements that are not caused by radiation. (And the trick itself should be able to drive in any way, so the complex operating system like B2 cannot do.) What is the fact that they were using "TV screens" instead of "computer screens"? It's the same damn technology. In fact, TV monitors were produced with much greater clarity. "If the object was not part of the rocket, it could be just one thing." We see where this goes. Apart from the fact that the information is correct, who says it was not part of the rocket? Of course the respondent clarifies that if something goes wrong and you don't know what it is, it is by definition something of Flying is unknown. The top voice with some misquotes makes it seem like the hair of the rock rays was actually its center. Which would make it smaller than a suit of space. <br /> 8) Neil Armstrong's closest death during exercise is a picture I can understand; I haven't seen it before. As I said, any piece of open technology can go against it, especially if it hasn't been tested enough because of that, you know, unusual. <br /> <br /> 9) The different trajectory of land decline (due to errors in the balance of the Moon) had no risk of life at any time. They were "fifteen seconds of fat left", which in fact, "fifteen seconds of fossil fuels before losing messages and returning to the command module." <br /> <br /> 10 "Bad" series of events "often leads to tragedy. I don't know how to put it easy. This, however, is a prime example of the rhetoric used. A short chain of one of the astronauts walk and around without a fun as a good child, followed by a high-sounding tell us that the reason for this strange behavior “can now be revealed”. br>> <br /> 12) It has been said that during re-entry, all communications were lost. This is quite common and was known at the time if it is impossible to run with modern technology. so. <br /> 13) There was no shuttle lost in space itself, while the high voice offers this “truth” as evidence that Appollo 11 was a bunch of decoration. reload again, kw a respectively. In any case, comparing the shuttles to Saturn missiles are somehow ... well, okay, it's just stupid. Even ignoring it, the successful transmission message seems to have no interest in the audience. <br /> <br /> 14) Do you? Hell faces UFO? Even in the film environment, it is not recommended. Unless you think it was designed for recreational purposes, targeting a special audience (which seems to include people who do not know the history, science, or rhetorics). <br /> <br /> Even the movie action is somewhat clear. Words to catch as "covered until now", "revealed to the public for the first time", comes, but the film does not put any mistake or offer a lesson or anything, which can be expected for so emotionally film. In a good psychological culture, there are many interviews and recording pieces that often come from the environment or people we know nothing except "NASA scientist". Wow, therefore travelers were very afraid before the effort? Fancy that. What? This relates to the movie action again? Oh, something that shows. Overall, in addition to being voluntary or accurate, it's not even good entertainment. And I believe, I am a boy who enjoys his documents; This film is not interesting, magic, ordinary, not something.
