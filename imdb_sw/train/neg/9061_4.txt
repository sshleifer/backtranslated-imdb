What can you say about this movie? It was not terrible, but it was not good! Two days earlier I was looking at Lillies and that was one of the best Gay films I ever saw. So this was not a good time to look at Gaya's usual flick. <br /> <br /> The story was silent and acting was the same. It wasn't bad enough to extinguish, but it had a bad time with some terrible. It was not very good cast either. <br /> <br /> I would like to recommend this movie? No you would be wasting your time and money. I don't understand why movies like these are being done and who gives them money. Spend your time Watching the Arc of Noah on Paint instead. I think this is where this movie was trying to go but has never been there.
