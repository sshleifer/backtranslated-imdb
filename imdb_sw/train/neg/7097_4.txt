This film has a low class B class price for all its events, effects etc. if you make you think they used the 80% budget on Connery. It's like looking at the elements of the Wing Commander after Star Wars (completely without content) <br /> <br /> Stories can be explained in one word: FLAT. And oh my god I can remember the villain so uninteresting since long ago. We are not given any reason to be bad (the destruction of the birth, we lead to thinking: nor any trust or evil of his evil. <br /> <br /> If you're out for Connery instead go to lease 'Hunting Forrester'.
