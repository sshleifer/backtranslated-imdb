On the islands of the fiji, the greedy owner and the dealer of the Primal Resort of Valalola invites investors and visitors to the opening of his compound including hotels and zoo which is aimed at finding partners for its innovation. When a university band of thieves puts the virus in the security system involved in hunting the hunter, many zoo attractions? sabretoothes from the original pre-DNA found on artifacts? escape, kill forces and guards for pleasure. The worst and cheap "Attack of Sabretooth" is one of the worst movies I've seen recently. The characters are bad and not funny or beautiful and the story is awesome Park Jurassik abolition and the bad collection of clich√©s. Basically the line and all situations are poor and stupid, but the winner is when the guards explains that sabretoothes are bulimic and like kill with pleasure. My vote is three. Title (Brazil): "O Ataque do Dente de Saber" ("Attack of Sabretooth")
