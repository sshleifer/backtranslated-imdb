I have seen how all other views of this film say how "good" and "entertainment" are. These people need to get out of the house often. I do not know why they have shillings for that piece of water, non-brain. Pat Boone doesn't have any talent to work, and its lack is not just for that of his co-star Pamela Austin, an old model (however one reason to overcome the misleading practice of giving unsuspecting examples about people who are uncertain walking, evil behavior that unfortunately continues until today). A good helper (Terry-Thomas, Edward Everett Hortyon, among others) strives to have a different sense of this, but for free. I found that two directors participated in loans, although "credit" is not a word I can use (no "director"). For "good entertainment," there are many types of existing movies without disturbing your loved ones by forcing to stay this way. Get one of these films, and this fly.
