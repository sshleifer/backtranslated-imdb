This film is a great Yawn that shows that Americans don't have a farce hangout. Even when it's written to them! The original film "Hodet on Vannet" is an amazing comedy of error which I would like to rate 8/10. Not only about the interpretation of language, but some of the strangest chain of events have been completely broken, stealing an original gray gray film and changing it into a "cheap" fashion model.
