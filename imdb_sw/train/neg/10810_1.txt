There is only one thing I need to say about this movie - a place where Shaq is in the music number and Francis Capra's character about wanting to become a genie; never see this film. The story is bad, acting is awesome (c'mon, it's Shaq!) And I'd like to see Capra in Free Willy (similar to awesome) twice before seeing this movie.
