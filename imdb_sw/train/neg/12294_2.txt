I watched this film correctly. It was done in an old hotel that a friend owns a stock. The plan was predictable, acting was the best mediorcre, all the events were outside, not really terrible. <br /> <br /> I don't remember a lot of that plot, and I think that's because it didn't have a lot of one to remember. They did not even use the hotel most likely ... The beaches are amazing and the hotel is on the beach. With a low tide, you can walk around 1/4 miles into the sea, which is actually seeing the first sight in the morning or late at night when the wind blows through the cracks. The best way to see this movie is in your hand at your fingertips so that you can go through the action (and I use this exciting time) to stop during the beauty of the environment!
