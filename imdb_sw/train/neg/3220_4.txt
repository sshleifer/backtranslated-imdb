What I hate when the film falls completely close to the end, having already invested an hour in it. and that's what happened with this film. I was surprised by its actors and the fact that malamud wrote his story of the source. I haven't gone to read the story but I can't imagine that it ends like this last film. Unfortunately I didn't pay good money to see or rent because my library had it. ohhhh lost with a very good statement (especially a woman was very perfect) but a place like a Jew? !!! now that was beautiful. I have no research in his decision but played if the director lost his marbles or died 3/4 of the way through the film. Before that step, the story and characters were going on, there were several points of good conspiracy and did not have much time. but the last hour of two hours - if that is not a very strong, insignificant sign that I have seen, I don't know what it is. I hate only when someone's faith is destroyed like that; it feels like an act of violence.
