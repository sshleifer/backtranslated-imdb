I had great hope for this film, for it has Charlton Heston and Jack Palance. But these hopes occurred in the world for the first 20 minutes or so. Palance was ridiculous. Even the beauty of Heston or the beauty of Annabel Schofield (or short-screens) can save this film. Some of the effects of space were very good, but others were cheesy. The plan was good. Even the sci-fi fans should fly this. Grade F
