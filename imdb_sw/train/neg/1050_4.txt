Nathan Detroit runs illegally craps to the rollers over NYC, but the temperature is high and can not find a safe place. He loves the long-term Sky Masterson gambling that Sky can not make the first member, Sarah Brown, going out to eat with him. Sky takes the challenge, but all men have a certain surprise in the shop? This is one of those 50 years of the most expensive MGM music in splashy colors, with large sets, bright music, greater roles than life and identical displays; Broadway photography with great screens if you like the kind of thing, which I don't. My main problem with these movies is just music. I love all kinds of music, from Albinon to ZZ Top, but Broadway show tunes in swing time and never-end pah-pah-tah-dah trumpet comes to the end of each fourth bar is not my cup of tea. This was written by Frank Loesser's team, Mankiewicz, Jo Swerling and Abe Burrows (according to several legends of Damon Runyon), and when the plot is quite possible, they are weak. The two numbers of Blaine for instance are similar, are not needed, do not go ahead with the drawings and drawings on the ears (and are too bad if that makes you uncomfortable). There are only two unforgettable songs, lucky being a woman (singing with Brando, not Sinatra as you can expect) and sitting down, you are a Rockin 'Boat (with the effectiveness of Kaye) but you have to stay for two hours to get them. The movie card of the movie is a little Brando to provide a good performance, set back; she also sings well and even a little dance, and it's the same as the simmons interesting always. The sequence where two of them run for Havana for the night is an honorable welcome from the noise, garden and the murder of Noo Yawk. Music fans can dig this, but in my opinion the music you should do something more than just a film show.
