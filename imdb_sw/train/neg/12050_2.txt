I was reading a few reviews of this film, and I was really surprised how anything was horrible. Installed as a cross between the stories related to AIDS and some kind of "Spirit" / "Blithe Spirit" story, this film can not always make sense on what it wants to be. Simon and Mark are a gay couple who have a "open" relationship - Simon may have unintended sex (though safe) on his side when he wants to. Mark is HIV + and she and Simon don't seem to have sex again. When Mark dies, Simon - who has made a habit of restraining his emotions after being rejected years ago by his father - tries to erase his memory and continue to be a student. Not that his behavior before Mark's death was very different. But Mark returns to the spiritual form and exposes his various efforts, when he finds Simon opening and accepting his true feelings. Unfortunately, Simon is SOB as a selfish, it is impossible to listen to him with compassion for many films. While it should be more compassionate, it is too late to keep. Mark, on the other hand, follows in the footsteps of Demi Moore from "Ghost," to the very right in the cinema. <br /> <br /> There is a wonderful change in the tone after Mark's return. Suddenly we get an attempt to ignore the humor, the TV show "It's mentioned." But that doesn't last long. Once Simon's emotional health is facing, something is increasingly becoming a wick, as well as an amateurish effort to enter your heart. At the end, with the golden-star-gold boy leading Mark's tears to heaven when Simon's sad, sad, shocking waves are very interesting, because because they are not surprising.
