The first mistake you make in naming the film is to use the "dead dead" without having a real zombie budget FX. Indeed, this was a budget under the zombie flick - the lowest budget. I thought it was a school film project. Actors of amateur and amateur effects. It was not too bad to focus on the above, and presented a spectacular twist for zombie types. If you get "R" for abuse, you can also give us good shots for children affected. Women were very little used in this film that could almost be classified as "gay interests." <br /> <br /> And, I'm out of Oakland. There was a lot of shot and no fighters in front!
