Mind, my friends and I saw the movie from the title of the alone. It's good, though it's obvious in plot and direction - you know where the movie goes into the first five minutes. My main encounter with the plot is that while it remains consistent, it does not explain many things behind the characters. The father of alcohol, a strong mother, a sister who encouraged ... that is a bad family, but apart from regular mention from a sister, there is no resolution. I was also confused about the area and the bottle ... it seemed to be good. <br /> <br /> Writing is a secondary concern ... children were not the worst actors, but their left script was very desirable. Unfortunately, what could be a film of good niche stimulated by the same effect, blah special, scripting and clear pieces.
