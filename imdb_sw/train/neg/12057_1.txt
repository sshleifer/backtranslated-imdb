Charles Bronson continued to decline for 80 years and what could be his worst film for ten years, if not forever. In it he plays a detective who goes to a good track to watch a pimp who has captured a Asian girl and now buys him for a top striker. It is an embarrassing attempt in action and is most likely to be caused by an ever-made movie. Many people think of the death sequels of Bronson movies. Death Deaths were not big movies but they were often done efficiently and were very visible. Kinjite however is a very excited excitement that is taken by racism and childbirth. In fact it is an effective film and all has been made worse by the fact that it tries to preach the ideas of "Law and Justice" which has fallen so hard to say anything. Certainly the movie begins with less interrupted sex with Bronson then for the second time asking for pedophile and dildo. The Chicago Theater I watched this just hit by the worst of this area, just decreased by the humor of the pimp asking the girl in this film. It has no more meaning than to use and in fact the film is not well written so that it can increase the level of exploitation and give something that works. Bronson looks more at things but to clear this this is very bad to save. I want to explain that I think Charles Bronson is the most cool actor at all but this effort is ultimately worse. The process of action is poor too. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * out of 4 (Awful)
