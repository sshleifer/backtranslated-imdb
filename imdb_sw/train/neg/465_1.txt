When I was in a movie the other day, I used Blonde and Blonder, but something about it seemed like it could be a good movie. Who knows? I mean, I'm sure many people have bribed with Romy and Michelle before they see it, Blonde and Blonder can be just another hidden treasure adopted. But when I started to look at it: Executive producer Pamela Anderson, wow, I knew I was in a terrible thing. Not only, but all that appeared to be on fire: Pam Anderson and Denise Richards, not to prosecute them, but they were not quite old and they play the roles that I think were more for women who are supposed to be in their 20s, not 40 years. that was so bad and sad. <br /> <br /> Dee and Dawn are your most stupid stupid blonde, they don't have when it comes to what's going on in the world, it's just really sad. But when the girls are lost to murder, your fighters are in their stories and they actually call elite girls from "ignorance they are happy" perspectives. They are set up to make a "hit" for the guy, and they think they just go to "show him a good time", but the actual murder is ticked and wants the case to kill the girls. <Br /> <br /> Denise and Pam are very focused on the screen and almost as they read the script one day before. I know that this was supposed to be a comedy of stupid, but it was more stupid, it went on obnoxious and it was just necessary. I would recommend this? Not in millions of years, girls are only this time trying to maintain their status as "sex kittens", it is more than a faint sign of Blonde and Blonder is a great blonde BOMBshell. 1/10 /
