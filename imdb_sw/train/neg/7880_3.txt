Livestock Farm (1954) had learned very well about the dangers of violence. How good good can be changed and corrupted by those who do not know or rule with a fist with an empty head. Unfortunately this film does not show any of these. Something that has been shown is a piece of propaganda and a lot of finger moving and pointing. Animation and patterns were good to focus on the budget and time but the very essence of George Orwell's novel is very missing. If you are one of those who want to see how to solve a novel or are interested in seeing the state of this innovative accident and by all means look. I found that this is a small amount. Only one person's opinion however. <br /> <br /> Remake is a summary below but not to the extent.
