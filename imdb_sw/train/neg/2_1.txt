I saw the comments of the capsule said "good acting." In my opinion, these are two practitioners who offer bad displays, and for zero chemistry to each other, for a good director at all his efforts at all times. Robert De Niro must be careful and more knowledgeable at all times. Jane Fonda's performance causes concern about the map because she is not able to handle this behavior, especially because the character is well written. Molasses-like would be a quick player for this exciting pacing. Although the film's intention is to be the story of lifting to overcome reading and writing, the look is "true". I give 1 out of 10, one of the 20 worst movies for its budget level that I have ever seen.
