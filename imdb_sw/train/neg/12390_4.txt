Having seen a great version of this movie on television years ago, I was determined to see the unapproved version. I was surprised that it was more reliable and well done than I remembered, but one thing had happened. I think other spies have also mentioned this, that is, what is the nature and inspiration of Chris Sarandon's behavior? Did he lay the other victims before? What? She is a completely psychotic or "average" sociopath? How did he expect to leave his attack on a younger sister? What? This behavior is widely believed, or is it just a matter of history more important? It seems almost simultaneously to be an unreliable trustworthy character, as well as things to hold a teaching work that makes him contact with young, affected girls. This seems to be a major complaint of the general audience. It has nothing to do with its performance, which is exciting. The movie takes a bad place between abuse and half-effective treatment of the subject, without completely adapting to any mode. It's not a very bad movie made, but it's not all good, either.
