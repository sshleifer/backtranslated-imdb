"John Hughes's son wrote a high school game! Wow!" I thought as I looked at the flick details here on IMDb, at the end of Saturday night, when I found myself looking at opening loans on BBC2. I've finished watching, and sadly it was coming down there. Of course you can't destroy this poor film, but I will remove the vendors out of this opinion ... <br /> <br /> There is a very good style on very little substances: unfortunately the style has never been properly installed in eight years since its release . For this substance, the film tries to look at the situation in the community through the microcosm of school life; but under the shiny veneer, a meaningful or meaningful argument fails to make it. Traders have built in infant strokes, and fall into the type of common badness of the author's father tried to interview in the Breakfast Food Club. Kyle Cooper's director is doing a good job of keeping speed (perhaps a little relying on information settings, which comes to be a powerful tool, but at least pushes the story together), but his efforts are not enough to prevent poor script with amazing surprises (how anyone is needed on the side of 'Maddox', when Blake Shields gurns with the light of its way through part, I just can't understand), not to mention many gaping holes of the plot (I'm for a creative license). , but when the "bad guys" know the identity of "good boys" making their lives trouble, but they can not act in any way to stop them, you need to ask why this script did not make another draft again before the production - made Dad even read?) I am sure the small audience can get pleasure from this film (and all the power to them), but it's better to connect to Hughes Sr. high school results. And if the idea of ​​school rebellion is what y appeal, the classic 1968 "If ..." is the most satisfactory inquiry of the subject.
