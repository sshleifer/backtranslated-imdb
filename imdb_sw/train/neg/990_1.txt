Don't waste your time or money on this film. My friend was lost because he thought it was another movie called Shortness (spinning on other travelers who enter the cave). so, we decided to look at anyways to think it can't be bad. It was. I can't believe that this film was released and made to the public. It was terrible it was almost like an accident scene where you want to look away but you can't just do it yourself. I really feel emotionally. It was a low-budget movie which a college girl gets attacked by a boy who is engaged in sexually transmitted sex. And really not good. I went to hate a woman's opponent for almost unhealthy. Welcome. All in all, the bad movie that was definitely rated NC-17 because. Don't waste your money. And don't let your children look at it.
