Is this a movie ??? What is this Indians trying to show? I think this is one more effort from the director of the disease to stop the Pakistani soldiers and in fact the country .... but what we in Pakistan know that we are always in front of India in every part of our lives ... not only in arms weapons. This is the worst thing that happened as the early Border 1997. The director and the author tried to overcome the shame of the defeat at Kargil and Pakistani armed forces, by creating such films. br /> <br /> One thing is very clear ... At any time there will be a meeting between Pakistan and India .... we will win .... !!! So Mr. Dutta try to make good performances instead of Nonsense movies like this
