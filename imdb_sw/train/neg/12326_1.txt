The woman (Sylvia Kristel) cheats a 15-year-old boy (Eric Brown). They are having sex ... but they are all tied to a stupid plot or something. Easily one of the most difficult sex comedies ever. Does anyone know that this film makes light of child abuse? I think it's okay because it is a boy boy - if we had one who misled a little girl would be (in fact) becoming angry. I'm sorry, but having that thing for a boy doesn't forgive. It's still sick. I realize Brown was old (he was true 18 this time it was done) but he is 15. I find it a problem that some people get this. Plot next to the action of sucks (Kristel is good - but it can't do, Brown is one of the worst actors who I have ever seen) and the weaknesses often get boring and don't care. I saw this shade on the playground back in 1981. I was 19 years old and my 14-year-old cousin (who could easily pass 18). He wanted to see it - I didn't have it but I decided what it heard? We entered and bought a ticket for three young boys who were obviously down. My brother thought it was boring and three other children left half through! I would do this clear - three TEENAGE BOYS left movie with tons of feminine female! That should give you an idea of ​​how bad this is. I wonder this is provided. A 1 all the way.
