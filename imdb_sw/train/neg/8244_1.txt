I think this movie should be awesome. But the only way that is really awesome is how horrible badly made ... and it's just. It's an hour and a half hour of suffering. Even more for the viewer than for the characters in the film (five girls) It is true that the main characters get their bloody piece in a bad way, which is quite good, for it is a panic-movie. And I (usually) like awesome movies. I have no problem with violence in these types of movies for se. However, all the violence in this film does not last. It's not a festival except that it's very bad. So it is even cracked and boring, and very quickly. The worst thing (if above was not bad for) about this film is that they have tried a copy of Blair Whitch Project, by photographing with cheap hand phones. But (again, this too) serves the end. In "Blair Which", certainly enough, there is an explanation, that is, a camera looking at the witch of blair. In this film, there is no more explanation than: "Hey we wanted this to see like Blair Whitch !!" Sound in the movie is also something to get sad about. Girls shout loudly that they often can't do what they say. Also, no effort was made to do anything better, this wise or other wise. Before, finally, there is a voice sound, which is as bad as it is, and it varies from low-euro-house prices to a hard rocky rock .... My instructions: Don't look at this under any situation.
