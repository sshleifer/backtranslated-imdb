Fragmentaric movie about several people in Austria during heat. This type of film has been done many times, and most of all, better. Stories have nothing to do with each other, except the last finale: 'people are cruel'. A bad animal, unhappy people with a long-lasting film without realizing it ... Ultra-reality? Impossible ... Boring? Certainly. Even Franzisca Weiss very good can save this! 3/10
