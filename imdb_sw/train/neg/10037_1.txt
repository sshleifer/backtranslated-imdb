I never thought of the film's film Yashraj would stand in such a way! Film has a non-fiction story that is not worth any interest. Saif has done more. Kareena has improved her figure, but not a good actress. Akshay is good. Anil is also good. I can say the role was not good. They wondered if it should be a "comedy" part of the movie. Because the previous films had featured Yashraj films should do this kind of garbage? It has many good film history. Overall, I was completely lost with movies.
