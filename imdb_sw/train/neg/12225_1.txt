My personal vision of hell is locked in a room without the ability to close my eyes or block my ears and have this film for ever playing in everything in the room. The whole idea that Streisand has a boy / man just begins to contemplate the face of how stupid this film is. The most important thing about watching any film is the concept of "suspension for the purpose of unbelief". . . it is impossible to do this in this film.
