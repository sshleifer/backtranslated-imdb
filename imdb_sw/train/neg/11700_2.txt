I was looking at this film, but after watching it I was desperate. A little bit was when Stephen King was in it. Rober John Berk can't act to save his life and he can not even do any of the others. A few shows even made me laugh loudly! The movie wasn't like I thought, after reading a book that was awesome, I thought it was black and very much. If I was Stephen, I would be mad! I don't know why they changed the end, I thought the end of the book was very good. If you have found that the pie killed your daughter, can you feed anyone else? The book was very good!
