It starts well, good intro and build for the main characters but after 5 minutes, the charm is lost. It is located in the same mold as the main protagonist from America Pie and Loser without supporting stories or creativity that made Pie movies more than commercial success. Let's be honest - Heder acting was very bad. Keaton, Daniels and Faris did better but did not have a big plot or script to get their teeth in the movie just plods up without any speed or clear storyline logic to prove its length. <br /> <br /> The end is almost as predictable as they come - so predictable I have chosen a box of vendors for this one line. I advise you: avoid all costs unless you really have nothing to do / listen or watch and then you will feel the producers deceived you out of the hour and half of your life.
