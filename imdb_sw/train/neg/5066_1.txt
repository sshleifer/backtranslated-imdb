This is the worst show. The adult buntch acts like children is nothing interesting. Even Sesame Street has a better humor and more adult than friends "Friends" can be the worst thing I have ever seen on TV and I've sat in front of the Friends watching "does not work well for others, modern series. for the self-contained breath of "Frasier". The characters in the "Friends" seem to be created to make them dullards repellant.For the concern of the neighborhood makes my body crawl. The caricatures and writing are sophomoric - though deliberately so (It may be interesting to focus on the writing session since. Authors can have a slave to the goal less than their ability to not destroy the loyal friends of "friends".)
