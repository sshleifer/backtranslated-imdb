Throw a bad dog bone. Sooo bad ... you can watch at any time. Kol (Ross Hagen) is a good man of the village who is running to be reduced by a powerful army commander (Jan-Michael Vincent). Kol can steal the transfer that loses the world. An anonymous android killer is sent to bring back the dead or alive. John Phillip's law has a forest / forest disaster that advises caution in dealing with these two visitors from far away. Dress is deformed and the script does not know the mind. Vincent certainly took money and run. The law shows the only sign of effort. Also in cast: Dyana Ortelli, P.J. Soles and Dawn Wildsmith.
