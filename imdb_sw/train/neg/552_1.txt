I sat around one part of this series and could no longer take it. It felt like I would like to look at several of the events already, and then hit me ..... Nothing new here! I've heard that dragon on Seinfeld, and I saw someone falling like that to friends, part of the Happy days was close to the same story, ect. No characters attract here either! Some were good at other exhibitions (not here), and others are new for profession that shouldn't enter. Avoid this stinker!
