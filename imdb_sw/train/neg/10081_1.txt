I have read some of the comments about this film and it can be thought that some people are very interested in it. This movie is nothing. It's very written, caused by it that makes sense. The characters talk about the cliche-ridden discussion and the situation is quite implausible. Although this can make this fun and fun, it is not because everything is not available for the film becomes very bad. It's like Lee Rose decided to write a concert about a woman struggling with her sex but then she was not allowed by the studio to carry out a true story up to life or had no cojones. This film can go to the encyclopedia as a standard TV film life.
