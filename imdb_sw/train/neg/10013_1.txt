The sign of an old man who takes rap for a woman in the case of a massacre caused by a deep outward domestic who is finally bound. As well as the case, one would think the film would increase on its hackneyed nature. But the area after the drones of the area and no change in the level, there is no characteristic behavior, and irreplaceable behavior. <br /> <br /> Homosexual themes are not really needed - or on the other hand, they are not completely available. It seemed to include the audience's defense. What will Hollywood learn to have homosexual characters does not make the picture more compelling? It is a terrible and sad movie. Lauren Bacall will take what good? I expected the best for him by Kristin Scott Thomas. This is definitely just one.
