I was thinking that the main character, the astronaut and the worst case of the runner (in his case, his skin, hair, muscle, etc.) could get more work on the film after the reduction of the ass. All required to do is get to work like Blob. The flick of this flick is very good. Astronaut gets exposed to direct sunlight (I think), and thus begins to act as a string of ice cream on a hot day. It's not just a puzzler, but it seems to be killing humanity and uses their body to maintain the integrity of the cell. Huh? What? Have you ever noticed that whenever any kind of radiation accident or experiment occurs, the person returns to the murder machine? Why is it? Astronaut sleeps at night from 'secret center' (which is no safety), giving its own parts going. It seems to keep enough memory to make him head for the launch pad, perhaps because he wanted to return to the position. <br /> <br /> So begins a part of the movie that is very much filling, and the doctor is moving around the counter counter Geiger, trying to find someone who has melted to the buzz he gives. He kills fool Bill Gates who is a fisherman to appear as a fool, who tries a little girl of the movie Frankster, and finishes a few of the wacky old (punishing karmically by stealing some lemons). Then there is a short area where he deprives his old Head, and a very long place where he kills a little boy and dismisses his girlfriend nearby. You think that after cutting his hand and running, the area would change. But no ... we are treated for ten minutes of the woman sitting at the corner of the corner and screaming for fear, although the monster has gone. All I could think was a boyfriend, anybody? <br /> <br /> The end of the film is even more smooth than all. A melt man looks into a bunch of goo, and then ... nothing. That's right. That's the end of the film. Well, at least it meant that there was no chance for a follower.
