Wow ... what I can say ... First IMDb says this is in 60 years ... which means Carlito would be so close to prison, He came out of 75 and said he was in 5 years. any, and the story that had no meaning even. They only return one actor, Guzman, and hes plays a completely different boy. Why was it ended with him and the donkey of Puerto Rican? Wheres Gale? He said he had loved him before. Wheres Kleinfeld? He said he knew him forever ... You think he could be in this. And if this is meaningful, where is Rocco and black dude at first? All were just ignorant ... This is insulting for Pacino and the first film.
