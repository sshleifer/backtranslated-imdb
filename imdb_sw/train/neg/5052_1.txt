Platoon is the War of Vietnam as the Rocky IV is for the race competition. The story of Oliver Stone's experience of the US Army Forces in Vietnam in 1968 is too much. While most or all events in Platoon took place over the 10-year period of US military participation in Vietnam, showing that these things happen to a small group of men in a short period of time (week) provides a horrible picture of war. In Platoon, men of the force see all the following for a week or two: US soldiers killed civilians, US soldiers accusing civilians, US Sergeant killing another US Government, US killing US officials, US soldiers killed / wounded by fire friendly, 90% + killed or wounded in the compound. For the stone trying to try this film as a common experience of US soldiers in Vietnam is a shame. Two films of the Vietnam War I would like to recommend are We attacked (the true story of the greatest war for the US troops in Vietnam) and the Bright Shining Lie.
