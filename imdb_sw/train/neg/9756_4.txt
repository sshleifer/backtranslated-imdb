Despite the headline (English), this seems to have little to do with the Enemies and much more to do with a hungry strong ruler who wants the Stone of Philospher & wants gold from the bullet (and virgin blood). Jacinto Molina plays Gilles de Lancre and seems to have little difficulty and people are killed when he thinks they threaten his position or when he needs a virus with their blood. He essentially aroused his love of the woman and the woman of the alchemist that she is employed and is more than a disappointment and folly that seems to be her trouble than possession of securities (unfortunately). There are parts that are at least as exciting and adult men are trying to knock down with big sticks, and the film at least looks good, but otherwise there is little about this to suggest. Little in the way of the monster and nothing to be so frightened, and more commonly, for Molina / Naschy film, not any unhealthy humor. So, 4 out of 10.
