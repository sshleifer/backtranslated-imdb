I don't know what the producers of The Shield were trying to do, but the result speaks for itself: Shield is practically unknown. <br /> <br /> Of course the exhibition on the Shield is great ... <br /> <br /> In fact, the show is very involved so you can't even see the displays. For example, editing is reduced from the shots of responses before they have their full effect. I don't know what the intellectual sense is for it, but it stimulates the show of every emotional effect. <br /> <br /> I will give you one Shield step for disappointment in the matter, but that's too much I can. It is embarrassing to see the number of talented actors lose their gifts on something that has been badly scored.
