This is one of the worst movies ever made. I feel like a fan of a great zombie film and usually tolerate a bad act, licking "special effects" of dumb and anything you can encounter with a second-class film, as long as the film has a brightness / story / suspension or anything to offer . This does not basically no positive feature and is a third or fourth level, maybe worse. Other friends of me and I made a small film during the week holidays and definitely worked better (however no movie of the zombie) <br /> <br /> This flick is not even appropriate, not to say anything else. Realistic and very harmful effects, zombies that look like ordinary people (except extra white skins pulled on their faces), WAY TO MUCH Fake blood (I like realism a lot, a mix of realism and a Zombie film that can be, but released a year is just plain clear). The camera stays very long with feeding events, gives you boring and you can't help but wondering, why zombies use WEAPONS (!) To kill their prey. I won't enter the dubbing info (others have done so). Although I am from Germany yourself and is at least curious about the original version, I can't waste my time more with this movie. <br /> <br /> Stay away from it, as much as you can.
