I tried to look at the films of the movie when I was five years old; I've never been the same since. It is filled with brim and images of drugs that appear to be commonly run for normal conservation, "this movie", despite its appearance, not for humans, usually not children. It starts out without enough and a poor boy who destroys his pupils' dance (waiting) to keep his head that way; yes, put his head that way. But don't be afraid, my friends! She is comforted quickly and flute her hitting, which is weird enough, will give you, but it is still accepted. It is a movie that faces a mix of Oz and where the wild elements are, but it loses all of the "warm and fuzzy" aspects of one of these two books. So, this yellow friend of Barney, becomes a friend of this poor boy and reduces even despair. And, in order to add a good array of the theme, awesome boat, which was first a friend of the motley workers of grandparents' clock and doped-up "dragons", is added to a mixture of violence. <The most comforting picture of this confusion is the villain, called "Witchiepoo" (?). Of course, he has his own problems: what with a plastic mask of the obvious to prevent his face face to deal with the broomstick whose gas level always seems to be under him a short time. As a result of this, one of his delightful pastime was resting through the nose in the body of the water that separated the country of Pufnstuf from its degraded, decaying habitat (I do not know I loved to live) scary ... <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a movie that has the same effects as its audience like The Exorcist, then this is for you. Enjoy.
