The only reason I don't get this movie than 3 stars is because it has never had a movie like Manos: Hands of Fate. The biggest crime of this film is the fact that it is head-slow and large, without forgiving the UK. The foundation of this film seems to be a promise, a whole concept of teleporting, but the direction they were going with was not quite happy. It was more than a film about research financing and bowties than emerging lasers. Staff were wood, unemotional, and uncomfortable. As was the case of love between two scientists - something that was not surprising. I never told them what the attraction was among them as chemistry was not there. Then I don't know why the big boy's melty boy decided to kill everyone he met. At least now I know that we must always give the person a sense of justice before cutting their research subsidies, perhaps they go up, and kill isonly and goofy hand signals.
