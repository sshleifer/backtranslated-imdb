It is not clear from watching this film (therefore I propose viewers to conduct a survey of people who present their case) but this presentation on the reality of Islam, and his insistence on both non-Muslim and non-Muslims is lacking, and also failing completely in human nature. It is one thing to write that the Koran says many things about how an Islamic active person needs to interact with non-Muslims, but anyone who can realize can realize that not everyone who feels himself a follower of Islam, will agree to consider all aspects of faith and the system. There is a reason to call too much on the audience to be a question, if viewers should see the presentation and health concerns; don't stop all, hook, line, and sink, without thinking of yourself. <br /> <br /> One specific, for example, examines the man Walid Shoebat; who says that they are former Muslims who made an act of terrorism in Bethlehem. There are many wise people in the world who do not have this faith. I have never been a Muslim. I have never read the Koran. I'm not a Christian, and not a member of the_any_ faith. But I am a wise and understanding person. When the film is very confused, in commenting on how some Muslims see their responsibility to Islam; I remind you that there is more than Islam than the opinion of the scholars. Just as they are primary and evangelical Christians, so there is also a difference in the size of faith and responsibility between Jews and Muslims. When you watch this film, you need to have a salt shaker on hand. One seed is insufficient, you will need more. Please use your own mind and consider your soul, explore what is presented, and assess the state of the world and how Islam is appropriate in it according to what it says in 98 minutes of video. There is a common stick of political cooperation among those who put this film together, showing a clear transparency. Be your own brain.
