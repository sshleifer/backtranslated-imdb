Satire of Monika Mitchell's showbiz has some laugh and some premeditated violence. I can't say the blood shed; but there is insult and injury. Max Matteo (John Cassini) is a character actor who has enough adequate presence on the screen, but has a bad track record to be selected for the places he follows. There is always a producer of the producer or the reason why it is not meant to be given the role he has sought. Well, the best thing is to overcome the competition ... Max faces such thoughts. Profitable work is just to move, push and shoot. Other members organized: Rene Rivera, Molly Parker, Jennifer Beals, Frank Cassini and cameos by Eric Roberts and Sandra Oh. Well, that shows business ... or is it?
