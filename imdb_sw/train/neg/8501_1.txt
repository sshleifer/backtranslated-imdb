<br /> <br /> This movie takes a lot of time. It reminds me of the Resurrection of the film (Christopher Lambert), which I also came across. And "Semana Santa" for every way it is even a poor movie. <br /> <br /> It's just good in cast to do something for this film is Alida Valli. Alida is one of the oldest women in the history of European film. I liked his observation in "Suspiria" and "inferno" (Dario Argento). I don't spend too much time to handle this movie. I will say something good about this movie ... let us know if you want to sleep very fast ...
