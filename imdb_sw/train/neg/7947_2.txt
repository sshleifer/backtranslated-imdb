When I saw this film on FearNet, I thought it would be a terrible movie. It seems, it wasn't. I have no details on how this movie was allowed to be displayed on that site. FearNet is a site that shows awesome horror movies. <br /> <br /> Acting is amazing from all actors. I loved stories. The story was stupid. The movie begins with someone with a book and a symbol on it. He breaks the stamp and some disaster occurs. Water turns to blood, the sea dies out, the moon turns red, etc.. <br /> <br /> The woman's situation was also angry. Many things that he did was useless. As he sees a piece of paper and his date. Unfortunately, it is the day she is expected to give birth to her baby and she begins to dedicate herself to her and start researching and asking religious people all the meaning. The two things that happened in this film are the execution of a lost person who claimed that God had told him to kill his parents and the end when Demi Moore died after giving birth to his baby to transfer his soul into it. br /> <br /> Here's what happens. The person who has lost minds gets shot and killed and apocalypse begins. Demi Moore gets a hospital in the middle of a big earthquake and gives birth to her baby. She touches her baby's head, transferring her soul into the child and dying. Then, the apocalypse stops. Why does God suddenly have a change of heart? He gets angry when the Governor allows the death of a man who lost his mind then he is all over forgiveness once a woman alone sends her soul into her child? <br /> <br /> * Last Spoiler * <br /> <br /> The movie is very good. It is the religious end of the propaganda piece of the world. Acting from Demi Moore and Michael Biehn and everyone else is better. That's about all that exists. <br /> <br /> I give this 2 star star for 10. Good act for many reasons!
