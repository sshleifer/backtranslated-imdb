I just had the pleasure to see this film once when I was very young of the film that was clear in trying to remember it. However, I can say it is not surprising if a killer called a killer should have things that are not remembered from this movie is a song and a place where older couples talk about the poor Timmy. Other than that the movie is just a little tomato and big tomatoes around and people are scared to win if people should do in this kind of film. However, just having a very mysterious Power and a song of interesting themes do not have a good comedy to do. In fact this film is supposed to be a B film, nothing to be taken seriously, however, you should still make a joke that is funny and do not try to extend the lovely premise to gently on the full movie. Perhaps a short would have been as good as a trailer showing a couple of older men mentioned above and a man struggling to shoot big tomatoes was really very good. Trailer itself looks like a trailer of shock, but no really made a perfect film, and one very weak there.
