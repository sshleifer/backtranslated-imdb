Almost everything in this film is correct, not the same, not the same. Take Mike Myers, for example. He has reached a point where you realize that his shtick has not changed since his SNL days, over the past decade. He makes a sharp joke of cognition and sound the same. His cat is very bad. She tries a hard way. He is a surprise of a kind of player, not a cold cat should be. Some of the movies are just bad. The set is very serious and it is clear to lose millions of dollars. (Cutting card according to previous buildings would have been more important than building a neighborhood and a highway.) Alec Balwin tries to beat a great impression of the great scope, but he ends up watching and screaming. There is even a good time for cheesecake and faux celebrity Paris Hilton --- which includes in mind only because this is supposed to be Dr Seuss story. Avoid this movie at all costs, people. It's not even the crash of the train. (I hope they will make Horton Who is with Robin Williams. And we'll have a movie-films of Seuss-star-spasitc- comedian movies.)
