This film shows Ben Chaplin as an exhausted banker in the UK who commands an email grandmother from Russia, accepts Nicole Kidman in a letter and gets more than he did when he met, surprised, he is not visible. The story is absolutely certain and Chaplin faces a lot of action that becomes very bad. Kidman is now a good place in this role, making his character about the only thing in this fascinating film. GRADE: C
