As many of the incoming filtals Hamiltons makes for a spectacular film look are all views and limited implementation. Although it is surprising to the low-budget budget that falls in its final end and becomes worse for a long time when it is released by a clear conclusion. The film is about the family of executives trying to survive after the parents died. They take the people, to take the blood from them and feed something that is closed on their apartment. There are good showings from Mckellhar and Firgens and others are just that. The film doesn't feel true or very disturbing about it. But for the first half of the pipeline to be a wonderful and dark mix that is amazingly amazing. The next half is not very suitable if it gets in the importation of the film and the real loss of the livelihoods of livelihoods that allow the entire film to be a high brightness. It is embarrassing though there is no doubt that some of the talent was involved in this production and although deeply wrong is still original and creative. The worst that when it comes to delivery fails at every level. <br /> <br /> ** / 5
