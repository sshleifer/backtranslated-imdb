It is hard to believe that the director Barbet Schroeder once made a wonderful and extraordinary Maitresse (1976), and now it just seems to do "for the exciting" numbers of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> This is a very lightweight John Grisham material, crossed with a plot of TV movie. Cattle is Cass Mayweather, a freelance investigator of independent and independent criminals who are known to ordinary killers. Ben Chaplin is a lover of police patronage Sam Kennedy, and together they make a duo uncomfortable. It is not good, when two non-equitable university maladriots (Gosling and Pitt) decide to send them on wildlife monitoring - for the planting of very careful attention and lies in the crime scene. Right, but when Bullock and Chaplin fail to create a spark, and we also have to tolerate several gentle flashbacks on the melodramatic indicating an important event in Cass's history. Then of course there are regular shots of cabin-side cabin cabin where there is absolutely no end of the OTT will be installed. Oh ... my. Look at any part of CSI instead. It is for sure and more exciting.
