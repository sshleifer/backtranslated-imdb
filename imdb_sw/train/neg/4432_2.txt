Tatie Danielle is on hag ghastly Hag who tortures her family of love and oblivious out of weight. There is a bit of subtext that can be on French colonial but it is only just Danielle doing a variety of items (as deliberately leaving a small child in the park) which will soon have someone picking his teeth and fingers toes. Unfortunately, that doesn't work here. It looks good and acting is good and nothing wrong with the concept but it's just so SMUG. God, does this film love itself. Anger is not nearly as clever or as funny as it thinks it. Simply influence in the show - sorry, movie - comes out of Danielle to get nastier and nastier, and the only surprise comes from looking at the most impossible ways he does this. That's the same: as in the sitcom, which is this, and the 'bonus' added to the magnitude of the size and time of the 110-minute race.
