I have tried to look at this so-called comedy, but it's very hard to carry. This is a bad, thin movie, a hit movie. Definition is not funny, but it is very boring and sad, in fact. Wrong script, acting bad. It's a complete waste of time - and nothing else to say, I'm afraid. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10 points.
