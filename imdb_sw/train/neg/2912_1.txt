"Machine Machine" should be one of the most difficult, bad and over-exaggerated sci-fi horror studios that I've ever come to. It is about evil against evil and the story of coming, with the aim of attracting and bloody state, evil and pleasing. Because the violence is not so serious and it does not make you laugh, but the cheapness of blood is not able to run freely. Issei Takahashi and Toru Tezuka are the worst experiences I have seen, if not enough is also directed by the attention of the director called Judei Yamaguchi. This movie has all, it's bad for the bone, A must see for every b-movie freak !!! ... Just: Relaxing and rare gem.
