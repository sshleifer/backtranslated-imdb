This movie introduces a variety of characters and their relationships in the first or more hour. None of them produce any interest or good response. I waited for the introduction to start, hoping things would be better and ending up until the end of pain, but there was no charge for doing so. <br /> <br /> If you want a lesson, look elsewhere. For me the action is not appropriate to write. Not that the story was bad, I think you could say I had some problems with the script - i.e. I thought it was trunk. Look at the credit that will show you that there is a strong cast here, it is not used for any benefit. Many past benefits in this flick do good; of participants who I have never seen before I like Deborah Kara Unger. That's about all that I can get good to say about this picture.
