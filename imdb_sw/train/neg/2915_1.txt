It's a bad movie, it seems like there are only 5 policemen in HK, they didn't use there guns and this makes me feel like a movie of Jacky Chan. All the time they used their guns to tell the accused only. When they finally use their gun is when they kill each other, it's a wonderful movie. In the movie, it's like all good people died without cause. <br /> <br /> They say the film line also welcomes, the story jumps here and there and bored people. But if you want to see a movie of blood, I think this is just a kind of movie, I think U.S. made a zombie movie is more bloodier than this
