Störtebeker is one of the worst of the series of television series made on this planet. The role cannot be accomplished by historical history is more than false: Only two examples: Visby was shown as a home of three houses. Instead, it was a great city at this time, it was the best days ago. Second, Hamburg has never been a city that cares for pirates in the Baltic Sea. Hamburg did not have access to the Baltic Sea, the capital at that time was Lübeck. But worse than all: Redirect! How can dilettante be allowed to lead a movie like this? Not possible! There was no one reliable place, the fight was ridiculous and I could not suppress laughter in extreme cases. I can't fully understand how a big television channel can be powerless.
