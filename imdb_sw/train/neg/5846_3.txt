Yes, this is one of those movies, so it is very bad, so it's lazy, so to blame, that you can't stop laughing. I looked at comedies, good comedies, and laughed less than my wife and I laughed at this movie. Other comments give a good idea. Characters cannot enjoy the mouse over, these effects have not been made you wonder what the primary school class of school was managing, acting - oh acting - talk about fatigue and banned conversation. <br /> <br> But the mouse, yes, the big mouse. Why didn't we come to see the mouse to the end surprising. Often 'big' is not shown until the end because the budget is low and good results are looking for a lot of money. However, I find that in this case the big mouse was closed to the end because the filmmakers were embarrassed that the best they had was dressed in a dress and a dentist. The most beautiful part of the entire movie is the elevator area. After making sure that the mouse was not able to cry (migraine from the bad acting?), The main dude blows the fire alarm to send the mouse into a frenzy. If you ever wanted to see a pair of mice waltz when blood flew out of their heads like a geyser, this film is for you. True, you need to pay taxes and see for yourself. <br /> <br /> But not for more than 99 Â¢, right?
