My brother is loving with this show, let's do this just the same. I totally agree with people who said it was to deal with the Dexter Lab and the Bad Parents. I have never loved abnormal parents, I mean, some things have made me laugh, but most of the time it is very angry and not very good. This is almost the same as I feel about Johnny's Test. Besides, NOTHING makes me laugh at the show. Gags are stupid and not mean, and tell you the truth, maybe it's just me, but kids don't have such a DRESS! Yes, I think Johnny's hair is awesome, but yomMon! And the Dexter Lab, which was one of my favorite shows and still don't care to look at it. That makes me hated by the quest of Johnny's attempt to make JOKE totally out of this amazing show! <br /> <br /> Something more. Ya. Dogs. What? So. It is sad. He is loud and awesome than Johnny! And the emphasis on gay? What fudge! I love dogs and death and I hope to die, because it would be better for children to see than to listen and watch obnoxious crap that goes into the show, and picking a gay accent. Unless you want the eyeballs to spell in the fire of miracles and your brain is rushing from this show, don't look at it!
