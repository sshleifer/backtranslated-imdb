This movie has always left my feeling. I looked at it as a freshman at the High School and I was home alone that night. I think I lost all the respect of Robert Reed as an actor being a big fan of "Brady Bunch". I also thought that the work of Chuck Connor was bad and bad. However, this film greatly affected me that I am now volunteering in the prison conditions of women to do Bible studies and church services and try to change women's lives, one at a time. What is interesting to me is that very few people watch this film. None of my friends looked at it and my family was not even good when I discuss this film because they didn't see it.
