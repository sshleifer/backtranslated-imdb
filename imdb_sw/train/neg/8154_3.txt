A long list of "big" titles in this flick (including normal John Mills) does not hit me to the extent that I can't judge the film on its real characteristics. It is full of discrimination, caricatures, and standard, setting scenes, from the air-thin-ace hero to a large-mouthed flyer. The list of music was like one time, about an hour before the end, I thought the film was about: loud sounds, rising to crescendo, growing bigger and finishing then silent, but the movie continued! I have not seen the true story, the wrong text, but the art of art and beauty Jean Simmons (the work of the nose before) and the small storm. I can't say that this picture has other links that make the film great. I saw it maudlin, mawkish and small.
