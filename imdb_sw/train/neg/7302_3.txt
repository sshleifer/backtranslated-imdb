The first five minutes of this film showed potential. After this, it came directly from another respect for some kind of informal comedy. The best part is that I can't stop thinking for Supertroopers thanks to Joey Kern. I would like to consider watching this film to really learn how to make a film. There are many instances in this film which makes only one stop and wondered if all the cast and staff just stopped caring at some point. What is surprising about this film is that it got 22 million dollars in the box office and it costs only about $ 1.5 million to do. Congrats for the Lion's Gate to be able to pull the same.
