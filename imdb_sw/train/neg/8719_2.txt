Well here I am going to another movie B. It's sad to see bad movies but I don't care if the B or C industry produces a film. Show some effort in your work. The characters are very bad. Acting is not in this question (surprise), but the compound is. What? How can the combat squad witness to the two soldiers who have laughed, and then continue if nothing happened. What despises me is how the author gave the remaining members to the place where they laugh about how the doctor's dose was good. Give me a break.
