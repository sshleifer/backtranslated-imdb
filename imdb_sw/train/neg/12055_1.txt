Don't use your money or your time on this piece of pain in a movie film. When every third word is devoted to an unintelligible language and there is no real plot and also having former characters who are still presenting the same old and unchanged presentations, they leave much to say. I expected something better from an award winning Benicio del Toro. A vision that others may have of Puertorricans will be corrupted in such a way as the Maldeamores. A bad word at a time in the film can be used to emphasize a particular view and may be funny or sad based on its environment (see Elsa and Fred's model for example) but it should not be a focus on the plot. The movie is a total embarrassment and absolutely nothing funny or even cute about this film.
