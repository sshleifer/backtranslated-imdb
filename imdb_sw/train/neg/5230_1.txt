Although Robert "Knox" Benfer has his fans, I am not one of them. His films are genuinely and amateur, and not just very interesting, unless you are 14 years old and sense of development of humor. Certainly not popular, such as young fans like to believe, by disturbing people on Wikipedia, or inserting ratings here on IMDb. It is certainly not filled with any major media stores, which speaks a lot about its "reputation" and its creation. Benfer has little skills in a little animation, but he needs to get away from his young tips and learn to write real amazing material before being taken seriously as a real singer. At this time, however, he is just a child with a camera, and it shows.
