I have read a review that seems to have been a pupil in a very high school, England in the 1960s to understand this. Maybe that's true, if so, then this film can't be time. ************* SPOILER ALERT ************** ************* ************* The latter makes up meaning as all children who are opposing the government and fighting the organization would have nothing better solution that does not torch the community for Max Max cinder type. Well, the main characters can leave, but they don't. The reason they go about this cannot be meaningful. There is no development of character enough to explain why. What motivates a group of innocent people should mean they have not been told or even confirmed. It is said that the war is the expression of the end of creativity, the only revelation that is possible only that any characters of this film have, and are not recommended. The characters that go to the massacre are not fighting the institutions, they just kill people. I thought they could use all the bombs to beat a place or at least a sanctuary at the end, which would have made a great sense of image, but it didn't. <br /> <br /> tl; dr - This movie is a young boy to fight against the authority that harms them, though they really need. You have no moral, symbolic, or meaning; This movie seems just a fantasy of killing teachers and people in the "power" that you hear. If you are thinking of destruction of school / school like columbine or virginia tech it is a wise and wise way to cooperate with teachers and institutions that you like, then I think you will love this movie. If you have been like me and you are working towards a life of blindness (too blind in this film) to fight "man", this film is young and awesome. You can also say in places where money was not available, and the story seemed to have a touch of attention to the lack of attention. All in all, this looks like a bad draft of what could be a good movie, but no effort was put into negotiations, character development, or values ​​that are just ... it doesn't work properly. <br /> <br /> If ... I can only get my hours back.
