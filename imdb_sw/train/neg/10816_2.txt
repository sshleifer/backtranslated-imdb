Oh just what I needed, another film about the 19th century England. Which is similar to the UK regularly, not anyone who loses the football field. In these beautiful masters, women and other titles were selected, Charlotte Gainsbourg surrounds no matter what Jane Eyre, from the novel has ever read freely. in the bed of Mr. Roochester, where he tries to teach the French girl to look at the blackboard at all times. of the fruit that is locked on the floor. After other people thrown around and spread the hot fire (maybe they have set up), the film finally comes to an end. Everything seemed real, that's something I think. But again, nah.
