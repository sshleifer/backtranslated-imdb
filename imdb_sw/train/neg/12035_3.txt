I expected this to be the most beautiful. I love the work of Tim Burton, so I was very excited to see these small online movies. They were not all I expected. I don't know exactly what I don't like. I think they're just kind of quick. The voice bothers me, and many of the characters, though I love Roy Boy Toxic, and Stainboy. <br /> <br /> The girl plays the part probably hit me many, though it was pretty funny. <br /> <br /> I also don't like the way some of the characters die. As well as the Girl matches basically sets the gas station on fire, or how the girl who struggles to die, in general. Roy's death was exciting, amazing. Death and freshener of the car. Basically ;-) That made me laugh hard ... There are some things wrong with children. Some language and year. That's all I say! 3/10
