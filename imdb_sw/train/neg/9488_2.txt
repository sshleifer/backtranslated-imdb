I have seen the most frightening movies in my time, and this time is not the worst, it's certainly in the bottom half. Script has started the same. The little doctor goes to the hospital in disbelief, with the hope of doing a better job for him and his future wife. Good wishes? The movie then leads directly into the toilet when you realize that something is killing patients. It shows that there is a demon on the floor that is reaping the souls of the people. It works the doctor 1, 1 nurse, and 1 guard at all hospital staff dismissing the patient's mind, making rituals that pretty much involves cutting the tongue out, and then allowing the haunted house prop of the demon to come out and steal his soul for The magic method of special effects of cheesy. By this time the movie gets too stupid, I was begging for it to be over. There was one hour to go. It seemed like half an hour "Stories From the Crypt" part of which was somewhat overlooked in half an hour. From the little Lister doing well John Coffey (Green Mile) for the tracy of Tracy Scoggins with Frigid Nurse Ratchet, this movie fails every level. I gave these 2 stars for only two reasons. 1) Her pastor is very aggressive, reducing a little pain towards the end and 2) the movie looks good, it is better than the current state of the awesome films made by high-quality wal-mart cameras. <br /> <br /> At the end, try this turd even if you have a Blockbuster movie passing (which I do, and I still felt deceived). Like a bonus drinking game, you and your friends take a shot at any time Matt Stasi (Dr James Asko) moving head speaking. You will be 15 minutes drunk on the movie.
