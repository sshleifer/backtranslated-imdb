Despite being good for the original strong nature, this is more than an exciting remake on Friday of 13TH related to more antics Angela psychopathic, killing more nubile young people for their "prostitution" in the camp. Pamela Springsteen (Bruce sister) looks good. There are some beautiful sexually explicit pictures and some of the most attractive girls, but the film (deliberately) unintentionally instead of insisting, is a stinker. <br /> <br /> * out of ****. > <br /> MPAA: Rated R for image abuse and gore, dirt, and for some sex, language, and drug use.
