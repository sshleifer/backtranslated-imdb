This film was quite ... ugh I can't get a word oh wait ... crap! I mean when you started I was like this yeah looks good and then after it was boring. I lost sleep and had nothing to do with the fact that I got late to show because it was dirty. Ram Gopal Varma has tried the best but the cast could not live up to the cast of the original Sholay means what he thought to do remake. What did he try to do? Be like Sanjay Leeli Bhansani and win all the awards last year as he did for Black? Ajay and the other person was especially good, another boy who played the game because out of all he was looking at her. What did Amitab do? He destroys his respect for making these films. First Nishabd then Cheeni Kum then Jhoom Barabar Jhoom and now this means hes got to gather a little of his money and move away from Bollywood as much as possible before losing all his respect and I tell you he has already passed his way. I mean all this is very good for other actors like Shah Rukh Khan who get a very good name now because of the recent decline of Amitab. I have never loved him because he thinks he is God and I knew only Abhishek would be in the movie. <br /> <br /> If you want to save your Â£ 17.75 and use it for something good to go to Heyy Babyy because that's just the funniest movie ever and it's number one in the chart!
