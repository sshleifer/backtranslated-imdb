College students, who are expelled from dormitories, face a shade killer. The Blood Dorm (aka Pranks) is a bit of a bag mixed with fans of slasher. The production standards of the film are very low and the story for the most part is usually normal, there is an exciting cover that is connected to the red ceremony. In fact a lot of building stories are pretty forget, except for one or two brutal killings. But the film is best done with its amazing dramatic peak (in atmospheric atmosphere) and a single point of courage, unusual. Stephen Sachs is the best of the vote as it does good good to turn into a character. Also see Daphne Zuniga as little as ill-fated student. All of these are good efforts for the B level, but the finale fits for the fragrance and for the viewer keeps the film a full break. <br /> <br /> ** out of ****
