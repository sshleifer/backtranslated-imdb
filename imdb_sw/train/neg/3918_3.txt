This movie may be the biggest permits I have ever found in the movie's movies. In general, I've just got this to be a second-degree film. Leslie Cheung certainly can be approved as an antihero and Ma Wu performs his character with good skill. On the other hand, the Ma-shapes (the hair of the face) are so obvious that I can't take him seriously. He looked like a very tall young man wearing Halloween, he finished with a beard of $ 4.95 of a beard. Specific effects were so-so, though "without" within the cellar was very good. The language of the tree looks like something from the evil evil of the 1950s, although POV is emerging by the language of more closely resembling the shots of Sam Raimi's business in recent trilogy "Evil Dead". The pyrotechnics were ho-hum and the last battle is over as lighter as you can find. (In fact, he reminded me very closely "Anything lost" part of which Robinsons are found in sand and ....) <br /> <br /> The program was not original and has been told countless times in the form of European stories. There was no change of counsel and no plot. In fact, you know once you are told to the characters who are good, who is evil, and who will live. <br /> <br /> I returned this film to Netflix and then sat down Write these comments. The first thing I did is look at the production date. Yep, says 1987 ... not 1967 which I thought might be. And that much more about it: the production of FX is the most common in the 1960s. The program and actions are more visible, since Hollywood was actually producing interesting and challenging films in 60 years. br>> ** out of *****
