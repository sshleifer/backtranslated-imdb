Have you ever lived through the movies and after all it's like one great "wtf??". Welcome to Decoy. <br /> <br /> Another directly on the nutrition video action flick can immediately forget about having a look or better but not looking at it all the time. Peter Weller and Robert Patrick star and quickly disappear in this go now fast-to-hack action dud where the story is pretty darn and the action takes and what to look at checking action as a hitting point? Robert Patrick especially drives a little down in a series of action that has to give him a machine gun while standing on a bus hood to move the school. Co-Charlotte Lewis's stars and Scott Hylands of Canada (the famous Night Night TV).
