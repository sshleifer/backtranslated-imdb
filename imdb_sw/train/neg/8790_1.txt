I saw this on a recent cable and kinda enjoyed. I have been reading the comments here and it seems that everyone loves the second half more than the first half. Personally, I enjoyed the first (bad story that was not added.) The second story, I thought, was closed. And that "California Dreaming," as I hear that once more ... Chungking Express is the same, but it's not something that ordinary viewers will continue to see, like "Crouching Tiger."
