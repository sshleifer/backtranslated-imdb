Very much, the humdrum cinema here and Stella Stevens are getting directions from someone who is hiding (it didn't take long to think who is) in Old Nevada Town out of Vegas for cash money at the Circus Circus Hotel in Las Vegas. Stevens leads his group of a third girl, and they know that they should act faster than they expected. Despite the best features of Las Vegas in 70 years, the average size is still believed by many characters, and the potential line of potential, Las Vegas Lady has one big boring egg. It seems ever for the film to run in the gear, and when it makes it just sputters here and there and never really faster. I was a little disappointed with this film. Of course, I didn't expect anything big, but I at least think this might be one of these films from 70 years or something like that. Not near. No one dies. There is a powerful gun between Stuart Whitman and George DiCenzo, a year before its great performance as Bugliosa prosecutor at Helter Skelter. Gunfight has all doubts to look at the waterfall. There is one punch and one head is hit by a transparent tool. Further there is nothing in action. And for girls, do not expect much there. Stella and her girls (both very brave, still getting a sauna and swimming.) We see what, but not just a short profile. Stella is wearing these beautiful bells to promote her real talents, but I would like to be a little more clear with her performance. In that way I could write one thing that might suggest a film. No, it wasn't, and I have a bit to say in favor of this film. It's not a horrible film in any way, they have nothing to go to YAWN.
