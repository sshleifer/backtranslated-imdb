I was surprised to see that this film had a very good color, when I looked at the IMD after seeing it. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen and I have seen many bad movies. It looks like a good movie at first, but when it comes to surgery I can't believe how bad it is. This high voice destroys everything! Imagine you are opening like that and then listen to what he says. I saw a movie in Germany so I don't know what he said in English, but strange things like "Yes, it doesn't hurt." ... what is this? Tell yourself "think about something else" and then forget your pain by thinking only about your partner is just ... ignorant. And his mother ... how does hell get something like that out there? Someone comes to tell him, his son died by surgery (what he was supposed to expect). Plus received a letter in Jessica Albas package. although "knows the hospital centers" ... and then takes "second second" to count it? What? Hell? ^^ And finally ... why the police surround them? The patient died from surgery, all that happened. The drunken doctor knows nothing else or ... and then breaks them all, even a partner? Why ??? With all that I think Christensen did a bad job, but that doesn't really matter for me ... those mistakes and stupid things I have written about above are a problem. I watched this film with other friends and we were all very disappointed ... As I said, one of the worst movies I have seen ... Do not look;
