Spend your time any other way, even homework is better than this movie. Jokes are not funny, cheerful poems which are Dr. Seus does not exist. The best way to lose the evening. My 4-16 kids cut a little bit at the beginning when they got to stimulate and left to play Barbies and the old men left to play ps2 and delete the net. My wife left and made a plate. So I finished alone. It's the worst movie of the "children" I saw. If you want to watch the fun movie of Shrek 2 children, the movie enjoys children and their parents. FINDA MOVIE HILI. Not funny, not cute, the cat's makeup is the only thing in it and you can see that on the disc studio.
