Randolph Scott comes from the United States for British Green Canada. He wants to start a ranch cow with partner Bill Williams and cook Lee Tung Foo. They beat their small cattle on the bridge built by Victor Jory. Later Jory hits their cattle and Williams loses his left hand during fracas. From 1945 to 1962 when he lost his retirement, Randolph Scott made a series of western western adults, some of them considered real classics. Unfortunately the Cariboo Trail will never be mentioned among its best west. <br /> <br /> It is more like material that Roy Rogers or Gene Autry can use. The story is a fraud sometimes. Williams who was on a journey with Scott, wanted to go to the prospect of gold if there was a great strike at that time. He does not blame the servants, says Scott to persuade him to make a trip to lose his hand. There is also a scene in the film when Scott, Lee Tung Foo, and Gabby Hayes are captured by Indians. They are saved because Gabby's mule has been taught to command and he runs to the Indians to allow our heroes to escape. I don't know that it would have played in Rogers' film. Additionally the story seeks to believe that the order of tyro Randolph Scott was injured by an accident on a gold strike after a few lessons from Gabby Hayes viewer how to get gold. This was part of the film's feature of Gabby Hayes's return. It would have been better if he had gone in the beautiful west and he had actually done a better couple with Randolph Scott before this. I will say this, although no Caribou made any appearance in the film, this is one of the few films found in Canada from the past that had no Mounties. But if I were you unless you were a big fan of Randolph Scott or Gabby Hayes, make a second withdrawal on the Cariboo Way.
