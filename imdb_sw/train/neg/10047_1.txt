I have now written a review of several MoH events, and this is among the worst. An interesting background at the beginning is completely rejected and when the credit is provided. If you look at people that will not have true life ("let's see below!"), Then this is your show. Except, it is not an exciting or entertaining - very despicable. The viral load has never been, displayed. I can really stop the fact that it affects people only, because the situation is very frightening. But things go off like a daughter who throws a father out of the house, and finally dies in his hands. The woman runs north, and runs in a few tens of matter. Then, some kind of spirit or guest or something that looks and saves (things that make you go to HUH?). Or something. Then, he circles to the heat. Finally. Evil / Evil. These directors send this letter.
