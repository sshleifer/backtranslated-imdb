Probably one of the most endless boriest movies, has been done badly and written badly. <br /> <br /> PLOT Five students living back during a dorm vacation, but someone has designs on them and starts killing one for one person, the main suspect is an interesting protector John Hemmitt played by Woody Roll, or it may be one of five characters. It is not bad not great nor far from Daphne Zungia who dies the fastest way and it would be the main heroine, and all the rest thrives even though Laura Lapinski the main hero sometimes has its charm and you feel sorry for it The end. KILLS can't see why they forbade this, he is very fake, one man has his hand cut in the first half which looks really fake, but others are very bad if one girl gets his head driving, one girl gets boiled alive and another is burned. It is certainly not the best of slasher ld to be better
