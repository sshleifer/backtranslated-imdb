Do not make a mistake, I love action and revenge, I have seen many since I was a child, including the recent Dolph Lundgren "The Mechanik" which is very good. And Tony certainly knows how to use the camera and it might even be a shot and editing film. But with "Man on Fire" (and even more with "Domino"), Scott suggests that instead of using his intellectual skills "skill" wisely, he uses voluntarily to be shown to pay for the lack of substances that his material does not give. "Person of Fire" is around 2 hours and a half when it should be at least less than an hour. The way Scott scored and edited this film also makes you wonder if he wants you (viewers) to sit through his film because his regular camera goes and shines it really tortured with the eye and makes you you want to leave the playground or wipe it after 5 minutes in it. MPAA and studios have concerns about the ratings, violence and films of PG-13, I see also the suspicion that the $ 70 million movie has been made with a B-movie script and a character that reduces your fingers, puts a bomb in a man's ass blowing a guy's shoot, this all to take revenge of the little girl who is not even dead! Continue then why the label will pass the best script because of language or violence ... So said ...
