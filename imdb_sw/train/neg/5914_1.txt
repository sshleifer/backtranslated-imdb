This movie is really provoking. It was banned in Chinese movies and I see why. Not because it is necessary for Communist rule but just because the movie is of low quality. I can never pay money to check this. I love movies from Chen Kaige and Zhang Yimou and I am faced with such bad movies that can come from China. It seems to ignore the audience and the director seems to have made the film itself. The shots of a man standing there would do something for a minute are hilarious and there are a lot of them. Style and video quality are very bad. I watched this film on Net and it looks like real people like this film. The only information I have is that some film films think that if the film is not in English it is quite good. I can't see any reason people like this. this is not a film of art is a waste of celluloid (That's like they actually shot it on the film, which they didn't)
