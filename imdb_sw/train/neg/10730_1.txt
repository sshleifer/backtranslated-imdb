The movie begins with 3 people met on the bar. OK. They say about their life of thinking, lying all the time, without reason. It is still the same. Interesting. The first 30 minutes you enjoy! But then ... things are getting worse ... Nothing happens ... for a long time ... and then, when something happens, all you can see is the old naked "women" picking up! Not right. Disgusting! By the way, this part should be on the film, but it's everything except that! Modern are not sure, it's boring, and sick! The amazing thing is that here (Belgrade, Serbia) on the FEST (film festival), this film was more popular according to surveys, of course, before people watched it! I thought (before checking): "Hay, this could be interesting, though it's a Russian movie"! But, God, No !!
