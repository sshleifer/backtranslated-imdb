With the best cast, this is an unusual film, especially from the atmosphere of the sky. It may be better than "bad Richthofen and Brown" but not in much. "Blue Max" remains the best of the small market over the past 35 years when "Darling Lilli" is happy if not taken seriously. It's amazing what ILM can do with Zeppelins and Gothas in a new film, the top WW film of Aero.
