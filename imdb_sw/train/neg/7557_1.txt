This film was awesome. Well, my popular film is 'Wicker Man' (1973), so I always liked it. Symbols run alongside, giving enough of the original items to make the word 'remake' a little doubt. (He is not a virgin, but it is a swarm of bees. WOW!) So many things that do not mean and do not explain, which I fear Mr LaBute has no awesome movie. (Did two people see how they were beaten in the car at the beginning of the living and well at the end of the film?) Cage looks haggard and worries everywhere, and his character is possible to call "Rowan!" for a little noise. 'Nods' for nature are angry as they come as tacky instead of being respectable. For example, some events appear earlier (a girl falling into a cupboard pretending to be dead while Woodward / Cage is looking for this island) and several lines of discussion are given directly from the original screwed Anthony Schaffers screen. I am sure some will provide better and more analysis, I can't have trouble writing more about this film. You don't have any type of substances. Give us in the scrap heap and other remake that have led to good film titles that were 'core' on top ((in this case very freely).
