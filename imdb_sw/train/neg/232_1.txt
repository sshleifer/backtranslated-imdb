This was one of the worst films. When Kate shows and Jed is with a group of boys and all begins to blow ... so Hollywood. Another bad situation was when Kate was driving her hands on the floor it seemed to be examining the text of the tar. Andie's work is very bad in this film - I could not connect with or feel love for each other. The other two other women were very beautiful and they put up Andie. However this was the movie's movie. I often like these types of films but I just can't reach this film. Many impossible circumstances and Andie's acting is no longer supporting the film. Also, he is both gum. Lancome should put his text with a putty knife because he seems to be good at journalists.
