In what may be otherwise run the mill, mediocre about infidelity in the sixties (Sensitive "free-will" period) film, developers of this film pile in ignorant surroundings after ignorance and advanced surroundings away with a little trite cherry on, with pleasure after finishing. At that time nothing made me ever feel sympathy for Diane Lane or Anna Paquin in the vicious care between the independent class of their lives, nor did I feel for Liev Shrieber's spread. The story line plods along the slow to predictable, pathetic its conclusion and the only interesting thing to watchable about this film is stunning Diane Lane topless. Here is a taste, it occurs about 30 minutes within the film. Fast forward to that part and skip breaks.
