After calculating the use of the word f, oh, about 22 times in the first 10 minutes or so of the film, listening to some of the worst actors continue on the woman and the horse, and doing good as 12 year old boys have naughty together, well, we turned. Depending on the dirt of dirt and potty humor is a true sign of a losing movie of Hollywood film, a product of non-thought and non-talented authors. We gave a second chance, certainly would have been better. No dice. Later, my boyfriend came down through the remaining movie if it was improved, still no dice. <br /> <br /> The protagonist had a cool bike. I would like to recommend this to anyone except young people, or boys.
