It's been a bad show of the 80s TV that emerged and tried to be the sole film of the porn. Oh my god was bad. Each character plan was of little importance. The plot itself was not something to say. Something about stalker, I think. At the end he finds himself? Not quite clear, but somehow there is a volleyball game involved. And the main character (Randy) is very close. The only reason my friends had hired this movie was because Casper Van Dien was in it, and they came to want to move forward with events and he in it, which was not clear at the time. Thank God I had no money on it, but I want that hour of my life back.
