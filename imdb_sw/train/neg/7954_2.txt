Well this film was "unique" we will say. Carrie Fisher had the most talented in the movie, although it was said he had a coke problem during the film. but he said that he cannot remember much of that. well that's its excuse but what everyone else? I can't imagine all they had a problem of coke.wh not all bad i mean i think the plot was the same and it had some funny moments. although the place the boy finds the same thing burned with his head was a little violent to my taste. oh well I think I had been disappointed because the Carrie fisherman is like an amazing and this movie did nothing for it.
