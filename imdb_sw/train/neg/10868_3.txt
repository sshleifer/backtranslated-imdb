For stories and screenplay which appears written by a secondary student, 'The Seduction Art' fails to provide a romantic, modern experience tries to handle itself as. The two main characters have the ability to attract - both men and women are leading "turn-alone (or in the case of women, involved)", but 'Art of seduction' does not even try. Shirking due to the clear observation of these characteristics of the two characters, 'Art of seduction' depends on any substance on the basis of thin discrimination, good. The 'Cheating Art' is a shame - disgusting its characters, shaking men and women, and despising the expectations of its audience. It takes very good people that we all know and provides their interaction pain when we expect to build them. Ji-wan is a damaged, damaged, destructive bitch. The viewer is expected to love and forgive his mistakes because he is good. Min-jun, well, he is exactly the same. Neither is good people. "Humor" in this film is mainly around Ji-wan and Min-jun efforts that come out of art in lies and lies. No promotional behavior occurs, and we do not know why Ji-wan and Min-jun are like this. We're just expected to pick them up as they are, and not ask questions - they are cute!, And all that is important. The best references to the famous actors of the film's scenes of the film can stimulate you to the 'Experience of Seduction. If you are still in high school, you liked Grease, or you are a victim of yellow fever, you can love this film. <br /> <br /> With its "Romance" tag, this is not a very good movie of the date.
