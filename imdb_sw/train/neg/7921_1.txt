The Merchant Merchant 2 is very similar to the original Mortal Leaders, what remains that is different from the other film has weird visitors. It is my belief that this film will be the best movie on IMD - if anyone had looked at it. The program is linked to, for several instances (many ways), making absolutely no meaning. The amazing thing here is why the world had a sequel made of an unsuccessful and frightening film (but still better). I would like to highly recommend this film if you like to enjoy bad movies for good.
