Now, I haven't read a little original story to know all the notes of the literature that you did not miss here, so I can't go down that way here. But I have long ago learned that Stephen King movies just a non-horror film, and maybe a couple of differences. This was not one of them. It started well, and at once I would not complain about acting, although Fred Gwynne was like a strange size. to help but suffer. And that came close to the end of the film, and at least 2 characters appeared in dumb's activities. When I mention this is: There is a small zombie running around the house. You think it's under the bed. Are you nearing the bed as possible before raising the blind blindly, playing your whole body with any damage that you might be able to give, or / or <br /> (b) ) take a little away from the bed so that you can look down at the very bottom of the clear space from a little safety space, or at least see the terrorism that comes to you, giving you a little bit of response. <br /> <br /> I know, let's go with (a). I feel like devoting myself for the murder today. Bleh <br /> <br /> Happy film however ... Not only scary.
