This movie had more holes than cheese cheese. Ben Affleck had a lot of weight trying to act in any way, shape, or form. He completely spilled. There is nothing about the trusted movie. The first problems were in the introduction where a person gives everything of value to the Salvation Army Santa Claus but does not show why. And then the granny puts his head in the oven - very good, and has nothing to do with the movie - not the same as the sound similar to the film. There was no incentive for Ben Affleck to choose the house he chose; there was no reliable impact with the family he chose; and people are attacked here and there for no reason to be beaten. two - but were rarity in the movie. Re-required another (or 4). Hope you enjoy!
