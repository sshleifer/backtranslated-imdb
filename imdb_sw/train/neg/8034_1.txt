I know the slashers are always necessarily bad, but come, what hell is this? It's like a group of 10-year-olds to save their lunch money and start to open this weekend. However, six young people go to one house to be killed on the screen. We have one brainy, slut, other slut, black boy, killer, position such as. There is a decent and honorable murder somewhere in the middle, but then it's back to more weight, and more false. For precisely, we actually know that it can not be a killer when someone gets an attack because this boy wants to take his best time for everything. After every character you expect to die, and a close-to-friend friend finally was taken by the killer (finds like, pushed down and then desperate) and the murderer reveals himself I think the filmmakers took this piece on the head and pen and put it somewhere on the list of characters. The killer then undoubtedly takes a lot of time to describe everything (and then ten minutes more that puts his own hand for some reason) and finally gets stronger for the gunman. One of the most horrible movies I have ever seen. I would like to be more enjoyable by watching Lindsay Lohan's movie, I swear. .
