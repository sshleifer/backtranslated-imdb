As a regular listener of Rolling Stones, I thought this might be interesting. Not so, if this film is 'old age', in the 1960s. To me (a person born in the 1980s) this seems to me as a hip propaganda of a hippy propaganda, but I'm sure this film did not happen to me, but people who were doing I worked for drugs and stones, I was shocked, actually showed real life, hard work in the studio, largely I felt like working with them to reach the end of this bad film. I have not seen other directors of the directors, but I think they are following the same leading style, a 'amatuerish' model that gave them the impression of the Eurotrash TV show, misled, effectively put together and missing the real value of entertainment. My only opinion of this is that I had no money on it, it was free with Sunday paper.
