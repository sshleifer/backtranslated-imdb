I knew that my summary gets you. Is this film like Pet Rock and Disco? Well, unless you lived through the 1970s or 80s, you probably can't understand why anyone would like to Coke New or has a Pet Rock (and in fact, at least for Pet Rocks, I don't understand quite). They are a few things that seemed to be meaningful at the time but actually eliminates a little generation. That can be said by Kay Kyser and his band. At that time (over the 1940s), they were very popular and had enough equipment that the studio made them Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosi and Peter Lorre in this film. However, if you were not living at that time (it was good before my time), you wonder why someone liked this kind of “entertainment”. After all, Kyser and his band partners are very strange and their humor is very, broad (ie, unsophisticated and cheesy). In fact, I couldn't stand their antics and I didn't care that there were many musical numbers in the film. Because of these things, giving us great support was given the back seat and fans of these actors may have lost. <br /> <br /> The film involves Kyser and the band come to the house where the little woman and her aunt wacky live. Once there, the bridge is sparked by wonderful events begins. Finally, it faces other experiments on Sally's life and meeting (of type). All are played for laughter - and not really a terrible movie despite being thrown. Overall, it is an entertainment that can be approved for the best. As a fan of Lugosi and Karloff, I certainly heard that I think I have to look at Kyser and his strokes.
