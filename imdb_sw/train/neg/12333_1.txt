Un-bleeping-unbelievable! Meg Ryan don't even look at his usual beautiful character in this matter, which usually makes me forgive her deep trouble of ticky County. It is hard to believe he was the producer of this dog. Plus Kevin Kline: What kind of suicide journey has its job been over? Whoosh ... Banzai !!! Finally this was led by a boy who made Big Chill? It should be a replay of Jonestown - hollywood style. Wooofff!
