At first I was sure that this was a film made for a TV that was not eligible for a great time. But after a few minutes of panic attacks, I realized that there is a comic value at least on the top-up queues and acting on the movie. This film would have found 1 if my wife and I did not laugh as hard as we looked at in amazement that administrators can put the same face. It was like the lowest version of the Big Hit (I was very laughing to buy Big Hit DVD) and even worse. We were disappointed that Nick chose to marry Elena, and not Jim, after hugging and finishing. A few alarms and blows will certainly help to reduce.
