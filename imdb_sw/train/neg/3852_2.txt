Was this one of the boring movies I ever seen? I don't know why? Just your run-of-mill story about someone who is about to marry, and start someone else's idea instead. The story has been told a thousand times. There is nothing new or creative about it. I don't know what was wrong with this film. Most of the time these types of actors / independent actors include making a film that has already been made a million times before, it is realistic of entertainment. There is usually a very inexpensive thing to them that is not really true. For some reason, this is not just a matter of thought. You can take part of the funny, or the clever ideas in it, but for some reason they are not just funny, nor clever in any way ?? I wish I new how to describe it, but not me? Don't waste your time on this?
