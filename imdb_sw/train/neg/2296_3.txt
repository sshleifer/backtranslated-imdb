"More More" takes place at a dive / gas station in the center of the Australian Desert by Tom McGregor (Paul Mercurio), a shy young man who suddenly emerges during the time of the visit. What we find, for the first time, confusion looks like a flashback in which she and her sister (although their relationship to each other is better to understand later in the film) is faster through the desert on her motorcycle. Later, he looks very calm, and sometimes, the odds in the presence of the arrival. We know one thing is true and that it is a kind of McGregor's mind, its risky care and such-clairvoyance is just important for the story, which most refers to the three thieves diamonds that the car dwindles and who rely on Tom help them out of the spot without getting through them. Of course, Tom falls to one of the thieves, a young woman named Charlie, and suddenly, persuades all three non-trust partners. But not in a way that causes anything to be hidden or action. In fact, the whole movie at all seems to want to create something useful, but it certainly does it. Even the end, which emerges as a hot flame story (and one that reveals a lot of the faults of the story), is just almost like worried. It can be worth trying if you don't consider a very strong pacing, but it is in the weather, at least, for something different than usual.
