I have seen Horrorvision almost unnoticed. Just 70 minutes in length I found myself hitting the fast forward button again and again. Acting was of 'if I was saying and saying *** k much I am an intense' school. And the story was in the best condition that has never been given. <br /> <br /> When I haven't gone to the Full Moon for making good movies I've never produced as a bad piece of junk like this.
