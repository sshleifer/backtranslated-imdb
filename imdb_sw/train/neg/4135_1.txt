This film was so bad it had to move further to achieve good bits. Hah are good bits? The only bit that was worth it was the last (those who have seen the film know what I mean). I expected much from this film like grass to meet in the morning of the dead meets Freddy vs Jason but what I got is this trick. The story was to forget, cast was misused and what the director thought when he did this. This may be good but I turned out to be a great film I ever saw. Well, if it had a sweet T and A, I was after a year and I was desperate. Do not expect that the film is good but if you want the worst fear then by all means check this and see how the awesome movie can not do.
