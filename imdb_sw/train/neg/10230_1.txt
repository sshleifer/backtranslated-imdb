It's done on the copy of this. It's not mine and if I had spent my money on this I would like to see those responsible and allow them! All I can say is this will be a bad student film. Any understanding of the center of the film does not exist. Working is a bad god, the story would have been rejected from the original series of Twilight Zone as an unoriginal and blind, and the change of tone of the behavior of the leadership to 'spirit' is delicious. I can only agree that the 'renew' view of this film is from friends and family. I'm afraid even though it's not so bad. <br /> <br /> Amateur at extreme! Avoid! Avoid! Avoid!
