I lost this on DVD without any previous skills. I was wondering how Michael Madsen was in a film that I had never heard of, but it was freebie, why not look at it. Well / I think it is that Mr. Blonde would like to forget she has ever taken part in the shame of the film. It seems, if your script and conversation are awesome, even good executives can not save the day. Neither are the actors of the actors who climb this film. Many non-native-English speakers are playing part of native English-speaking speakers, reading verses from the script that should be thrown away and not made to the film. It is not possible how all the lines that are visible in the voicemail sound. The music is very bad and it doesn't exist, and one thing appears and looks like playing poor school. I recommend you look at it so that you can understand other films, better. This is why I gave 3 instead of 1 it is suited.
