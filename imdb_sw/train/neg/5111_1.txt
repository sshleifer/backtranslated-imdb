I was a brilliant viewer even using many winter hours to help build a house for the White Family, just being ill seeing a house after a year. All the rocky rocks have been removed, the rocky road and the front fountain have been removed, all pine trees and pecan trees have been beaten, the sprinkler system is finished. Now it looks like a disaster area. They don't even have any more ... they live "in the city" and comes out only for the weekend. It touches me to think about all the hours that Oklahoma's great men gave these people and saw the results. The story we all saw on TV was not the truth ... don't believe everything you see and hear.
