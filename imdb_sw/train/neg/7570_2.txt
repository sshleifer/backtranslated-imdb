You don't expect too much from the photo of PRC, and for unusual weaknesses - especially from Edgar G. Ulmer and a few with Joseph H. Lewis or Lew Landers - that's exactly what you get: not so much. This "epic" on African Women trying to incite rebellion against the British is not very different. Script, long PRC hacks Arthur St Claire and Sherman Lowe, is a trite, laughable, full of "unidentified" wisecracks and hollow holes of outdoor Mongolia. Trends, long-term PRC and budget expert Al Herman, is half- The best comatose. Exhibition, though - except for an angry and angry anger leading Walter Woolf King - not a bad half. When he shows, he finds the comic time, charm and spare and seems to have a good heck of time. Duncan Renaldo can influence as a Arab pastor - with his Spanish impression - and an old old elder George J. Lewis as Raaldo's opponent. Arab is doing his usual villainy job, even if it goes a little bit over time. Joan Woodbury is very good and nice to touch, and he and Renaldo have a great chemistry together, though - like the rest of the cast - he doesn't have any with the King. H.B. Warner, whose work was back to the silent era, gives a charge of respect for lower tax cases, although he has several lines and, PRC to be PRC, not cut. There are many photographs of photographs printed from a large-scale films of the same Arab theme - although I do not know one - and, PRC being PRC, no effort attempted to make it unknown: I have seen pictures of stocks that were obvious. "Yank Libya" is not very good, in fact - well, right, it says - but it will be worth looking only to see Parkyakarkus in his prime. I had heard about him and I knew he was the father of actors / director Albert Brooks and Super Dave Osborne, but he had never seen him before. It was worth looking at this PRC's "tenth rate" to see him working. Otherwise, neglect.
