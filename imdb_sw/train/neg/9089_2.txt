The movie has only one flaw, unfortunately this damage damages all the trust of the piece. It begins with the judgment of the work of Israel of crisis areas. It fails to address the cause of the Israelites. Egypt, Syria, Iraq and Jordan attacked Israel. That is why Israel "takes" their land, because these countries have lost their war. The film also says that Israel has rejected the United Nations for disagreement with Resolution 242. The problem is, 242 was immediately rejected on the establishment of ..... people of the palestinians, doing so. Most movies are shared well, and can show a player that changes the mind, but remember, when you look at anything, don't believe anything you hear, and only half of what you see. All participants in this film are Israeli analysts, and some have made many public comments, and remove any trust in their words. All participants need very much the history of the history taught accurately, not for the storytellers.
