If you ask me first it is better. See Sarah M. G., she is real, realistic, brutal girl, see Amy Adams she is just a little fool around her. He is nothing! People don't like it! Second, Sebastian was good and warm in the first movie, now is "the face of the child". The story is not good, and I don't understand. Why didn't they do this first, it's the beginning. Dear players, nothing and story. This is not brutal, this plays. First has the best actors, the best stories, and its meaning. I think the music is best in bad intentions 1 and music is best in brutal motives 3. It's not the worst movies I have seen, but in comparison with one of its first big, big, big, no big ones.
