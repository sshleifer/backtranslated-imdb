I just hired Creep and did not really attract. I didn't feel anything in this film. I felt sick because the year alone was amazing. I left out of my living room several times to despair that something would happen to this film. What? Didn't we see all this before? I did not like any of the male characters in the sewer. I heard bad for him. But again I could not think why he was still alive and not killed by Creep? Many questions need to be answered. A person describing references to the PS2 Silent Hill game and I can see the same. <br /> <br /> Not a bad film, not good. Judge yourself.
