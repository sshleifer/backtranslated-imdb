Yes, Marie Dresler drinks a transplant that she thinks is poisonous and leaves. <br /> <br /> Dresler is good. Never my cup of tea but he is a strong actress who really holds the screen. I looked at this for Polly Moran, whom I saw elsewhere. Here, Moran is the same - evenly - as a friend of a young friend of Dressler. The worst has come into the total problem. <br /> <br /> The program is a good heart. The wicked try to steal the people of the city. Dressler triumphs and all the best. <br /> <br /> I wonder about the order of the plot: bonds. This happened during the Depression so perhaps everyone was known by the bonds and what she could do if used properly and if used badly. I, however, not at that time, I don't know them. They are like different parks, right? It seems odd to create stories about a little person next to some modern financial institution.
