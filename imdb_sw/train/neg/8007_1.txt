In fact, I did not expect this kind of film out of America. How anyone can take the issue of child abuse and make it “fun” is just sick. Auteuil (whom I had previously accepted) around as a kind of child saving Rambo was not aware and visiting all children used for sex worldwide. What is the cause of the double is that stunning and the world's most enjoyable film "Happy" happened a year before this film. Menges and its partners should be ashamed of themselves. It is advisable to read some comments and more intelligent audience there. They could see strong care and ignorance of this topic. Those who think this is a good movie show the amount of uncertainty and you need to look at "Happy" to open your mind to true pedophilia fears. Do you think your child is more likely to be kidnapped and sold into a sex slave or hated by a neighbor, teacher, friend or even a relative? Hmm ... I wonder. If they make a film about the slavery of children of any kind they give to everyone to do so it is true and emotionally involving instead of this trick. 1/10
