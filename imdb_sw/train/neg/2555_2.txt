This movie is most likely of the most horrible fricks that I have seen. The length was not nearly long enough to insert a good storyline. Also, the way of the dead parents was simply ignorance. Suddenly the mother dies from the fall of swimming after walking on the statistical figure, and the father is shot by a police officer? I can see where some nature can be what they were going, but it would be better. Also, the cheesiness of all that has made me want to push to stop before. Having heard Lucy's name and decided to be 'Lucifer', I wanted to touch. Yes, it's interesting that Lucifer was a woman, but look at the name. It's a male name. It should be given a male character. All in all, the movie was bearing, and could be used plot plot.
