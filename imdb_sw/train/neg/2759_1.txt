Hilarious, a short laugh ... and still not comedy. I especially liked the ambulance of the ambulance to quake "bad bude" who then cried out to them "you dirty", I mean wow, a person's online degree in books is paying! The worst script to consider, and the introduction of a plot in an instant motion, ignorance in the story, the development of the ZERO character (even among the characters who meet. It's like they all know and trust for years) the voice of dodgy up and added echo The consequences, and the holes of the conspiracy .. oh God is the holes of the plot !! Being honest I write this even though I don't look at anything, but I really expect 30 hours ago or so it doesn't really improve the already pathetic experiment on the cinema ... thank you God we have good leadership to do a certain amount we forget that the film is a burden of ... well ... use the ideas for the conclusion of the sentence!
