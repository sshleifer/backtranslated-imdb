This Tim Burton's original remake "Planet of the Apes" from 1968 (and star Charleton Heston) is far, far away from quality and original plot. Certainly the special effects have changed since 1968, but writing is not recommended. The characters were boring and the conversation was bad. I sat in the entire film with a friend (who only deserved to rent) and was fully understood why, before Christmas, all the items of the "Planet of the Apes" on Target were on approval. My advice to Tim Burton: don't put this to your start. My advice to everyone else: see the original "Apes Planet" of 1968.
