I saw this movie when I was very young. It is, by far, one of the most amazing movies I have ever seen. Now, usually, I like amazing movies, but this was a little bit. <br /> <br /> Not a lot of movie plot. If anything, it starts like Toy Story, where things happen, and Raggedy Ann and Andy goes to adventure to rescue their new friend, Babette. From there, evil continues. There is a Mjanja, emerging, marine monster named Gazooks, and a band of pirates singing songs, which have just made a powerful film. Also, I can't help but I don't feel that Babette is angry and a little too. Certainly there was no film support. Now, although I didn't like this movie, there were several nice parts. I loved the camel song. Although it was a song about being alone, it was a friendly feeling. Then, there was Sir Leonard. While most of the Looneys were just plain nuts, Sir Leonard was the most interesting and perhaps funniest. King Koo Koo was just a little dirt that made Dr Evil look like a bad villain. Also, there was a song of Raggedy Andy, Toy No Girl. It was a good song for young boys who wanted to do hard. But, honestly, even these things didn't make the movie better. (But remember, this is my only view.) See if you are interested, but only if you have a "something" standard.
