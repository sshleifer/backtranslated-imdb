Jean-Marc Barr (Being Light, Big Blue, Dogville) has directed and interpreted this amazing film which is the second phase of some trilogy. I might be wrong but I don't think this part of the concept of Dogma '95, though it looks like that. I'm not sure what I think about this film. All actors are good. They give good performances, especially Rosanna Arquette and Jean-Marc Barr. Stories are somewhat interesting. But I don't know, there is something about the movie that I don't like. Sex scenes are a very long way. It comes from a fascinating work of art until a piece of modern soil I do not know exactly where it stands. Certainly not bad movies, but I can't advise people to see it and I'll tell them not to look at. Just do as you want. If you feel feeling and deserve, try, you would like.
