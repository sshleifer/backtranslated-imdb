It's like what other Dracula movies are always doing, Dracula's friends are always on Dracula's side, which is broken at the end. Regardless of whether someone wants to stay a vampire or not, I would like to see something like on the first movie which minion fights against his master. It's very surprising (since you can almost predict how the story goes) than just a priest or D. win the game (we need awesome squares!).
