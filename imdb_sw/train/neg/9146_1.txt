Sam Mraovich should not be allowed to touch the camera again. If he should be arrested there ... for the least of the small larceny. Any person who even dime even dime lease any trash should erase the claim and pay compensation. This was unintentionally my first glance of his "work" and it would be my end. Ed Wood looks good to me right now. When I turn this piece to the video store, I will ask myself to be removed from the shelf. I deserve to support homosexual movies, I am angry and angry and that this anger, a very heavy man is not allowed to distribute and organize something like this, and a good basketball boy on the lid (Jamie Brett Gabel, who, thanks, has no other characteristics to act on IMDb) with an amazing back synopsis that is used as a bait, and then sell it as a "movie" of the lease. Believe me, this is no place for any rack anywhere; not just a movie in any word of the word. The role of the offensive, which is not responsible for this can only have an effect on the efforts made to promote and support homosexual movies (hell, gay rights in general)! Gabel is not as pleasant to look at the film as he is on the lid, and looks once or twice without a shirt - that's it. Instead, the wise Mroavich gives us his self-indulgence of the dirt of nakedness. That "" "thing" gathered "is the project of the Mraovich. Both he and his friend Michael Habousch (who, I understand, provides the same waste) is bad for this. Mraovich is deliberately as a full talent (in all places), despair to catch any attention to "lose" who can pretend. He should be merciful.
