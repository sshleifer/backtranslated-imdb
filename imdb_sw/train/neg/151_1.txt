This is very awesome. The only thing about redemption about this movie is that sometimes people ask me what the worst movie of the vampire I ever watched, I would like a suitable answer. I think it's published on 35 mm mm so it's already like hell. I can't worry about the comments but I saw some fanboys (maybe connected to the film) said that this is the best movie since the Matrix. Let me lie and lie. Nothing is good in the film. Everything sounds. Leaves are bad. Choreography fight is the worst I have ever seen. The events of fighting are very witnesses. Imagine a girl clapping her hands around the circle without helping and giving a weak kick that can not hurt the kitten. Obviously, the director has drawn people out of the street to give them responsibilities in the film. I know the director did not have a great movie budget but still the best movies have been done on a small budget before. It was not forgiven.
