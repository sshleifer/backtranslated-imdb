I foolishly read behind the DVD cover of this movie in Best Buy about the previous year, and I said, "It looks funny, with Michael Clarke Duncan, how I can lose!" I paid $ 15.99 plus taxes. I sent it to the house of friends and we were all amazed at how it was written and done. Wooden displays are growing. All "hilarious" and "best" exhibits were never found. After 90 minutes I put my head in shame, I know that I can't get 90 minutes or $ 15.99 back. I almost cried too, because if that was so it could be considered "comedy" I no longer need to believe in movies again. My friend and I have often told our friend the fear of this movie to the point that he needed to see only the misunderstanding. More than a holiday season this year I watched with him because he didn't want to look at it alone. This was my second terrible mistake, because when I looked I was angry. I started screaming at the cinema, and not one talking to the cinema. Everyone knows I have found that this movie has been worse than what they saw. My sense of humor is sick and happens and often bothers my friends, but that didn't save this movie even. The fact that this movie is not on the list of less than 100 on IMDb is amazing. The fact that its rating (during this writing) is 3.6 is a crime against humanity.
