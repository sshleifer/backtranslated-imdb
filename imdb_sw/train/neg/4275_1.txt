I can't understand why so many people praised this festival. Smaller pieces are one of the most noble titles I have ever seen in my life. Now I have seen all the seasonal seasons, and see part of the season 2 1. I can no longer take this show again. 1) Where is the correct entry into criminal investigation? In the 1st season, there was an area where the Cooper Agent was throwing stones at the bottle. What? Can you think why you did it? He only wants to identify the killer by making this 'joke' talking about the ability of the Tibetan dream. Wow! <br /> <br /> 2) There are many unwanted images in this show. For example, the 2nd season started with a "funny" area where an old dumb man is using agent. bubu. That's all. This is a true and long term (3 min 30 sec .... It's like hell.) .
