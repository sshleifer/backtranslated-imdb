What's a bad film. It starts well, with a headline, but that's the same as it gets. <br /> <br /> The movie is something about the mouse that turns on the creatures and goes on the murder of the killings. Acting is not too poor, but the script is useless and the film does not even threaten despite the atmosphere of the atmosphere. It is amazing that a certain group has joined this bag of garbage and thought would make a good film. It is not a good film. It's trash, and I encourage you not to lose a moment of your life on it! One out of ten.
