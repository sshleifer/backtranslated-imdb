When turning the book on the film, it is generally a good idea to put at least some of the author's voice or concepts adopted, rather than ignore the author altogether. Although it is clear that the director had access to and suggested the advice of Elinore Stewart's children, it is important to note that children believed their mother to be a true liar in terms of good experiences, strengthening, and strengthening of her land. The book describes his life on her and her husband's homes in the vast area of ​​Wyoming; writes daily adventures with many friends and friends, although they lived several miles away. The film, however, takes the usual situation for the time being done, showing the woman's experience as bright, unforgiving, and almost uncertain. Perhaps the director was bringing his experience of Vietnam War with him to this film (like some film films), but it seems to be a great excuse to take pleasure and the beauty of this book and make it rotating, dirty environment without friends or hope. Don't waste your time with this movie; read the book instead.
