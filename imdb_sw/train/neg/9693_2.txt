The program "Bonjour sad" is taken from the first novel of the youth and Francoise Sagan, which was the best buyer, although God knows why. For young people wanting to get rid of a parent who can have an action may have some appeal. Do not be taken by the fact that David Niven plays the father of playboy and Deborah Kerr-wife's expectations. Unfortunately, it is very resting on the shoulders of Jean Seberg's fraud. He is good and easily fulfills the image of a spoiled boy. The problem is that he can be infected but can not do it. Anyone who saw him as Joan of Arc in the first film Otto Preminger of St. Joan - Seberg - knows that he can not win the film. 19 This movie, also with Preminger, fulfills the first "promise". It was his second movie; was now 20. What was the idea of ​​Preminger? Niven and Kerr can compensate for Seberg's lack of capacity? Not a chance? Seberg's character is in the middle of the story and, although he is good, although he may be 17 years old, he cannot meet the emotional needs of the role. I don't know if he has ever been a successful actor in his short life because he had no effect on my knowledge in his future photos. But anyone who thinks this film is better than the need to look delicious. In spite of Niven and Kerr, this remains the story of young people based on the style of young and beautiful girl who needed to work.
