Drew Barrymore has young Holly Gooding, who goes with a hack journalist Patrick Highsmith (George Newbern) and completely destroys his life by claiming his "doppelganger", or a bad twine, is killing him and his family. This horror movie of evil is a kind of hard to take care, even if filmmakers and actors seem to have died too much. "Doppelganger" is mentioned, as well as non-dumb dialogue. Other viewers will see the name of Drew's character comes from the role of Audrey Hepburn in "Tiffany's Breakfast", and the name of Newbern's character is playing in the name of the famous writer Patricia Highsmith (actually trying rewriting "Breakfast" as a horror movie, believing or not! I think that it is worth a loan because it is not quite your typical movie of fear - I mean, author / director Avi Nesher seems to really care about you its characters, and gives her film more than the usual trip to the slasher. <br /> <br /> After gray-describing everything-to-dialogue viewers, the film goes to the hideous, out-of-the-peak view that seems reliable. This film certainly does not skimp on the year. <br /> <br /> But hey! Drew kills his mother in this one. No, I haven't played. Traditional Barrymore shows around and just beginning to get a sharp murder. <br /> <br /> Drew always looks, and very sexy in this one. Newbern comes as a delightful person, "good" kind of guy. But the highpoint of the film should be the area with Sally Kellerman, an attractive old man who is very professional in his one area as an old woman who started a sex business phone (!!!!!!). The film is basically but it is easily loved on the slightest level of evil, of evil. <br /> <br /> 4/10
