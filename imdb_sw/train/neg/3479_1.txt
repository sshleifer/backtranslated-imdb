I went to see this film on the movie and I was shocked when I entered the room. There was only me and my partner! This sounded to me that this film is not very good. It's not my surprise, the film was bad. Ben Affleck has a boy who buys a family for Christmas. It is a very fantastic story and he will fall in love with a girl who hates. His work is OKish but with the comedy feature of the film is not very good. The plot line is poor and the comedy almost does not exist. <br /> <br /> However, there are some good points. For example, the family is falling and the mother is very funny. I hope this revision will leave some people lose their money. I was so ashamed when I came out of the room!
