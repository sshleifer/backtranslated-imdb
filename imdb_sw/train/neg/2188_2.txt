Following a car accident, an ignorant scientist (Jason Evers) sets the head of his girlfriend (Virgina Leith). Then it goes to the collector looking for a perfect body to do it again. Absolutely all the way around, there is nothing to redeem here. Also in cast are: Leslie Daniels, Bonnie Sharie and Bruce Brighton. One should have helped to keep this one of his troubles. Let's die.
