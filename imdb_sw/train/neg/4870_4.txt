The movie is bad. No special - just a movie "kid" and no big thing in it. There is one reason for this look for: animal talks. Some of them are very interesting in what they say, you can't just stop laughing. So if you want to hear a dog in a pound of dog saying "I am Keyser Soze", or another animal saying "You're a dead cat walking", or many other of funny liners, see. Because there is no other good movie to look at. Vote: 4 out of 10.
