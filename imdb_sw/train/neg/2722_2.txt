For the elite among us, "Intruder" is an unfamiliar movie of France from France which offers the so-called "art films" bad name. The story is something about the old coot of bitterness, Louis Trebor (Michel Subor), who goes to search for Tahiti for heart transplant, but moreover, I don't know who among the people in the movie were or why they were doing what they were doing. For an uncomfortable story of pride, the movie loses us early, although I am quite sure to admit that there may be SOMEBODY out there who actually gets a deep message in this film. <br /> <br /> This hard hog community runs two hours and five minutes - although I am absolutely sure anyone with any kind of life still continues to be executed with closed loans.
