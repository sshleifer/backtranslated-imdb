This unusual in DORIS DAY COLLECTION does not need to be inserted if he is only in the film for 30 minutes. What he does yet, is light when he is on the screen. The closest film plan is just an excuse to show players of the Warner contract of the day. JANCIE RULE shows the promise and it is a shame she was not a big star. RUTH ROMAN manages the role of "go-getter" and aplomb. Better if this was colored. The core areas of the Travis Air power and back estimates are doing well. What best about the movie is some of the amazing music interactions. If you have enjoyed your LUCKY STARS and Hollywood CANTEEN you will love this.
