Drew Latham (Ben Affleck) has decided not to miss this Christmas. Not only is Drew Millionaire; but also feel guilty of being too big. Drew returns home and raised a family that lived in, Valco, $ 250,000 for his "family" for the Christmas season. Tom Valco (James Gandolfini) refuses, but is eager to take Drew's offer. Christine Valco (Catherine O'Hara) has little to say in the matter, but she learns to have Drew almost ... it's not the same as the daughter Alicia (Christina Applegate), but that also has a chance to change. Drew Missy's girl (Jennifer Morrison) tracks Drew and wants her people to meet her family. The real park is in a shop like a fun Noel is a complicated task. Others: Josh Zuckerman, Bill Macy, David Selby and Stephanie Faracy. Affleck is comedic, though it's amazing.
