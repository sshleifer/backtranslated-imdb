Michael Caine has always claimed that Ashanti was "film alone (he) made for money only" with "the worst film that he has ever had". Hold, Michael, aren't you in Swarm and Hurry Sundown? And aren't the two films worse than Ashanti? Perhaps Caine only remembers the despair of punishing the stage film at a temperature of 130 degrees Fahrenheit (director, Richard Fleischer, was in hospital due to a solar stroke during the shot). What Ashanti actually happens if it is not a job under Michael Caine. Rather, it is a very exciting and thrilling average of talent, exotic areas, expanding to boring and stories of effective form. Dr. David Linderby (Caine) is a W.H.O drug which has been left when his black wife Anansi (Beverly Johnson) is missing during a help trip to an African village. Linderby gradually recognizes that his wife has been taken by the slave traders - led by Suleiman (Peter Ustinov) - and puts on the whole continent activities that ultimately leads to the Middle East. , big stars come with improper and improper roles for visitors. William Holden has comeo poor as a chopper experiment; Omar Sharif shows a bit of her customary charm or grace as a Arab millionaire; Rex Harrison looks good at the time of his short role as a helper who helps Caine in his efforts. The film depends on the best buyer named Ebano, and the little known author Alberto Vasquez-Figueroa, but the doubts that made this book very popular are not in this situation. Ustinov is a charismatic as a slave (he appears in all his movies that he can not give a bad impression), and Caine makes reliable pain as someone who thinks we will never see his wife again. There are often extending measures, but for the entire Ashanti is slow-moving. All in all, it is a hokum act - not as Caine's has suggested many times, but it is not a very stimulating film and certainly not stopping all of the talent involved.
