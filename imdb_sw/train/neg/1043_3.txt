What's bad, bad film! I can't believe all that is planned on this excuse, amateurish for a real movie! I left the theater before the end, and I wondered how bad the direction and function of the movie's camera was! And reading readers wishing to have the truth and the truth in this film all the time is actually a bronze attempt in pulling the wool in front of the audience and celebrating to be cheaper and tawdry. At least this film has shown me once and for all that Sundance festival has become a full joke and that being shown here is the most labeled to make a worse decision than anything else. Avoid at all costs. You will need your time back! I know I did.
