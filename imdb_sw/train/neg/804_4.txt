I photographed this 1 film since the plot was not very possible. Judge yourself. Understanding, the following will not only give you a plot, but also damage your desire to watch the movie. The computer virus, designed with a nerd nerve, uses a code through television screens and computer monitors. When the code - through the light - enters the eye can reach your 'electrical system' of your body. What makes it is to force the body cells into the calcium excretion. In seconds after being infected the patient reached his neck, the vision of the tunnel continued, his skin would turn white calcium, after which he fell with his hand and the flame would disappear in the cloud of chalk. <br /> <br /> This virus is very intelligent. When it comes to the fact that a computer expert is trying to erase the code with the output of braille - used by hands - the device is placed on a very high voltage, which causes serious burn wounds on the head of an expert. The virus also feels abuse against remote control and ATM keyboard. Fortunately it could be stopped by throwing more than the pc's previous desktop when rack and electrocuting nerd and behind it on a broken computer with its feet in some spilled water.
