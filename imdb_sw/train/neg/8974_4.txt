This movie, I will not call "film," was essentially on something and work more with the famous works of time. Well the war was full of swing, and this film gave our soldiers and listeners a cure. <br /> <br /> But let's have something with a little bit more. <br /> <br /> liked to see little Buddy Rich on dance. The music was very good. but one after another comes quickly. Do not know even Zero Mostel! so if you are one from the "greatest generation," as they say, you will be happy this ... <br /> <br /> movie.
