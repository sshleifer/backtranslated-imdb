The concept of the story is better. Unfortunately, the implementation has fallen. <br /> <br /> Movie is not recommended speed, for one thing. It should be an exciting journey, but it is slow and more boring less. I think the problem is mainly in screens and editing. There are not enough constraints and restrictions to hold doubts, and there are incidents that are not appropriate to move very effectively. <br /> <br /> Manufacturers should see this on screens and insist on Recording again. Unfortunately, when the producer is also the author and director, this is definitely not possible. Most executives seem to be flat, and that's under the director - all actors have been quite able in other projects. <br /> <br /> It is a shame, for by better writing, editing and direction, this can be a very good thriller.
