Anyone who sees a few modern Movie TV movies knows that the fidelity of the plot is the first thing that breaks into the planning table. So, when Lara's losses enter the Patti home and it begins to drive the owners of the house, I have never lied. When Lara finally finished his work with threatening the poor Patti, and accusing him of doing anything about it, I started nodded. You see, on the LMN Map, people don't behave as they do for some reason, they do so to set the stage. Only on the LMN Planet can someone almost have a homeowner thrown out of their homes through their power of cheating !! Poor Patti - he only believed so much, and Lara left his medication, and then there was this great battle on the levels involving a needle filled with deadly deaths that complement the needle into the stomach, and the body bag comes out the front door. Fear! <br /> <br /> But take it from me, this LMN Planet product is normal. You need to look at it immediately, because of the good laugh you want. At the level of improvement, I am filing this 95/100 film. Make a big bunch of popcorn and get the pieces of apple, too. You will understand later.
