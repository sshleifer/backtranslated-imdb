This document is a comparison of the last few years of the work of Betty (Paige Richards). Tennessee College was the most well-known queen in history. His most memorable work came in the 1950s and it was a picture of fetish, slavery and anti-cat "girly flicks". Irving Klaw (Dukey Flyswatter) in his Star Star Movie ordered Betty on what to do in front of the camera. There was no dirt in the popular image or "stag films", but however, Klaw was charged with distributing dirt materials and ordered to destroy them to avoid charges. It is not surprising that Betty had a ritual following the length of her work. The girl-second door with black jet hair, blue eyes and the glass figure of the clock wore a green gear or they could not rule for decades. After all, it has been said that he was photographed more than Marilyn Monroe and the second only picture of the world, Elvis Presley. Betty Page could disappear and dedicate his last years to religion. This movie really would be much better; but good enough to hold interest. Miss Richards is amazing in its own right. Bra, panties, garter belt and hose no matter what its image for at least. Also in stripes: Jaimie Henkin, Jana Strain, Emily Marilyn and Julie Simone. Be not advised this film can change your heart rate.
