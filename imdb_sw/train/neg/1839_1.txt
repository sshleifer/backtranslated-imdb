I couldn't wait to put this film in my DVD player when I used it. Then after the start, I couldn't wait to wipe the OUT of my DVD player. I really looked at all the movies. My wife and I were trying to wait and wait for something interesting to happen, but there is nothing surprising. The box reads if it will be really funny. Sound of sound sound good. Ben Stiller is funny. Jack Black is funny. What? How could this movie be lost? Well .... does not miss! This is the "unwanted" player I ever seen. Nothing I said and thought was even a bit of fun. It's just a bad movie. Believe me. Escape .... GIVE IT !!
