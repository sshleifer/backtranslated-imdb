Another turgid action / adventure flick from Quinn Martin Productions factory. Roy Thinnes comprises an agent of the Diamond (Mr. General, for you), working for his G-Man Assistant "Aunt Mary", looking for "Tree", who is on the message ... well, just watch the movie. This deserved it and got the full send to MST3K. As different boys and audiences have said, the film "Fargo" had more places in Hawaii than this film. It is being shot in an unusual budget, the film shows Hawaii's broken diving shops, gas stations, and hotels. Zulu - later being a star like Kono in Hawaii-Five-O - looks like Thinnes' lumpy, inept sidekick, while France France Nguyen food Jenny Craig food gone very bad. Others participating in the opening screens include Richard Harris knockoff, a follower of George Takai, someone who is not smart-hit-sprayed on Sansabelt slacks, and the "Tree" of "villa", the UK's veddy games. You can very think half of the plot through the opening credit, but relax - just enjoy the giddy mediocrity of this 70-week movie. Every time I think of this movie (and I think of this movie from time to time), I find myself stretching theme, written by flute and stealing ... nobody knows why. Recall for Trivia - Chief Diamond led by Jeannot Szwarc, one of the three directors of the Universal contract who would continue to make the biggest film, in turn Jaws 2. Others were John Badham (War Games), and a little colleague named Steven Spielberg. .
