I am a Christian and I say this movie had a bad statement, a misconception and an absolute presence of Christianity. You can also check "Remember Titans" and at least do not mix Christ on the soccer film as a formulaic steroid for lost. Let me make a positive view of what has distorted me from this film. <br /> <br /> 1. The school was in Georgia and it was a white academy school. I didn't see one student or a black player at school. I am dealing with the College of "Christian" south and were not built for any other reason than to fix discrimination. This is a problem when the movie is about Christianity and Christ changing life ... how to change the hearts of discrimination? (note: I loved the black coach of the sign, as it was done by the white team and all the giants' giants.). What? I can find people to say that it was bad to act, bad movies, bad writing and poor poor compared to other movies. If we could compare this with other soccer movies, would it have a charisma and the same power? The half-Christian Christianity that was shown was doing even less than me. If Christianity is about reading only a few scriptures and asking for a change of life, then don't say no one will listen to what Christians say. We want to sell Christ as a cure-all. It does not need to be sold and it is not worth connecting to such a life. It is not surprising that everyone sees Christianity as an anti-intelligence and this incorrect presentation. I agree that this film can be powerful for a few people. For many, it will not be. It will not give a real picture of the struggle and heart tension. The most important thing to me, is not a Christian in any way or stretch. It has values ​​but it lacks as a 'push-up-by-bootstraps' message as deep as good ideas. If you live with people who are struggling and / or living in the third world, this movie will be hollow as many churches are today in their religion.
