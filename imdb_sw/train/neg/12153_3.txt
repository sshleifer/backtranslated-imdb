Feeding Masses was just another movie trying to give a little money away from the ambition of zombie around, especially due to the popularity of movies such as Land Of The Dead and the Evil Evil series. It starts at a television station, which is protected by the military, and reports that The Lazarus Virus (Zombies) is close to the city and free to do their business again. The problem is, this is completely false. Zombies run faster and only a few people know. Among them are Torch (William Garberina), a cameraman, Sherry (Rachael Morris), a woman of luxury anchor (for some reason she is listed as playing Shelly on this site) and Roger (Patrick Cohen), military escort. Torch and Sherry are against the false to the people but the center is used for secret services (or another government organization) and they are under investigation. This movie sets itself behind the cover of the box that says "We hold the MASSES on the highest level than any of the three 'dead films" and George A. Rombero. " The source of the quote has lost all honesty and me. I would just say that this film is BAD. I don't mean as bad as I expected more (obviously I was, though) but I mean badly because I couldn't find any features of redemption in the film, nothing. Acting in all parts is on done or timber also. Does anyone remember their line or read cue cards? I can't even imagine what the best part of the movie was or the best actress / actress. Certainly did not have one. If I had to give someone a little person, I would say Roger, the military escort is probably the most interesting character but it is not really true. I would like to recommend passing this film, despite a well-checked box (What happened earlier on the movie). 3/10
