This was a good idea and the environment was good but that is the end. It seemed like the offender putting the park in contact with the West. The plan had no meaning. There were many characters and not enough time to develop their behavior. There were also unwanted things that were not related to the plot or did not help the story. There was also a long period of time when the plot could be investigated but it was used for silence or unnecessary conversation. The script should have more meaning and guide. I had a great mark of the question on my head to watch this film. But throwing was good in my opinion. If you just watch eye candy then this is your movie.
