The Good World follows the life of a slave girl and the poor farmer in China. The movie depends on the novel by Pearl S. Buck. The story is good, but I hated that they decided to throw Anglos in the lead roles. Walter Connolly is a farmer's father. He has a strong sense of America, as many of the leading artists, that I can't hold him. It is embarrassing that Hollywood could not adopt their belief in racism in order to expel Asians from leading roles. Taking Anglos and making them look like Chinese is like Anglos to put a shoe suit on their faces to play Africa-Americans.
