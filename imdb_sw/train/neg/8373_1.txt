I was not impressed by this film especially because I went to the cinema with my family with a good faith to see a film that was a 12A certificate in the UK. To my surprise, this film was full of the shame of sex jokes. (That's not a problem for me as an adult, but it's not good to watch with children). This film was often bad at times with a joke fart, getting hit in groin etc ... and for the most part of the film is not very funny. The scope of the film is that Calvin Sims, who is a 2m midget, comes out of jail and steals big diamonds but then he is forced to put it in a women's wallet. So the whole film sees him pulls away as a abandoned child, entering the house of women so that he can get this diamond again. So far, I have enjoyed more output from the Brothers Way - but this film certainly takes biscuits. <br /> <br /> Good advice - try until it comes to TV or Cable
