It was so interesting that it was made. The director / writer / actor must be realistic. I can't imagine any other way to approve the script. What I want you to consider is this ... when watching the film I had a feeling for executives. It felt that in the comedy club stand where the guy is dying with his feet and your stay, not enjoying, just very bad feeling for him coz hes to try. Id likes to know what budget, I think should be low if the quality of the film is very poor. I want to write 'joke did not appeal to me'. but the truth is for them to appeal to you, you would like to be the person who wrote them. or delay. So imagine that in the form of the script ... and this person has got a green lighting. Is that not surprising?
