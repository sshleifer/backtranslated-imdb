and does not support the case of rohmer that a few years later Syberberg came and made a very big piece of work on one subject (with little help from Wagner). <br /> <br /> maybe this movie didn 't look so when it happens, without a syberberg film comparing to, which probably shot on small voice sounds and a few resources. In fact I can't remember at a time when there is a horse in the syberberg film. I know it is all, the German version is a pure magic, while this looks like a college production shown on the film for reference purposes. It is not even here at IMD ... but someone lives on the 'air from the 12th and 14th centuries' or somethingâ€¦ well not a great help for the film it comes as it is not fair and cheesy, as the monm from the monm Rohmer is one of the French writers who love its leading men in general are not found, too, and that is not recommended. The syberberg parsifal was interesting, and it can be seen on a German TV today to sell some kind of special bike he made. I wonder what I think about the syberberg on the video is like. I remember that the last time I saw a film in the theater, very badly that the experience was misleading at 5. But even then it would adopt what this edition offers, I'm afraid. It 's hard for you, for chutzpah, but ... this film was only needed to design more bucks. does not look like a modern-looking CHEAPO! BON MARCHE !! oh yes, it's just an endless arbitrary and Parsifal going to church with this cheesy passion that is being interrupted ... blah!
