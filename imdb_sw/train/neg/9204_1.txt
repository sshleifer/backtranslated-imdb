I have seen this film often, (and recently read the movie book depends on) and every time I see, I just want to give it all four. The fact that they do not know that the behavior of Tom Hank enters his D&D (Oops M & M) :) persona ("Oh, he just does in character.") Outside the gaming session. That's the fact that after three months of treatment, let's just destroy it and feed its deception! This type of people is what gives the RPG bad name. <br /> <br /> Also corny 'love ballad', and music carried out by 'cat on the piano' and 'leave us if we are so much deceived' almost enough to keep your teeth on edge!
