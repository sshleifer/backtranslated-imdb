See, I read and read these comments and there is so much I want to say but I'll try to make it short but clean ... <br /> <br /> First of all, it forgot to forget all the bad things this film was done ... How it didn't show anything nothing of a bad reputation and I agree with many people here saying that it was "Hollywood", meaning, you expect a real life story? Where will people wake up and see that you will never find the truth about 2pac and Biggie ... Its all covered and buried down. Secondly, not against 2pac or Biggie I love both but 2pac and Lil Kim have been embarrassed in this film indeed ... <br /> <br /> Then, for everything they say The movie is awesome and can't see the truth, either you are too blind to see it because you think you know something about BIG or you don't know anything about it and you love this Hollywood film. Use your mind and see though clouds ... There is so much you can say when you come to this topic, I didn't say 60% of what I'm saying because it's a very broad topic but for the movie I can just say that it might be a bit, my meaning is better . But anyways I am just a man gives his opinion .... No feeling hard ... See, I would hip hop and I live for it but after seeing this movie everyone with little mind could see that this is not how someone thinks to live. And all of them respect 2pac and BIG, like all other artists who make life like this should turn to another page because it destroys the young people .... Bringing the wrong message to children and that is: not going to school but living from the street, locking and grabbing paper Hip hop really thinks about love and intelligence, be smart and all. Well / I know that many of you will think that I am mad, but this is just my attitude. See me maybe it's right about something and Im not saying this is a bad movie because even though I'm in hip hop for 17, 18 years I still don't know what bout 2pac or Biggie no matter how many articles I read or how much I help with listen to their music ... As many of you all out there. Only people who were around them and murderers know the truth behind it all. And at the end I want to say to all of Biggie and Tupac fans and family, these two people were going to be bigger than ever, no matter how they lived their lives but FUNA IN HOW TO SEE MORE, JUST AND OTHER RETURN, READ IN THE FIELDS FOR HUMAN RIGHTS LIKE THE WORD, IN THE YEAR. INSURANCE IN THE WORLD IN IN SOUTH AFRICA, TO DO TO DO YOUR WORK TO DO AND DO YOUR SOUL, YOUR MODE AND EDUCATION ... IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF DOING, YOU HAVE A LIFE IN DEFINITIONS! PENDA AND GOOD FOR ALL! RIP BIGGIE, 2PAC, AALIYAH, THE WORK OF WORK, JAM MASTER JAY AND PEOPLE TO DO WITH THIS WORK !!!!
