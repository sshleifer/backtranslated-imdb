Not the best film I ever saw but at the same time I could sit and watch TWICE !!! The story line was very bad and during the first part of the first story I wondered what hell I was looking at but at the same time it was so bad I liked it cheaply all the way. <br /> <br /> And Jebidia deserves Oscar for his role in this movie the only thing that has given him down was half way through suspending his silly name. <br /> <br /> The total of the film was good perfetic but if your post is cheaper and you look at the country of pound go with it.
