I grew up on the 'Superman II' version ("S2T") and as a child, I loved more of the Part I since it's not just the most Superman and the three types of Superman three, started with a bang? ? The best Clark Kent for Superman and rescue events. Children did not have the patience to wait for Superman to appear on the screen, as part of I. Now as an adult, I can see how powerful they fell with S2T (See: my opinion.) I've been hearing back-stories on how early and irrespective cancel the original director, Richard Donner from Part II. (It must be a rarity back at the same time for two different films at the same time, now it's normal: 'Return to the Future' and 'Matrix' 2 & 3 for example.) Unfortunately, after finally seeing Richard Donner Cut (or , "S2RD") I still can't fully recommend it. Gone, he was the superman's supreme change, the entire rescue of Paris, as it was the first part of the opening in the S2T. In fact, all wrote the words: "Before Superman?" in S2RD. Specific effects were not serious in Part I or S2T, but S2RD, they were most laughable? as well as Lois fall from the window of the Daily Planet. I will admit, some of the new events worked and others took the welcome to leave, such as any place in "honeycomb." In general, if you grew up in the S2T as I did, and like it as a child? not nitpicking as I like an adult, you should see S2RD quite if it's almost new experience of childhood and dozens of new scenes. (Spoiler alert) Unfortunately, the bad change comes to the end: it was also amnesia kiss weird from S2T to be replaced by the same as the last 'I.' This is not just a clever, unfamiliar, insignificant why Clark returns to dinner, if these events have never happened. And will he continue to "turn back" for every fight?
