I am a great fan of Charlton Heston. Certainly of course is one of the most actors of all time, but he was thinking when he made this film. Usually if he made a bad movie I could be blameing on screens or director, but in this case he is all. This film play is all his fault. It proves that even Heston cannot attract Shakespeare's story. I lost 2 hours and a half of my life in this snooze fun and I will never find it at that time. That's far from the Heston movie of the WORLD which I've ever seen. If you are a Shakespeare fan you will probably find this film, but if you lose your time, you will be sad for a long time.
