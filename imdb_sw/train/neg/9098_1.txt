There are some reasons why some films go directly to the video and of course the obvious reason is that if it is too bad for the audience of reminder games then it is automatically released on the video. Of course it will not be fair for films that are good and are still given directly to the video. This is not an exception even though the film has good actors or at least competent administrators: Amy Adams (is designated Oscar and a talented actor), Robin Dunne who deserves the best or at least a good agent, and Sarah Thompson who deserves the roles that are leaving from the young melodramas . The film has also been released: this film is done before the Cruel Inquiry so this film is actually prequel and instead of stupid. This was a waste and a film that is the same as the standard of porn and pay-to-view film sex. Fortunately for administrators, hopefully they will be able to delete this from their renewal. So if you're looking to see something wrong, but don't have the courage to buy a porn and then rent this film as a start.
