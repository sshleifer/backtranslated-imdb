Christopher Lambert is angry and despair in his appearance as GIDEON. This film could be the classic was Lambert made like Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump, or Dustin Hoffman as Raymond Babbitt in RAIN MAN, or Sean Penn like Sam Dawson at AM AM SAM. because the line of the story has meant for us in life, the help of Charlton Heston, Carroll O'Connor, Shirley Jones, Mike Connors and Shelley Winters were much better. 3 out of 10.
