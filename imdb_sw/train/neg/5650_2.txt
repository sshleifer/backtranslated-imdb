William Shatner in small doses is patient. Unfortunately, instead of stopping his behavior as a small anger, and being amusing for a good amount, it has proved necessary to expand his role and destroy it. As was done in the previous series of Star Trek. I think I won't understand America's humor, which may often 'up' to get a message through. I vote with my feet. I no longer look at the show, which is a shame, because the rest of the cast were beautiful. It is a pity that Shatner's excessive role also affects James Spader's performance. But many show how society goes, I think. I'm not going on the same journey. Frank
