All you need to know about this film occurs in the first five minutes: it seems to be cool, it has an original voice of the meditation of the late 60's, and all but its characters are different. Once you get the message, you can also change the other film. Davies's main character denies his good partner, one of the few people in his life who cares about him. Then when he gets his advice to join him in the real world - rather than live a fantasy film that he is the thoughtful director - he does so by expelling him and connecting with the most interesting actor. Couples laugh and the art of thinking you think are the only things to look at here. <br /> <br /> The film also attracts like the fall of Jason Schwartzman from Mount Rushmore. In Rushmore, the worst fear of Schwartzman was something to win, but here's the quality of his character only. The family of Schwartzman's family clearly reached him in this role; here is the hope of his choice to improve.
