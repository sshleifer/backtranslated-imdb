Thomas Clay has been mixing with the wrong type. That is a problem with young people these days, they have no respect. Most of this film should be avoided at all costs. Work in the main body of the film is slow and instead of postponing and facing the denial of drugs as if, as a director, they do not have where to go. We are told of the main character of the head, which is a bit of a stranger, we see at school and at home not quite accurate, feel a sense in himself as many young people do. Robert comes in with badly ill and starts missing school and using drugs and before knowing him he is a psychologist. <br /> <br /> The film is really about the total failure of Clay to understand the links between violent and violent pictures. Clay seems to think the generation of destructive young people is being abused by the events of the war on our TV. has still made it a piece of the most disgusting violence caused. Is this a real person? If Clay hasn't seen YouTube maybe he is a fool and doesn't know it will be done by a brutal brutal scene from his film? Everyone who would like to see it is a hiding place from the end of the film and I'm sure it will be a stick with people. Some films are not reduced by making many acts of aggression by killing the film not only destroying the young people who are actively involved in the fight, also condemning themselves as a brutal, worse because no better than its personal status of celebrity. Shamed for all involved.
