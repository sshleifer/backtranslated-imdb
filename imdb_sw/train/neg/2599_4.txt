I got a very cheap DVD and I am a total Drewbie, and that's probably the only group that this film could have interest for anyone. <br /> <br /> The first movie of Drew, looks good, and finds quite a lot of very beautiful scenes of it, like a swimming area, a sexy dance scene, a large number of so on etc. He never shows a friendly charm we know from his recent films. <br /> <br /> The movie itself is average average or small, and more looks like made on TV than one of the movies. There is no true fear or tension that is built and conversation is often interesting. <br /> <br /> The most interesting part is probably the end because I don't understand it. But maybe there is nothing to understand about it yet. But at least you can't reach the end you were expecting, and it also comes sooner than anyone would expect. <br /> <br /> Overall I think this movie is just for Drewbies.
