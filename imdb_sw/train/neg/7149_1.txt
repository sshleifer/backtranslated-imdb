Anyone who wrote on "Redline" as a great movie car should be paid by Daniel Sadek to promote this fire of crappy fire, a refuge of a run of amateur cotton. Easily movie worse than any car or movie ever made. This makes Children of Animals seem like Kane of Citizen. <br /> <br /> Take every sketch of a certificate from a series of TV series 80s, put some special crappy effects with disabled characters without importance and you have evidence of life that Daniel Sadek should not write screenplays with produce movies but they should remain in commercial real estate. <br /> <br /> This is just a blind movie with such a crippled program and a more active action mechanism ever. What causes me is not that the creators of this film are stupid but they think that movies will go to the public so that it is enough to fall to this trick.
