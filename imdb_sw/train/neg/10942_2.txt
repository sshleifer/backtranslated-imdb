Lorenzo Lamas stars like Jack `Solider` Kelly's old Vietnam and an army striker who keeps searching and destroying the message to save his sister from rednecks backwoods. Movie's are the cheapest and worst that Ron Palillo is the third dirty, and still has 3 minutes of screen time, and even that's not good. In general the terrible movie, but events with Lorenzo Lamas and Josie Bell depend on the tree bound and touched by the unintentional laugh. Followed by an improved sequel.
