Incredible. What? Finds any dumber than this? It's not a chance. Fools in this film harm even Ed Wood, De Palma, and Woo. If the first part in the series had a good and second conversation had a bad conversation, then this has an honest conversation. It's amazing. But this time the story has fallen to the level of negotiations, too. Despite acting and conversation, I loved the first two films, but "Cube Zero" certainly kill the franchise. A completely moral plan is seen from the left-winger pen. Sometimes I wonder if the authors left themselves as they know how to fight democracy and old dictatorship. In this film they are exposed to America? democracy. Why is not the goal of Korea, Iran, Syria, China, Zimbabwe etc. in anti-military movies? Indeed, many of these parts are not possible to produce a cube like this anytime soon, but that's the point. Obviously, garbage writers like this actually enjoy these forms of government, whether they know it or not. I would even like to say that everyone who promotes US foreign policy at all times has a democratic belief in its foundation. Refer to the film: without having to turn so far that it is not even better, the film has a lot of clear text. For example, for one reason the two men who manage the cube have done for a while and do not know the pain and sadness that the project involves, however the first one turns against the system! Anyone who has any idea about human nature will see right through this idiocy. Or how about the evil character, the evil chairman of evil who speaks as he plays with the bad Brook Brooks. In fact, once this creature appears the movie loses all the weight and thus any chance to be exciting: it becomes really a comedy.
