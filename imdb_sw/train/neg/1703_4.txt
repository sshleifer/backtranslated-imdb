Vet Vietnam decides to take the city behind the water to run amok, and anyone who enters his way is removed (including women). Released on the movie before the "Star Birthday", which turned his work around, this game of the club league with Kris Kristofferson is a thoughtless, thoughtless and powerful kilter. Published in Simi Valley, CA, the results do not go, with the redneck clich√©s and senseless violence that makes more of George Armitage's script's director. Armitage has collected over 70 years of its films, including Jan-Michael Vincent, Chief of Victoria, Bernadette Peters, and, for a little, Loni Anderson; however, in the middle of everything is Kristofferson, who is slick and ignorant. It deserves the points I think because it is not strictly prohibiting - but the bad vibes (and the peak of ignorance) wear the whole project as a bad stain. * 1/2 from ****
