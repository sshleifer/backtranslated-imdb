We bought this series on DVD because of all the interesting views we have seen here. I gave three stars because there might be little doubt that sometimes acting, leading and writing is brilliant. In fact they are very smart we did not see the propaganda that was so well spread in the series. If someone is looking at it, the person will see the entire litany of the right on the right wing organized by the Fox (Faux) News. To avoid giving any damage I will avoid describing all kinds of special events. A short look at the sites found here on the IMDb will reveal that everything from suffering up to the control of the gun to the right of the Internet to provide "Infomercials" and call the information is right with the best plot twists and speech release released by some of the best actors in the world. We looked at the many exhibitions and eventually left the suffering during the torture of justice by using Attorney General Gonzales as an example of what all suffering is used to protect us all. The series can also impose male and female homosexuals through subtle forms of conspiracy to show bad people. All in full litany full of great religious religion. Of course the popularity of this program will be used by future historians as evidence that America lost its way at the beginning of this century. As a student of history I would like to have this program as being in leagues and propaganda released by Goebbels for Hitler and some of the propaganda produced by Hollywood to the American audience during WWII. They want to use this as a teaching tool to help your pupils understand how the trick propaganda can be at all times in all ways. Just make sure you buy the cheapest copy so you can avoid stabilizing the ultra fingers on the Faux Web that produced this storage.
