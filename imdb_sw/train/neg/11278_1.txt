This film is just one of the worst films made and is a charge of claims on not just the British film industry but the talentless hacks work today. It is not just an ordinary movie that also has a good feature of British actors, so what is the cause? I don't know and just don't know how to interact with the debate because the movie was so awesome it is never worth thinking. warn and stay in hell away from this garbage. but it seems I need to write ten lines of text in this review to get more information on the plot. The humanity of man is placed by his bad friend and fellow worker from his father's company and thus leads to the encounter with Russian mafia and dodgy and ignorance accents, ignorance of the stupid plan. I would like to ask for my money back but maybe it's still a shock from experience. if you want a good film of crime to look at the usual suspects or godfather, how about lock, stock .... that's the peak of the contemporary British crime .....
