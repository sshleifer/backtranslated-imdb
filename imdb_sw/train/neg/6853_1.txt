Another way to Zick's Zickie Bridge from Albert Pyun great. Tim Thomerson's 13 inch Clint Eastwood-like cop from outdoor space runs a bad head (!) To the World and participating in the gang war in South Bronx! It is interesting for mercy, but it causes evil, and the effects of the cheesest since the Attack of Mama 50Ft. They should drive the guy to continue, too: See how the Thomerson sunglasses disappear and are available again in every shot. Laughably bad, but that's why we watch these movies, isn't it? Dequel'Dollman Vs. Toys' seems to be worse, if possible. <br /> <br /> 0 (of ****)
