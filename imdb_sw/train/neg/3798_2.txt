And that's the only reason I have this DVD. Now I haven't seen the first film Nemesis, but I reviewed the information from them and I here to say: What? Why? Because in the first film Alex was male. But again the first time was put in the future, so maybe this Alex is a new and only scientist has arisen to make Alex this time. Who knows, at least not spoken in the film in any way. Here is a quick summary of the plot: Alex, still a child then (or as you want, as it was, is, later) runs with his mother using a special time tool and ends in 80th Africa. The mother is killed by Alex (Sue price) grows in the African tribe. Then the tribe is killed by the cyborg from the future by Alex then runs and hides and finally kills the cyborg. So there is. What? The voice is known, isn't it? <br /> <br /> Terminator is not the only film released here, the Predator gets its good part and I think the first movie Fly, Price One Vincent, gets special selection to provide a solid foundation to create your head of cyborgs. Let's see, is it another? Well, the film was a very common budget rate, but it had a special impact on the mid-90 film. It would have looked similar to a flick of 80 how ever. The biggest problem is the plot. Things happen only and the viewer doesn't care about the motives. Nemesis 2 is not a piece of movies that I have been happy (?) Looking but it comes next to a damn. I will say nothing about doing, because we are honest here: Does anyone expect Oscar a good reputation here? Oh well ... at least I have got a Sue Fire price in that way of reckless. <br /> <br /> Flash movie "real": 2/10 There are not many benefits about quality. And despite the fundamental plot the film itself makes very little sense. Campaign movie camping: 4/10 I often laughed due to the seriousness of the film, so it doesn't have a small fit in it.
