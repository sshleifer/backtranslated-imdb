This is a very good production. A general consensus has been that when Princess Margaret may have been damaged and painted and she may have been exposed to an extraordinary luxury, she was a very beautiful woman. Here there was a more weak stage of production, the actor could not find it. It was also seen that the production budget could not stretch out to the pastor - from the start, the hair on the character of Margaret's Princess had a permanent bird nest in the opposite view and it seemed as if she had been trapped through a bush. The Duke's Edinburgh player appeared to be ready for his role by looking at Rory Bremner to imitate Prince Charles and was farcical. Production had an unintentional error, a shaded shadow, a disgrace. I think all readers of Daily Mail deserve a copy of the free DVD for Christmas!
