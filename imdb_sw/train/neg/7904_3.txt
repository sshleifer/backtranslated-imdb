Boogers little-looking little that spawn foam and give birth to themselves. So far with the features of this movie movie has. Some of the MUNCHIES play out as a long-term comedy which is so stupid that you can no longer get funny after 15 minutes. screens like Capt. Kirk log entry from STAR TREK, the most popular location from ET, Clear information from movie artists to "Look! We are entering the GREMLINS success here!" and Clint Eastwood County card tells us ... what about its western movies especially? That last was completely lost to me ... Oh yes, and the disposal of chemical into the caves seems to be a bad thing. I don't know where that idea comes from. It does not say that MUNCHIES is an incomplete film, for that matter. It's just true, really dumb. And if you stop to smile when you look at it, maybe you will feel like a mess to do this after you finish the film. Good / Good? Yes, but only if "dumb", "losing" & "ignorance" are the criteria you are looking for. 3/10 and, well, uhm, 6/10.
