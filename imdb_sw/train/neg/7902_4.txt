Cute and playful, but lame and cheap. 'Munchies' is another group of Gremlins coming from 80 years. I am not much of a fan of imitation. The first was 'Gremlins' very good. It came to the average 'Auditors'. > usa usa usa oul oul oul oul But the full holes should go to 'Hobgoblins'. <br /> <br /> Is there more? Now 'Munchies' for me would fall somewhere between 'Ghoulies' and 'Hobgoblins'. Actually I probably got more entertainment than 'Ghoulies', but I liked the dark voice. From going to go on its nature (which is much better), but because of that nature hammy act (Alix Elias and Charlie Phillips), they can get the heroic rather than that you just see the munchies running amok. That's where fun happens. In essence this story describes the munchies (which are hungry, horny and destructive) in the whole group of encounters (some time they work) in a small desert town like several people on expulsion. It's silly, but thanks to amazingly for zippy pacing. The creatures themselves look rather than bland and very transparently, since they are the basic storms. Where their legacy has come from is that they can actually talk ... and with a view. Charlie Stratton and brave Nadine Van der Velde (who was in 'Critters') was the right direction. Harvey Korman was accepted in two roles. Robert Picardo also climbs. <br /> <br /> Entertainment less refusal for undemanding.
