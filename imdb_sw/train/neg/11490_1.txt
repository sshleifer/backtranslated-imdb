I agree with everyone's opinion that this show was not properly developed and written. Work was not more than low production standards, however, I feel the practices can only depend on the materials that are provided and do better. Considering these ideas I feel it is important to explain that one of the actors has emerged and continue to keep better than this campy for non-productive production and to be an honorable and talented actor. A lot of badly caused movies to get a chance on the hit of the HBO "Dead Like Me" where he performs the role of Daisy Adair and on his loan is responsible for this role in an effective manner. where he played Ashley who was a smart but intelligent player of seven. I felt as if anyone could "do that" from this series will certainly be Laura Harris and the truth in its nature made the best working field in order to win the respect of many manufacturers who are now recognizing him with his talent as well as the typical Nordic patterns. If you have a chance to watch this series I recommend that you have something to look at after a cut like 'Godfather' or maybe 'Beaches' to remind you that there is after all a lot of true production and value out there and that this series is just a memory The lowest budget what Laura Harris can only say about her time on the show and I bet she could quote many young actors protection words to say "It's the beginning!"
