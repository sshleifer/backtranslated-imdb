Accurate History? Hmm ... Maybe ... if you hit, and the light falls on just a thing-so. But basic accuracy is not a compensation for bad, bad and unacceptable conspiracy, paperwork meetings and inappropriate conclusions. The main characters are only characterized; The embarrassing exhibition that emerges from the Americans of the "enigmatic and good" Americans through British officials. Inappropriate and inappropriate publication of an interesting period in American history. I want my money to return.
