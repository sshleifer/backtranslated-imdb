Dragon Fighter is the first Sci-Fi Channel (although I think now called Syfy?) The original movie I saw. But I have seen one or two since, and I can tell you that they were ignorant, but this beat down the barrel. CGI has been made well, acting is bad, the script is ridiculous, and what happens at the end of the end is unexpected and out of place (if you have seen the Dragon Fighter, maybe you know what I mean; put a spoiler in my opinion). Further, there was a single tune of music which was widely used for every sequence of hazards. That was a real fool; they just played regularly. And it is obviously not natural; I know I've heard somewhere before (I can't remember where). This is one to avoid.
