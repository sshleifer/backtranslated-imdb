Kenneth Branagh is trying to turn on William Shakspeare, a regular music player in the 1930s, and as a result Shakespeare badly and bad music comedy as participants have not thought once or another of two styles and in some cases the worst flounder in both of them. Specifically it is Nathan Nane, who seems to be under the impression that he is quite hysterical like Costard but it is wrong wrong, and Alicia Silverstone who handles the language of Shakespearean and all the authority of the young Valley Girl who read the script with a voice in her middle school. English class. Music numbers are developed by the "Girls in the Sea" high-school production skills, stopping to watch and watch while singing and dancing, as well as exclusive discrimination Adrian Lester who shows himself a royal song and a man of dance. The only favor of saving the film is Natascha McElhone and the contribution of Emily Mortimer as an eye candy, but they have given them a much better exhibition than this film and you would be wise to explore some of the other titles in their film pictures and give this extra mess.
