Are the filmmakers sure this before they open it? Script jumps from place to place without providing a lot of details. The beginning does not specify whether it's prequel or not. It starts with the Start of Superman on Earth and then jumps to action after the last movie - but it doesn't really matter to this viewer. Great mix! Superman himself is weak and needs Prozac. He is shown as a home wrecker, an excuse, and someone who is clearly depressed and frustrated. This kind of behavior rarely makes the hero attractive. The end is absolutely ridiculous. Superman lived in the hospital made me to kill myself. I am very trying to skit the SNL where Superman looks on Maury Povich and Maury says, "The results have been - on the part of the child, Superman, you're a father." In general - similar to acting with this Superman and Kevin Spacey, but the HORRIBLE script. The movie is completely unknown.
