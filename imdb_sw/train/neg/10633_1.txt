I watched this video in a friend's house. I am glad I didn't have money to buy this. The video coverage is from the 1975 film of Capricorn One. The movie starts with several clips of rocket blow-ups, most not related to flight planes. Sibrel cigarette smoker is a video of a few of the scanners who prepare video ads. She prepares her own voice instead of letting us hear what the workers said. The video is amazing with amazing display of Zapruder film. His claims on radiation, shielding, blowing stars, and others lead me to believe he is too stupid or has some kind of grinding ax against NASA, astronauts, or America in general. His science is bad, and so this video is the same.
