This is your usual movie of Priyadarshan - a group of characters loony out of a silly message. His signature period has a full source of film coming along and fighting in a certain hidden secret seat. As a winning lottery ticket to Malamaali Weekly, the black money in Hera Pheri, "the hoc" in Phir Hera Pheri, etc., etc., the director emerges. Don't do wrong; as clich√©d and its preposterous movies can be, I often end up enjoying comedy. However, in most of his films there is really good humor, (Hungama and Hera Pheri being good). Now, the hilarity of his films is declining as he is using the same formula regularly. <br /> <br /> Songs are good. Tanushree Datta looks amazing. Rajpal Yadav is irritating, and Tusshar is not much better. Kunal Khem is the same, and Sharman Joshi is better.
