This woman who works as a photographer goes home and laughs where she gets this hole on the ceiling. So she might know that her neighbor on her is a photographer. This film can be a good plot but then a drainage plot of any hope. The problem I had with this movie is that every ten seconds, someone who loves heroin. If they took events where a person beat heroin, then this would be a very good movie. Every time I thought that the place was going somewhere, someone put in white powder. It was a cripple to use drugs in one movie. It created the attention from the main plot and good news about the photographer. Lesbian things do not bother me. I was looking for films about art. I've got a film about the use of drugs.
