Tarzan Man of Ape is a 1932 film remake simultaneously, and as the original film, has little resemblance to the Burroughs' literary character. But when the 1932 Tarzan was reduced by "Tarzan - Jane", this Tarzan, played by Miles O'Keeffe, is not talking or even participating. He makes Tarzan cry several times, which looks like it was a sample from the original film. No, Tarzan has second bananas for Bo Derek as Jane. Or suppose, like the third banana in the left chest of Bo Derek and his right chest. This movie does not mean but show Derek naked. Two events in the film are presented in slow motion, and are very bad. Further evidence that no one cares. It is hard enough, Tarzan has an orangutan kick in this film. Maybe he car collected from Sumatra and the Indian elephant which is also showing.
