I think this is a produced and directed film. Benicio Del Toro should not work in the production of movies, he should put pressure on his acting and that's it. Steven Soderbergh has missed any idea of ​​a revolutionary, about his values, and most importantly about Che Guevara's life and so on. The camera is bad, as a person who has 2 days of shooting with it, music is ... I don't know ... there is some music in the movie ???? I will not recommend this piece to anyone. It's just losing about 4 hours in front of the TV or nothing .... I can't know how someone can measure this movie more than 3 stars. Close yourself from this "movie" problem
