We have a lake. We have an animated meteor crashing. We have a dinosaur of kill-motion killings and strokes. Well, then let's call this film MONSTER LAKE. What else can we add? Hmm, two idiots called Arnie & Mitch define the definition of the "comic aid". We also have to have a sheriff who does nothing in the film and no one hears it. Pray, we are more than half through the movies and we forgot to insert the bad guy! No worries, let's let one person with a mustache, take a shop to show that it is a bad man, then give him a nearby fish to the lake, take him out of the forests and all this for the sole purpose of finishing dinner dinner. That should work. The full, complicated films, this film. His Word will mislead your mind to compel laughter. The first movie of Dave Allen as "the motion of the stand". After this, he joined Charles Band for several years until the mid-nineteenth century, when Band lost money to pay him, I think. The effects of dinosaur are pleasant and the whole film is pretty damn without surprisingly funny. Unfortunately, that's about the only thing it can say about it. Good / Good? Yes. The logic of thought in the story should be enough to put it on the list. If not, Arnie & Mitch will make a trick. 3/10 and 8/10
