I would like to give this film 1 out of 10 if it was not for ms. The function of Claudine Barretto. and I'll take this time to ignore that Kris Aquino here. and ... end. <br /> <br /> I really have AVOID to watch the awesome movies of Pinoy because the story is not natural and I really think that (some) authors don't have enough attention to the characters (and their development) in their story (redundant ?? ). it was like they 'hit' the movie to continue when their story went out. and my goodness, the creativity of the creativity led them to stimulate other movies. why? Why did this film have a good review? I can't give them that reputation. The movie was a terrible KINA, but the movie seemed as normal as it deals with the Filipino logic ... it goes into my list of 'possible occurrence' group. I just liked to spend more time upgrading the story lines and fixing those past events, don't worry if the lights were spilled, regardless of whether the content would trigger you.
