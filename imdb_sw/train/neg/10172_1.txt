When I saw that Noah Wyle and Ricky Schroder were in the same movie, I was like, logo! I agree, I was interested in watching the film. And I must say, the first fifteen minutes or so it was nostalgic through. Then went every hill down. I did not expect to be a dump of civil rights jumbo. They took every possible controversial subject and threw it into one stupid story. I was surprised that Noah was involved in anything like that, especially his role. No one has a brain fully able to accept all of the result of the Vietnam War. If someone wants to know how communism was, sit down and read a book about it. And it is not the person who appreciates or contradicts it, it is only true of the cold. I just watched a few scenes here and there just because I wanted to see Ricky's body, but that's all I liked. Anything else about this angry movie.
