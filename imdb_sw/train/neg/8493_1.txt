Many days after seeing the Ada, I still fear that any group of people will spend a lot of time making the film as angry. No one should see this film in the hope of learning any results about Ada Lovelock, colleagues or products of its efforts. Similarly, no one should see this film in the hope of having fun. <br /> <br /> Like a sci-fi film, of course this will be a terrible defeat. Somehow, the main character can bring back to life and interact with it on its own computer - for advice and promotion of Timothy Leary's words. I believe anyone can stop their unbelief in this regard to be very sad. <br /> <br /> Like a drama film, this of course will be a terrible defeat. In some way, the author / director can fill in twenty-five minutes a regular, unwanted, irritating and insignificant moment of anything. I am convinced that anyone can feel that all the game in the film is used only as distracting. I find it difficult to fully demonstrate my Ada's degree. The conditions that I saw prevented from leaving the theater but no question that I would like otherwise. I'm still angry that I have lost time taken to see it. It's just that I might criticize this movie more efficiently, I'd like to be more than explaining.
