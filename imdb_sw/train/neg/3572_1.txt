The amazing "Z" center in Los Angeles showed this Zadora film about six months or after "Butterfly". I was very optimistic for the film actor, and then he goes from bad to clear to work in this film. Again, it was 80 and I tell you the work of Harold Robbin had been experienced by wise authors. Jacqueline Susann ran into it (hated his way of writing women), the work of Irwin Shaw was done by many women, and in fact Sidney Sheldon had her kingdom at the end of the early 70's and then came Jackie Collins who made women stronger and the same for every man in his books, even more. Why this work is avoided. Harold Robbin's work in the 80's did not detect the audience. Zadora also does one job of Robbin's work as if he was throwing a corrosion into the fire. Assistant support was not helpful. <br /> <br /> Oooooh ... this was a bad look at that time and even 20 years later, it looks worse. I was also hoping as an actor and all were shot to beat when this was done. It would also be difficult to also isolate himself as an actor (although John Waters gave him "Hairspray" was a spark) though he has a good voice to sing. Hey, Also, wherever you are. ..Hairspray can go on a tour! Join the show. You might be a bigger story to come back. <br /> <br /> I just hope to burn this film for if you do.
