Still Die Hard another direct to video burst and cardboard designers? How many more of these worst (and bad) goddesses were removed from the most popular films of the late 1980s and early 1990s are still out there? For a record (not that you will really care) this is still far enough of a mix of Die Hard, Under the siege and 2 full speed full of clich√©s and predictable. Unsupported dirt is an ordinary paperwork option to cut guns that have been sent by various means as the film goes on, the hero is usually an old cop or something that has family problems and views and of course brings together the party not only the emotional emotional burdens but also the piece that is compared to the eye of the eye and the angry child. Should have a luxury car towel between Florida and Mexico described carefully as a cross between a liner and ferry? this goes on to describe how it comes to seem around the road on rusty roads? in New Zealand! Acting is like wood like deck, the script's wonders, the one predictable liner, criminals don't know the whole and the plot has holes in it can go to the ship through. It seems to never be the end of this kind of direct denial on video trash that sets off late TV and DVDs of the supermarket broadcast everywhere (although this film is still bad and not yet available to see DVD) release but give me the time!) There is any chance of at least half of the efficiency, semi-reliable and most important ORIGINAL ?! No, I thought not.
