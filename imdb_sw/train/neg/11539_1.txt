This is a great crap that I have seen for a long time. Last time I hated the movie very much when I watched "28 days later" and "Magnolia". There is no absolute certainty for this film, except to see some of the sexual / rape cases and Gillian Anderson withdrawing from the road, and every single sentence of discussion should use the word "F" at least several times in it. It has a very cheap job and is a very small budget. My friend and I finally turned off the movie after half an hour. We tried to give them an opportunity, but nothing could save this. Don't see IT !!!
