### Spoilers! ### <br /> <br /> What is this film offering? This registry editor and movies that match the awesome plan. It is sad to see Denzel Washington's talent lost in this way. And we know the father is a shady character, he is Mexican after all, unlike the wife who loves more creasey because she is American. He killed all who think he died. And did it? Of course, he can't, he is a small child and you don't think hurtful fan feelings of Hollywood. Remote business was the only thing that prevents you from the lowest "implausibly" success (as a critic said) 'Taken'. The nausea of ​​such movies will take time to go. It is at the level of such movies that we deserve credible for IMDb.7.7 for this film and 7.0 for My Mys. Go to the figure! The mine will be at the rate of 3.5-4.0
