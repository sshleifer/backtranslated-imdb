Okay, don't let my summary be a fool. This movie reduces HARD. But the worst movie ever? This movie was awesome in ways that people should not split their minds to describe. But it's not worse than Manos: hands of fate, hobgobblins, fear of the island of spiders, or a few of the movies. If the movie reviews are approaching, it is terrible. Do not see it out or can develop health problems. But there are worse movies.
