I saw this movie a few years behind the BBC i sat on it. How? I don't know, this is a way up there in the "very bad" chart "Little" Kidman chart, Baldwin, and Pullman should cringe when they see it now. Leslie Nelson.it was again tonight I tried to look at it again but life is very short. A few minutes I watched it for Nicole's favorite warmer around 93, has Baldwin ever made a good film? Pullman played a stock in the "nice but dim" business of the F-word coming out of his mouth when a woman from "frasier" miscast ed as investigating his accusation of a murder voice is not correct. stay well.
