I saw this film a few years ago. I would sleep and there was nothing. So I got it. What I find is really worthless and that's why it bothers. Richard is tied to a chicken wire and Jarvis begins to do with Richard's girl when he doesn't know. Then a friend of Jarvis, Troubador plays a stupid song on his guitar. The next morning shows the girl of Richard talking to Jarvis and Trouby and then walking back to Richard and looking at him while he is still bound. Then they play fun music and the movie is finished. What do I mean happened? Did they break? And what was he telling those two boys (Trouby and Jarvis)? Its amazing and poor. I can't enhance movies that are troubling and unavailable. This was the worst film I ever seen since the 90th edition of the Lord of the Flies.
