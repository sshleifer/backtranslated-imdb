This is the first time I saw the movie by Jamie Foxx, and I bet it would be my end. I couldn't see why she had said, although people in the audience thought it was very funny when she made a face to the camera, or to say "I'll go to the shower". <br /> <br /> The plot is quite possible. A bad person comes after a good person. A good man has a woman, so a bad person uses. In the middle, officials voted. Last features are not completely trusted. You spend two years with millions of dollars to expel a boy, but do you do your homework to solve a little riddle? <br /> <br /> There is no good work, no part of a plot or story, and a shot is made for MTV. Don't waste your money on this. <br /> <br />
