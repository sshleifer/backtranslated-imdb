I totally agree with the review by a different type of review that the film has never been interesting, interesting or comprehensive about the creative process as its foundation would seem like a document. Gentle is aggressive and lighting is a big problem. If the film should be characterized by poor lighting it does not strengthen the performance and sometimes it is difficult to detect performers' performances. Most non-South Africans will have difficulty following English spoken in the film and some of the inner humor will perish in the process. I watched the film at the National Cinema Festival last year. The views and results of the film were generated by unidentified and unhappy until they left to welcome them from the film about our breathing period. Unfortunately Bunny Chow will not be remembered as one of the bright African white lights, but some of the amazing films about our history of racism will actually be counted among us the best in our 110 year film history. It is not surprising that the film disappeared from the cinema in Cape Town just two weeks after being released from many movies in Durban and Gauteng. It has a clear appeal among South African audiences.
