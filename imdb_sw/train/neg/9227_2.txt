CQ was the worst film I saw this year. Almost every film I have chosen to see in the playground is at least entertainment or has something to say. This film seems to be directed by a film student for its Intro. for the class of paint. His father makes a good film. Her sister did good. But the Roman brothers? NO! One critic had the courage to compare this film with Leardpard. At Coppola, Jr. he got the same idea, the film about the film, he tried very much to make himself to Europe, veryay, and witty, all the time is just kitsch. The leading actor carries the same words through the entire film, as he is scared or with the shock of this film being done around him. Schwartzman somehow can cancel his role as a director of flamboyant. Depardieu is the same. One part that has any true spoof film all the time is amazing, not just the B movies, but one that comes from Italy; A shooting session of several characters into a very small car, driving around and leaving people without civilians. This is the only thing that reminded me of movies that I think she was trying to destroy. Or turn off. Or both. The document that leads to chatting on the camera and hiding the various items outlined, the last was placed on "moving" or artistic value ... I think the funniest thing about this film was the film itself, and not in that way. It is not surprising that this film was returned after the observation of the ceremony to regenerate or reopen or anything, which makes me curious how bad it was before. I can't believe it would be worse than this. If you want to see the beauty of the film watching the Austin film. Any of them. The third opening is more entertaining and more confident than all this film. Lil 'Romy, for movies, PLEASE go back to watch your cousin's music videos. Leave the Muslims to the father.
