I commented on this when it first started to pay "fingers in the middle" review, saying that I will give you the most beneficial course of the first event. I have seen a total of six cases now reaching this point in June 2006. And as a fan of Batman of all life, I can say without hesitation: this show is a perfect crap. Everything is wrong with that. Everything. Through the animation and creation of pride, stories are unfamiliar and unfamiliar with the development of the dreck writers to give any substance to any story. <br /> <br /> And for God .. .is is just me, or is the Joker in ALL EPISODE? Is Gotham a great system of door right? Or, again, it is a complete lack of concern in authors putting any effort in other criminals (see "no development of behavior", above). And making things worse, every single Joker story is the same as the part of the 3. <br /> <br /> 1) Joker causes people. Joker sets the whole city. Batman saves the day. Pty. There was one place I saw that was not a Joker story. The head is running, but the villain was a good cluemaster ... "Think Thank Thunk" section and show the quiz. That was one of the worst stories of Batman I've ever seen, heard or read. Yes, worse than "I've had a Batman in My Chance." I can't say I really feel this show is because it probably contradicted ToS, but it starts with "B" and poetry and "fastardization". Thank you for the presence of Timm / Religion / etc. The era of the entertainment of Bat, back from the days of Fox and Children WB. Good pieces, and I had to know this, it would not be possible to live forever, unfortunately.
