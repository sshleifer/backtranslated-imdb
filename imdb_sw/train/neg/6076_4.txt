In FAN Robert De Niro plays with Gil Renard. Or is Travis Bickle? or Pupkin Rupert? Or Max Cady? You can see the problem with this kind of work is that De Niro has played a very similar role in TAXI DRIVER, King of Comedy and CAPE FEAR and unfortunately the characters were better developed and had the best documents. It was a little hard to believe that Renard would have started as a fan obsessive fan games into being out and out of psychological <br /> <br /> column character is not just a problem with this script - It also lacks a target attitude (the problem I had with untouchables where De Niro superb but ended up a little flat), with several stretches of the movie I kept thinking that Bobby Rayburn was the main character then switch back Renard. It also seems to be broken by many sports fans who seem to think this should be more concentrated on baseball. I am not sure if this meant to appeal to the original baseball fans but again there are things that its taste have and if the manufacturers made up their minds who has and what stories should focus on <br /> <br /> I accept I invite you to FAN (Especially for soundtrack) but it is very flawed film and it should be remembered that for the 1990s the characters have been stalked with nutters as in SINGLE WHITE FEMALE, HARM ENTRY etc. lasted the steam long ago
