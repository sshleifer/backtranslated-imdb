These were more than 80 minutes of unexpected boredom. First, I wondered how it is possible to produce something like that. Then, until the 70th minute I was making sure that it was a few minutes, and I lived at the very end that I am very proud of as I think I am watching this film as a great test for people's patience and patience. Was it worth looking at all? Well, as I have written above, if you want to try yourself, try and strive very hard, you can even end ... The movie is not recommended for characters and they seem to have no common sense. All events in the film, you can certainly have seen somewhere before, and seem to put on this film to fill the film film.
