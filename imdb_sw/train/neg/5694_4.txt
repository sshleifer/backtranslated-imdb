I will be honest - because I rented this movie because I am a big fan of Kyle Chandler (especially from the Genesis Edition). Since he is playing a good man, I wanted to see him with a different role (due to curiosity). The plot itself has also drawn me; who likes to be a hitman (Tony Greco- a.k.a. Mr. Chandler) must kill someone easily before being trusted with life - or, death-witness who will witness a person "in the family". The movie was not as I expected. It was sick, I hated the last (if you saw it, you would know why,) and there were many unwanted parts. Basically - it was dirty, and it didn't mean a bit. Yes, it was a group movie, and that's the gun going to BOOM. But there is more than a film than that. This film acted if it didn't have time to get in - just look at it and understand it. The true actor was made- James Belushi was very amusing as "Rose". Sheryl Lee made Angels appear as honest as she could get. She was very surprised. And Kyle Chandler was similar to convincing as a tough alien to "family". If only the script did justice for executives.
