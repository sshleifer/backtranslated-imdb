First, I would say that I am the most faithful in Fanpro's items. I see it as a way to proceed with a good show long after deletion. Star Stars and Wars of Wars The Revelation are examples of good efforts. So I have a soft spot for fanpro things which means I will look at things I could do wrong. <br /> <br /> So on ST: HF. Well, first of all good things. The effort is a great place to make any reliable display, for the most part, the crew of the various sailors seem to have a good time and their roles. Then, the effects are not bad for home efforts, without anything that makes them real. Stories are not very bad either. There is no great creativity, but things that have enough and at least there are continuous text. But it has many errors. First, although it is obvious that In order to stop images of Star Trek, fix back, music and effects, I don't see why they continued to redeem almost every sci-fi music made. Everything from visitors to the Starship Troopers brings the head of orchestral for one step or another. Similarly, many images come from other movies, CGI securities to make them different. The Black War, for example, though they are hiding, are quite clear the Star Destroyers from Star Wars. And the center is also open battlefield of Fleet Ticonderoga from Starship Troopers. Also, the sound effects from various Star Wars movies appear in the war between the fighters, as they are shared on the video. In one place for the first or second season, I think, even see two fighters of TIE fly back during the war, which barely make your suspension for any unbelief. <br /> <br /> Acting varies from wise to feel painful look. Everyone keeps improving as the development of seasons, however, but expect to spread over many screens, especially in the early season. They have also made an interesting decision. Let's just say that the callers of food on this show seem to be fully on the “cake” and stop it. Overall effect of recycling is generally appropriate in general. But in fact they should have a death club to kill someone who decided to use fans of cheap Ferengi and Cardassian for anything except the use of back or "adopt" shots. They are mostly non-real. Every time I saw one of these (without trying not to laugh too much) I continued to expect a bad spirit wearing to pull a gun and declare that "This is a stick-up!" In one area "Cardassian" actually speaks when wearing one of these. Not just the lips do not fit, but the mask does not even open where the mouth should be. One needs to be beaten hard. They could not take a trick for them, for good! There are also some good work done, but the work of unusual decisions, such as Herman Munster looks similar. The Scriptures, although related, are not new. Instead the script runs like the promotional DS9, and the shipping from DS12 to various missions. The new enemy, "Gray" is not very dangerous and the line of conspiracy that you are dealing with is the renewal of Borg fiber. ie Starfleet facing Gray, Gray is very powerful, Starfleet do not have to escape with their lives, then through technology they begin to find ways to fight the enemy etc. etc. All that was done before Borg. The skeleton of doubt is the conversation. The Trek Star authors have been able to write "insert technobabble here" on the script. It usually means to be displayed on a recent anti-enemy program by using the "discrimination phase" or "separation charges" etc. In other words, anger that tells you that it is on trial and resolution is close. <Br /> <br /> The words are just gibberish. I have no problem with this, but where ST: HF makes a mess where they include the real views of the world in this concept. Wise advice such as "We need to connect" looks good, but not the time spent by the trio characters already standing in the group. Similarly, when asked what the situation is, a wise officer has heard the answer "We count the three battles". Did he really need to count? C'mon! I expected a question to ask him "Are you sure?" or "Can you double-check". But my opinion of all of the favorite is this: <br /> <br /> Captain: "Can we establish two contacts?" <br /> <br /> Labor Officer: "No, we can only send and receive." <br /> <br /> Yes, duh! ..... <br /> <br /> After saying all of the above, the show improves the time it goes. 1 and 2 times are very bad, 3 shows improvement but 4 & 5 is where it starts to get better. The 6th season so far seems wise. <br /> <br /> I have a problem with their media choice for exhibitions though. Quickly comes, by frankly and migrating to the divx / avi system better. Some of us if we really take our downloads download and watch them on a normal size screen and not look at a small QT window on a computer monitor. It's not just Quicktime to make it hard, but the resolution of 320x180 displays inside is not slow. In fact, it makes the exhibition unknown, if they were a copy of the generation of the tenth generation of VHS. Few could do this with this downloaded option. <br /> <br /> However, the show has promises, and I even start as certain characters. But that's the top 40 episodes, so I don't know this says that a lot about the development of behavior at all. But what can you say, it's free? ? Or are you three years old?
