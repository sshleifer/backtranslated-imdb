Unhinged follows a common plot of early 80's trends. Very good young at risk. I must be for a film manufacturer who used a helicopter for some of the early-road road shots, in fact you think for the second will be the best in production. Looking "Unhinged" was like seeing a class of amateur who go through the heat. Some of the worries, the worst, on the scenes are beaten out by the deficit of the Valium overdose. I wondered why they did not just keep the cards on the camera so the artists would not change their eyes constantly. Two big girls were chosen because of T&A rather than talent. Laurel Munson as a great Terry chick is exciting as looking dry paint. Two nude events make fun of young people. Janet Penner and Virginia Settle as a male / angry daughter and mother chicks find themselves beaten and compete for doing the worst work. Long, good words, insist on the wrong word, it's all there and it's fun for those out there who love bad films. Exhibitions change suddenly and out of long black can drive Mack through. The cartoon diagram is hit on shots without even shining to show the sky. Eyesties eyeshadow mocks the viewer. But you know, it grew up on me. I felt sorry for that. I wanted to hug you, kissing it boo-boos and doing better. The latter does not do with the damage caused but I have been caught. I have my theories about all "banned" and hope that anyone who chooses to watch this film does so for the misuse of drugs and a sense of humor. Otherwise pass.
