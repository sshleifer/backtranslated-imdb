According to the recommendations of a friend, my wife and I invited other couples to this film. I apologized to them - all four of us hated it and spent all our time looking at our clock swinging the film so that they ended up. Half of the vignettes are wonderful, very worth of entertainment. There were a few events in Paris - for example, I expected to see pictures of the Latin area, but I didn't recognize anything. Many parts were inside the bar. No one in the playground laughed anything, or made in any way. If you would like an amazing, engaging, foolish, films, don't miss this. If you are down on earth like me, you will have pity you saw.
