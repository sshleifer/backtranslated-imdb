I understand wanting to make a film with different colors and differences. I understand the views of the original auditor that this is an unknown movie of the movie. My step is as soon as this movie ended my first comment was: "This is what happens when a rich princess wants to become a film star and she doesn't have a talent" ..... she uses her father's money to make a film she writes, leads, and pays for. .... open to the film to realize there was no development of character and no instructions like beginning, middle and end ...... part of the voyeur was good and edgy but what was the point? I saw women go home, find pictures, violate the guardian, come out on a very cold night (not reliable) to watch the noise and run over her guardian partner .... The movie is approaching ...... In fact I want to know what the point is .... what the vision of directors ..... why is there no development of a dead partner? Why is there no history on the guardian? What does the vision of the night mean? What? What is it on the car? Why is the dead guardian? Why tell us about the patient's mental / filtering patient? What and urn? Oh and the lights are that we think to mark who this house is? Location? Why? Why does the guardian feel like his home? The same thing was never followed ...... like William Defoe ... I used this movie because he was in it and is known to the edgy characters ... to write again and tell me what I need to learn. of America who loves movies .... Chris ....
