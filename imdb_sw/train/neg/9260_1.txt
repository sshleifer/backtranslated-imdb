The only link to this film is concerned is that it is very bad. I would like to hit my finger with a nail nail than to sleep again. Even for TV movies are flat. Sent is boring. Screenplay is as exciting as a sand bowl. How the two directors planned to create a similar film will remain one of the greatest 20th century century. If you're tempted to see this, call in, set your alarm clock for 90 minutes and enjoy. With any luck you will be faster, and the alarm will wake them once more worse. So, this movie.
