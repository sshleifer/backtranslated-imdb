The fascinating concept of vampirism has something to do with the virus (but it has been done several times at the moment). Editor can be passed. Sorry to hear about trouble and credit. Maybe the movie ran on the market. Lighting was very dark in areas. But the worst trouble of technology is sound. The level was good enough to hear the conversation, but many of the interior have a voice of echo to them, which confuses them very much. Nor did they concentrate on recording, or mixing sounds would be better. Also, many natural sounds went through. He should have found someone to do the effects of karate events. The clank of the swine's hitting swords was not the sound of the epic war. Especially in anti-editing events is required to be tough. <br /> <br /> Also acting was a little flat. Sorry, but when I see that the person is writing and starring in the film, in my experience is a red flag. But it was a good effort so I gave him 4.
