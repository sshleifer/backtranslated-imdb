Ronald Colman won the best Oscar for the performance of surprise as the famous thespian style who has lost all of his responsibilities, especially like Othello's Shakespeare. George Cukor's proposed film has an amazing nature, after it was written by Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin. Unfortunately, the magic flag comes as you feel here, and the business of the backstage approaching. Miklós Rózsa also won Oscar for its symbols, and Shelley Winters has a short time of hard waitress (when Colman's exhibition gets in touch with him, he asks, "What kind of nut?"). Otherwise, this situation is obviously clear, amazing draggy, and not very funny. * 1/2 from ****
