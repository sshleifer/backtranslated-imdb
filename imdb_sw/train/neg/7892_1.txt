It started with an interesting premise. I am always like the civil war and ancient civil society. Most of the film continued, the more I realized that this was the best B movie. In the last half, it quickly became a movie C, then D, then F, then "I wish this was not a tax so I could put it on a microwave!" I can't say that acting in all cases was bad, many more. Writing, however ... I never read the book. Perhaps the book is well written. Screenplay is written 10 years old. It was ridiculously shallow, drab dialog and uninteresting, characters like as interesting as a 5 pound bag of fertilizer. I loved this film, just as my wife did. I am a Christian and I have no problem with movies that promote or support Christianity. This film made great freedom for the reason. Bad, terrible, useless. If you liked it, I have suggested Superman 4.
