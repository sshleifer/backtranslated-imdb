One should tell Goldie Hawn that her work as a thirteen-year-old boy has died thirty years ago. This is one of the worst films released in the years, an unequal epidemic which two directions are devoted to their private trademark displays in their efforts to make a bad and bad script lead. This should be beaten at birth. I hope John Cleese was paid for his name was associated with this tragedy. He is the only actor who came through this most fascinating or less aggressive way, his only mistake that he failed to realize that all others would photograph.
