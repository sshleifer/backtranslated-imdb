From reading all the comments sent here to the IMD, this film seems to have been hit, but I didn't think it was bad. I have seen the worst, true. It is a spirit story about a husband and wife, Ted and Laura Fletcher, and their daughter, Amy, who come into an old house in Japan. They know little, the Japanese nun killed his wife and girlfriend with cruelty, and then killed himself 100 years earlier with a samurai sword. Like the amazing things happening inside the house, the ghosts of old residents begin to own living bodies, and plan a promising plan of bloodshed that occurred 100 years ago. <br /> I saw this movie and decided to give the opportunity, from the lid it looked like a good story of good spirits. It was normal, and it was Corny, but I found it most of my time. The spirit of the spirit was being carried out a little, we see the figures of blue-tinted randomly pop up randomly close to the family, and taking their bodies. Be honest, ghosts in this kind of film reminded the ghosts on the Haunted Mansion journey in Disneyland. I would be wrong, but after watching this, I saw that the film of Japanese fear "Ju-On: The Grudge" and the American remake of this film broke this little. The old Japanese house where brutal massacres took place, the activities of the soul, the curse were placed in the house, etc. But I cannot be wrong. <br /> <br /> To count, this is a good story of the soul. Don't remove your way to see it, but if you like this type of thing and it comes to the TV you can shoot it. 4/10.
