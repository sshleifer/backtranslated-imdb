For my life, I can't find a reason to want to make a film about "Jerry Springer Show". So it's very strange. Other ways, sadly is the pleasure of guilt. We all have to admit that we have seen at least one place. It is part of our pop culture. I saw it here in America recently. It's very bad. I will admit that. Jerry is doing a terrible job of what I think he meant he is working. Or something like that. Jamie Pressley is in it. He plays himself basically. All she needed was her boyfriend, Kid Rock. It would be perfect then. Therefore, I would recommend to jump "Ringmaster". Just look "Jerry Springer Show". It's more enjoyable than this. <br /> <br /> 2/10
