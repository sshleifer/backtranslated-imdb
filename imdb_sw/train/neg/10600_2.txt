I will be honest. The only reason I watched this on television is that it is under IMDb 100. And right now, I wonder if the hour and half of my life really had a 'look' on the same list. Van Damme is Luc Deveraux, who finds himself in the fight against the Universal Soldier after the main computer pull 'HAL' to protect himself. And yes, after all the necessary explosions, shoot-out and dismiss him who finished. Included with the slightest and slight set-up make sure that it is the place of the beauty list is right. <br /> <br /> It is for fighters like me who want to check the full list. 2/10.
