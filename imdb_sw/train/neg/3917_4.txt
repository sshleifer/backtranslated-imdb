"House of spirit" is very bad. I have lived in South America, in a country that suffered for military dictatorship as one movie trying to explain, and even if everyone knows movies could be far from reality, this film makes viewers as stupid and stupid. Things are not so simple and common as shown here, and of course the political process is more complex and interesting that the plot in the "House ...". If you can't show that the controversy on the screen is better not to make the film completely. There are many examples of how politics can be taken seriously in movies, without many common places. In one place I heard that Carmen Miranda could be seen in carrots and palms. When you talk about certain things you should not be cautious but respect for your public mind.
