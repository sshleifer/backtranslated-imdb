I had great expectations for this indie after misleading the comments of thumbs up. Then .... <br /> <br /> Here is my extra 'two cents' for already installed, the best 'lost in translation'. First: Morgan 'stuck' in a small town where he meets a beautiful Scarlet who works in local supermarkets. Can Morgan help to strengthen the beautiful Scarlet from the trash life of the trailer? Is it true? NOT. What about the same purchase in Target? First, Freeman looks at the interior as he enters Harrods. Then, he sneezes on the T-shirt to prove that he has never been in any shop that has been proposed by beautiful Scarlet. Morgan is restrained from everything and all of Scarlet's facts and is portrayed as slick in his ignorance to everyone and everything in Scarlet's life. <br /> <br /> One player enjoyed Scarlet and the old hubby fighting area where his life, the car in this situation, needs to attack his old hubbie wife. Is Freeman protecting himself and protecting himself ... he ... he struggles to disbelieve and is not able to deal with a very trivial matter of truth, very slowly in life. The character of Freeman believes the washing of a car with a very new revelation, a very suitable blouse is the key to the interview of Scarlet's work. Another sign that Freeman is HIM. Freeman's endless 'talk action' where all the issues of Scarlet's fact have been reduced to one or the other in relation to Freeman's experience was irritating. Free Scarlet learns such lessons from Freeman as: some people pay $ 100 for T-shirts and blouse revealing can open doors instead of lack of education and white skills. Last Freeman provides a little Scarlet over a wonderful diversion and 'star', even paying for gas for Scarlet's dead night to return to his life unchanged in the city name Freeman cares not to know.
