The first ten minutes of this film about filming in Belgium, are good: you see the real chaos on the set, the producer of the nervous breakdown, the cold has become the director (Mickey Rourke), the worst angry star, etc.. You've seen everything before, but it's good. But there! Sometimes the film repeats itself: that ten minutes from time to time. There is no peak, no great progress, no good acting, even not bad, it may just continue on. Mickey Rourke has two good moments when his behavior is said about f ** ked up work in the area where reality and false meet. In total, that makes 12 minutes good. <br /> <br />
