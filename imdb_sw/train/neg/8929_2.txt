This podge of hodge was taken from the novel of Gore Vidal (actually one of the most famous American writers) makes MAGIC CHRISTIAN and VALLEY of DOLLS looks like Fellini art-work. Raquel Welch, and a wonderful body (and really not very long) in the lead role (except KANSAS CITY BOMBER when he was quite good) played Rex Reed's (a bad film player, not a critic) to just change, just around the gold ( The big chick) Mae West, John Huston, the youngest and "naive" Farrah Fawcett (before Lee Majors, is embarrassed), and various other enough -toids pretending spoof WAY ​​can also be something that does not go to it except part old films published (ie Widmark in KISS OF DEATH, Lena Horne) ... HERE so they can continue with blood from everyone. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10. Best performance = ?. It's too bad, it's worth seeing!
