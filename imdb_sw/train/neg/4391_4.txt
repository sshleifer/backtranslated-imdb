Little scientist Harry Harrison keeps scientific scientific research in the birth of ingredients and flying colors, but his intervention for his mother and doctor lovers want to sell serum. When he finds out, there is an accident involving Harry to lose his hand. Therefore, he tries to serum and what is happening is the generated hand of the generation that has his own mind. Oh we have seen this very often before, but what makes this so very interesting and Juba's shonky is quite the performance of the Elke Sommer film icons and Oliver Reed. True is not a flick flicker and films; there is much better there, which is the same in the vein. "Service Relationships" do not only have a different style. Unusual nature and splatter unhappy resembled "Re-animator" and even touch with slapstick facing as something from "Evil 2". <br /> <br /> The comic story is completely broken by black humor, but it can get melodramatic and slightly in dry because of fun. Surprise bears over, especially the final results of the flick. Which is well accepted, as I thought it could mix with something that can be found. For limited production budget FX makeup can look rigid and goofy very much, but there are some good moments that will make you smile than actually cringe. Even the shadow of gender tension tells the story, thanks to the performance of Elke Sommer as a mother. Oliver Reed is a very good surprise in a bad mood and wipes it very well. They were both describing as a couple who loved to hate them. Billy Morrisette is happy in the improper performance like Harry. Director Damon Santostefano eliminates the film and creates some of the most stunning and scary events. They are babies and quietly, but you give them for some unpleasant entertainment.
