Lulu (Louise Brooks) works as usual and has nothing in her life. She enters the Miss France competition against her boyfriend Andre (Georges Charlia) and succeeds. She stands in the name of Miss Europe to leave her boyfriend back. He is winning again but he returns to Andre because he has asked him. Once he comes back together, his life reappears and so one night he writes his notes and allows access to the popularity as Miss Europe. Andre is following him ... <br /> <br /> This film is a silent music music piano every way. It also rises-up so everything appears quickly. The debate has been added later and is very serious. The cast is well accepted as a silent film. The best part of the film comes at the end but the story goes too long. After looking at this, I do not really know this program was on Louise Brooks's exhibition - she has a desperate headline that makes her face look fat. I no longer need to look again.
