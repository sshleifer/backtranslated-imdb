I saw this movie last night and even after just a few beer shows that this film was from me when I realized that I was watching it. by word, it is unfunny. Nfunny. I strongly believe the announcement of trivia about black jack apologizing for making this garbage. I can't believe that the levinson of the barry did not just print this script while reading the first page. more than that, I can't believe that I watched it over ten minutes. I gave 3 out of 10 * because I would like to see christopher walken making bad movies for payment. also, the horse "corky," to be just like a character in this movie, it is really quite ridiculous.
