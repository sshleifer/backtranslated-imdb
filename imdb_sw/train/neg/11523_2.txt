"Igor and Lunatics" is an unusual and casual attempt in an ethnic-hippie-murder-spree movie. It seems even about twenty years later, Charles Manson was still urging those who are not interested but not able to film. This is the production of ordinary Troma, meaning in other words, there is a lot of boring footage and quite non-meaning footage to accompany the nonsensical plot. There's a bit of random gore and free fraud on display? which is not bad ?? but it is all very important and evil to be concerned. "Igor and Lunatics" are very obvious even using multiple images twice, as the perimeter perimeter perimeter for instance. The wrong plan is trying to tell the story of the hippie-driven ritual of drug abuse by Charlie Manson wannabe Paul. One of the lowest students of Paul, called Igor, becomes too little of the Bible stories and the culture of drug addiction and gradually leads to a widespread worship of crime. Just show through a small example exactly how Igor Madness is: he tears the heart directly out of the sexy sexy black hitch-girl! There is a sad voice of the synthesizer and some of the ancient pseudo-artistic exercises of cameras, such as slow footage and lurid dreams. Maybe there is one sequence that more or less you deserve to be useful for the garbage fanatics and that 'it's when the poor girl is cut by half by the machete. Because there is no one, the camera holds a gastric shot in the stomach for the entire fifteen seconds.
