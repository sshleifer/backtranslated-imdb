What is the worst movie of 2003? "Cat in Hat?" "Gigli?" Mais not! I recommend that this was a small film of anger from the beginning of the year. Written badly, very badly, and (if I can have confidence) badly, "Procedure" is a black hole of the film - the movie so dense even the least of entertainment can escape from its scope of the exploitation event. It's not even a funny accident, like (for example) "Showgirls." You know that producers think that their listeners will not be too smart. They called the name of the movie, at the beginning the name of "Singers," because they thought Americans were so ignorant to understand what they were eating, even if they went to a good height to describe what to eat in the movie. Instead, they have a common name and a picture of Heath Ledger looking sadly more than enough to send you there. <br /> <br /> And, hey, you know what, they were right! My old girl saw the picture of Heath and circled me inside. I agree, manufacturers, have met your target market. He also loved "Grease II," so you're in a good company. Returning to the topic, Heath has a Catholic player from a special (you think) command that tries to investigate the murder of his mentor. He has hilarious issues, perhaps because no one has a good mind who believes that he knew a little thing about religion, much less being a string player. The only member of this process is the smoker of alcohol. Since I have wanted to see the return of the smoker to a big screens, his humorous experiment reminded me of all the pigs in my high school who made division of Monty Python, thinking that if they said a line like Pythons could not be quite funny. You know what kind of people I'm talking about. If I say more, I would be a risk of producing damage. In fact, something that destroyed this film is the fact that it was created.
