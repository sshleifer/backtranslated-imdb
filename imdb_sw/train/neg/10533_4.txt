This version moved slowly to my taste and I think I have problems with playing this start. But the first movie, it's usually a TV movie version of the play which means that it has no original flair film film by William Holden. Could they employ more than twelve people as extra? Why transfer the film until 1966? So can you give a little sister a line about the Vietnam War? Why not 1963 and give him a line on the civil rights movement? <br /> <br /> About hitting, some beat several misses. Jay O. Sanders gives an accurate description of his behavior especially to his events by Josh Brolin. Brolin on the other hand forgot a lot of details. He is believed to be a former BMOC jock but they do not have a watchful look at William Holden. I always thought Brolin looked a little like gorilla to have all the women in town going up on it (pardon pun). Gretchen Moll was good but he seemed very good to the character he played. He had no project of guilt or ignorance whose character is needed. Maybe it's because she and Brolin were about 5 years old than the characters should be. But holden again was ten years old. Bonnie Bedelia was not forgetting if Mother and Mary Steenburgen did not seem to create her ideas if she was playing Blanche duBois or Katharine from "Taming of The Shrew". <br /> <br /> About Mr. Inge play, I always heard that this story of a young woman who chose passion on practices was always needed epilogue. "Twilight Zone" I believe giving epilogue and part of "Spur of the Moment" where Diana Hyland was a little expelled by Diana Hyland, a little harder, because Diana Hyland chose to run with a boy like Hal Carter.
