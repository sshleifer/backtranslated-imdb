This movie was written very badly, led and acted that prayed for faith. It should be modified by the best script, director and compose service. The worst problem is acting. You have Jennifer Beals on one hand who is polished, professional and quite reliable, and on the other hand, Ri'chard, who is a bad miscast and just a jarring in this piece. Peter Gallagher and Jenny Levine are just as bad as a slave who gives them (and put) a couple, although they usually do a good job. Vendors (and director) should not try to make all the accents - it's contrary to the unknown. Better to have a focus on doing good work in real English. Offer it hard. Why the children of "African trader" (so under the category of people of the race community) have been beaten by skin executives, while Marcel, known to have social characteristics, including the color of "color" ? It is as if the directors of the throw can not be worried to read the script they hit and select the best actors from a great artistic and physical art. It's just so weird! This can be a great movie and should be renewed, but with people who respect the material and can choose skilled and skilled executives. There are many good actors out there, and it would be fun to enjoy how Jennifer Beals, Daniel Sunjata and Gloria Reuben did with proper query, good script and good leadership.
