First I would like to forgive my bad English. I'm not HOSTEL-hardcore-fan, but I loved that movie however. Live Feed, however, SUCKED BIG TIME! I've never seen a movie of gore and good acting, but hey, who is wondering? Acting in Live Feed was ... well, not there! I have seen some of these comments if it should be a school project or something. Okey, but not for students in the media or school to act. This was no class even! And what about the story? Run with sad for Hostel. And what about the year? What? About the incidence of psychological torture that should lose your guts and leave you a cool shape? That was more ambitious about the hole of the hole! Short, fast and NO edge. More as an execution instead of suffering. Okey, where the blood buckets, but not even real. Slaughtering and violence more reminders of Braindead than Hostels or any movies of Saw. And the Braindead was fun! Okey, I often laughed at Live Feed, but that was more frustrating than fun! <br /> Instead of losing 80 minutes by watching Live Feed, check ANY another!
