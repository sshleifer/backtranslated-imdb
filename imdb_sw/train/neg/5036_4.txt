SWEET SIXTEEN (1983) ** / ***** 86 minutes Director Jim Sotos Releasing Bo Hopkins, Susan Strasberg, Aleisa Shirley, Patrick Macnee, Dana Kimmell <br /> <br /> Good girl of fifteen years Melissa is a new town of the desert and not long before people around him start dying. The detective should put together the clues with the help of Nancy Drew beautiful girl girl played with Friday 13 Dana Kimmell's authors. Americans local Americans are accused of the great because they seem to persuade cities affected. All these events lead to the murder of the killer in the sixteenth birthday of Melissa's birthday. This is less than the average slasher is not very memorable. It has been made to feel the television, without more symbols instead of the theme song of the theme that plays several times. Lines like "murderer turns us into coleslaw." Switch to standard screen screens for eight years. Marci calls Melissa a bad name and somehow promotes friendship. It seems Marci sees how difficult it is because Melissa knows how to wear pretend. This film would be difficult to be reinforced today with the main character being fifteen and the most inclusive director of his up-ups. The social definition of the Indians has not been established enough to be taken seriously. I am also surprised by the high rating of this film gets. The Bloody Day of the Sixteenth and Bloody Hunting Day was likely to strengthen the time of the birthday party culture to create a brutal mass murder but I feel unable to give. But sharply it offers unseen movies like this on DVD gives hope that others will follow.
