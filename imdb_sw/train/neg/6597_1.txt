This is worse than the worst cartoons of Laurel and Hardy 60 years. They were terrible, but at least they were easy rapoffs of then Stan and Ollie to return. New audiences reconstructed pairs of cartoons and cartoons were waste disposal focused on money in the interests of children. It was expected. But, how does one try to fix this work ... I can't even think the word. I am sure the creators hoped that somehow would encourage another revival of Laurel and Hardy, but you could not encourage interest in the past with an unknown and unwanted caricature of what made nature very interesting. The impressionists (I hesitate to call executives) make Vegas act and that's where. This setting is much smaller than those used in the past, trying to identify two views of the feature. If this film was the first sponsored by REAL Laurel and Hardy, I am sure the viewer will remove the original duo attribute if the understanding has gone. The only movie I like more than this is I SHAA IN IN THE. And, you know, these filmmakers primarily did the same thing for Stan and Ollie.
