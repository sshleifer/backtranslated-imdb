I still can't believe how this movie was bad. If I wasn't a mussochist I don't know if I would live. It seems like it costs $ 1,000 to do, but it's not the money that brought them. Acting was bad - not just bad, 3 graders can read the best lines. Second, the only other reason for viewing this type of film is skin, and that is not very much in this flick. We don't even see more interesting chicas in buff. Ahh well, good luck sometimes eh?
