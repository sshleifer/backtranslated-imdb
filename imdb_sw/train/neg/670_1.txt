Prom Night is about a girl named Donna (Brittany Snow) who is expelled by a psychological killer trying to kill him at night. And to do this killed his family, friends, and enemies. Now before I start letting me say you have been tired of the awesome PG-13 movies that have not been scared recently. Are you tired of talking to the foolish girl 'Oh my god' and talking about elegant things. And you are too tired for girls in relationships and then you cry. And the last thing is tired of fixing America, Japanese, and Chinese film. That is a big Sunday night but I have not yet been checked. The only reason to see 'Chicken's Night' is to cut off death. If not, don't see the Prom night. You can not see just kill the noise and you can see some blood on the wall. And through deaths are repeated as 24/7. So they are not only afraid but they are wrong. When I met the cast I think I was ready to blow. Talking the girl too much, talk of the boy too, and a lot of 'Oh my master. It prom us. I understand it is fun but for a lot it is too much to ask you not to worry. If I put Put Night on the list of the worst films of 2008 without seeing some films I would have been the first. I will not be surprised if it is released on DVD for cheap and fast. Do not lose your money or the time of acting fast, cheap advertising, and 'dead night' when you watch the film. (1) If I could give a zero film film I could.
