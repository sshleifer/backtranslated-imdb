Perhaps because I was so young, innocent and I wanted it when I saw it, this film was the reason for the most sleepless night for me. I haven't seen since I was in the seventh grade at Presbyterian school, so I don't know what he will be with me now. However, I will say that it has left me feeling ... and many of my friends. It did its job, at least until we were old enough and able to analyze and build our own views. I was especially afraid of what the newly converted Christians had to endure when they did not get the mark of the beast. I don't want to destroy the movie for those who haven't seen it so I can't mention the details of the events, but I can still do it on my head ... and it's been 19 years.
