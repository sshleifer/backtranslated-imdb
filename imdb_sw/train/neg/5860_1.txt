It is difficult to put words in full view of this film. A new vocabulary will be developed to describe the complete lack of anything even so-called 'humor' or even 'entertainment' in the "Rabbit Test." Therefore, as a small contribution to this future effort, I would like to suggest this:> <br ir ir ir ir ir j j j he used to describe more debris than proud as a "Rabbit Test". The Joan River and "Hollywood Players" Jay Redack have had a very limited ability to achieve their limited ability to play for this 82th minute of injustice. Try to put together Birds! comedy style and moldy collection of gags, (Note to Joan: German physicians are not funny since Vaudeville) disinterred from their graves in Catskills - that's bad enough. But in addition to this movie crime, it is a model of the River's direction, which can be described as 'bad', and thrown to bes once and after having a keen interest in even the most weakening of the weeds. Adrift in this Sea of ​​Sargasso is a Billy Crystal non-occurring in its first role of film as the protagonist of the film who did not live Lionel. Viewing Crystal in this picture is like looking at a blind person passing through the mining field; finally clexe reflex becomes a permanent condition as a cheap joke after the cheap joke hits on his face. I can only mention the type of audience who can really like the Rabbit Test. Cabbage, mollusks and late delays are all candidates. But to realize, people who think - I would like to recommend bleach in your eyes before suggesting "Rabbit Test."
