The person who wrote a beautiful review of this inappropriate project should have a relationship with the author / director / star - or, in fact, that person even thought carefully that this film would be interesting to anyone uninvited and very tightly woven inner circle.

If I am transferred to a psychological thread of a dream then make a real fabric easy to buy.
