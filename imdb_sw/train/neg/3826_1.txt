Damn, I thought I would get the worst west. It can't be on this however. Hell I think I would like to have my eyes open to the Trinitarian Triple feature in a loud voice. I don't know I can see Ben Hur again without laughing my ass. It is still very serious. But hey, if you would like to the west of the stupid and the accepted stars in that matter take you to Shoot Out with Gregory Peck. It's just bad, but many funnier. 1/10
