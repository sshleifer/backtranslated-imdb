When this play was first shown by the BBC over 30 years ago, it would have been quite different at that time. So some people would see that it was very frightening, and could be influenced by special effects? <br /> <br /> Looking to play in this day and age, It does not seem to be all that fear again, even the special effects can go away. <br /> <br /> What! The train could be allowed to pass the Light Light in the dark hole? I don't think so ...... but if you look again to play this, you will see that the first train that comes into the tunnel, knocks directly through Light! (maybe that's what it was during dickens)? You will also see that the path leading to the Sign of the Sign is very steep and poor. Certainly it would have a series of correct action and the signals of Signalman to climb up or down in the cutting. (I can't help but beware of such things) \ t <br /> <br /> I don't know what is going on ...... I mean it is a traveler spirit, or what? Does anyone understand fully this story of confusion? (maybe I am the only one not) ??? <br /> <br /> To count ..... <br /> <br /> The game you have at least one, with the character. It is disturbed that it is not frightening nowadays, and a little if it is not very confused in places, and has a common practice of signs .... <br /> <br /> Thanks for reading my comments.
