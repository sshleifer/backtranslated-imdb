Combine foreign tropical areas, newborns in skimpy clothing, explosions, Dudley Do-Right gifts, film stars and her best years (Martin Sheen), military art and sexy beauty (Tracy Lor ... .si, sorry ... Tracy ELIZABETH masters) and you think you would like to have fun fighters. Not so! This is a movie of dreary TV and though it likes to promote itself as "Charlie's Angels" handle, no place as good as the original series or even gawdawful, irretrievably stupid, soon C.A movies. This disgust is well described as the THIRD film and Andy Sidaris. There is no place so happy as Andy's "Hard Ticket For Hawaii", although some of the fight scenes are decent enough. Girls spend a lot of time asking and trying to also look prissy and irritating over time. There are far better things of this kind that are out there. Oh, and "babies" do not have a fire if they like to think they are. A terrible voice ... when it is located.
