Michael Jackson would have demanded an opportunity for high-billed behavior in CHILD GOLDEN, and because he loves children. That didn't work (and why should it?), Therefore instead we have Eddie Murphy out to save the world by saving "Kid Midas". I would strongly advise all future readers to enjoy in detail the amazing actress's wonder in this wonderful fantasy - adventure - comedy which is a step closer to ISHTAR. Anything of Murphy that says or can be really good, but don't feel bad about her very fine talent; he is not in this film, and the same went to DR. DOLITTLE! Violence and collective displays are the reasons for strengthening as a tribal camp, and that did not mean if the Philippians and the film's films continued to enter the person. Speaking of the photographs, they were taken out of amazement at the time of the prestige of Ronald Reagan. Murphy is the best in coming to the AMERICA with HRS 48, but this stale movie is not my touch of gold honey for a pleasant taste.
