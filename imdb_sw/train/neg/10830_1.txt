1999 will decline in history as a year-old critic of the public film. First they sent us to EYES WIDE SHUT. Then thought the PROJECT WILK WITCH Project and now the MAGNOLIA which is off the worst movie of the year. What does it mean? Who knows. Its full of fun and carrying and doing bad. I always like to sit and watch credit, but when this was on top I couldn't get out of the movie movies as soon as possible. Many of the attendees to show that I was, felt very much the same way. Days were discussing with visitors. It is a bad and hateful film that will make you feel bad and hate.
