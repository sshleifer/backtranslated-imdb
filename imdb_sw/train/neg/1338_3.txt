I saw the goals of change .. twice .... and always the same feeling ... you see Olsen twins make the same movie .... they love to play different games and then love them for boys..OK now about the movie .... first from for young boys and young girls do not play on such big goals. 2.football does not play outdoors ... 3.if game full complement referee gives more time (minutes or more) ... and finishing it so shown ... I think this movie is bad because of lack of football knowledgement .. .. if it was done by European producers it would be better..and also the four actors are not the right choice ... they are faced with a real lack of truth. They played season in full house but that doesn't make a big star .... you should show your talent . ... and that's what does not exist in Olsen twins
