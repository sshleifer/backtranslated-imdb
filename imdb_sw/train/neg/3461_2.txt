Most films are often seen as natural, repetitive and normal. I happen to be a fan of a movie of fear, but this film was very poor. The script was not very much, the plot is ridiculous, to do very bad work. Just stinker round, that I've lost my life on. This was the entertainment value of the 15 series of films that was bad for the first time. Who / what reduces this dirt? <br /> <br /> I liked only two things in this film. The first was the mask of the killer - which was good. The second was the Austrailian cohesion and pride of pride. Lock yourself, and avoid this privacy.
