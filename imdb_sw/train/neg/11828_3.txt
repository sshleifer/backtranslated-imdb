A few months ago, I was involved in a discussion with another IMDb poster (Hey, Kmadden) about this film. The card emphasized that if I gave 'Flushed Away', I would like to. Based on a particular aspect of the argument, I have agreed to watch the movie. 'Fushed Away' has good intentions (At least on the Aardman section), but it has no power to connect it all. Its best asset is the captain of the beach / boat, Rita (Played with Kate Winselt), who, IMO, must be the main character of the movie instead of Roddy (Hugh Jackman). Rita is cool, tough, and interesting, while Roddy spends a lot of time photography in her time. One of the most important things about 'FA' is to repeat the joke which is not funny to start with. When Roddy blows hit, the film ensures he gets hit five times immediately. Shocky of my name, says Rita's brother, who chooses Roddy at least three times. My tolerance for cheap gags that involve pain is the lowest. I can't waste time thinking of Katzenberg's kleptomaniac behavior towards Pixar (One such film is unfortunate, five left). but I will be disappointed in Aardman. They can do (and have done) better. Try hard next time, boys.
