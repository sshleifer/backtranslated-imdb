I liked Boyle's performance, but that's about the only thing I can say. Everything was rolled up to the point of ignorance. Many of the actors spoke as you would expect your 9-year-old nephew to talk if he was pretending to be a jaded role, a stone heart, or a bad villain. The raspy-overs sound seemed to be amateurish to me. I could buy cheap synthesizer and beat the best music opening. And what is the whole of the 1984 police to torture things? It was completely useless and had no relationship with the actual story of the story. Cox added many items, in fact, that apparently thought it would be cool, but he had no relationship with the story. That is a great disappointment because one of the things that makes Borges stories is good is its minimalism - they are tightly tied, and no description of dirt. This movie is just the opposite. I stopped looking after the area where Lonnrot asks a question from Yiditche Zaitung, or there. I lost $ 4 this lease, but at least I can find satisfaction by writing these comments and certainly saving others from making the same mistake.
