I saw this feature as part of the North American Film Festival in New York and was scared of a photograph of photography, sado-eyeschistic, which I got. The story line is hidden under a lot of sexual intercourse - and, not one is in a small enough condition - patients are more emotional. The director appeared to go to the value of shock instead of exploring different levels of why these characters are like this. See if you can stomach - I still have fingers.
