Even though this film is alleged to have been a joke to respond to critics is still a bad film. If someone goes to that kind of thing at least to make a good joke ..... first, Jeroen Krabbé is thinking of poor Gerard Depardieu ..... usually I love Gerard Depardieu even though he was very funny in 'Iron Mask' three musketeer one. Otherwise to me he is a steam boot office and Jeroen Krabbé is worse than that. The office of the poor man's box .... in fact that is not fair for economic cancellation. If '4th person' should be a certain type of Bourgeoisie inquiry .... what am I saying? it is not. Let's just say hypothetically, if it should be, it wasn't very strong. Satire is something wrong .... If it is not a bright view, the viewer becomes a hippopotamus instead of ...... I think it happened. The story ends only as a bunch of disgusting characters doing something that anyone could take care of and not in an impressive way ..... very satire] The most likely to be the spoiler of the spoiler. It is worth the hard work in the cemetery where Jeroen Krabbé's behavior works so hard you don't care? because Mr. Voerhoven should be a good manufacturer of the film I will give him the benefit of doubt and think it was a good joke that was out of control ..... though I think he didn't give Jeroen Krabbé because he is the best actor and every The character he played has been a bunt of a bourgeois toy .... unless he can't fail. So it becomes like a wonderful caricature. Do you think Mr. Voerhoven did it for a purpose? And Jeroen Krabbé is a joke seat too? So you understand a problem I have here? It is the worst film ever because he should be a good director. So there is some kind of involvement. I knew 'Patch Adams' was awesome without even seeing it. Do not be opened by the '4th of the Most Holy Man' s illusion or mr. Voerhoven Name as a good director etc. etc.
