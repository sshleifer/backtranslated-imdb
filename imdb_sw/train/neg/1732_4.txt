Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are the most popular duo of the comedy in history, and certainly so, so I'm glad to see their films. Basically the person in the horn of the horn is the fourth crack, and soon Ollie loses all sounds of the horn. She rests at home with Stan in turn, they need stability, and Doctor (James Finlayson) to say she is coming to see Ollie. After identifying pipes and electricity supplied by the optician, the Specialist comes for inspection, and after other tests, suggests the milk's milk drink and get the sea air on the sea. After Stan drive a certain trumpet, he hangs on the window with a string of phone and car crash, he and Ollie on the dock rental boat. They put the boat on the field trying to kill a goat, and Stan has brought his trumpet! At the same time, the front page of the newspaper says that Nick Nick Grainger - Runner (Richard Cramer) has run away, and he gets into the boys' boat during sleep, and the goat goes through the boat rope, walking towards the sea. In the morning, they see their location, and the killer comes out looking for something to eat, and puts Stan and Ollie to make artificial food, e.g. string for spaghetti, soap for cheese, baking belt, sponge for meat meat, and he is eating them. When Ollie started hitting something, Stan blows his trumpet to help, and Ollie's anger makes him beat the killer, and goes on until the police come, just to have Ollie's anger to take them to prison too. There was a short time of comedy, but not a black and white film. "Well, here is another great mess you got!" was the number 60 for 100 years, Quotes 100, and Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy were the number 7 on the opponents of Comedians. Okay!
