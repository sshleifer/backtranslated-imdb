Elvis has left the building and is lucky because he did not look at this unwanted stinker. The view after the director of the area Joel Zwick gets ways to make the script unfunny even under amusing. Filled with unnecessary deaths, homosexual characteristics, and hack jokes, this film is more desperate than exciting. This is a kind of film that makes one hope Kim Basinger follows Doris's early retirement. Let's remember him how he was (talented) and not what he was. David Leisure, delicious Dennis Richards and all others are gifted here. Zwick finds a way to reduce their talents on each side. The boy playing Elvis looks more like Gomer than the King. The only player who plays is the little girl who plays Basinger at the age of sixteen. She looks like she and is really good. The only other reason to watch this film is to watch Tom Hanks coming. The comeo is not all pleasing, but at least not painful. One needs to ask if Zwick has pictures of Hanks or something that makes him make this film.
