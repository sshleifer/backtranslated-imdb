Maybe I have seen too much violation of the crime, or maybe take the right drugs. This is the most planned, lost conspiracy, a strange plot, just a stupid movie I have proved for a long time. <br /> <br /> As for the direction, it seems like it took a little time to show this than it did to put it together. It really looks like to make it directly on the video before it is completed. It is a bad "M" film Fritz Lang's first reference to Peter Lorre. You would like to be better to lease it instead.
