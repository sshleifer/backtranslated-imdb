This movie did not have a big star in it, but it had a beautiful handful with the best players and Gene Tierney before being a big star. With George Sanders, Reginald Gardner, Harry Carey, Bruce Cabot, Jospeh Calleia and Cederic Hardwicke, you could expect more from the film than preserved. Additionally, I find it, because of the second script, as director Henry Hathaway was a capable and firm person in the park. The video is set in East Africa during WWII - before Americans entered the war. Brits are trying to control their African colonies while the futures of Naziism are trying to trigger problems among the locals. One of the white people in the film is a double trader - working for the destruction of the British Empire! But, beautiful Tierney, playing the daughter of sultan (!), It is out to help save the day of good UK. American filmmakers have been collaborating with the Empire and the 1930s and 40s saw the pro-empire film. Nowadays, with the changed impression, the idea of ​​seeing the happy black people die for Queen and the country seems to be uncomfortable - and it will be difficult to strengthen any side! However, in his day, this piece of propaganda was effective in combining support for the British - although it appears today, the film is faced with a long string of silly casting. One bright time in the film is the final strike between George Sanders and the enemy agent. Such a bad after a very powerful film movie seemed just talking and talking - losing some of its punch.
