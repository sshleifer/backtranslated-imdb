This movie is losing stock of the film. What? Do you believe that the military military plan map would be placed on the easel on the patio throughout the day for anyone with a binoculars or camera with a visual lens? What happened in this film. What? Do you believe that the person of DEAF could register in the army of duty in Europe when WWII served in the "Negro" unit ... cooking, supply services, burial details, etc.? What happened in this film. What? You believe that a black official (and known as intelligent) will choose DEAF K.P. being part of the fight against the work to protect the dam destroyed by the Germans before the partners arrived? What happened in this film. Do you wonder that the DEAF soldiers did not understand that the German airplane was coming from behind and would have problems with killing him? What happened in this film. Do you wonder that a group of American soldiers gathered in a warehouse on a farm house that the Germans had taken over them would leave their feelings in front of the German soldiers who were only 50 '? They did this in this film, leaving any possible entry into the barn Germans can look completely unhindered. Can you believe that, on the battlefield with an open English, the Captain was named the title of the Great, if not his name, as a person who spoke to that general, in an open English on airwaves open, said that the dam was protected the next day? Perhaps they should have just sent a messenger to describe the direction of the US attack coming from just to make it easier for the Germans. Not a movie should be placed on the 50 worst movie list. If so, I am sure it will do well. Look for your own risk.
