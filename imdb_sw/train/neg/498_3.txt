I saw this movie when I was very young and I thought it was funny. I saw it again last week, and you can think of the results. Some of the funny parts in it, very few and very long. Genesis is the only thing that is funny if you ask me. If you want a full movie b this is a good option, but don't expect too much from the size of visitors
