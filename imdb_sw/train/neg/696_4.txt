Eh, not a special flick of slasher. So-so acting, effects, but not unknown and unknown sound sounds. There are three deaths in the near-closest to the beginning of the film that makes the scene that looks visible. In addition, there are many characters walking around, without realizing what is going on, or expelling red nerves; The more murders than the time, than the people. There are other deaths, and the killer is a good killer of space, not a place to perform any. The killer also likes to put other people to kill innocent people as well. Identity was not revealed at the end, and the goal is very narrow, and we don't care. Of course the movie takes place near Christmas, but this is not the main reason. One place is available for Christmas lights, that's about it. <br /> <br /> The movie is rather dark and muddy pictures often, at least a video video I watched. Some of the talks were lost in some of the opening events. Finally it must be stronger than it was. We think we know what happened, although there is another chance to do.
