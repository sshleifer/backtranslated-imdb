The Treasure Island's DVD should be required to look at any film production course! It is an example of how to do a film. Watching the movie and then listening to the author's comments / director clearly shows a great hole between what he knows about the characters and what he tells his listeners about them. I call on the past, but I think of movies as a means of communication, and communication doesn't matter if the audience doesn't know what the leader is talking about. The director's purpose is to make the film "Hollywood collection". Among these gatherings, alas, is the attitude of the character and transparency of the concept. The director himself knows that the listeners often do not understand the points where he has ignored the "Hollywood cliché" intentionally. However, he never seems to understand the idea that the clichés exist for the reason. They are short to present hard ideas quickly and clearly. It is good to avoid, but they need to be replaced by another way of communicating with one idea, not just being removed. The film is based on an exciting, rich cluster. The two pieces are required to create a personality and history for an unknown corpse that will be used in anonymous message in the last days of WWII. Soon everyone begins to create their own personal and personal fantasies and their discoveries becoming increasingly true to them. A person who has a low opinion of "Hollywood partners" of traditional stories can create a good film with this idea. This film is certainly not! Fabrics make everything possible to bring the balance to these characters, but they often fail with a confused script. In particular, I am more interested in Gonzo, who plays a fun body. In many films of pappet, it always emerges as a very charismatic puppet.
