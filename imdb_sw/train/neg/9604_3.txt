The first thing I saw in this film of course, was the amount of unwanted weakness. It is not dirty or anything, but much that is not needed. Annik Borel has a woman who has a problem believing her family stories of a father whose father is like her iswolf, and believes that their fate is being made right. What you really got quite interesting. The original Wolf was keen to be a completely psychological film, but Universal struck into the real person of the Wolf who never deserved to see a buck or two. I see this concept of someone who is not really interesting. Unfortunately this is not what I was looking for. Instead we know that it is not a wolf from the beginning, so there is no fun or misleading, also trying to make the film look like this happened. They fail there and also add one or two parts of a film that discusses this fact. At first I enjoyed reading the film details. But I realized it was just a covering so that they could open the breasts of the main characters as often as possible. Annik Borel is a good actor who plays a great psychological role, or a very serious actor playing. psychological role. Since Danniele's character has no brain and it is only a nut who runs around insane and hitting and photographing as a wolf, it takes little skill to play. He has a time of his performance decreases in an interesting time but is quickly damaged by the work of poor camera and light. The idea is good, but it is done in damage to the film. 3/10
