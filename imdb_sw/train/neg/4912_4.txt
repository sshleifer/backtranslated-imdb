If you don't read the novel, I can't tell him how this film believed. The story is a symbol of the hidden material: the killings of the young; The woman's inquiry loves to her partner and is infected with a serious disease. Yes, it looks like a soap opera and it actually plays. The first 2/3 is lighter, except for the killings and the last 1/3 returns to the part as it takes the speed to its conclusion of losing. <br /> <br /> Acting is complicated small, although it's hard to blame executives themselves: the screenplay is angry. At the end of 1/3 you choose to watch because the film really becomes interesting, but that's the last 1/3. Russell Mulcahy's director is very much in his feature, but there is just so much he can do with the TV budget and web censors behind him. She is very young to cut quickly and lose lenses, although she was able to squeeze in a few "under floor" shots during the murder in the club room. Unfortunately, if this is done for TV, the details of the cool features that they use well and broad images are not available. Remember to producers: give this person a good budget and an antennae when you employ. Collect: This film is bad for movie standards and is recommended by TV standards (see CSI, instead). If you have a film like this, I have very good suggestions: take a copy of "Deep Red" of Dario Argento (my top recommendation, excellent film), "Opera", or even "Tenebre". They are powerful in each group.
