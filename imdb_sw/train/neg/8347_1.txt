The head should be "Walker". That's just what he walked. Nothing in the film was good. The film details are not quite suitable for the plot. The only thing I can get from the movie is that he was a good boy, but a little man of terrible life. <Br /> <br /> I am sorry that I spend my money and time, on this movie. I saw people leaving the hall in the middle of the movie. I was hoping that it would be better .... it's a mistake. I have become worse. If there is a suggestion that I can make to the producer is repeating his life on another field, because making movies is definitely no cup of tea
