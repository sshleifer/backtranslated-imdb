This is a budget under the 1970s budget. It should be a docudrama about hunting of Bigfoot employees through the North Pacific North. Each character is typical, from American to native to a stupid cowboy. Acting with details is a full joke. If you expect to see more photos of bigfoot - continue hope. There will be no more, and what you can do in your farms with low cost and camcorder; it would be better than this film. It is not that I do not like the price below the 1970s; I do. It's that this is a mess like a bad acting, evil characters, lousy stories and no thrills which you can't just enjoy. It is not like a "bad" group, nor can you get a bad laugh without the help of improper material. It is usually many boring pictures of people with camping, walking, riding, and looking at wild life. There are serious attacks that are totally stupid; they think our friend Sasquatch is throwing stones under the camps from the top when they fire their guns behind him. At this point you are stuck in large quantities for bigfoot for some drops on film heads and leave the whole thing.
