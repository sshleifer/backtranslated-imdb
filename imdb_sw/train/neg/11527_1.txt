<br /> <br /> The movie begins as an ordinary comic-hero movie. It is about a boy who has been taken, have no parents and has loved the school # girl. No surprise in the film, there is nothing that you can not think coming on the film. Toby Mcguire shows us whether he is not a good actor or that no actor in the world can save a script like this. Perhaps ten-year-olds can enjoy the film but it is a little violence for the least. You can't get away from thinking movies like people of X-Men, Batman and Spawn. All these names are excellent. I was about to walk out the last 20 minutes! One thing that might be good though it was a computer, but it's not even anything to put on a Christmas tree! So my confirmation: Don't see this film even when you get paid!
