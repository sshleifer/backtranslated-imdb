Wow, it is the destruction of the talent of the act. My husband and I sat there, all thinking, this should be better, these artists are very good to have lost their time in this trick. Interesting characters, hackneyed script, and listless lists makes for two long hours. In fact I didn't have a hack and left to make a vegetable shopping (cat bed being more appealing than this film). The man stayed and proved that he did not get well - when Buddy was killed, you would want all of them to be hit by a car and finish their sad life. It would be the greatest entertainment. Beautiful scenery and dress can not keep this alive.
