This step was on the night of the night. I think if you fill the time, because it's too late! The movie is just apologizing to show some tits and ass at the beginning and somewhere on half way. (It's not bad tits and ass though). But the story is very ridiculous in words. "Wolves", if so, you can call it, not fully shown his teeth. If it looks perfectly, you can clearly see that they have internal staff working on CGI, because the wolves run as they run on the fabric, and the CGI option looks like standing, all has shown. gore and blood, and you can easily see who will be killed / cuts / taste next. Even if you like these splatter movies you will be disappointed, they did not work well there. Do not even give me a start to the executives ... Most of Corny's lines and girls cry everything about every 5 seconds. ? <br /> <br /> Total awesome and awesome.
