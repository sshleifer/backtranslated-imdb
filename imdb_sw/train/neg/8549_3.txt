Well, what kind of hell of TRASH have I been looking at now? "The Mountain of Witches" should be one of the most abnormal exploitation of the Spanish and eternal adultery and yet, at the same time, it also strongly emphasizes. There is nothing that means here and I even doubt there is a script to work with, but somehow I couldn't turn it off. Folding your head and density begins immediately, and a series of opening about a little girl who was killed by her mother's cat. So do you think this film refers to children with evil powers? Heck no, because after this intro, the girl and her evil was not mentioned again. Then cut to the guy, with the most popular mustache you see, who breaks with his partner in a non-purpose way. When she asks him to use her holiday with her, she immediately asks her employer to ask for any job! Great argument. Finally the film will begin now, when he goes to a mountainous area only to photograph some peaks. Although not before taking a new girl (Patty Shepard) and her non-top images! On their journey, all kinds of incredible events occur? you guess? has never been told. The girl wakes up in the middle of the forest, loud loudspeakers become everywhere and someone steals jeep! True, the witches car? It seems that the witches of silent witches possess the mountains and make voodoo for criminals. That's almost as I describe the plot, but there is a good chance I leave? More important here is the sky! "The Mountain of Witches" is often very interesting, and its attractive music and interesting movies. All supportive characters appear to be unusual and Patty Shepard loves a beautiful heroine. This is the most horrible film of Europe that would be a story, if only someone had trouble writing a planned screens.
