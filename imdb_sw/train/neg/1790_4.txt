This was a "good" movie for the first time, then it was a mediocre of the leaflet and the visual, the best. There is a lot of King James English spoken and not just horrible in today's world but not always easy to translate. Can you imagine today's young people trying to listen to this film? Forget it. <br /> <br /> Bing Crosby has good lines here and looks like "Hank Martin." Rhonda Fleming ("Alisande La Carteloise") was, also for her beautiful and beautiful appearance, long red hair. It is a beautiful movie with a perfect feeling, and I can't knock it. Perhaps this deserves a lease, for historical reasons or if you are a big fan of Crosby but, in general, not so much.
