The surprise of the haunted house finds the American family moving into a 200-year-old home in Japan where suicide genocide is a trio. <br /> <br /> The layout of the novel is on the sole feature of interest in this slow exciting exciting stimulation by the Motel Hell's director. The film produces zero disturbances and includes certain scenes that do not seem to be leading anywhere. One obvious example is the early area where the male looks at the temple after realizing that his house has haunted as the monk warned earlier. The player explains the history of the house (which the audience has already learned with the opening sequence) and then the film is only reduced by something else. Earlier the monk was dedicated to help. Well, where is help? The family continues to stay in the haunted house if things are getting worse and worse and no mention of the player is made so close when he turns again to do what he should do one hour before - try to drive out the house, although at this time it is difficult to viewers take care of. <br /> <br /> There are some (perhaps) unintentional campy laughing to see American actors finally have a Japanese spirit and suddenly start to do a bad military job, I say maybe because the area is more than a little remember to duel chainsaw from the director The same Motel Motel which was definitely meant to be amusing, but in general this is a memory forget.
