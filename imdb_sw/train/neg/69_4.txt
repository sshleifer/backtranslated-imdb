I thought this was an unusual, unfamiliar story of Australia's famous story. Heath Ledger and Bloom Orlando were very good in their roles, and gave their characters some personality; but the whole thing seems to be forced and normal. <br /> <br /> Genesis may be more than involving them; maybe starting with a shot, and then stirring back to the renewal of how they got there or that kind of thing. And I felt that the area was always predictable and signed, as a very bad tv soap. I was very excited about this film, and hoping for something else. The only thing I can say for His grace is that it beat Mick Jagger's version, but not in moderation.
