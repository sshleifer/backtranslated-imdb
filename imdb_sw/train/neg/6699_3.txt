"Algie, the singer" is one bad comedy and unwanted silence. During the slapstick does not stop completely. This is a kind of humor and a certain process that makes you wonder if they should be funny or not. However, the real quality of the film is worthless. This should look for the blows of the film mainly because it is one of the first models of gay movies. The main character of Algie is a strong young man, acting as a common "pansy" in many early films. The movie has a personal view. "Algie, the singer" is very good, but it attracts the historical perspective. (3/10)
