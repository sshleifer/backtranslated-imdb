I found this on the shelf when I beat the house and bored. How can people give this 10? Not only is it necessary to be a free-sounding film (I think), because it doesn't work on that level either. Good plot, bad conversation, acting badly; there's nothing there. Harvey Keitel is decent, but has nothing to work with, and Bridget Fonda and especially Johnathon Schaech is just awesome. The development of the plot (especially the relationship between Byron and Ashley) does not make sense. It seems like the authors liked a plot to go in some way and do it, without actually writing the truth in the necessary bits to make it. It is only half an hour, but that's 90 minutes of your life you will never be back.
