This is a very odd film ... I was not quite sure about what, some of N London reduces infants in forests that all believe is some kind of oracle and somehow make them all, in their own way, changing something about their lives that usually live in disaster. The film ended after 90 minutes and made me feel that it was not good at all, almost irritated in the sense of nothing. I don't care about the characters - none of them get the opportunity to love the viewer. What was the message? What? I was slow? It was very unusual. What happens to Runner? Why does Emilio hit the baby? ... which had no meaning, meaningless. What? Can someone help me understand this mess of films?
