I can't believe I am angry after seeing this that is almost writing my first review on IMDb. The Disney Document is not just a Reashed Earth lite Planet. Now I realized to go into this which was declared as "from the people who brought you to the Planet of the World," but I did not know that they were going to abuse the same cuts as the series of mini series. I just paid $ 8.75 to see what I had on the DVD. Shame on Disney for not warning people that there was nothing original here (except James Earl Jones voice-over and 90 seconds of ocean that I don't believe they were in Planet Earth). But the greatest crime of all, is that when the planet Earth uses the bad story of polar as a proof that we kill this planet and the catalyst of ecologic change, Disney took the story and made it a friendly family . After losing to the husband of the polar, they show his children growing significantly after a year, and eliminates garbage about how they already have his memory, and that the world is a good place after all. There is no mention of sheep that are dying near the same difficulty as their father endured, no warning for future generations if we do not get our action together, no. Just a montage of things we already see in the movie (and more often, if you are one of the billion people who have already seen Planet Earth) <br /> <br /> I've never left the hall feeling so embarrassed and deceived in my life.
