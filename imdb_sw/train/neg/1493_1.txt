We can't find how people made this film and they thought it was worth all the work they put into it. Even more surprising are those who watched this film without the feeling of being deceived out of 88 minutes to do something useful like cleaning down the bed or reading Leviticus. Firstly, they would surely have access to 2 true Irish people, and good looking women who could give their best lines than the printed stars, haggard porns contaminated in this film. In fact, the year-but work of wonder, is not a problem if you can think to see the ingredients that came out of the fire (old) flames of the flame and right of the fire. There may be something to do with the fact that after their terrible act of humanity you just want to die of pain. So, if you don't care about all of the following: \ t The movie doesn't mean unless you are as closed as the authors were obvious). <br /> - The theme (There is nothing to learn from this film) There is nothing to fear about bed at night, nothing to think about or appreciate, or to tell others. <br /> <br /> - soundtrack (Crap, crap, crap.Music as common and lighter as script). It is possible to have this grace to save the film, but no ... no fun here .. Even the rocks are fake). <br /> <br /> Then, yes. If you don't care about it, and you are a horny boy who has a bad taste in music and "women," this film is for you. Positive feedback: the most interesting movies, lost on other things. Very real Gore; again, lost. But the abdominal area is normal. I agree with the mutant- disembowelment problem solving the fake problem.
