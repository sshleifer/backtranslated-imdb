I don't often go out of my way to write a comment, but for this I should, just warn anyone who can assume that for this look they will see comedy. This does not come close. When the foundation (change of color / gender / whatever) is very serious (and has been done, better, often before) the real change of two black boys in two white girls is one of the few interesting changes that have been placed on the screen. It would be very bad if all required by the script was to change white chicks. However, the Wayan brothers need to hide themselves as two white women. As you will now consider, they fail completely. I've seen drag Queens without makeup making more to convince women than these two do with the best special effects and people pretending that Hollywood can offer. Its awesome. Adding a basketball player to build as a building, a terrible conversation with holes more than a golf course and this film blows down an individual. And I love bad movies! Avoid as a blow.
