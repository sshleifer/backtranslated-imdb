It is reasonable to me that this film is getting raves from Hollywood because often in Hollywood is just a popular race. It also means when you think that people who love the film can only respond to a lot of songs that are being played to you instead of story content. However, this film is recited and has grown more. Eddie Murphy looks just ridiculous. Jeniffer Hudson and Beyonce Knowles have no way of doing Oscar's performance which many have voted before even the film. I can't even believe that Condon has been set up for the appointment of Oscar to lead all the time he made it to the album. Glitz does not replace any story. The song group is not a film.
