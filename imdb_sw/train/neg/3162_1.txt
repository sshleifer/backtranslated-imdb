I had no trouble completing the movie because I was so tired I thought I was going to look at movies and my friends and I were tired so we woke up and left on another film if I ever had to sit for 2 minutes of the movie again I think I will shoot himself ... and I know the whole movie because my friend told me what happened at the end and I was not surprised at all I mean who didn't know he was going to do the right thing and let him have fun and really meant you would be the perfect idiot don't know it. I know I didn't miss anything and if someone asks me to see that the movie would say "on my dead body".
