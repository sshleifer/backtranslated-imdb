This is one of those films that I could sit just once. Charlotte Henry is good - in fact, all participants were good. The problem was on the script, conversation, direction, editing, sets and special effects. In fact, this was 1933, but it was actually done. Part of the problem is that actors like Richard Arlen, Gary Cooper, W.C. Fields and Cary Grant do not recognize (there are faces to recognize that it did not come). The movie just clumped with no cooperation. A lot of spirit of Lewis Carrols, humor and promotion does not exist. It's a pity! It is a very good book. I would recommend the Disney version of 1951.
