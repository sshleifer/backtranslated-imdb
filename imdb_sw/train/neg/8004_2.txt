First of all I would say the first 20 minutes is good, the monster looks nice and CGI is done well. It is disgraceful that all the movies are greedy, / or <br /> ******** SPOILERS BELOW ******** <br /> From the opening area we can see this film is a fight and the US, usually this type of voting can not bother me (we Brits get enough from Hollywood) but here is not a trick on making Americans brain-dead. It goes back to the truth and left you wondering if Yank has arrested the mother directors. <br /> <br /> The sad part was very bad and part of the movie where it begins to descend. Here we are brought by an Olympic medal and drink a uncle who enters the memory and begins to accuse the father of his death, then beat him before he starts all around the couch floor. It is difficult to connect the truth during the crisis! All virus viruses are ridiculous. If Americans know no virus, why do they waste time, money and resources to explore? The US government agency orders to extract the innocent brain of any Korean, and make Americans evil (or ignorant), was not helped by the fact that this young man was directed to the comical effect. <br /> <br /> Movie is about hunting monster. US and Korean forces have been given a chance to find a creature even though out of the movie are not visible. People alone hunting hunting, in all Korea, are the main family and some of the random tramp who appear at the end to save the day! Usually a few US / Korean officials are trying to stop them on the way. The sister was just inserted into the film so she could make a shot at the end. It was a clich√©d, you knew that it would happen but to make it worse it eliminates all until that part! and my last bitterness, how hell did that child live at the end? The monster was swimming with the head under water for 5 minutes! why does the monster not eat children in the first place?
