No rotation - this movie is awesome. I have seen the old films of Christopher Lee / Fu Manchu, I know and the characters and it is the origin of the saliva, but it's still only godawful. However, the wisdom of Peter Sellers still shines with his show of Nayland Smith, with a sense of sadness, tragedy, and power strengthening through the stoic facade; it is a performance that I put at that time with the image of Peter Cushing of Van Helsing but done in the tenth part of the overall screening of all Cushing movies "Dracula". If the movie took place in the SÃ©rie-Comic vein as the BUBBA HO-TEP through the TV show of AVENGERS of 1960, this could be something special. If you are Fu Manchu or Peter Sellers completed, this is something you need to see, but it passes to anyone else.
