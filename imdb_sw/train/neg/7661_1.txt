The name of the worst movie all the time is one that is given quickly and often. Most of the time it spreads the truth but I want to invite you alone in the dark for a short list of real candidates: The order of 9 from the outer space, the World of War, and the Adventures of Nash Pluto. When I looked at the weight of 90 minutes I found it hard even to stay awake even when I tried to cut it on the film. But I heard only in the dark (I was trying to avoid pun but I could not resist) when I looked around and hoped to see Mike Nelson and his two robot friends. Oh my friends and I had to give comedy in the film. <br /> <br /> So ... about the film itself. Let's talk about the effects and effects since that should be the only part of the film. The movie has a bad creation that is a cross between Xenos in Guests (even calling them Xenos), and creation in Black Pitch. It can turn invisible to random (and I assure you it's random) and hurt to light. There are also small creatures used to control people who change them into something similar to a zombie. All of these are shown by special effects of the time that would be mediocre in 1997. Practical events are chaotic and impossible to follow. People are shooting at the screen of the blue screen or empty on the hills that were inserted into the post. Light shines quickly on the dark screen makes your pupils stimulate from a lot of work while bad rock music is not back. <br /> <br /> And these were high marks. The story surrounding the legal screening (Slater) which the idea of ​​looking hard is wearing a black woman's vest with a cushion of a river and not shaving for 2 days. And government agencies (Dorff) whose lines involve the barking process. All three should be embarrassed in their presentations (not that they have ever done a good job before) and a casting director deserves a shame. Reid and Slater are supposed to be lovers in the film I think. The film has one of the most amazing love places I've ever seen on the film between two. <br /> <br /> Then come the plot. Keeping quiet places that have meaning is not really interesting. Others are illegal. The holes of the plot may have the egos of all three stars. The movie begins with the text and the voice that tells the story behind. This opening goes on for a minute and already the viewer knows it's for something terrible. This opening quotation is consistently repeated in awkward conversations in a very beautiful and heavy way through all the film. And the latter did not make one mind. Not only did it have no meaning in the film world, it was not just wise. <br /> <br /> Finally the one leadership of Uwe Boll. Obviously, that's all that can say. Its use of shaking cameras to compare doubts. His lack of direction and executives. Just look at the Reid in the scenes in which he is not between the aim of the shot. The complete destruction of special financial effects for the time of the shot. And finally choose to choose a voice on explaining something that should be clear to the audience. <br /> <br /> I paid $ 1.50 to see this show on the second sports field. And when my friends and friends gave me the value of each quarter I would advise people to avoid paying back this film. Grab about 3 friends and share rental costs and watch this new movie. <br /> <br /> Your attack Be Boll. Hidden on your Tara Reid. Shame on your Christian Slater. Hidden on you Stephen Dorff. Shame to anyone associated with this film.
