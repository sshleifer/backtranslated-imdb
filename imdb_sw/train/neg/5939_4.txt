I thought that movie was the same but it was very disappointing that they did not use the true picture of her life. I expected to see her mother to be a real Jamaica, that is to run things. Just looking at the beginning of the film tells me that the movie wasn't right. Which I totally lose interest just a matter of seconds since the beginning of the movie. I am very disappointed, like looking at biography on Mark Anthony and having Arnold playing that part. I don't know what the author thinks missing a piece of movie that I'm sure his mother played a major role in her life. I will say the movie was the same instead of a big fla !!!!!!
