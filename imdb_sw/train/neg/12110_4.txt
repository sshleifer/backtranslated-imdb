What is interesting about this semi-musical set in the 1920s Berlin is a wonderful movie and editing. It is on the line from First National in these departments. The story deals with mildness and resembles two other Miller films (SUNNY, SALLY) where a working girl is corrupt and a young man with a rich and unwelcome family, problems with a final clinic. All four numbers of music are connected at the beginning of the film and we go for a long stretch without any music preference. Miller sums up the parts of me and thinks for you. There will also be no good color and since you are not the first. <br /> Miller here is very active, remembering Irene Dunne by way and delivery. Unfortunately she does not dance like that is her forte. SALLY is still the most beautiful film, and this looks like a second and rather poor SUNNY very big runner. Her life had been damaged by the sinus disease before the day when hospitals and antibiotics did such a disaster could be prevented. It is worth visiting these films though seeing a star on Ziegfeld of twenty years.
