O my God, what happened to hell? I can't say it again but what kind of back film is this? Dubbing in this is the worst way to write in "King Kong vs Godzilla", Linda Miller had to be the worst executive in it and the suit is actually cheesy.Its about some villain named Dr.Who who gets henchmen to build a gorilla robot that has the same power and King Kong but when this robot has fallen it builds another and then tries to capture Kong.To do (that's when Linda Miller gets angry) makes Kong his slave but everything goes wrong with King Kong saves Then Dr. He sends a robot after him. Later when I was watching the movies I found the head when Linda Miller and other clowns began to mourn. While sharing with the DVD viewing while you were playing I was hoping that madness in the film would go to the end. The reason they could show Kong to return to his island to fight dinosaurs. Do not look at the movie under any circumstances or if you know ... caution and ambition ent will receive.
