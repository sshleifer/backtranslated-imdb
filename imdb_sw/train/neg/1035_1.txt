Acting bad, cast and terrible cheap. It would have been better if it had been placed as a modern fashion film. What is it. Starting the name of the movie. <br /> <br /> "Enemy" Making the name "Action Action" would have done well. (contribute to the effect of the disease). The commander appears to be a 60-year-old player, the girl of the blond having had at least one face at all. Near the end of the film she and she are working together to get rid of bad people and every time they mix words that feel like cheap lines given before the sex scene on a porn movie. Horror. Don't waste your time.
