I often feel like Scrooge, slamming movies that others are concerned about - or, I am writing a review of the improper raves. I found this film almost unnoticed, and, odd to me, was to send it quickly not through good conversation, of clich√©d but even red numbers, of mobile numbers. Anytime in this film - a non-standard music for music, lots of votes, some animation - is more to deal with the script which does not guide the wit or development to cause a trigger plot. Everyone, June Haver and Dan Dailey seem to be good people, but they can't carry the film as a team. Neither have any charismatic or has many sexual intercourse. They are all bland. I love Billy Gray, but his character is a good one-note. The best part of the film, to me, is the dress of June Haver and very beautiful.
