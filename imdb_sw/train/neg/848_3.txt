Okay, If you are looking for other Diaries of Bastketball, this is a very bad film. It is around two brothers. Max, the younger, has a great carcass of cocaine. Adam, the old man, is a doctor. This film thinks to show a decline from the truth to the extreme burden that the drug makes possible. However, it is not so. It shows that cocaine can be fun without regard to the situation. Most of the film direction is on Max and its distribution methods. In the end, Adam is no longer able to take trouble from his work and begins to use it (permanent drugs). This movie does not close to the peak. Is not less than the kocaine that really makes you, it has boring and low-budget events, and acting the older brother, Adam, is terrible. I don't know how this film failed to approve and receive awards, not the wencher's heart. If you want a clear and realistic movie in the extreme world of drugs, if you do not buy 'Diaries of basketball'. And look different. Try to avoid this film but, if you think you'll enjoy it. Try and see for yourself ...
