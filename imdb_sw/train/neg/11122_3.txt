I will say this - this director is about pictures of RAW ... many of us are not ready to deal with the head. Photos of sexuality, suicide, murder, and people "pull themselves" are constantly blowing bombarding viewer, which makes me wonder if the director was trying to communicate the concept of relief or release. Although I don't think I could see this film again, I will say that the director has a good eye. There were very good shots and "time of pictures" in the film (fans, the fishes of the wire on their hair), but the story has left me need more (because we were left to ask ourselves "what heck did we just see?"). Note: If you have a habit of touching or vomiting easily ... don't see this film.
