This is a true "LOCK STOCK" string and thrown to stellar with a terrible script. I do not know why many UK executives registered on this junk, must be bribed. Missing match storyline goes on forever and forever and if I didn't have a good money for me I would have erased after 10 minutes. 'GUMMO' (I feel I am trying to be a 'director' at a lost hour and half of my life) but this waste is close to there. really bad.
