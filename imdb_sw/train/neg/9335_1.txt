The reason for this is the worst movie is because it is so badly written, and this is the error of the author of the hack Robert James Waller, also the author of Madison County bridge. Writing is bad because the plot is quite suited to the discussion is wood and implausible. Failure couples? An American journalist and a beautiful Mexican woman with a history that she is ashamed of? It is given by a powerful criminal, directed by himself, and after several adventures (large-scale strong) that change with events that show the killer's heat, he leaves a weak partner to the killer, who, as bad as he, sees clearly more than anyone with the original. There is nothing that can help this movie succeed, even the scope of Scott Glenn's vein as a killer, is not the favorite art of Giovanna Zacar√≠as as Luz, and even the best performance of Harvey Keitel as a CIA specialist given to monitor the killer. Serious damage to time.
