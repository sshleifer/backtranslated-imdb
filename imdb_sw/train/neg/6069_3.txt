It never stops how you can take a good actor, and make him lose on a film like this. Robert De Niro is one of the best Hollywood stars of all time, but even he could not save this film. In fact, his character is the same as what he played in Cape Fear, which was very good, but I can't reinforce when the characters are doing the same schtick than one movie. I believe it becomes old, and it is here. Nothing is amazing in this film, but then the story is told a million times before. Wesley Snipes is your regular football player, and his ignorance shows through his reputation. De Niro has a delightful player, but his role in this film is less entertaining. However, because De Niro is in this film, it makes you draw if you're a fan (no planned pun) who sees everything he does no matter what is wrong. But seeing De Niro for the best, see "Midnight Run", "Goodfellas", or "Cop Land", or even go back and see "Driver Driver" or "Godfather II". Don't waste your time with this drivel. <br /> <br /> My Test: 3/10
