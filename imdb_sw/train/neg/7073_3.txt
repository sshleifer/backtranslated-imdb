We have an average family. Rakta's famous father, we have a "daughter of a rebelious boy", an old child accepted by a very good child. And we have a careless house servant, what show does that have a housewife? What? We have Brady Bunch confused? Yay! When you first came I thought it was really cool, especially because I was small. Music was bad. The obstacles were wrong and they were also concerned. All the obstacles were about family and friends and problems. Father was the kind of father of "Danny from Full House". He always gave out advice. But he did not have a clean freak. They had a home guard. Remember? Plots were basically Lil 'Romeo was in some kind of trouble, or ... not so. Oh and maybe the fifteenth game. Well, good things. Not true. But it is still a good show for children. But Nikelodean can do better.
