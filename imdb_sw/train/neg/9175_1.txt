This is about the worst movie I saw. This movie resembles the quality of movies such as "THEY" & "Cabin Fever", but even those with name executives where this failed. "Eye candy" of this movie seemed to be a 50-year-old woman who raised a bad face. (eg only quality). I would like to test this film for possible possible. Women I tell you that people were not bad looking, but not more. If you'd like to go to this movie I would like to heal your money.
