Henry, the Veterinarian Doctor (Paul Rudd), and his great partner, Kate (Eva Longoria) are looking at the last minute plans for their reception. It's the morning of their wedding and Kate is in the frenzy, giving the best publishers about his need to present food. But, fear of fear, "angel" of ice sculpture, ordered by Kate, comes without wings. In the next confrontation with the painter, the "heavy" girl falls on Kate and brings her to the Hereafter. Now, a year later, Henry's sister made for the mind to tell the young pastor that Kate would want him to start the love of other women and move forward. However, a good middle, Ashley (Lake Bell) becomes interested in Henry himself, very angry at his culinary partner (Jason Biggs). More importantly, Kate returns from the other side to destroy Ashley, because she is not willing to let another woman have hands on Henry. Can anything be done to return to Kate for heaven for profit? This is a romantic romantic comedy, one of the most popular fan has ever seen. No, it is not beaten, because they are trying to make things work. Longoria is beautiful and beautiful as a powerful partner and Bell has a disgusting and humorous style that is also infectious. Biggs, the funny funny, too, are completely lost. With Rudd, a very talented actor (see Anchorman, Knocked Up, or Clueless, please) tries very much and all, and in fact, that's the main reason to see this hard. His preference, it seems, and easy goes a long time in making the film to consider. But, there is nothing that can turn an unreasonable script and a horrible trend into a winner, anything. So, if you are a fan of paint-of-wool of a romantic comedy, think long and hard before you cancel any money for this. It was even free tickets to fall on your thigh, being warned that this movie is a close experience of death for those who worship movies and love.
