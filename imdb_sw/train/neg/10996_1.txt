Movie Underground Comedy is perhaps one of the worst comedies I've ever seen. I had to know that it would be bad when the box had "verified" words written on it ... meaning that the creators of the film will come to focus more on stimulating it than laughing. <br /> <br> The movie is a shadow of the amateur of child sculptures, bad characters, and the worst jokes ... from the sketch of the Bat-Man skeptical skit of Arnold Shvollenpecker, not only delightful. A few skits that are a little funny are a few and far between - look Micheal Clark Duncan playing a gay girl, for example - but even they go too long and damaged from Vince Offer to know in a comedy. Put down the bottom of the bottom of the Cupâ€¦!
