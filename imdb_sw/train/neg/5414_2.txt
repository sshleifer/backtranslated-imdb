This film is even a great step under the usual fares form presented by Sound. The exhibition was awesome. Even the Boman Irani, who always shines, may totally OTT as a fool. The sound of the voice did not even remember. And despite the strenuous effort, the woman leads can not manage to be "sexy". Vivek Oberoi has the best potential projects when Fardeen Khan seems to be stuck in a similar situation for a while. But this monstrosity is even under its limited capacity as an actress. Esha Deol and Amrita Rao are awesome in the evil roles written. It is a good time for Indra Kumar to connect his helmet. Hope he never can lead another observer like this. The future of Indian movies are in the best hands now. In order to calculate the total, stay away from the celluloid waste.
