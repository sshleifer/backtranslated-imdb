It is interesting that all who (so far) seemed to love this film did not expect - I think that's a trick. Unlike them, I had optimistic expectations, and that was a mistake. Once I saw how the face was close to the camera all the time, I knew we were in the hands of a very good director - that's always a clear sign of them, they think it is arty or effective or intense to hold a camera about two inches away from actors. Vendors in this film, though, had only one face of the face. <br /> <br /> If the camera was not present, the lack of light in the film killed. The film seemed to be completely closed in the dark. So now we realize that cinema movies were an amateur title, too. "Ooh ooh, we will light the flashlight! That will make it all close!" No, it seems to be invisible. Over the major technical errors, there was no more story of barest idea of ​​the idea that has never been developed, and nothing new about this kind of relationship was light. (Perhaps this is a new type of film for Germany, but in Los Angeles, don't forget about it.) The fact that this film won a series of film awards does not reflect the quality of the film, but it emphasizes the quality of these special celebrations. I assure you that this film will not win anything at the ceremony I saw. In fact, twice during the film it was finally up and people began to wake up to leave (this was one of the effects of the film's "total darkness" approach). But when the film was busy, instead, there was a moan from the audience. And as soon as the movie was finished, it was clear that it had no meaning as it was standing at one of the two original points. By the end of the time it would have saved the audience from many heritage events (decorate paper, vegetable, spreading honey to bread). Well, we find it, the life of an old man that was weak was boring - but we saw that one out at the beginning. I recommend that viewers do not open this, you have nothing to offer a modern web site.
