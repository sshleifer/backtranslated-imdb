It's a shame! I was looking at this with hope it would be an unknown gem of James Garner and what it was stinker was! The quality of production was good, but the plot was not damaged and I can honestly say that I am only a few hours and more dumber now. That movie did not have the features of redemption and if this type of items comes out, it will give Hallmark a bad name. For those who insist on knowing what it is, it's about anything, and in this case, it's not a good thing. We are under the watch of a proud old woman who is one of the dumb creatures that came around the world, which happens to be married to a real partner who might be the only living person who could put her. He throws him out of the same mess after another, makes him in a state of disgrace after another, and is proud of himself all the time. Then the movie ends. What an apology! It is not worth the time it will take to look at it, so you have to do it and explode this, you will be glad you did it if you knew how bad this is.
