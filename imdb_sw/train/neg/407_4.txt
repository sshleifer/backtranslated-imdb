I love special effects and witness new technologies that make the science fiction actually appear. Special effects of this film are very good. I have seen more of this film, since it said in HBO for the past few months. I must admit, I am going to show a few, but I have often been fascinated by movies, and I've seen several instances immediately. But every time I see some "Sneaky Man," I feel sad, almost like "film film." I don't know why; maybe it's that I don't want Kevin Bacon to be bad, and there's a disappointment in it. But I think it's just witnessing how bad it becomes bad. Regardless, I can recommend this movie with excitement (although some sections go slowly), but I have not recommended for young people under the age of 14 (maybe 12, if mature).
