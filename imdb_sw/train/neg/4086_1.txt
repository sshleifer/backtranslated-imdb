I came to this high-tech film. I was aware of the work of Greenaway and 'The Tempest' and I was determined to deal with the situation. I first wanted to change after ten minutes, but I felt it would be right. There was a storm representation, but where in your mind are you asking a little boy riding a boat? What is an example? I continued ten minutes a minute my finger on the 'off' button, somewhere else my mind. This is not Shakespeare, not movies. There is a time and place for them, but I will not waste my time and there is no place in my Shakespeare studies. After twenty-five minutes I have left it and that's the end. I then read all the comments on this site and the credibility of the film fits only with its defenders. 'The artwork ..... then put it in the gallery', 'it's ballet ..... continue on the point then'. Shakespeare can be made wisely, and games were made to the audience of the masses, they were found, and this version helps to put a wedge between Shakespeare and the population in general - and I don't think Bard would be happy with it.
