River of the Lake Crater Lake (so our head), to revive Plesiosaur, who keeps fighting on the majority of people (in California, which is the world capital.) There are bad movies, and then there is a "Monster Crater Lake", which somehow managed to avoid MST3K. Together with a sketch of a sketch, a good-stop animal, and more, this is a horrible piece of budget under the 1970 / movie budget. <br /> <br /> When the movie is guilty of a massive crime, one big is Arnie and Mitch, two obnoxious documents that serve as our comic aid. They blow around, fight with stock "banjo music", adult women, and act as a pathetic claim of humanity. The characters are bad, they should count it as a crime against humanity.
