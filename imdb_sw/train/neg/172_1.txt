Return to Cabini and Lake does not, in any way, stand by the original. For only one adult (Stanley) who returns to the sequal, the film is not even worth 2 hours of your time. I am a great fan of the first film, the story line and acting was very good, but this is one movie that I will never look at. It is basically the same as what sequals for the Legends Urban and Witch Blair were like, but for the worst act. I found it better to do in soap, it's sad that you just have to laugh. I, in any way, suggest this movie to anyone, watching it will only block you from the first.
