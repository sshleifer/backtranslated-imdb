Imagine "playing play". This is important to see once for the exhibition of Lionel Atwill and Dwight Frye. End Melvyn DOuglas in "Ghost Story" and Melvyn DOuglas of this film. What? There are violent seats in this village of Bavaria, or are there more natural conditions, though sinister, details? Dwight Frye is Herman, a red pastor, who is cast as a moral character. It is a pleasure to look at his facial expressions differently in what is the nature of the stock. Nothing happens for a long time, but we find that the Atwill cigarette doctor is a real killer. There's a lot of 'comic aid' but that's for the course of these era. Fay Wray looks very good.
