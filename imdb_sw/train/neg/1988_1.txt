In fact, I've passed a bad statement. I went through the fact that Lil Kim had lost some of the tanks and his arms or his hands had not moved, I used weeds, I used color communication. This is what killed me for me: In the area where four roses were sitting at the table discussing. Lisa-Raye and Monica Calhoun are standing with, and then Lil Kim comes to break any enemies by saying, "Who, Who, Who, Stand up. Let's go here for HOT SECOND." I am a fan of western films, and I have never heard of anyone speaking like this in any Clint Eastwood movie. <br /> <br /> If someone thinks this movie deserves more than 1 mark, please say another movie is worse than the Gang of Roses. <br /> <br /> I am through.
