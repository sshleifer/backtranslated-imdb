"Friend", with open and no taste or class, suggested I look at the work of Ron Atkins. If this is a representative of his work, I don't want to see anything else with him. It is amateurish, defensive, crime breach and self-garbage. The "pregnant woman" of the head is a little kind of budget film who kills a group of hookers. There is little fraud and some tests, but there is no single feature that can save this from the hangman's nose. The lights are amazing, the talk can scream and many shout, and the trend cannot. I saw doco on American filmmaker developers during the recent Fangoria conference. Atkins was one of those listed. He spoke if there was something important about his work, but after looking at this, I don't see anything to import anything. No style, either, and the effects of a terrible video (like delays) only add to the invention. It's not bad however it's fun. Avoid.
