It's not worth looking at this spoiler tacky damage everything about 'Annie'. The characters seem to be close to cheap and low-sense stories for production. It was open for TV, even if I got on my TV, I would like to open it automatically. Children in the film do a good job, but adults do not work and it is not really interesting for you. The film did not have music / dance numbers that made the original talent and it takes Annie's love we all love. Johnson, if Annie is sometimes surprised and on the act ... you can't assure that she is really Annie. The distinction of the character continued to irritate me throughout the film. Sadly, this good was a total flop.
