Not only does this film have a bad plot, a bad trend, and a bad act, it creates a whole new meaning of racism. The "White" chicks are small, "White" boys are grouped-to-be, and successful (yes again) "Traders" are traders who turn toilet. I wonder what will happen if I have done the same film as the line of the same story with the script, just I did about Wakauaca. "Dude, it's good to finally see leaving the contact with small sores." No one seems to see it, but watch this film again and will stop how they showed the new Zealand "white boys". Suddenly his white people are the main reason for the abuse of the group, and they work for the bang quickly. Samoa girls just have a heart, nothing like a girl without a slutty white. It is disrespectful to me that they could not make this film without giving the Wayuau community in New Zealand good news. If you think I am spreading, walk to watch this movie, and see what you are doing for "white boys". Just because Samoans choose to call us "white boys" in real life, it doesn't mean funny. If I say a black boy I will throw my teeth. Do not see this movie. Don't waste your money. Don't be a racist.
