Imagine a place where a group of writers like next to the table and one says "let the black woman go to a non-public member (also black) on the street and ask her if it is black, then go". Other authors fall on the hysterically laughing until someone tells you to repeat in each section. More laughter. Now if you think the premise is amazing, and the show has many kinds of conditions, you will enjoy this show. For the rest, use your wapper and find something else to entertain as watching a dry color. Those who have written reports of this show should get out more or forced to watch television comedies which are really funny. Another example of humor in the show, the girl tries to leave in the supermarket to try to try hypnotise cashier. Frequently it is funny at first but why repeat again and again in different displays with different criminals? I could give other models but these can only be treated as demolition, revealing why this comedy is not quite funny.
