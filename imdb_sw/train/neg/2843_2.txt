Yes, Sakura Killers is a goofy, a movie of awesome ninja, do not make a mistake. But it is also one of the most amazing. This is largely thanks to the presence of surprises for one Chuck Connors, who is billed as a star in the movie but actually shines only in a few scenes. I think he thinks that kind of Obi Wan Kenobi (“Ninja-buster hard”, a copy of the box says) but his 'wisdom' is laughable. "Go without thinking" ??? My friend says this is a sign of loss of mind, not a huge collection. But in fact, his two help, Sonny and Dennis, have a bad conversation like 'Brooklyn', when we call him Colonel, tends to shine in comparison. Especially looking for Dennis's logic about 'genetic splicing' Sakura are involved. If you know anything about cloning you will die laughter. And yes, this is the main point of the plot, people. <br /> <br /> Movie Enjoyable, Sakura Killers is a hard-getting-get gem. I do not spoil the 'trick' that ends with you, except that it is fully installed for the Sakura killers 2. The worst school Chuck Connors died. :-( Because he has a lighter way of hitting ninjas off.
