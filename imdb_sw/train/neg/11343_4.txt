1 looked at 2/2/2003 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Jim Kammerud & Brian Smith): A publisher and an impressive viewer of the Dalmatians originals. very much like the original. One of the most important things about nature was to stimulate the story, which this is not recommended. Animation also cannot be attracted to Disney and all we find is the same characters going to that type of story again. What Disney will stop to distract us with sequels and re-do's etc .. etc. Maybe when we stop leasing or buying this mediocre fare which they have set out.
