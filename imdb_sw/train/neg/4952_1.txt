Okay, I've been a fan of Batman. I loved the series of animated, and even Batman Beyond. I even read the comic of batman now and then. So if I could imagine - I had a little excitement when I heard on this series, and then I was desperate. This series is not something. It has not even begun to match the previous series. It's like one of JU's long business. No depth whatsoever. And what did he have to Joker? Who, in my humble opinion, is the best Batman of all time and killed him. I would like to say his plan was worse. True, I would like to say there is nothing about this series that was creative or interesting. In short (because I believe I could say more) don't waste your time on this show, or your money.
