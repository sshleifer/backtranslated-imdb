You should accept, this version despises Shakespeare ahead! No one can act unless a nurse who was my fav! Juliet had a good skill as a young man but he could not give the emotional depth of his lines and we could never connect to him. She is bad to make the area when she is meditating to drink potion sleep ... god stop whining! I would pour his mouth to bind! Anthony Andrews ... yikes! Considering his other beautiful films (Brideshead Revisited, Ivanhoe, Scarlet Pimpernel), he is a totally shocker in this. And don't let me start Romao ... puhleasssssee! It is still good to see if you're on hunting to see every Romeo and Juliet made in the history of the film. Olivia and Leonard's version is still the best, followed by Leslie Howard and then Leo and Clare's current!
