This movie was arranged by a friend. Her choice is usually good. I read the first cover and expect a good movie. Though <br /> <br /> was a terrible movie. Which I prefer not. But no fear came into mind when watching the film. It was red, <br /> <br /> is not a very entertaining movie. The appearance of Denise Richards <br /> <br /> was a pleasure to the eye. But that's it. We (we are four) We are a little disappointed. But do not feel free to see this film and it'll judge yourself.
