This was the movie of WORST I ever saw! Molly (hall molly) could not act AT ALL! she had no feeling was blah blah blah if she had read out the boring book book. A new baby and a child who loves food (there were no names to remember) were very angry to make me a knife. Whenever he said it was about something scientific or food. Dad Mollys did not feel enough about his missing daughter. The police officer and the father of Mollys said the same thing as four times. it was just awesome. Everything was repeated many ways. Beatrice would have to have something wrong to be very important. I lost a little time in my life by watching this film!
