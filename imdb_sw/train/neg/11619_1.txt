I watched the entire film, waiting and waiting for something to happen. Maybe it's my fault in anticipation of evil and fear instead of psychology? Is it a wonderful story of Oedipal's story: I want to kill my father and mother and marry my uncle and write a music movie with him? I did not understand why other aspects of the plot were present: why the building was over, why was there a great stairwell and a perfect spot for someone to fall into their punishment if nobody was doing it, why events for both the father and the father at work, why A good kitchen if you just go to eat takeout, why the boy wants to be baptized by parents that they are opposing rather than other ways around. I see the positive views of this film ... Has my taste been damaged by going to the 70s movies and the old fil filters?
