All you need to know about this movie comes after the opening area, where someone falls into the lake and eats. Then begins to set up the features of the name: You see "Slugs!" in a large letter, followed soon after "Movie." WHEW! I was worried that I was in danger at "Slugs: The Musical" or "Slugs: The Show Show." In any case, from the film it becomes a fest-killest. You see a boy refusing his hand because he had slugs in his glove gardens, two people are infected with slugs during sex, and a girl falling behind him in the underground way to get stung to death with killer slugs. It is a very good film, comes to a "bad-bad" group. It is also a very bullet for the grainy film that you are shocked to learn was made in 1988 (I think it was 1974). I am very surprised to receive it as high as it is here, because many people here don't get any kind of movie anytime. But if you want a movie that tries to be scary but it is worth being awesome, this is one of your first candidates.
