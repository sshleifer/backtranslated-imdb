I wish I could cast this negative vote, because I think I lost 83 minutes of my life watching the films of films. Acting was too bad for God, meaning that it was so bad, the conversation was worse, the script seemed to be written and ... I can't think of anything that can be scary. And the day "out" and the night "inside" shots make you think the events took several days. It is widely used, directed, written, etc. etc. by all means up to gofer how it gets lunch for everyone. Go away from this one in all things. If my only saving grace of staying out of hell is by doing one good act, it's telling the world not to look at this trick. This movie is the real reason why awesome movies are never available.
