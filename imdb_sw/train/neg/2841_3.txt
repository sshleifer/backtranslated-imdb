SAKURA KILLERS (1+ outdoor 5 stars) Perhaps in 1987 this film may have been shown cool ... if you have never seen a * good ninja movie *. Cheesy 'music of 80s ... cheesy chat ... cheesy act ... and the most-cheesy martial arts way. The most cool place is at the beginning ... with Chuck Connors aged playing golf on the beach ... Many black ninjas are trying to laugh at him and it looks like he is willing to hit his ball to realize ... suddenly he reaches his pocket of golf and ... naw, I'm not going to destroy you ... if you've ever had a bad luck to see this film you will thank me. Stories are a lot of ignorance about stolen videotape or something. A group of Caucasi heroes are taught through a ninja because "just a ninja can fight a ninja" or something like that. Strange, these don't seem to fight better after their training than before ... oh well, the movie does not move along pretty briskly. Fighting events may not be good .. but they contain a lot ... and the sound effects are more good for a few.
