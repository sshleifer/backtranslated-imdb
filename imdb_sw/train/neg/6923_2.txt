An awesome Mexican film from a short story by Edgar Allan Poe about a news messenger who wants to go to a protected button hidden in the forest to write a story about how it works, etc. ... When our hero, Gaston, is due to show The big and Dr Maillard, the head of the reserve, we see all sorts of things that thinks to be horrible, as the men who are around almost long in the ditch, and the comedic, as our hero will be joked on by the soldiers as he climbs the ladder hanging along the building. Then there is one that can be meant to be two: one of the man dressed as a chicken, yes, is right chicken, which hits along the ground for feeding chickens. The area was a comparison of the film, but, at least for me, it was the lowest of the film and what was so widespread when you thought that men and women who were older thought this could even be part of the entertainment. Ah! That's really a real fear that is Dr Tarr and its Legion of Change of Name. And that brings me this fact on a film that is a lot of films that cause a lot of headaches usually have some kind of big problem. Yes, this is obvious, but some distribution problems with others, which this is one, has many changes to the head so that someone can buy the same garbage immediately. This is definitely trash. It has very little to go to it. The only artist who should watch is Claudio Brook as the head of the reserve. He is one great slabe of ham as he laughs carefully, orders to ban, sashays and sword in hand, and magnify the chicken. I am very tired to hear saying about the "respiratory system" as its way of treating mental illness. What? It's a group of humor (Hey, film like this and a script like this deserves this word word). It won't take you long to think about what's going on in the reserve or will not be more interesting. Cinematic chicken beginning!
