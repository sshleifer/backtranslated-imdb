From the director Barbet Schroder (Reversal Fortune), I think I saw a little of this in my Media Training class, and I recognized the leading actor, so I tried it, despite the scores of critics. Basically a young child Richard Haywood (Ryan Gosling of Half Nelson) and Justin Pendleton (Publisher of Michael Pitt) killed a bomber girl to identify themselves and see if they could leave without police getting. Investigation is the murder of Cassie 'The Hyena' Mayweather (Sandra Bullock) and a new colleague Sam Kennedy (Ben Chaplin), who have loved the evidence found in the area, e.g. unrelated hair. The plan is not quite visible because Cassie and Sam are making a quick Richard or Justin as suspects, it is a question of whether they can drive them out. He also has a star Agnes Bruckner like Lisa Mills, Chris Penn as Ray feathers, R.D. Call as Captain Rod Cody and Tom Verica as Asst. D.A. Al Swanson. Now I can see the same concept as Sir Alfred Hitchcock's string and kill it with something challenging, but this film makes it so secretly, neither even the very good Bullock can save it from being bad and predictable. Enough!
