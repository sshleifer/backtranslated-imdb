All the wonderful things happening in this sitcom depend on Jim's character as a bad father, a bad man or just a whole of selfishness. What? That could be funny? Of course the character in the sitcom should be guilty, but Jim's behavior has failed in a merciless manner. <br /> <br /> And why? I think it's that because "should now be better". Jim is not a fool, he can take care of things and he has the opportunity to do so. But he chooses. It is a choice of what he does, when he chooses to play with his children, not to go shopping because he does not want to buy "woman's products" and is the choice he does, when he keeps his family. Some of the other characters seem to be just in a row so Jim can have someone to be jerk for. If Cheryl's character was a real person, it would have left him years ago, and not staying with the killings for 8 years.
