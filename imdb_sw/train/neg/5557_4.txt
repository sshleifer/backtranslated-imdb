Okay, but does this make this movie beautiful? Well, it's not true, in my opinion. But not all suggest. It got very slow, fast, in fact.it also predicts too much through and through. One and two could be predictable, but not much. I also noticed that this film was sometimes a star, which I had no thought of considering this series and character. Jeff Fahey is the worst evil in this phase. he is a good enough actor, but I felt played his character too on top.I think that it fits the sound of the movie, which would have been good if I loved the movie.plus, there was some evil one liners .Arnold Vosloo returns in the role of the head , but has been given a little to work with in this film. Characterization has not changed, as iilvyotarajia.oh well.this is just my opinion, for me, when this movie is not bad, it's a very bad vote for Darkman III: 3.5 / 5
