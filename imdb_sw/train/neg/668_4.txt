Therefore, Night Night was supposed to be a terrible and exciting movie. I am very big and I was afraid to see this film at first, but after seeing it, it's not horror or thriller. I was amazed at the movie on my seat because it was so predictable. You can predict what happens next. The young players were fond of playing their characters, but I'd like to say the killer was obviously on a wise game. Yes, I will give them props for a plot because it was good, but not exciting or scary. There was almost zero "flying-in-your screens". So, don't lose ten dollars when you see on the movie stations, try entering the DVD.
