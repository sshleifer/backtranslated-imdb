I couldn't believe I spent $ 14.00 on this. The only way of deliverance is a terrible year. Dubbing was worse than I had. It looks like it was hit by a VHS camera. I think every fennig spent on special effects because there were many parts of blood and body parts everywhere. It is one of the worst movies I have ever seen but I must admit that many times that were not as disgusting as it could be because the whole movie is deceptive and unreliable
