The film deals with two former football players who are Fred Williamson, (Mack Derringer) and Gary Busey, (Lenny) who work as private eyes and meet all kinds of women and men with a bad nature. Mack Derringer is approaching his former Vanity wife (Jennifer Derringer) who works in the sex chat room. Jennifer is threatened by one caller who wants to do the horrible things to her and asks her help with several other women. Mack & Lenny have more time on their hands and often go to Miami, Fl. golf course or depend on the Bar Games where all city items are going on. There are lots of lots, murder and a lot of two key words that brings this film completely under ZERO big. Don't waste your time, this film only got 50 cents and that was too big.
