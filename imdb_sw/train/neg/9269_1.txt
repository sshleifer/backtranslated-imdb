Well since seeing section 1 to 3 I can honestly say that you should not have any part 4. Everything from effectiveness, and I DO means to do a bad job with the worst, I try anyone to look at this and not be bored out of they thought. It refers to sections 1 to 3 that have the power of vibe on the Damion field, but without it near this this is not the same. Certainly at the end of section 3 I was a little tired of the story line, but it was well closed at the end of one third. Again there is no reason to part 4. Even if they could do better than this sh * t I was a ticket, lol. There it will be an hour and a half of my life I will never see them again.
