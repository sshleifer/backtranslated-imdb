The movie was bad. The Theater was dead in silence because everyone was ashamed to be there looking at the trash. I think someone gave Jet Li lobotomy and made him do a script with a written five-year-old conversation. Military art is 'ok', but when close to Jackie Chan movies and "The Matrix" it is better to see one of them.
