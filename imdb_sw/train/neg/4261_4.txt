Pathetic. This is what happens when the director comes to work because the person pays. The aim was good, beautiful places and films of epic numbers. But performance, damn! I swear, in some shots you can see additional on the background look in the camera, or watch executives because no one told them what they should do when they hear "Action!". The war of war is so bad that you wonder - are these people really? They could do more damage by clinging. In slow cases you can see people on the battlefield walking around or standing, holding hands. The only step in front is somehow stressed. But why? The story is so useless and cannot, it looks like a random situation for historical order, sometimes however. The talk is dumb, the plot of love is more humiliating and ridiculous than in Hong Kong movies. With a budget of 40 million, and you can see every dollar invested on the screens, in a more favorable manner, the final result of this great effort is a round-off laser disk in a small cover on a video store .
