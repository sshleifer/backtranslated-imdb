They were beaten though nothing special, they all work fine, the story looks like a good idea, the script is loaded and the last has a very good tist; so what is wrong? To start special effects is very bad (if this was given in 60 years) it might seem similar but in 2003 there is no reason to be seen as poor like this. It makes me laugh that the DVD cover says very proud 'from a special creator of Creepers' Jeepers. The second dimension is weak, this film is not the essence of the story, the doctor feeding the patient's hospitals to the devil (or a demon-forming creature) should be strong or afraid; not just. <br /> <br /> All in all this is a very bad film, and though it can carry and occasionally enjoy it gently, it is still better left alone. <br /> <br /> A rather sad 4/10
