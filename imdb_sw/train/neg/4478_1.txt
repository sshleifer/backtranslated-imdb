I had no expectations of this film - a little fun. Wuthering Heights can be transformed into a suitable modern story - good and soap, hub and exciting. But this film decided to give us the talent of people involved in the simpering version so much water from the source material that was strange they had guts to call Wuthering Heights at all. It ignores the fact that it is the story of people who are of a different nature, especially those who are not feeling, and constantly interacting with one another. It changes the realities of certain characters - Isabelle, for example, in the novel, did not have a bone of his bones in his body - he took his blind course and turned him into a prostitute. Heathcliff is a bad person who psychologically tortures many people in his way, but in this edition Catherine has left his daughter in his ministry. This discussion is one and one wondering how the administrators could win any of the direct faces. In a deep space or a real sense, we know they mean something when they shout in someone's face. I have read criticism on the early 90s edition, "Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights" which included Ralph Fiennes and Juliette Binoche, saying that it turned out a dark story, a very gorgeous Gothic in the competition of sudsy bodice. Excellent tips, but the MTV version is going to go further, using the basic story formula to provide cumorting of beach coastal music on very bad music.
