Other unsuspecting film vendors include. <br /> <br /> From real life experience, this film continued to despair from the beginning. I now served my second visit to Iraq as a newborn child. This film has nothing to do with what will happen in real life events. From the beginning of the name of a few: the bomb of the bomb, EOD's out of the air without escort, the EOD attendant blowing VBC, with the rolled sleeves when grown in ACU, where I had to visit the stop 2 dollars without a copy, the sniper area. The list will continue, however, it is not appropriate to write inappropriate things that take place over a period of 2 minutes before other inaccuracies; and the action was released. <br /> <br /> This movie is for people and critics to check that they have no experience or experience with deployments or military. The people with military background or military skills will be disappointed with inaccuracies.
