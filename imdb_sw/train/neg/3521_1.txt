I am still engaging in KUSA's view of this film again. I have seen practical movies, I have loved quite a few, but this goes up. Not only the worst male actors (Sly Stallone) played the role of leadership, but the plot of the movie is stupid since the beginning (why don't you steal money when the plane is down, it would be Hell very easy) that requires someone and IQ under his shoenumber believe. Furthermore, the plot does not really change, a three-year-old child can think what happens next. It is a set of buttons (the genre of the genre), and Sly does even worse than his other movies (he was even better than Rambo III if you look at the film as a comedy instead of an action film). Now there is an actor who cannot act A) surprised B) sad C) anything else than his primary face. I would like to explain that this film has two things that can make other people like that. Events are ideal, but then ... you can see better than July 4. The pieces of MANDA are magnificient, but then ... there is a document about the Alps and Himalayas, so you can see the best sights that way, instead of wasting time on flick this. <br /> <br /> Go look at another movie instead, there are hundreds, even thousands of practical movies.
