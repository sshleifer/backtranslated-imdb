This movie is more deceptive than at any time, using a festive actress like Walken playing in this piece of junk made like it seems to have nothing better than playing a role of boring like this! And the fact that the movie was supposed to be close to the magician and you can't see it until the end of the movie but at the same time you have to sit and watch this boring film when it gets, or tries to get a definite point and you should go through all this way of boring executives and monitors think of all the time you used another movie and decide on this and how you left your money only makes the wrong time there. I would like to watch cartoons for good. Leave this alone, please!
