1 looked 5/27/2009 - 4 out of 10 (Dir - Harold Young): The 3rd Universal mummy movie is similar to the first two away from the final result from view viewer. The story is similar to the results available. This time the story area is U.S. as a new Egyptian priest sends mummy to our country with hope he can raise him to kill the children of those who opened the original tomb. At this time the mummy is played by Lon Chaney (which is not very different because it is not necessary to do a lot of work on this character). The new priest becomes the village pastor and sends the mummy out to do his dirty actions after giving him a leaf of tanna leaf. Again, the girl gets on the way, if the priest falls to the widow of the parents and wants her, yes â€” that she did not die with him (we did not hear this information before?). The plan is, of course, damaged as the city of the city that laughs mummy and lighting (similar to the Frankenstein monster) and the burning of the creature there is the last story ... how do they get sequel? I think you will see and next in the series? or not .....
