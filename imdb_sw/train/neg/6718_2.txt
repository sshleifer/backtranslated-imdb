I wanted to see movies because of the article in the film magazine. It was not highly recommended by the critic. The storyline is different and I am sure that it can be a good movie if it was in the right hands. To direct and act was bad! I had a feeling of watching a film made of a group of amateurs. Although the movie began promising, it became worse and worse. I think this is an odd movie with spelling characters. I still think it's worth checking if I haven't seen movies caused by gay sex. Don't put your high expectations though, then you will be very disappointed. * from *****
