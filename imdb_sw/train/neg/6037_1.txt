Moron and the partner performs the resurrection to the dead, in an attempt to prove that the dead cannot be resurrected. Not surprisingly, they revive the dead soul that begins to beat them with copper, and the next day some of the college-age people tell stories around the fire. The boy with the axis comes back and begins to walk on stories telling stories. This group calls the fighters, the army sees blood spread everywhere and thinks it is a mountain lion (!?) And after a short time it is affected by a destructive killer who can or cannot be a spirit. Moronic movie a small splatter which was locked in the afternoon afternoon but where several characters carry the buttons and chat as though midnight, and they want to send a symbol of the sign to attract. One boy has a gun with one hand and a shot on the other side but he does not want to load it, then after carrying it, he has several opportunities to kill the killer but it does not bother, because it will end the movie very early. Then gives us a gun! It also has characters who do not show sensitivity and little less after their friends have been cut into pieces and the lousy effects (the human heart looks like a piece of poultry, a car hit at the end is a typical car) and a bad conversation with another female weakness you don't have any help. And finally tries to run and enough to say that it was all the innovations of the same college-age people of the story stories at the beginning of this movie. Then the murderer returns to the truth in the last place to beat them into pieces. Again. That kind of helper is just good for laughing unexpectedly. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 out of ****
