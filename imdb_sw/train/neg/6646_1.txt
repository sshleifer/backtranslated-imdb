It is very sad that the Romanian audience still has evil and uneducated people who enjoy this kind of cheap exhibition and exhibition, as high and brutal as a series of "Garcea" or a child "Vacanta mare". The difference is that Mugur Mihäescu, Doru Octavia Dumitru and other small artists never claim to claim their exhibition as "art". Pintilie, who 40 years ago made a very good film ("Duminicä la ora") followed by another, good enough ("Reconstituirea"), tries to announce his long film "art works" - but, unfortunately, his masters in a very small way to express themselves. So, "Niki Ardelean" offers no longer a sample of "HOW NOT" - this is just about its reputation.
