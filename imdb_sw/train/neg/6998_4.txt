Hollywood was always having trouble coming to terms with "religious pictures." An amazing mine shows that there is no discrimination. Although you are using good healing gifts, and being invested in the top budget, and effective photography by Robert Planck, the movie fails to overcome the credibility of honesty. Perhaps the reason is that the film looks so realistic that the sudden entry of fantasy items eliminates the view of the viewer in action and the destiny of the characters. I found it difficult to stay still through all the statues made, similar to biblical references, and it is impossible to agree with the light of Ian Hunter who know that they are all as an example of Christ. With censors in Boston, Detroit and Providence at least agreed with me. The movie was banned. A few of Boston / Detroit / Providence films, if any, were complained or went to other cities because it was obvious from the trailer that Gable and Crawford appeared in the "photo message". It had dropped everywhere. Normally, the movie has enjoyed something of revival on TV. The home atmosphere seems to make the story of more films receive audience. However, with the growing characteristics of a non-strange or unusual film, this amazing flow of strands have predictable lines, which will not have anyone who tries to see how the main characters will ultimately think.
