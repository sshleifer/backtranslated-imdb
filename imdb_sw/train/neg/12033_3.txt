Modern about a small town with the same number of Mormons and Baptists. The new family comes in, explore the published talks, the usual acting, green and yellow carrots, and everything 'in the Mormon joke' known to man. Anyone outside the Mormon culture will have a hard time to strengthen this movie. Anyone within the Mormon culture will be a little troubled by chuckle here and there. You will be very good to watch other Hess movies (Napoleon Dynamite, etc.). Acting is mediocre. Jared Hess has had hands on the best film as "Saints and Soldiers", and "Napoleon Dynamite". I would like to recommend both movies on that cry.
