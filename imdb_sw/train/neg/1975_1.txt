Be completely honest, I haven't seen many western films but I've seen enough to know what's good. This is now more west in the world today. Come! Who has ever thought that this could be a cool movie wall that everyone would like were a bit, no one, completely losing! Second on that day and age women black women were not able to carry or use guns. Chick Asian speaking English perfect? If settings are west, Asia is not where you go. Finally, the wicked chick of homosexuals was very much movie started just from scratch. Now don't get bad I am not colored or white or so don't enter after reading this but this movie, this movie is the worst presentation of black people I've ever seen!
