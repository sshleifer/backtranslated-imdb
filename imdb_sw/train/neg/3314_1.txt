Reading through all these positive comments I feel is lucky. What? How many enjoyed what I think is the worst match of my second novel of Jane Austen? There are many problems with the film, already mentioned in the inspections; just set it hammed-up, over-performed, aggressive chintzy from opening credit to completed completion. <br /> <br /> While most characters are mis-cast and neither Ewan McGregor nor Toni Collette puts into practice which are eligible, the worst is Paltrow. I am very pleased with his performance in certain tasks, but here he is disgusting - he feels himself, nose, slouching and cut off from his characters and those around him. A very frightening effort - though even Emma is perfect can not save this film.
