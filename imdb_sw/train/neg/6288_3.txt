After reading a lot of comments here, I wonder that no one has found this as basically remake over the Twilight area from the 1960s called "Mirror Image," and Vera Miles. Rod Serling did a better job of creating a spooky story of more than 24 minutes than Sean Ellis did for 88 minutes and this stirring snooze. A short piece can be effective and anonymous and untreated, but in a feature film, it should be more relevant and the story should be meaningful. Sadly, the substance and mind are two things that are not "The Broken." Yes, it has some time, but it's not enough to prove your time. More practice: although this is a modern story, it's not one character in a movie with a mobile phone! And although a car accident is a story that has a story, there is no record for the insurance company, for someone who was driving another vehicle, or for the police who would be required to make a report. My advice: skip this time and look at the original nature!
