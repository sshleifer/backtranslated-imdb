After many bad memories, I took this cross every time it showed in the 2nd Season sequence. I recently watched it again to remind me why. I've been seeing that this is the worst ST: part of TNG (except "Shades of Gray," which can not count as part at all.) <br /> <br /> I have continued to listen to the debate and think of the red-penciled script and author Write 101 writing: "SHOW, don't tell!" From the declaration of Deanna Troi, and a reminder to everyone regularly reminding about what was interesting, the risk of Okona, is for Guinan's description of how funny joke of droid is (not), for whom - who cares to solve the crisis, no 's plot of action that has not been shown and three times is stressed for strengthening, and there is no reliable time in anything. Unfortunately, Bill Campbell, a good actor in another situation, is also a dog-puppy huggable to be the center of a conspiracy plot. On the other hand, there may be no one missed by John Barrowman (Jack Harkness from “Doctor Who”) who can pull the characters down here. <br /> <br /> (Zero points, by the way, by the element of data. I think Joe Piscopo left that a few decades ago, he and Brent Spiner didn't have anything to work here. Though Jerry Lewis bit was funny in the way of stupid.) <br /> <br /> On a good day, you can be able to think of this as a delightful little service for the bottom of the Series Series. I, I'd like to fly forward "During the Square" or "Q Who."
