This movie was not so bad, I couldn't believe that I was watching. Directing, editing, production, and script all seemed to be done by secondary school students who do not know much about movies. There was no flow of stories that made any kind of mind. The great emotional times and constraints (such as earlier between Heath Ledger and Naomi Watts) and behavioral relationships (as described at the beginning of the beginning) completely and where not to be established if they would have loved more with an effective film. The characters are depressed, and so difficult to have any relationship with them. Acting, surprisingly, is not a bad thing, but a horrible text removes the convincing exhibition. Film plays as T.V. The worst northern / epic bad, and sadly reduces the fascinating (true) story that tries to tell. I have read many comments that protect the film as important for Australians because of the issue. That's all very well, but because Ned Kelly is an important historical icon of Australia does not work well. No one says that the issue is not good, only the quality of the film itself. Pearl's park was about an important historical event for Americans, but that does not mean that I defend the film and say it's good, because it was still bad. Defeat all, though Heath and Orlando are interested in watching.
