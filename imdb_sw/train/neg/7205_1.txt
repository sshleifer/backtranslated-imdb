If you would like to enjoy what should begin as a 2 hour movie in a burst of disruption, you will love this film. Otherwise, you will be surprised how they could make the film from something very easy to translate into a large screen like the Auditor's Gadget. <br /> <br /> In the preview of the film, many images were shown not in the film, and within the film, some events will not be meaningful. When the movie is less than 1 hour and a half, I can only think of one time a truly memorable, and that's before or during credit! <br /> <br />
