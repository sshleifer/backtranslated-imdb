Liongate has not yet appeared. Each movie from the lionsgate has caused. I've tried and tried to try to give them more opportunities and they continue to beat me often. And the Cabin Fever is definitely no exception. I could not even remember the priority for this film was exciting and bad. Guy eliminates a dead dog for some reason. She is infected with a random virus, taking the children to the camp, children begin to become infected and die, the city learns about it and instead of helping them, they kill them. then water is contaminated and everyone dies. The end. <br /> <br /> Hardly, that's the whole movie. All characters are completely lost, care for any of them, and one child should remain with the boy meets the world. My friend and I found that talking about how fat and our fellow colleagues would be more interesting than considering this movie. We've been able to make it all the way to the whistle at $ @ t, because this film will make you do it. And still I am confused by the slow martial move of one child of the order and how everyone looks out of the country has completely lost and refuses. And again, why did this dog attack a girl? Why was the baby trying to kill sitting in the chair waiting for them to kill him? was that part of their two plan? wow. The best deal ever. I can't believe this movie was released for exhibitions. I would very much on the DVD belly, then alone and stay in the theater is not moving for an hour and a half. It was not terrible, or pleasant, or cool, or nothing. it's just losing 90 minutes that you can use ... don't know, plant a tree or something. it produces more than this garbage. Acting, special effects, and script is joke. never take this. <br /> <br /> The cabin park gets a good footing area, out of 10
