Imagine turning the American song on the cartoon. Throw in two beautiful animals, some awesome puns and a pair of roller skate and you would like to find yourself with a real replica of this film. I remember seeing this when I was young; I made my mother borrow from a video shop 5. The story itself is not so bad, it's just looking for Marxists there is certainly something to complain about. If you don't like America you love this film.
