I would like to list this film under a terrible movie type. Since the fear of the species comes close to the horror I have decided to put it in this category. Acting was amateurish. You know who criminals will be in the first place. Heroine is as bad as a movie. Students making movies should take this movie as an example for a lesson not necessarily do in the film. It's bad. Man is a bad word is reduced. Criminals take over the seabed and want 10 million dollars. They would be sitting duck after getting money. Is there no village plan? How dumb. Cruise's female director is an old cop, navy seal, kung fu I'm afraid. The hilarious part is a way that brings the time bomb. He says he knows what he is doing and continues to connect all the wires directly. Then he puts in his pocket and according to the film and all existing connections. Is it mad? As mad we looked at this openly. If you have M-i-L who doesn't like. To rent his rent this movie and pretend to enjoy it. I assure you that she will tell your wife that you have such a bad taste and that her son / daughter has married her family.
