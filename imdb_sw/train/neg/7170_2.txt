Yikes made this blow of film. The characters were weak, weak plot. I thought this can't be too bad because it has Christoper Walken, oops. He must have done this because he was tired and needs money. The characters were supposed to be Russians but nobody had a feeling of Ireland. I am trying to find something good about this, I can't but Walken did a good job with wooden behavior. Get something to read, or see discoveries, never see this movie.
