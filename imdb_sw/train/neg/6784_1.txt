I tried to watch this film twice and even then distribute the most influential parts but still can't make it last. I don't understand how this movie * actually gets any positive views. I think these people give good feedback if they are just trying to make it a film for marketing purposes. Their review appears to be untrue and looks like a domestic work, which makes things more sad. Movies should get a realistic view of their steam and not made !! <br /> <br /> Acting was reminiscent of a movie of cheesy movie, and not in a funny way. I don't care about low budget films and act dry if they know how to work with it. <br /> <br /> I have seen a leading attitude to persuade. His facial expressions and humor was sandy. I thought this was the intention of making the women's conspiracy seem to be fun and founded, but it was worse. The script was also very bad (his superiors decreased business speech) with unpleasant words. I don't get anything liberating about this movie except some attractive women. <br /> <br /> I have never felt that the mark was this misleading. I was fascinated by its Columns but I was afraid of everything else. Of course check if you want, but I don't need someone else to get their hopes / waste their time. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's just me ... Maybe not.
