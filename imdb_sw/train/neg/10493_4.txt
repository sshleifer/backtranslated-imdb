Hard to share movies. I did not give them a collection of 110% and so simple as the conspiracy seemed to be quite uncertain who was doing what the FBI's American characters and their work were. Nor can I treat them very much Irwins as film actors when their lines and events were all in the style of one of its performances, not being done. This is nothing more than a part of the glory of the TV found to show, along with a little insignificant plot, which seemed only to find a way. However if any Irwin show is always worth watching, this film is well worth also, but not Christmas day. Talking about that, I have good things to do also than being here. 3/4
