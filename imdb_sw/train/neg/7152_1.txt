According to an independent novel with a friend of the same age group and F. Fitzgerald, the magic pastor Sheila Graham wrote this trashy story. Gregory Peck continues to go beyond the embarrassment such as a strong drink-or-be-damned; as opposed to Scott Fitzgerald who spoke soft and gentle. Considering the era of Fitzgerald's handwriting, at the end of his life, a highly respected writer was, in fact, living a quiet and anti-dominant lifestyle at a time when AA was still unknown. Fitzgerald had no one too proud to restore his bankruptcy stories to support all his wife (mental hospital) and his daughter (at the university). Living in a small apartment with a second hand Chevrolet his life was different than 180 degrees than shown in this film. Welcome to every 20th Century-Fox movie released during Daryll F. Zanuck's leadership, with almost every film directed by Henry King, it was a work of excellence. Dear Infidel was different.
