SPOILERS. The brave people of the hospitality have been watching this film. Allow me to increase the ratio by describing the following: <br /> <br /> Script: Dreadful. As Tom and Dan "know each other," a ban on the film, the talk is open to one person, and I am accused of being the director, who worked carefully with his words to be intellectual. One time, Dan asks, "Have you heard about HIV?" and looks on nature as to ask, "Have you communicated with nine foreign communities?" Make: The eyes of white color and chiseled face do not have a good executive does. Speedman did well for what he was given, I think, but Marsden was terrible - not feeling, unreliable, and sleepy and surprising during his imprisonment. There is a lack of exhibition (also see Interstate 60). Plot: Give me! During the half escape they were not exciting but angry and weak. Remember Marsden pretending to try the keys on the door and then throw them down: "They don't work, man!" Tee-hee. And beware of semi-black and white publications, which are developed by the schlocky sound taken from CSI and other blood crimes. Most importantly, the most dangerous, evil, and offensive, is a homophobia (outward or indoor, you decide) in a film that HIV is considered to be a weapon. Tom says that Dan may have removed a condom or not used it - forgive me, where is Tom when they have sex? There is an engagement of a partner who comes out as a female woman in general. In total: Beware!
