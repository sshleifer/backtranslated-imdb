Executive, very successful in his academic life but can not fail in his normal life, meets a young man with a low illness, who survived from the shelter. All actors feel alone, and the intellectual person will show the beauty of small things in life ... For this argument, somehow Amelie-like situation with emotional music, I did not expect but a hateful ethnic movie. However, if there were interesting events (a young man is sometimes a strong man), and the interpretation of all actors, Daniel Auteil and Pasqal Duquenne, was very good, I decided to go to the film. The French film, in general, has the ability to show something that is very visible in life, as opposed to the most hit American movie. But, because of it, it is more than a disappointment to see after the end of the mysterious death, the incredible death of the young man, a pleasant tone, the happiness of the executive family, the cheap values, the unspeakable laughter of the daughter, the boy rise from heaven like Michael Landon ... In fact it's bad, in my opinion of humility.
