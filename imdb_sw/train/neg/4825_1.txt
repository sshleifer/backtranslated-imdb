Looking for the impression, and other reviews on this site, I was ready for a terrible terrible movie that focuses on junkies. I found it complete to complete on the junkies. I wonder if there is another movie called "Cookers" which these people have reviewed? There are only 3 main characters, and none of them hit me as well written or well done. Basically the whole movie I have been shaking my head and surprised by the folly of drug addicts. <br /> <br /> Are you gracious. Do not rent this movie. Tax "Cabin Fever" or another good movie of fear. Hell, rent "Mary Poppins"! Animated Penguins are more powerful and more interesting than what you will find in "cookers."
