I don't even have to watch this film, since it is not really horrible movies - and so it is not worth considering Dr. Cheese. At least, they are not afraid in the common sense. Certainly it is a terrible proposal to waste your time watching this trick. That is why I ended it after the first four hours. Imagine my surprise, then, when the hour showed that just 45 minutes passed. Yes, that's right; in plain words, this film is b-o-r-i-n-g. "Command" was a lot of errors, not all special. In particular, it seems to me the main problem with the "religious" film of awesome films is the lack of interest in Hollywood to share a Christian's own issue. It is quite possible to make real films that are also religious. Just ask William Peter Blatty. In fact, without religion, the film like this is anything that goes to the idea of ​​film artists (usually angry and unknown). Think about it. If someone made a film directly about, say, physics, but not just getting the basic rules of physics wrong, but according to the whole plot on its wrong illustrations, you will be tired of that useless plot. It also goes to these types of movies. In other words, the "Command" (and many similar movies before it) comes out of all the fabric elements about the Catholic Church and about the Christian faith and attempt to create a plot outside of this innovation. Of course, the conspiracy remains alive and stupid. This movie has added charms to be interesting to look like toenails grow. Avoid this bunch.
