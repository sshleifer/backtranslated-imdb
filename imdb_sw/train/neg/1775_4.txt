According to a typical short story by an author of fear Stephen King about the so-called 'Sleepwalkers' of the lifeless creatures who exploit life from widows so that this power can lay them. They have been running away from mankind for centuries we have been told and have been directly taken until there are only two left. Philam starts when a good mother and son arrive in a sleepy city, they are the last sleepwalkers they are on the prowl for widows to eat. Mother sends her child to enroll in high school so that she can look for a virgin, she does (Madchen Amick) and tries to find her alone so that she can breastfeed. It is not clear why a mother cannot look for young people - it will make things easier to think if young people can follow more beautiful women in a secret place than a young girl following a teenager. However his plans are faced with a girl fighting back, playing a pencil on her ear. Police called and hunt is over !. The child is sick from his injuries and so the mother goes to the killings of lost fighters and crying in the hunt for a girl who hurt her child and beat the pain sores during the year. Finally the girl kills the mother-end of the movie. This movie is garbage !. Acting is different, from Brian Krause's average to Alice Krige better. Specific effects are moderate, and show some of the effects of earlier computers which are very interesting as it shows how far these things have continued in a very short time. Trends are hit by the film falling into the camp. The director seems to be sure if we should be afraid of sleep or treat them compassionately and when it is difficult to allow the film to be modern. Stephen King comes am amusing silence as an angry garden like Mark Hamill, as a puzzled soldier. Alice Krige seems to focus on the film, her character is given deep and gives an indication of what the film can have better screens and excellent patterns.
