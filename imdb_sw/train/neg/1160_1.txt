This should be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It is (I think) the basketball player's basketball story, his hard-but-right coach, his girlfriend, and his colleague (played by Michael Margotta) who has a constant nervous breakdown. The story goes anywhere, there is the development of zero behavior, no one cares, and displays, except Bruce Dern as coach, is awesome. It's hard to believe how talent like Jack Nicholson could lead the movie that bad. Make sure you avoid this turkey.
