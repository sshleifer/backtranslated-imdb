I missed 10 minutes or the first minute of the film but I don't think of looking at it from the beginning would have made any difference. I saw that the film was very boring and was broken and acting. I remember Patrick Swayze and some of the other actors (Roy Marsden, for example) in the best roles but all disconnected here because of the very weak script. "Solomon's Plants" ... a very small part of the film in the "mines" was almost as exciting as looking at the dry color and I am sure that even the original school child would be bound to watch the war "warriors". The whole movie reminded a series of American television-priced TV. Give me Indiana Jones any day!
