The last judge has Joe Don Baker's great home around Texas, shooting people who shoot people. Then he has gone to Malta where he makes more people. It gets locked often for people to shoot. Then he enters into an armed man, who is dressed as a monk. There is a boat after, and Joe Don wind up to jail again. Finally Joe Don, with help from Elaine from "Seinfeld" to kill a bad man, hit a boat or two and someone is shot. All this with an interesting theme, like Mitchell!
