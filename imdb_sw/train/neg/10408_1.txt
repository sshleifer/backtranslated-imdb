If Fassbinder has made the film worse, they certainly don't want to see it! Anyone who complains that his films are talking and claustrophobic should be obliged to see this, learn to know the most appropriate style of choice that he chose in the best film as "The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant". This film film under many pictures, quasi-symbol pictures looks like a "film film". Situated in the slaughterhouse and area where Elvira's friend-channel-friend for what seems like ten minutes are just two examples of what makes this film a real test of the patient's patience. But what he feels most about it is a few events involving Elvira and his ex-wife and / or daughter. These are the only time that expresses any genuine humanity, and confirming that on the basis of this terrible film, there was an excellent film struggling to liberate itself. What is it.
