I have seen a lot of stupid plans during my time, but this is among the worst. After discovering some disease in space, the astronaut returns to the earth and begins to melt. Then it goes on people, and killing people (how much more than I, I just look at them, I can't tell them.) This is the kind of movie that shouldn't be done first.
