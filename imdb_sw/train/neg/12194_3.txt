The movie begins with a voice about where to tell the audience, and who the characters are. And when I hated the movie. For all the endless possibilities of any filmmaker, I see a very simple and affordable solution to explain the situation in the voice of telling everything. In fact I believe the voice sounds betraying the idea of ​​making a film. I like to hear from the voice of saying where we are, what dates we have, and especially what the characters feel and think. I believe that the director needs to find a way to see the impressions and ideas of the audience to the audience. But after the negative effects of intro, a very interesting movie begins and continues to go long enough. The middle family and all the members of each other are shown in a perfect way. I think the director has a talent to capture the realities of life. For example, a father who should make his personal calls from the bathroom may seem odd for the first time, but life itself leads us to some situations that may seem unusual but also common. I think the director is a very good observer about real life. <br /> <br /> But that's it. Over time, the origin of the film begins to offer a sacrifice to tell stories. I really felt like I had a headache because of the endless characters. It was like actors and actors were given a lesson and were allowed to cancel the conversation. It's really true, but the characters always ask "really, it's so" etc. for each other, or the characters saying "no" or "you listen," ten times when you say just once it is enough to have a headache. <br /> <br /> I also think playing and making a reading book is more then they should be. I understand that playing with a book in the movie is very much related to the plot, but I think the director has lost a point where he should stop showing these events.
