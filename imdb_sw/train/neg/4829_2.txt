As a typical movie player I can say I have enjoyed watching this. It is not very emotional for a sporting game, not to get excited, not too fast to act. More, some time films are unreliable. Well, I understand, the soldiers are out of their minds out there, but it's hard to believe that someone could risk his life, hostage in the city of hate, and after shouting by the wife of the refugee refugee, without asking a question (in the right way) . It seems to be romantic if it is an animation or so, but it should be a great film on war. There are several cases like this, so the whole picture makes sense that it is the first preview of the film, and it requires a great job. It feels like the creators of the film liked to create a picture of the brave soldier, but all these 'curves' of his psychology seem unusual. This picture has left a question in my head: WHAT? Why did they give Oscar? Why SIX? And IMHO is an exciting part of the movie :)
