Okay, the exhibition of "Indians" who are not found in this story is clearly WRONG. I agree that Elvis looks good here, but yes, his skin color looks changing during the film. I was thinking, OK, ... he never was in real life. It is some of the color of the 'horse' which I have ever seen. It is as bad as 'Indians' in 'F-Troop' and western Hollywood who were played by Jewish and Italian actors and not native Americans! <br /> <br /> This movie is the same, but it is usually a limping story and mediore songs, as in all future films of Elvis. He made them just because Collin Parker tied him bound under long-term telecommunications to squeeze a lot of money from Elvis as possible! I continue to think 'thank God' that Elvis stopped making movies ever not long after this film came out. It is good to see actors of Joan Blondell, Katy Jurado, L.Q. Jones, Henry Jones and Meredith Burgess in this film, though. Bustess Meredith's 'indian' makeup completely AWFUL. It's the worst group for sure. What did the film staff think? Did Mr. Meredith do this just for money or what? I love some Elvis movies, though. For example: 'I love Tender', 'Jailhouse Rock', 'Viva Las Vegas'. I can even stand to watch his film with the stars of the future stars of Mary Tyler Moore and Ed Asner, 'Changing Characters' that Elvis plays on the local doctor. Well, at least Elvis made a good FEW film, but bad and ugly hearts are better and beautiful. <br /> <br /> I'll love ELVIS! Thank you, thank you very much!
