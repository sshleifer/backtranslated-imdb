Deathstalker is headed by John Watson and star Rick Hill, who is some kind of body builder and famous of it, if I understand the right? The next plot like Deathstalker (Hill) tries to get something from a bad master, and he must go to the master's cave. He meets many villagers and delegates during his journey, and the settings are very close to Tolkien, and in fact Conan Carpenter. This is a great success of Conan's great success, and although this is a very stupid film, it is very good and it is recommended for fans of the trash and to tolerate film junkies! <br /> <br /> No more movies fit in this film. Two exhibitions are close to the atmosphere and interesting, but what the death of Deathstalker considers to be displayed is the gray women and the big muscles of the Hill. Women are the most vulnerable and very poor, too, so this is the eyes of the eyes and so should not be fun for many women! The events of fighting are not unique and very interesting, and creation is not something special. And other aspects of the film are also very young and very bad, but what do you expect from the budget efforts like this? This tries to be as good as Conan but it fails very well. As I said, this can please fans of Turkey movies but no one else. This is a very bad group is good! <br /> <br /> Deathstalker is still not as close as it can be, and as a turkey film, I appreciate this almost like other turkeys, enjoyable course! If a bad film is your cup of tea, then try this and be happy, but if you don't know "fun films" then stay away. And if a man cannot stand a lot of dirt, then stay away too. There is a further shortage here than violence, and due to these events, the film has a R. Ratio. <br /> <br /> 4/10
