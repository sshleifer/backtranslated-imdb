If true, you want to lose two hours of your life, do the following: <br /> <br /> 1) Check out TV lists. 2) Find the movie 'Men in White'. 3) When 'White men' come, sit and watch. <br /> <br /> And that's it. After a two-hour stay of bad puns, horrible memories (and not surprising) of the film, and finding something that is possible to have the lowest standards made in recent history, you will have lost two hours of your life and wonder why. br /> <br /> Why did I do this? I was ignorant to think that this film could really be beautiful. It was not. But, on the other hand, if you are old enough to remember Power Rangers, you can see other common faces during the film. It is possible to save on the cost of production, Saban (who also does Power Rangers), decided to wipe freely the old monster clothing from everyone who loves the franchise to give birth to each toy. I saw a few old stars from the events I saw from the time I was a child, so I think it might say that it has nostalgia value. <br /> <br /> But, if you want to see the Power Power Rangers monsters, go to watch Power Rangers itself. It's better than this garbage. (And that says something!)
