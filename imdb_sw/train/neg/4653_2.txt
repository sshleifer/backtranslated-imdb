The vampire pastor wants to call him after a fall of love with a five-dollar businessman in this very low budget. I can't express all positive comments on this film. I will encourage you to the great hall, but it is not even worth it. One reason for redemption (and this is me being very generous here) can be a grandfather who is the only characteristic character in all this mess. Don't waste your money, or time. In fact here is a word of advice, If Troma puts it on a DVD, but it doesn't do it yourself, for all the possibilities. Trace DVD Extras: Comments by Omar and Kirk; the second definition and deleted events by employees; bloopers; troma interactivity; radiation protests; Feature from "Terror Firmer"; Trailer displays; Trailers for "Rowdy Girls", "Children's Heads in Heat", "Can't: Music", and "Bad Giver 4"
