LL Cool J. Morgan Freeman. Dylan McDermott. Kevin Spacey. John Heard. Cary Elwes. Roslyn Sanchez. Justin Timberlake - wait a minute. Justin Timberlake? And he is a star? I had to have a better understanding than to hire a EDISON. In fact, I knew better. But for quite a short time, I used this STV. When you have big names like Freeman and Spacey in STV, you know it's one of two things: indie or dog. As you sit on the shelf. What this did. And for good reason. The program involves a police force of death and the MAGNUM FORCE, and "journalist" Timberlake is the only one who has tried to reveal it. He is targeted for his efforts - or maybe I must say to his evil acting. I stopped it after one of the bad guys was shot on the forehead and still had the feeling of turning on his shooter and exciting before the fall. Just bad. The real way to be bad is to see Freeman on the lid and in all the movies to play an unusual beard, looks like something like hobo. You know only the director did not control. Freeman is clearly reduced.
