This film was suggested to me by a friend who lives in California. He thought it was strange because it was true, "The only way people in the Ohio Valley is!" I'm from that area and I saw the film like "The only way people in California think we are!" I have lived in Marietta and Parkersburg and I work under wages there. We laughed, we shared and took a break with people of our age; The youth went together at night. Older people had less time after work because they were taking care of their families. The area is good in the summer with no gloomier in cold rain than anywhere. In addition to "if you are found in a industrial house you should be sad" to humble yourself, the story did not have any elements of charm, mystery or even the feeling of fear <br /> <br /> Martha's attitude was The worst offered. It is a concern that anyone who was beaten so would be a church, but if he were, he would probably make friends there. I have read a review that appears to think that Martha was jealous of Rose because Rose was "small, lovely and thin" but if this was shown. All we see is Martha learning to love Rose for reasons that will be used as the three friends were of the same age as gender. We see Martha hearing left during the smoking sessions, she came out of the loop when social programs were made, used but not appreciated, and ultimately did not respect and hurt. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <3 /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Kyle's murder because it was once with several attacks of fear? Please. This takes stigma against mental illness to a new level.
