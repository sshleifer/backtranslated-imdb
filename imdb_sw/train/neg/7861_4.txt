The good cluster that you attended was very good and after the great success of the remake I had so eagerly anticipated. The sad truth is that this film is very strange and cannot. The situation is dumb and more of the cause and acting is very bad. At this time there is a fragrance or different brakes and remake. Also, the year is not big and when it happens it is very bad. Violence is small and embarrassing because there are many arguments that make you think that there is a bigger chance of abuse. I mean, there is a SWAT team that takes into account the family of cannibal mutants. You really expect something different! As I looked at the movies I wanted my money again. This method is a clear example of how outdoor movies can be aggressive and inferior quality in all fields. <br /> <br /> The dirt that leaves the fans remake like me. That's why sequels are never available; at least this movie is not recommended as that of the previous 1985.
