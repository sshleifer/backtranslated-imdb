Yes. Pretty sure I saw this film when it was over Supremes <br /> <br. / another story recycled glitzed up Hollywood-style, borrowing documents from the best make-it-in-music-industry film. <br /> <br /> No original here. <br /> <br /> more cosmetics, clothing glammier and choreography = more money for questionably "talented" Beyonce draw. <br /> <br /> Like as a throwback style, you should appreciate the real groups who struggled (without having voice digitized and Hollywood empires) <br /> <br. /> Beyonce engagement makes this trash hypocrites.
