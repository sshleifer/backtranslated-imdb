2005 gave us the most "Host Porn", and 2006 gave us Live Feed; not a very respectable Hostel. Live Feed follows a pretty formula similar to Eli's original Roth film, except this time dumb kids are Asian rather than central Europe. The program focuses on these deaf children, and one of them hates one of the locals so they can get into trouble. Residents decide to close all in the theater, and kill them. Despite the fact that I would like to hear the most unpleasant things about this film before seeing it, I was still hopeful that it might be at least half because the director Ryan Nicholson had previously made a 45-minute rapture of rape and retaliation 'Torched' but this film falls down just because many of them are either concerned or interesting. The film tries to record back to the good old days of the Grindhouse movie (which Hostel did, successfully), but it doesn't give the truth. Surprised, considering the original work of Nicholson for special effects - even the gore is amazing ... though it is better than acting! There is no more that I can say about this film ... it's bad and not a good way. Avoid!
