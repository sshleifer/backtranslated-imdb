I feel like I am the only child in the city who was angry with Branagh's performance. He is a good actor and many accounts, but he could not just eliminate the South voice. I mean, it was bad. It was as much as he tried to be Yank. One of the previous investigators wondered why U.S. participants. they were not beaten in this film. The second is that idea. It is amazing when characters / actors like to extend their scope, but it is another thing to try too much effort to get the performance done. Maybe it was Altman, but he is a good director ... Everyone deserves to delete here and there. But it's hard to look at something that is sad that you would like to stimulate the bone of a chicken or eat a full bucket than staying through the Gingerbread Man.
