I always thought people were so few about these old Andy Hardy films. Two of them were not bad. Modern movie critics are not the ones who prefer to be good, the very best of the film's favorite shoes like these are not found. <br /> However, I can't defend this film either. You can still have a dated discussion but still laugh and cry on the story. Looking at this, you just shake your head to ask yourself, "how stupid can you get?" This is a string than Corny, if you know what I mean. That's corny I can't learn so many people actually sitting at an hour and a half. The story is essentially "Andy" (Mickey Rooney) trying to get out of jam because he makes a story about sharing with a certain beginning from New York City as that is the end. People had more social awareness in the past. You would like to hear the word "social player" as if knowing the rich or good people is the greatest achievement that you can make life. That's all false, of course, and looks even more today. However, it is about innocent and fresh stories and series (there were half of these Andy Hardy films made) if you could get it. Also, if you would like to hear Judy Garland singing, then this is your ticket, singing a few songs here and believes her hearty way. Oh man, I almost give us even write about this!
