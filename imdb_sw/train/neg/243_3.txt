William Russ is the main character in this all released for TV film. He left his family behind to just increase and start paying off his debts. But he tries to leave his family. That's where Peter Falk (Colombo) comes, with several different responsibilities, to persuade him to return home. The story is moderate and actually managed to get the old star (Peter Falk) and used it for a very good degree. But William Russ was not really a star. However, it seems his acting is still the same. I have seen the delivery and story of so much fun how everything was predictable. In fact, the last 20 minutes I could compel the word by word before it happened. Good movie should never be like that. Overall, it was a small movie. In the form of opening the letter, it would have "D".
