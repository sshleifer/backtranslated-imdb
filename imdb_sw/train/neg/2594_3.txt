Although it's a R-movie R, I am sure that you will be very happy unless you are a boy <br /> <br /> Why? Because there is no real plot, no character development, no funny joke. The only thing that this film has a lot is dirt. Tons and tons of naked or nearly naked asses (the best I can add) love your eyes. <br /> <br /> I can't understand why this film has the name of America's Pie since it is just a bad mix between movie heroes and comedy without being successful one of them. <br /> <br /> My view is just watching this movie if you want to see some naked chicks, but it is also a shame to rent / buy erotic film. Share this 1/10 for 2 smiles I was in the whole movie and another 2/10 for good chicks
