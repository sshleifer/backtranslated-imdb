What else left? I have read all the reviews here and many are the same. . However, one person even went to call this bad movie and that Satan was disrespectful (or something along those lines). Evil? Wow, it's a shocker does. . I mean, TBN basically made this film. Open your eyes please. Anway, this was the lowest class of propoghanda preferences for years. The most frightening thing about Omega Code is how much money they used to do so. If this film can be made, there is no limit, and therefore, we have no choice but to be ready for "Yentl 2", and "Ernest Pushing the Order of Omega." For those of you who are in biblical stories, Dogma's new film will photograph where Omega Code has not started.
