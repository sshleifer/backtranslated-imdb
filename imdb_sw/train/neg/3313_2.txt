How can anyone say that this film is comedy? If I didn't go and then my finacee would be asleep and ask for my money back. I love Gwen Paltrow, but it was like she was on the right set. I would like many flicks, but I hated this. That's the only time I have seen so much liberty and not been installed. The covers were overlapped. No one speaks that way again and I don't think they did it. Part of the play was awesome. I answered only to avoid his feelings. Now I know why we never married. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.
