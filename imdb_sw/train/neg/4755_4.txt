I thought the film was good in part. The beginning was exciting. The first minute of the film was good. The camera's camera in the first 30 minutes was amazing and I did not like coz did not have the artists altogether. I think the last 25 minutes of the film was not very realistic that we hope a lot in these film cases. <br /> <br /> dialoques didn't mean and I don't think they were very witches. I felt like they were trying to copy the film as a mobile phone on the side of the talk, but they failed miserably. <br /> <br /> The entire film has only rules and caine. I don't think it was a waste of time, its beautiful film, but not gr8
