I watched this film recently late last night and usually if it was late then I am very happy with the movies. Although I tried, I could not just stand this movie completely, continued to get worse and worse if the movie continued. Although I know it thinks that the comedy but I didn't find it very funny. It was also true of the truth, and the plainness of rural life. If this is what anyone thinks of the life of the country is like, it is obviously not. I must agree that some of the delegates sent were beautiful, but the French boy was really fake. I must agree that it tried to have a good lesson in the story, but in general my opinion is that no more than 8 person looks at it, is also very angry.
