Who was George C. Scott? George C. Scott was a famous actress. Usually any movie he had is much better. Now ol 'George had enough to do with this film ..., but once he said something that said that the film by T. <br /> <br /> I do not remember his real words, but essentially said that Great Writing can Saving Bad Work, But Doing Great can not save Bad Writing. Never this little investigation was truer than in "All New Adventures of Laurel & Hardy: For Love or Mummy". <br /> <br /> Made in two ways was perfect. Bronson Pinchot (Laurel) and Gailard Sartain (Hardy) are not just looking at pieces, but they are doing a very good job by following a real plan (way and all). This movie should stand as a permanent covenant for their talents. That said, this film blows flat on its face when it comes (changed) Writing. <br /> <br /> In addition to the opening dialog between Pinchot and Sartain (which was "in character") and simply Gag including taxi, this movie is a perfect job to stay. PROBLEM # 1: A lot of time and effort went into the plot. <br /> <br /> I don't want to know why mummy wants to grab a beautiful British woman. I liked it to see Stan and Ollie (or at least, their position). Too many screen paths had described the plot or the most strange characters who said the plot around them. However, even if this film was all joke, it would leave us with ... slapped-down "slapstick. What does it mean to "spray down"? <br /> <br /> In the slapstick, the character hurts through the spread of comedic effect (ala Looney Tunes, 3 Stooges ..., or how about Laurel & Hardy?) <br /> <br /> In " slappedtick "wet water (as I define it), the behavior gets badly damaged or damaged, and filmmakers play it with comedic effects. <br /> <br /> Maybe the example can help: <br /> <br /> In Looney Tunes, Duck Daffy is shot by Elmer Fudd. His bill dies and puts it again. That's a common slapstick. <br /> <br /> In this "gem", Ollie accident for some people. They turn around, tell him to be careful, and continue their fun way. These are not. That's not funny even. That's ... interesting ... with this movie full of these jokes. It's like that is this film of butter and butter. Authors and directors take a very short time and act as they should be funny. In fact, the only example I gave is a very serious case, but I can say very much. Summary of the long story: The film doesn't work because the script fails to identify it on Pinchot's and Sartain's ability to simulate Stan and Ollie. Instead, the script comprises on the field displays and the jokes of the lame. Watching this film is basically looking at the two best listeners who have not been given real working tools. <br /> <br /> Not a good movie, but it's help to sleep. <br /> <br /> I say to give this person lost and connected to a true program (just long as you define "Atoll K" and "Be Big").
