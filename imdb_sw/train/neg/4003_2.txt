Great desire. This was one of the best act of British crime intelligence / spying shows from the 90s that made an impressive character of the title played by Robbie Coltrane of Scotland. Yet this extra one has little to add and maybe experiencing the inevitable allowance due to growing expectations when the unconscious show return after hiatus long. Coltrane is not much to do, more carefully used for the unpleasant killer, and in what he is doing, he seems uninvited, almost exhausted. The old story of a soldier is written by books and attempts to inform us of the family of Coltrane's family seems to be lighter. Perhaps if the authors got a whole series in front of them rather than one-hour event they could write this in more detail. As is the case, skip this and look at the old Cracker from the 90s that are the highest.
