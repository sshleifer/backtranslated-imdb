I wanted lots of zero or less. I liked to comment. It is the worst movie that has been made 'non-use' is the perfect word for it, unless there is something wrong that Roget didn't think. I am also losing to think anything negative enough to describe correctly Bo Derek. The best that can be said about it is, he is consistent.
