It is not possible that the script as clich√© and quite amazing can make any screen even smaller. Talk in this film makes Catwoman looks like a classic high culture. Billy Zane plays the harmonica bad ass, Elvis pretends to be, gunslinging, a military boss who plays the life of a low-football soccer player who turned out a penalty gambler played by the craftastic show of NBC "Next Star Star." Its performance is as cold as ice and not through the cold. "The movie" takes place in Vegas, and since people play poker there are authors felt that it is a perfect environment for a movie about a guy trying to live 24 hours against anyone who was gambling, who had a gambling whose goal was $ 2.4 million if he could do so for day. And so hunting continues. Reeking hunting and unpleasant explosions, building building plans, cinema movies, and one liners with the word "bet" or "gamble." The female winner is also beaten in a mix, but why I do not know. Oh but don't worry "NAS" lost fans also make their unlikely comeos too. The end of surprise will capture your socks off if you like predictions or preferences. Joel Silver should examine his decision to export more. I wish he could give me two hours of my life back.
