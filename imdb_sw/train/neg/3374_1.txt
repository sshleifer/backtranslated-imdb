This film looks and others like classic - I have no idea why. It's bad for sure to be laughable. The only grace to save and this film is the delivery of cheesy lines which are so toe curlingly embarrassing that you have no choice but to laugh at them. <br /> <br /> There are several beautiful songs and good choreography in this film, but SO WHAT! There is no plot, put in the theater without climate change, and Michael Douglas is as sad as it was. My brother immediately ordered me to watch this film, because he said I can't believe how the film can get! He was right. Usually this awesome movie I have suggested that people should not look at it, but in this case I think people should, if they put another bad film you saw in a glance.
