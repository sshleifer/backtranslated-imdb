The Blair Boys' Boys are just as beaten as Bwitch was! The head says all, secure your money and your time and use it on a good film like "Once Upon Time in America", "Shawshank Redemption" or "Enemy on Gates" (if you want to watch the GREAT movie "war" etc.) if it was a football team and the great drama were the highest and AA was rookies, then this movie was a high school ball. It was done as it was a movie of a high school club and their father's camera. Certainly they came into a hateful place (making a film) but I do not have that brave call, almost here we call it stupid! This is all the way! Now go see and then tell me what you think.
