There is a big difference between giving the original seat, the edge, your seat-seat, the awesome, the-fest, and making it as the movie star Eli Roth and his team to do with "Cabin Fever" and just did it like that. The film follows five college graduates in the cabin in the forests that begin to prove death as one after another series of epidemic disease, fast, eating meat. It is not long before the friends turn, and they can hardly stand in front of another person, even less want to be in the same neighborhood. In general as it appears, there is a certain spark behind this film that would have worked, in the hands of a low-cocky film manufacturer. Unfortunately what we end up with an uncomfortable interest whose sole purpose seems to be very good at the beginning to make the inevitable destruction more similar, the hackneyed script to become dirty as the viewer leaves the discussion, and the misunderstanding subplots that inspires a little more (for example one) to appear on the screen and director Roth. This is the wrong choice of films in several ways! Avoid this time of burning.
