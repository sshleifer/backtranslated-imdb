As a fan of white white cinema was completely disappointed, as a movie film manufacturer was very good, it looked good, a good work of the camera, a wise direction. But if the film is closed only as far as possible, the rest of the so-called 'awesome movies' are filled with floods. Although it had a little bit of 'cause of trouble' the whole concept of E.V.O (Electronic Voice Phenomena) did'not seem to be reliable. This movie did not express ideas for certain events but continued with them. Acting was far from the attitude of the main character does not show any sensation, like most recent exciting / frightening movies. Certainly not a movie I will buy on DVD and I can't recommend anyone who will run to see it.
