I had to know that I was in trouble with Casper Van Diem as a leading character. Words can not describe, nor are they right for how this movie was awesome. But please let me try to explain it: A bad act, a horrible conversation, a corny situation and in every way you get the feeling that you emphasize faith and propeganda from the Network of Trinitarian Networks. His weak attempt in trying to show Hollywood that the movie can be entertaining and have a deep, religious message associated with it. They have been sadly disappointed. It was clear the worst movies I saw for a long time.
