Without wanting to join, Brad Sykes is responsible for at least two inappropriate films and clichéd that I've ever seen - this is one of them, and Camp Blood to be another. <br /> <br /> Acting is awesome, printing is shoddy, and everything about this film's sound "seriously, you can do better". Maybe this is a challenge for everyone to produce youtube with our own crap related craps? I bought this for £ 1, but remember, you can't set the price for 71 minutes of your life. You can do well to avoid this turkey, even at a low price price.
