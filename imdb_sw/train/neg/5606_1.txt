I believe Shakespeare explained what I read well. I think she (a woman) is very opposed. One thing seems to me if the author tried to convince himself! He causes dirty books (texts from the same time but they are not linked to the Bible) several times but I can think of at least three references on my head that give historical accuracy to the Bible events. Anyone can distribute data and confirm whatever they like but it doesn't. Customs change, the word definition is changed for a while (see English & German where it is obviously common root) nothing is the same, growing and changing every time. The Bible has many different interpretations but the King James version is one that I have found to be the best of any kind of research. In the King James version you will see some words written in italics. These words have been added by translators and can stop & mean the entire line changes. The text from around the time of Christ was written without space, without punctuation, without paragraphs and without lines of numbers. These texts seem to be a long term word and translators added all of the above. For example how can you read this: YOU are now reading if God does not have anywhere or read it if God is here? Same the same two letters mean quite differently. That is why many biblical researchers use 'Lexicon' to help them in translation as they provide a word for a translation of the word from Arabic, Greek or original Hebrew according to the original text. It is also interesting to note that when translated into a logical sense you can prove that God exists but you cannot prove that it does not exist! Finally I would like to listen to people who think they are so wise that they deserve to judge the Almighty. Talk about ego! Put the soap box away, God bless Maegi
