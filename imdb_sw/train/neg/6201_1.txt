I have seen it. It is not "good" but it is interesting in the way it is caused. The boys in it are naturally natural but ................ graphic / freeous end band rape is repugnant and-yes yes - the intervention of the second entry of war video footage is offensive in how it tries to compare the true fear of this misogynistic knowledge. The real cruelty - this film is just angry. However, the film has a look that can draw you. But it seems to me is "Emperor's New Clothes", but actually in reverse. The film looks good, but the direction, story, content and the last feeling you take on this film are enough. If feelings can breathe-this is.
