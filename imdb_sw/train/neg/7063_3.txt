The boy made a lot of style for the movie group and I thought one day he said; I should take the cheap condition, try to keep the head on it as you can (cause after all I am the headwriter) and try to convince people that this is really a movie. One of the worst I saw was that indeed. If you're intended to see the best titles, go see some of the banners don't waste your time looking at this. Do you wonder you don't think, see the poster? The only part of his project that is supposed to have head work is never worth!
