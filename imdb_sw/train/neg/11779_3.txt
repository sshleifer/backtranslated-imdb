I don't like this many movies. If you have read the Prize books, or at least you have seen the first two movies (especially the first), you're going to agree with me. <br /> <br /> Compared to the Corleone saga presented a novel prize, the script of this film, sometimes, even ridiculous. The characters and relationships between them are wrong. The story reaches anywhere, although it seems to go to a certain direction during the film. It is understandable that different times should be expected by the Corleone saga in the 90s, and that we cannot get things as they were before. But, on the other hand, I don't know why they had to follow some discussion from other movies, in the context when they were not worth. Why this? It looks like the wrong-made columns that try to copy the original features of the original film. It will never understand it is the fact that Mario Puzo, Coppola and Al Pacino have joined together to do so. The person who led the pieces like Apocalypse Now and the Godfather must be forgiven almost anything he does on the movie until he dies. Similarly Al Pacino, to be an actor he is. But Mario Puzo should not write this. How to come? He destroyed all his original work. It's a shame, my friend. The Prize novel "The Last Don" is a 90th story about the group, and it's good. We can never say the same about the plot for God godfather III.
