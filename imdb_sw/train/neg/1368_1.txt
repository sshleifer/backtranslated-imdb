One is the highest score that I could give this film, based on zero and negative numbers are not allowed. Pee yew, an irreplaceable movie and many people lost a b-list who have done a better job, written and led by a boy and a twelve-year-old boy who screamed and screamed in a whisper,. For example, Gene Stapelton's behavior (Ding-Bat from All in the Family) characteristic of Marilu Henner's behavior which "turns all the way" to sex, was a cheap attempt on a typical movie humor ... good, cheeky humor? Renting Animals, American Pie (only one place), Old School or Office Office.
