I liked earlier. It was brilliant and always will be. Surprisingly, though, I really looked forward to seeing it again. I am usually little against re-makes because there is so much, but in this way it surprised me. I really enjoyed the start. Caine brilliant, as usual, and Judah Law manage it to himself. It was clever how it was modern and it was working. What makes this very good is the last seven minutes. It goes far from nature, so far in fact that it becomes clever and only reduces. Last in nature was amazing! Most tension was built and it was a clever course! This? It did not grow in tension but in the confusion as it seemed they decided to do the Caine homosexual behavior. It was as if they were trying off that difficult to be different. And then ... BANG! The law is dead. Keep Credit. This film should only look at the exhibition, but the last seven minutes actually find it. What a pity ....
