for those who had a desire to know what happened to translate to the original movie, eliminates your opportunities, and then return to the real world. The man who hid gold in the first movie told Twitch, so he is transferred to another prison, where the tournament contends on him. Twitch plans to leave prison for a month to get gold to start life with his wife. Then something happens and someone is shot, and the film turns into Die Hard in another prison. But the wrestler's daughter is taken into it all, so she tells him to go looking for him and the woman of Twitch. As you can imagine, acting is under par, it has many features (very sad) rap rap, and unplanned events. On the joint side, you have a Spanish bloke in it, whose star in each prison / stage / thriller has been made, and it hinders the door in this. It is not a terrible thing, but at least it was not guilty. If you were a great fan of nature, it's good things. If not, you have warned.
