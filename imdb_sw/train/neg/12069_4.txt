Carm Monson's Z-grade film was one of the most directors who were driving into the lower budget field. His movies are full of ineffective, functional work, small work and bad conversation. The figure is the murder of the very visitors living in a family home. Unfortunately this film is almost without blood.You see the real murder except for shadows and few blood splatters. The power, but the lack of a boil and a trap left me depressed. Providing 4 out of 10. So beware: don't miss Monson's film and Andy Milligan's "Blood Heritage".
