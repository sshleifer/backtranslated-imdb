This was a kind of an amazing film about life in New York City and focusing on the main character (the title of the head, played by Brad Pitt) who thinks '' is Ricky Nelson-type musician, unless he has a real talent. It is a great pleasure to look up to a woman with a bad type of New York City and a terrifying impression coming into the picture and takes it. That destroyed my film. It must be Catherine Keener, who often plays hard women with garbage. The pitt hair on Pitt - Pompadour's salt - was fun to watch. I can see Johnny Depp with this excellent role. The last end: it's unusual to hear a film made in 1992 (except Woody Allen) and just a voice of mono.
