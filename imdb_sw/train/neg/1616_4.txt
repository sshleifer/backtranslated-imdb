Saturday night: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday morning ** Sunday Night * Morning Monday <br /> <br /> The second phase of Che's film causes the story to go ahead 60, where the man has now migrated to his resistance fighters in the mountains of South America, living without food and water enough to deal with the group. Everything comes to mind when crossing until Bolivia and government forces raise their campaign to bring him. <br /> <br /> Not full-time and final movie sites, the second phase of Soderbergh focuses only on action in the mountains, and will be even an even duller experience. And more carefully, the mark is closed, giving the second phase more than an unacceptable art of the art that proves it as a divorce. There is only an incomplete air of the film that is never recommended. You can not have the desire of Soderbergh or Del Toro's car in the lead role, it's just a shame that somewhere in the production items could take a turn like that. **
