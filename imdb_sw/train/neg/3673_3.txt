William Hurt scuba diving scientist ??? US agency conducts surveys abroad? A wounded person taking the butt after falling 20 feet behind him and running? Sniper does not exist and does not hurt Hurt (just hurt him) but the second "kill" shot is dead? Loss of time. In order to compare this and fall down as other critics did is ridiculous. Oh and at the end of the movie they decide to start wearing gloves in their hands except for the "bad" agent and Hurt decides to kill him by giving him "virus treatment". When? BTW ... when IMDb required 10 lines of text? I'm just stirring here. Is this not just a technological content if you need to have a line of x?
