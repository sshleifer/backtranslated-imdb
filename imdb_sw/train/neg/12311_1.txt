I know I've added a comment but I wanted to clarify something ... <br /> <br /> I'm not an old fogy from the Baby Boom generation that grew in a b / w flick of Phil Silvers, Jackie Gleason etc. Bilko was already old 20 years before I was born but I was happy to recognize the trust of Phil Silver of BBC2. I wonder if I would like to enjoy the travesty of Steve Martin if I haven't seen or heard of Phil Silvers - I don't know - maybe I would like. Some other observers who think this movie deserves '10' to admit that they have not seen nature. I can only encourage you to spend 21 minutes of your life looking at one place. If after watching Ernie's original, Colonel Hall, Ritzig & Emma, ​​Duane Doberman, Henshaw, Dino, Flashman, Zimmerman, Mullin and still you think Steve's film is anything more than '2' - I will stand pint. ..
