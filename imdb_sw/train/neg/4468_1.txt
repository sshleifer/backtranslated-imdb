Okay, open and simple, if you're a fan of other Tomb Raider games (yes, even AOD) PUMA FROM FROM LEGEND. <br /> It is of course, the most awesome game of TR yet. It looks very good, it looks very beautiful, but it is not quite possible and I have left it. I feel like I have been stolen by Eidos. It is very easy. TR was a PC game before anything else. Control Lara using the keyboard. In 6 games Tomb Raider control was normal. In AOD they were 'tacky', but still the same order of control. In Legend they have changed its movements and control methods completely and he can never fail. <br /> <br /> I have seen an opinion elsewhere from people who say 'Use mouse'. No, why am I? Others say 'Use a mouse'. No, why am I? Some say, 'But this has been the level of control over the years' years. Well, I don't care, not any other game level so why do you destroy it. Oh, I know, because they don't care little about the basis of their original, honest fan, they want to get money in new children who have never heard of the series until the movies have gone and make a lot of money. Influence. <br /> <br /> I advise you to any F bad fan avoid away from this game, and if you buy it for Eidos. I have seen the issues of other publications, especially on Eidos forums, from people telling you how to trash, maybe they will hear.
