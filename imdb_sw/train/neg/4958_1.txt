Not only did they get all the wrong characters, not just the words they use, not just the authors who need to find a female partner, not just the drawings are real, but it looks like it was designed for the age of 1-6. The only time I have seen on this show that guarded me was, was "Mattter Of Family", because I loved Robin's behavior. And sometimes I think it's just a general copy of the Batman Series Series. Example: In BTAS, Bruce is a friend with Harvey Dent, yes? More than two story stories, he turns into an impossible villain, TwoFace. In the "Show" Bruce is Friends and the Ethan guy, and on two story stories, He changes in ClayFace villain potentially. That was a small example (That could be even true), but in short, this is an attempt to SEND on the Batman series. And That says something.
