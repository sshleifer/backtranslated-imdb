For me the only reason to be looking for this remake was to see how bad and funny could be. There was no doubt about being funny and bad, because I saw "Voyna i mir" (1968). Will we start? Here we are going to ... <br /> <br /> Robert Dornhelm and Brendan Donnison of Pierre Bezukhov - a silly fellow who has no original depth; Robert Dornhelm & Brendan Donnison Natasha Rostova - scarecrow, her image can cause sleep; Robert Dornhelm & Brendan Donnison's Andrej Bolkonsky - a good body who, like a lean fellow (see above), have no depth of the soul of the Russian and "fight within"; Napoleon Robert Dornhelm & Brendan Donnison - a skilled leader; Robert Dornhelm & Prince Brekton Donnison Prince Bolkonsky - turd and English face; Robert Dornhelm & The Numbers of Brendan Donnison Numbers Bezukhov - show freak-show ... <br /> <br /> Others of the characters are not much better. <br /> <br /> The movement of executives and the way they look and say often angry. They act as modern EU citizens dressed in one day. It all seems cheaper and has never been closer to the standards of Russian men and women of the 19th century. <br /> <br /> A good place of entertainment to explore and enjoy. We had very few in our office when we remember this modern product, shown last evening on our TV. <br /> <br /> "User Reviews: 8.0 / 10 (29 votes)" - I think, many young people have never watched our film ("Voyna i mir" 1968) or have a fantastic feeling of "Tarantino-Spielberg" quality. Remember the event when our hussar saves his friend, returns, gives us, and the bridge goes? It looks like a CGI explosion. It is neither mind nor trick to make the best version of the novel, which was handled in our country immediately. But I would enjoy the remake of Russia's "Gone with the Wind". Hey, directors, wake up and get to work with it, instead of destroying our classics. <br /> <br /> Now come back to normal mind. Offers off. What I said above is not new, although it is a wonderful death. To make foreign actors trying to pass on to Russians (when they are involved in shocks and extreme drama) it is a bad mistake and filmmakers make this mistake again and again. Of course there are many consequences of laughing - especially the Poesy Clemence is concerned with anxiety and singing it makes the Russian viewer think: "This takes a lot that is wonderful!"). To say something new, I'd like to mention the speed of the movie. In my opinion, this new version is amazing. Stories and events are not very common - they move around and continue as a modern video. Again we must remember our "Voyna i mir", where the action is natural and the details are very easy to just sit back and enjoy "go with the flow". I thought that perhaps the war of Borodino would be great (somehow fix different obstacles) but it has never been a match of the warfare events in 1968. <br /> <br /> There must be something good in this film after all. And there. The characters seem to be trying hard to do all the work. They had a chance from the beginning but still joined the "lost team". Plus 1 point for the lack of that. It makes the Russian observer uncomfortable - some events are surprising though they should have great power and executives are doing well. They all cause compassion, and sometimes - appropriate to laughter. <br /> <br /> What I still like about this serial is the last part of it. It shows very clearly how everyone gets "his salary and taxes". Besides, judging by film trailers I thought that the film would have an adult sex area, which could kill the entire project. But, fortunately, you don't have that garbage. And that's great. <br /> <br /> "Voyna i Mir" is not "Harry Potter" and today even we, here in Russia now, have not enough trick to make the film better. Should I say that the quality of our lives has declined? Fortunately, the appropriate film was investigated during our Soviet times. The American version of the 1950s was somewhat correct - ours was not there yet. There was an expanding atmosphere. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 (1 point is given at the beginning, step 1 goes for distrust, and 2 points for the last serial part.
