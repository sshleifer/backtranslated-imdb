Unthinking, unintelligent, unstable, job-killing (where is Angela Jones now talented?), A very wasteful waste. Not surprising Reb Braddock did not mention anything else since - anyone who has the opportunity to make his first film on his own rules, based on his own script, with the help of Quentin Tarantino himself, and create something like this, anyone who feels that this was a story appropriate to tell the world, it is not good to break the second. Under the circumstances, the performances are good - executives do what they are told to do, and they do well. It's just that they shouldn't make it in the first place. <br /> <br /> 0 out of 4.
