As a great fan of the original film, it is difficult to watch this show. Garish decorations and seconds with lights take any style from this remake. Mood is not there. Instead, it has to look and feel for many television movies seven years. Crenna is not a bad option like Walter Neff, but his room of "snorkpy" and "apartment" is not appropriate nature, or make him an interesting person. She does a good job working but Samantha Egger is really a bad choice. The English and California model seems unable to hold a candle in the voice of the velvet of Barbara Stanwick and the sexual appeal. Lee J.Cobb tries much in Barton Keyes style, but even his performance is just fine, without fashion. It feels like a TV film had again reminded me of an amazing original film. it is.
