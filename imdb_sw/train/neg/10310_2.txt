Lorenzo Lamas stars as a certain type of CIA agent, who finds foreign beauty named Alexa, catches her daughter and defeats her anti-employers. O.J Simpson is also on board to give a dash of acting loyalty to a non-talented cooperative. I must accept not a fan of Lorenzo Lamas, or his movies. He calmed down. However, compared to O.J Simpson and Lamas' wife of Kinamas, Lamas looks like ah, Jean-Claude Van Damme. I just saw the CIA because of the new interest next to the case of O.J Simpson, you see because if your parents had cable and additional ways, you can't avoid this movie. in 1994 you can go to Amishi community and some moron would play this on their television. The movie itself is a collection of sequence of actions and would be interesting though the value of the O.J Simpson shock jumping after fireballs and exchanges can be one builder to give humor without fun. Also where Bobby Knight and Kobe Bryant did a full campaign of the camp? <br /> <br /> * out of 4 (bad)
