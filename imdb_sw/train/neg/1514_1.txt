I saw this film yesterday. My girl wanted to see it just because of Richard Gere. I feel I have lost my time and money and told my partner is the last time we're going to see the film just because an actor / actor is in it. I hope he learned the lesson because I had trouble protecting him in his seat. As I, since I was already paid, I wanted to see the end at least, hopefully something good would stand, but I had no breath, and incidentally I would be the victim of the same film. <br /> <br /> This is not black and white, it's black and black. The main character (Richard Gere) is as bad as its subscribers, and all sex offenders are shown as the primary criminal offenders who cannot be trusted and the worst among them were very serious. Talk about play and exploitation of the American American phobias. Richard Gere's act was good as usual but the girl's blond who should take her place was the best washy. Absolute failure to work. <br /> <br /> The movie tries to use the most popular themes and offers a cheap, amazing, and unreasonable hearing. They use sexual offenders as an excuse to engage in violent acts of violence, assault, rape and torture - something that is almost seemingly free. They have even wolves attacking people in the film - how you can get down. <br /> <br /> I collect the film will not come out of USA and go straight to the DVD. That must have been in other countries too, but because it is Hollywood and Richard Gere only had to show. Believe me, without Gere, the film is not even suitable for the B-series movie.
