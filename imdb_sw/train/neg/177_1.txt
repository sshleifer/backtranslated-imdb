If you would like to see this film, please read it again. It is not unusual to publish my opinion on something I have seen on television, but this was a loss of my life that I needed to do something to produce to get a bad taste from my mouth. To launch this film will take a long time if there are too many things. I'll just tell you, please don't see this film. It was a perfect waste of my time and it would be your waste. Anyone who wrote a good review of this film is one of two things; it is completely avoiding, or working for a producing company. Again, I am sure you will actually see this film!
