This is a film that had a lot to live down. In the year of the popular filmmaker Barry Norman saw the movie the worst of the year and I had no hearing but the worst things about it, especially the conspiracy that had been criticized for being too hard. red red and film is facing more when the word "plot" is used because as far as I can see no such plot. There is something involving the Russian robbers, a character called Pete Thompson who tries to find his pregnant wife Sara, and the Irish barrier called Sean. How they all get into something called "plot" I don't know. It is difficult to describe Guy Ritchie's stadiums but if you look at any movies I am sure we can agree that they all have property regardless of how they can seem hard when looking. Also the James Bond film though the squares are introduced by action events. You will have a great difficulty believing RANCID ALUMINUM has any basic plot that can be explained clearly / <br /> Looking at the drop lists will have enough alarms about what type of film you will watch. Sadie Frost has been seen in some of the worst British films made in 15 years and she does nothing to be the opposite. Steven Berkoff gives a bad name (and he has a character called Kant which calculates the wit of this movie) when one of the support characters is played by a television advertiser perhaps because no great actor will die in this <br /> <br /> The only thing what can say about this film is that it is completely forgotten. I saw a few days ago and soon after watching I am going to write a long time review review for people who are willing to watch, but for now I have forgotten why. But this doesn't change the fact that I remember to resist this piece of big crap
