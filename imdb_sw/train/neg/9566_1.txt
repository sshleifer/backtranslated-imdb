I see many movies. See original wargames years ago and love it. Computers that are still a "great secret" for most of us and the movie was convincing, through its own way. <br /> <br /> This, however, looks like a special Wednesday night special budget. Overall extraction, from start to finish. The program is too weak, you can't believe it until you see the film (which I do not recommend first). I can't identify one actor who actually did a good job in this film. But hey, with the script that I would be surprised if anyone can do a good job to do. Many image items. CGI seems to have been taken in the '86 version. Bah, no, I'm just getting into a bad situation to write about this. Don't see this movie. <br /> <br /> Short life to lose time while watching crappy movies.
