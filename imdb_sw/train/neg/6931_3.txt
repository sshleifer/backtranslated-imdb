A rich 1800-year-old fool wants to visit a neighborhood reserve to see how the famous doctor cares for his patients. In spite of the initial reaction of hatred, he was soon invited to the hospitality and hospitality. And, as the doctor shows about it, he talks with conversation and conversation !!! And while speaking, loonies run amok here and there to do something exactly production. Although there are some steps here and there (and some of it is quite disturbing), it's amazing how dull and cerebral something around - missing life and energy, which is odd to flick panic. Even someone who thinks he is chicken and clothes like one becomes patient. In addition to this visit takes a visitor, it is even more concerned until finally you realize that prisoners have taken hospitals and abuses the caregivers. However, in spite of this loss, the film is amazing in many places - especially when it moves slowly as a wonderful event is performed or people just look at the set. It is only when the reserve workers are found in the prison cell, and the hunger, does the film have any real effect. Considering this plot, it's certainly hard to imagine making it boring, but people who made this film cheap! Now for the same purpose as the ability to write, act and leadership, this would be an interesting and valuable film. Do you know, now thinking about it, this was a plot of one of the previous sessions "Star Trek" TV show! You know, the one who has "Mr. Garth - Master of the World" and Kirk and Spock are imprisoned by these supporters and his powerful supporters. Remember the last: the film has very little deception here and there and includes rape, so you have evidence - not children. In fact, considering how this film doesn't mean, it's not for anyone! However, with this version included in the "50th Modern Movie - Classics of Chilling", the publication is very bad because it is difficult to see all this meat due to being very dark.
