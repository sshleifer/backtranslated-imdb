Ugly Coyote can be more effective if the film makers made R-rated guilty of pleasure / exploitation film (and a lot of shortage.) But since the rating of PG-13 is what all the studios want these days, we continue to film like this: The flick of PG-13 "tease" which is not allowed to go anywhere near the film should be gone. <br /> <br /> Script is going to be generic that is easy to guess the plot action will take place 15 minutes before it happens. Acting is not enough, but the characters are so paper-thin that nothing can be done with them. There were also many points where it seemed like I was watching a music video instead of a film. The only film of the film is beautiful female leading. We see them in most of the best coverings and best to open ..... but only the amount can be displayed from PG-13 restrictions. There are a lot of solutions and toned, bodies continue to make a good number of choreographed dance, but no dirt or sex to talk. Tyra Banks (keeps getting more attractive to age) is also in the movie for very little time. The new player Piper Perabo is also very simple in the eyes (and has the smoker's smile) and shows the ability to act the truth. Only people can see this fascinating film are boys who have never thought they are not allowed to watch R rated movies yet. Viewers can get a lot from the attribute feature, but the adult audience will feel that they are angry and deceived. <br /> <br /> Rating: movie-1 women-10
