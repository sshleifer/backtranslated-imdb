I bought this on DVD for my brother who is a big fan of Michelle Pfeiffer. I decided to look at myself earlier this week. It is a piece of entertainment with two different lines of story. Part by Michelle Pfeiffer was far more interesting and more attractive than two. She has a Hollywood actress who has had a few unhappy relationships. He bothers Brian Kerwin (a young boy married to children) after driving his car behind him. After having a hatred for the woman she offers to run her home since she doesn't feel good to drive. Romance grows eventually leading the tragedy when his wife gets. What happens at the end I was not ready but a slow and normal TV guide takes any game out of the plot. Another part involves the former boss of Darren McGavin. This section was actually sent by Kenneth McMillan, Lois Chiles, Steven Bauer & Stella Stevens. They all want something from the boss's studio but at the end when asked to resign, all are aware of their work now not going anywhere. It passes time but not all that is interesting and I am happy this is not bought from me. I am not Michelle Pffeifer fan but she was admittedly just an actor watching in this film and even in 1983 was an honorable actress. In general though you are a fan of his avoiding this as it is very common.
