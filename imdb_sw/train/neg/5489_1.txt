Stories are the same as ET: walk out around the world and try to return home. When his stay on our planet, it will have a friendly relationship with mankind. But, unlike ET that comes from the drama, comedy, poetry, this film is just fun. In fact it is a clean Dysney production: its primary audience is children & movie is more in visual than in a message. <br /> <br /> So, you will find some funny scenes (first to see the city, "cosmic" lost toaster) and tested to be tested, and specify specific to "Doc", who repeat the "Mac Fly" character, Hurley, who seems to be open to fun. The ice on the cake: the main head is taken by Danny Elfman, and if every other beautiful composer, you know his "sound" before it is known.
