I have read comments that should not look at this film if you are looking for a Shakespearian discussion. This is true, unfortunately, because all the stimulating discussion, this wonderful game you have, cut off, and replaced with songs. I have read this play, and soon I was lucky to do it, so it remains one of my Shakespearian lectures, but this film seems to take all that I like about it. Princess, though of course did what she was told to do, did not give birth to the regal, and all the girls seemed to lose the cunning of their characters - they were also affected by the reduction of evil, which not only eliminated the already female characters of the conversation, but took out the context outside - it was a little difficult to hear Princess declare; "We are wise girls to laugh at our loved ones like that!", When the shock was not quite done. All the radio news in the film has also disrupted the sequence, and they took a lot of good performances, as they showed information on the events after them, and were in the latest documents. In conclusion, the best play, destroyed by unusual concepts, and cuts wisely. Kenneth, I usually love what you do. What do you think?
