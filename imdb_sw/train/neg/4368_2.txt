This is given to the DVD market by Alpha, and it is for the fans of Boris Karloff who died (like me). It is not a horrible idea, but it is a game where Boris is a scientist who tries to accept the rich husband's wealth to get the benefits needed to continue his work. But once the victims explain his will and leave his partner, all hell goes away. It seems very interesting to see Karloff as another kind of selfish self, and some of it is hilarious (especially from leading a woman Mona Goya who is a laughing scandal like a double wife. /> <br /> But continue with great attention.
