When this cartoon was revealed first I was under the impression that it would have been at least half of nature, the boy I had missed. I must accept watching this cartoon is almost as painful as watching Batman and Robin and George Clooney all the years ago. I watched a few events and two of them had Batman to get his ass leaving left and right with a penguin who fought like Jet Li and clapping from Batman and I saw another place where Batman got his fabric again with Joker, who seemed to use Jackie Chan as he climbed the air like ninja. Since when Joker or Penguin got a match for Batman? and worse when Joker and Penguin Kung Fu partners of Jackie Chan and Jet Li. It's really shame, sad and sad how the image of Batman shown in this show. Animation is bad and the conversation is awesome. Being a fan of Batman since my youth I can advise you and advise you to stay away from avoiding this display at all costs, because it does not know the true picture of Batman. This cartoon is like wannabe Kung Fu Flick and if you want a real cartoon Batman classic I recommend very Batman Series Series, but this cartoon is nothing more than a piece of S --- T! Get Batman: Series of Animates and don't waste your time with this cartoon.
