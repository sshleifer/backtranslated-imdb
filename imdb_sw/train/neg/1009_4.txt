*** TRAINING INSTRUCTIONS FOR PEOPLE COUNCILS *** I will make these reviews brief and sweet. I bought this film from Best Buy because it seemed to be interested and had other top executives like Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman. How bad is it, right? Well, it's very bad. Justin Timberlake plays Pollack, a wannabe journalist who remembers the case that could lead to corrupt cops in the Edison Police Force. LL Cool J is a document, an officer in power on a special power team called F.R.A.T. (First Response Answers). He has had a "fault-of-edge" offensive soldier called Lazerov (Dylan McDermott). In the opening area we see Lazerov & Deed pick up some bank thieves, but at night they attack a couple of drugs. I don't want to give away too much, but things are bad for boys who do drugs. Pollack, who works for Ashford (Morgan Freeman) is going to trial involving Deeds & Lazerov. He blames the dirty play and with the help of Ashford, do others investigate that it turns bad. Wallace (Kevin Spacey) who is within F.R.A.T. The team joins Ashford to try to bring the bribe to justice. <br /> <br /> You can tell from the beginning that the performance of Freeman and Spacey is pretty missingluster. The only person who offers all outdoor performance is Dylan McDermott. He is a full case of nut in this movie and make him a believer from me. LL Cool J is awesome in this film. He says every line in the same way and shows the same feelings. He was the best in movies like Blue Blue & Sunday All released. The film begins with a good step but then hits the foot through all the film. The end is far from satisfying. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time with this film. I put it on Ebay this weekend.
