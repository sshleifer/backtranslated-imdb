SPOILERS IN !!! I was reading the book "1st to die" and I wanted to see if the film followed the book I watched it. For many parts made. There were different MINOR (the area of ​​the last violent area for example) but not many and for the most part the movie remained true to the book so much so many movies. <br /> <br /> This may be an error - although the movie was sent-by Pollen and Bellows in particular — I wasn't that feeling with the book. Or I would take it back. I began to be very surprised, gradually becoming more confused and at the end was left entirely unhappy and feel close. There is no difference with the movie. That's why. <br /> <br /> No "charge" in the book, or movie. I have often read who has done this exciting thing that has caused the destruction and the final resolution and I hoped that the film would be a little different. All - (did so, RIGHT did, HAPA did so) - it was not interesting, not exciting and more mixed, sad and oppressive then anything else. Adding to that, the love of Lindsay's life dies at the end (after her HER's disease and cries in her grave) .. then cutting down the place where she thinks suicide… then suddenly she is in a war life with a REAL villain who was removed after The arrest .. but it turns out he and the wife were in it together .... HELLO !!! This whole thing has now become a "HOSPITAL JOY" instead of a good old past. I felt and bought this book and watched the film (I must admit it well - the job was very good for the TV film) and hoped that it would not follow the book that was hurt to do. <Br /> <br /> I still think the movie looks and for some reason it does not leave it as a bad taste in your mouth as a book (or maybe it's just that I knew what will happen) But I must say this way the unfamiliar story did not really happen.
