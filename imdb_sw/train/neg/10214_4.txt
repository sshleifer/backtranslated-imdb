Dick Foran and Peggy Moran, who were very good together in MUMMY, return to this very small offering of Universal Horror. But this time, instead of having Wallace Ford as a sidekick of comedic "Babe," we get Fuzzy Knight to switch as budly buddy called "Stuff". But the results have never been close to personalities, and the horrible level is not quite close. <br /> <br /> Dick is a businessman who gets an idea of ​​driving treasure hunting on a remote island in the old spooky fortress. Peggy is one of the group that comes for the trip. But there is a beautiful and beautiful appearance of John Carradine in a black cape and a big hat known as "Phantom" who defeats the party in its own fortune. This "phantom" is not very strange, and no effort is made to try and put its average face in shadows to create any tension or damage. It's always good to see Moran's perky, but otherwise you can write this as one of Universal's misfires to forget once.
