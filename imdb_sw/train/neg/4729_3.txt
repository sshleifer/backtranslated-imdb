LIVE LITTLE, LITTLE PENDA is one of Elvis''s amazing movies. Part of the slapstick, part of the fluff, surreal part and wonderful part. Elvis meets a very beaten girl with an angry voice. He looks like Jennifer Aniston. The story is not as important as many Elvis Presley movies, and there is a bunch of amazing characters. There is not much music in this, but what I liked, although there is no even memorable. Extensive brightness. Elvis and Michelle Carey enter her house on the beach at night, but a few minutes later the delivery is coming and it's daylight! What ?? That's about the essence of the movie. What ?? O, good things about the movie: A) Elvis looks good and B) dog steals show.
