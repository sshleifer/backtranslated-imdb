Although there was some exciting time, I thought the movie was very good. For a long time it was running, the worst became. As soon as that step came into Monument Valley, I found myself looking out more wonderful than the overdue and powerless interaction of characters. The daughter's behavior was not normal. First he enters the contract, then finds the truth and bail. Then he comes back, then throws them back. Then he is no longer. There is no pressure of any decisions. There were interesting characters, spectacular scenes, and many lost possibilities. I would like to say those pictures were much lower than the total part of its parts. It seems people who liked Repo Man liked to rely on this. 2.0 viewers don't match the Search.
