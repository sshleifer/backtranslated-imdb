I usually do not know if this site could give you this 3-video film because I hated this movie. I thought Uwe Boll alone in the dark was the worst I saw yet but at least I gave 2.5 out of 10 in my opinion (Stephen Dorff shot for anything that made me laugh so I added little ratings). Hell would be compared to the blood of blood, Bloodrayne could win Oscar for good film if they were fighting. <br /> <br /> Now for a plot, this movie is about a BTK killer that's good but they've done well. The beginning seemed good but I must go very quickly because death is to buy. I love killer movies and even if they are smiling they can still get better deaths. I am not a fictional film but I believe he could beat himself if he saw this. Sorry to run but nothing good to say about it, because it looks like someone took a camcorder with this film. This .. something of disaster. Be your Boll movies no longer on my list of bad movies than this took a cake. Yes, I can't explain the plot (if there is one) but that's the best I could. Now if you don't care I'll go to crawl on the corner and go back and forth and remind me of how this movie was bad for life .... OK not for life
