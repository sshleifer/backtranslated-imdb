I bought this cheap rental video, thinking that the cover was very good. And it was good, but the movie is garbage. I can handle B-grade, sometimes even enjoying the B's (ie 'Surf Nazis Must Die' is an example of how the type of entertainment can be), but this was just bland bland bland. Extraordinary events were very broken with beautiful and beautiful pictures of fantasy dreams. This movie has very little to offer.
