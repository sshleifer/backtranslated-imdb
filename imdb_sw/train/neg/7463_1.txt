I have sworn for a long time to NEVER, EVER watch a movie that has anyone who was regularly cast a member of "Saturday Night Live". I had no "Corky Romano" tax but I was forced by my inappropriate behavior to watch it for half an hour. Then my good habits failed. Foolish, not funny. Surprise, not hilarious ones. Bad, not good. That is simply all I can say with this video.
