If you just avoid doing this kind of film later. This film is interesting as a test but it doesn't matter a suitable story. One can feel powerful for staying because it affects many important issues but it does so for no reason to identify. The viewer comes off without a new perspective (unless one comes with one when the mind of the person goes off, as it will during this useless film). One can use one time looking out the window on a tree growing. <br /> <br />
