How, in the name of everything holy, did this film receive the distribution? It looks like it's hit on someone's phone and it takes the girl's surprise situation to a completely detailed situation. They shout for 90 minutes full of film. And so do they. No plot, no tension, no characters, and not much to do. Just cry and shout more. I left it after fifteen minutes and wound quickly in that way to see if something happened. It doesn't - except by shouting, of course. Then enough, the act of going in a hurry forward shows another problem - no function of the camera to talk. Each shot looks like all sorts of bullets - a distance distance, one angle, dull, malicious, DULL. It is not bad it is good. It's just bad.
