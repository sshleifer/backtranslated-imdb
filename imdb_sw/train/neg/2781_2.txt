This is a film that tries to vote on Thai history, put in the ancient city of Ayutthaya. I decided to watch this film because I thought it included many Thai films that I have watched and enjoy, which make Thai actors talking to Thai military and martial arts civilizations. Yes, it isn't. This film is totally shot in English, facing the Anglo-American actors, and has the production standards so it's terrible is terrible .... but it's not funny! Who can we blame for this trash? Acting, talks, and many sets were very bad. Some scenes seem to seem like they were choreographed by a club of high school acting club. Specific effects were also bad, but a few were just cheap drawings posted on the screens released with the effect of a particular cheesy. It has one great, epic-style out of war zone, where a few thousand extra to get run into a field at costume, but when we see two bombs fight in the fight - HA! It's a joke! Film shows the beauty of a couple. What a pity they did not show a little more skin. At least that would be something for boys to grasp. Don't bother.
