O dear! What a desire. I have been looking at the old West on British TV for decades, and I did not have this recognition until yesterday - many of West Scott comes almost every few years or so and they usually have to look again. </> <br> Rich Games and Outdoor sets were good, but that's all I can say about this film. I agree with many wrong ideas made already. Several times I felt like closing it, and finally I did, half by way, something that I had never done. <br /> <br /> Scott appeared as a common fuel to welcome girls, his two groups were bitter and also was Mexican boyfriend. And I feel the military uniform was 20 years or modern too, not that this has caused many Western makers. It was probably better than the second half, but I didn't worry to wait and see.
