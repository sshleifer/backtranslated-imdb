This film is going to prove that not every film was made during Hollywood's best days to see. Just because you have a good mix of cast does not mean that this can win the script which is possible written by chimp! Think about it - a film showing Richard Widmark, Lauren Bacall, Charles Boyer, Gloria Graham, Lillian Gish and Paul Stewart and still a bad film! The basic foundation of the film is not bad - a private mental hospital where employees have increased more than patients! Also, the subplot involving a strong husband and wife (Widmark and Graham) had many promises. However, the script was run by finesse and the revival of the drunk buffalo - and bellicose and the way over the scenes on a regular basis in the film. In fact, it was under the game of sports and more as a very bad part of the "General Hospital". Of course, this film is not !! True, this film is not !! Though the most important reason for this film was the record was very bad, but I also have to design the producers also by meditating and exploiting former executives. For example, Paul Stewart cannot be the name of the house but the actor had a unique talent - especially when playing in the Noir films. However here, Stewart is thrown out as a nondescript psychiatrist and a shocking European shock - it hasn't worked since this was good out of its kind of work and its character had been fully and straightened. Also, Charles Boyer appeared just to be optimistic and without it. Seeing a good romantic actress as a psychologist in the heartland of America simply seemed just amazing. Overall, this is a very bad film. It looks so much in the train mode of course but it's not really good. My wife and I did not like the film very much but we also felt that it would be very good if the scriptures were capable. <br /> PS - In the case of art following life, Oscar Levant played one of the patients. In real life, Levant knowledgeable spent much of his life in and out of mental institutions.
