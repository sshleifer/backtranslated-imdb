LOL! Not a bad way to start. I thought this was the original, but I realized it was a reflection of the 1976 KING KONG revision. I've never seen King KONG until I was 15 years old. I saw this film when I was 9. The funky songs of the film will be hit in your head! Do not mention the song of the film theme and Yetians. This is the most harmful effects I have ever seen. At the same time this film is still a holy grail of the B. B. Quotations: "Take the tranquilizer and go to bed." "Put Yeti on your tank and you have the power of Yeti." I remember seeing this film on the MACRABE of MOVIE led by Elvira. There is one area that was like King KONG in reverse! In King KONG takes the girl to climb on the building, but in this film grows under the building and seizes the girl (who was falling)! Also around the year there was another KONG KONG who was MIGHTY PEKING MAN (1977) who came from Hong Kong. There are many cases of matte travel and body parts of the motori. This film will leave you laugh. It's like I said, just another King KONG clone. Rated PG for violence, language, environmental features, and other awesome things.
