I loved Student for the first season. <br /> <br /> But now with the 5th season? (or 6?) things are very clear. <br /> <br /> I was like a show, but it's Donald Trumps own ego fest. It is true that his company will work for them, but come! some things says "You are FIRED" is just insulting. <br /> <br /> after watching the show, I would like to serve him. not because he is arrogant, glorious or such. His right that the show is unrealistic and the way to handle things makes me just squirm. Good entertainment? Yes, but it is exhausting as the backbone is very degraded. check your back jack.
