A series of unwanted screens that seem to go on forever and day. It is not as shocking as saying "Freddy Got Fingered" or "Lost Reality", but since there is no way it is approved in any way, mind or form. The worst features of rhyming clown ever. Any more if it should not be anyone but it is more accurate or political. It also has the worst track of all act of filming, WORST implementation of Arnold EVER (not just worse to put the film, real EVER bad). I have no choice why Karen Black, Micheal Clarke Duncan, or Slash would be a star in this (the reason I looked at it first) The only thing that was so nice was Dickman. In conclusion I can not recommend this film to anyone, but people who do their work in life to get this less than 250 on this site are pathetic. To do something known and you live people. If indeed the Scientalogy Church hates him, he cannot be ALL. <br /> <br /> My bridge: D
