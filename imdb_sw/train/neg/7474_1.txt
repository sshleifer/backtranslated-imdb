This app did not work for me, although I am a fan of type. The main reason that distorted me was that there was no single place where there was no main character. This made it two-dimensional and I left it before the program. <br /> <br /> I was hoping to leave my opinion there if I was not a movie critic, however, guidelines on the status of the IMDb that you should put 10 lines of definition. It reminded me of Hudson Hawk through the main character in every single area, and I would like to hope that the authors of this app can employ more different partnerships with viewers. I have no doubt of the talent of everyone who was beaten by the workers, that only after looking at such things as "wire", I came to expect many things from the doctor's game.
