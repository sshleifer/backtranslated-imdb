Becky Harris has a female player whose luck is to be in the shop at the wrong time and just plainly that in this film is to distribute the reason for the wear of remote control! Miss Harris seems to me to be in fifty years or more when she comes to the area. Once the red pig is supplied and it becomes apparent that this is not a queen AARP. If this is not the best property shown in the cellular cell, I want someone to do it in me. Surprisingly in my opinion and I am fully wearing my VHS copy that takes its charms. I would like to know if this film is available on DVD. Some of this film should not be mentioned. I was hoping to see something to influence and mind, however I was desperate for both errors. God bless Becky Harris!
