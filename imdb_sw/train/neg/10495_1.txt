I think Hunter Croc is a good partner of cool! I know I didn't have the courage to go even 5 feet away from croc. But, everything in this movie is bad. Declare jokes, people whipped, and skit on all the President to make one movie the worst time. <br /> <br /> It is a very bad film that you should stay away. "Jokes" are all newborns who will find themselves laughing because they are stupid. The program is very serious and you wonder if the screenwriter is 4 years old.
