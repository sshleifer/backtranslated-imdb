Cat in Hat is just a slap in the film surface. Mike Myers as Cat in Hat are bad not funny and Mike Myers could not be worse. This is his worst film that he has ever entered. Acting and story was very bad. I mean what they can make the most popular stories with Dr Seuss made in the film and become one of the worst films of all time and similar desires. I couldn't see the movie worse than this rather, maybe Baby Geniuses. But this film is very bad I can't even describe how badly they made this film. Bo Welch should be expelled or the author should.
