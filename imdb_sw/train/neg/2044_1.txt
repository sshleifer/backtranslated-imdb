This movie is bad. I don't mean just 'bad' as it is; "Oh script was bad", or; "Acting in the situation was bad" ... I mean bad if a person should be judged for a crime by strengthening this unpaid bunch for worried people. I can't even respect the details of (Plot ??) if I can refer to such a thing. I mean, after all, no one is deliberately going to make a bad movie, do you? Well, yes. It seems they are doing ... and the guilty person is the author / director Ulli Lommel. But the worst is that Blockbusters are actually renting this to their customers! You are advised. Leave this crap where it belongs. He went to the shelf, collecting dust.
