This is one of the worst movies I have seen so far, the most beautiful place was Christian J. Meoli "Leonard" trying to jump up and down the bar, kind of like I wanted to do on the DVD, to save the rest of the pain of humanity looking This shitty film. It has a huge sand so that you can wait for it to get good, I mean with Sean Astin "Andrew" (played its part fully, did the best, worst in this film), Kyra Sedgwick "Bevan", Ron Livingston "Chad", Ren√©e Zellweger Poet "(who puts his name on the lid has a total of 1 line and less then 4 seconds on all the films ... <br /> <br /> any respect, they would go and buy all the copies of this film and burn it with the Author / Director George Hickenlooper and Author John Enbom
