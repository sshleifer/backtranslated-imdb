Melissa Sagemiller, Wes Bentley, Eliza Dushku and Casey Affleck play young students in Middleton College in Middleton town. Four young people form two triangles of love. In one night during their evil month they run and say with a low and degraded mountain road. Not looking well they indulge in another car and one or more of them kill. The movie is decent, unfortunately there is a suspicion of zero 4 out of just 10-only ticket-bopper roughly never forget.
