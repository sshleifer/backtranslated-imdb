Somehow a woman working with a scientist puts iron balls in people's lips that are supposed to change their personality but actually converts them into zombie killers, like a zombie. "The guinea pigs" for the attempt is locked, young women young women need to learn lessons. This movie is bad, angry, and surprisingly terrible. It has little to no logic in the script. In fact you will have trouble following what is going on. It has no special effects. A computer screen that is considered to be a major scientific development does not appear more than the old Atari screens. The worst thing is that there is also a hairy fabric (it looks like a single child in a summer camp) named George who serves as a servant / servant for Jessica ("leading actor"). In all the movies you will be under the words of the voice, the sophmoric of this puppet. But wait ... you also get loads of signatures, non-stupid, nude occasions and some girls with some bar. When all the sad voice of sounds appears back as some sort of spiritual discovery has been made. There are no suitable characters. There is only a bad grade. The article "gore" and "fear" are shown very much. This movie looks like a boy puts it together. No coincidence Henry Sala, director for name but not for business, did not make another film. I was tired of the coma looking at this stupid, stupid, dreck! And how to end? What happened? If you know I allow it in secret because for my life I can't see it. Note I know that I have lost the time spent looking at this garbage which made the beginning of my weekend bad birth!
