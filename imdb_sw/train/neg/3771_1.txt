This should be one of the worst films of the 1990s. When my friends and I were watching this film (being the target audience of the focus) we sat and watched the first half of the hour and our jaws touching the floor as it was bad. Sometimes, everyone in the playground began to talk, dropping or generally crying in their popcorn which actually paid the money they were doing to look at this unfavorable release for the film. It must be seen as a great idea on the paper, but on the film it looks like no one in the film has a clue going on. Create work, wear clothes. I can't achieve how to destroy this is a look. Fix an hour and a bit of your life .........
