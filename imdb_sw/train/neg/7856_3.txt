This is very interesting. I am an Army and a soldier depicted in this film is awesome. If you are in the Army and you will see this film will laugh and convince the whole movie because of how they did as a squad. It was ridiculous. They did as a group of ordinary people with military uniforms about not knowing what to do. It was a good movie of gory I'd say at least. There were several instances where they are trying to make you nervous. I would like to see if you are tired and want to see the shade, gory movie. It will be the best movie if not in the Army. I would also say I loved the first one better than this.
