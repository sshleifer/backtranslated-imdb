Even with cocaine laced 1980 this is pathetic. I don't understand why a person would like to lose a slide, time, effort, money, and brain cells to make such a drivel. If you're going to do a comedy, make it funny. If you want a garbage film like this, set yourself up. If you are going to open it as a joke like this: Don't be !!! I mean, was it the same joke? Someone please please tell me this was a joke. please.
