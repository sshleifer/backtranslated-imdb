The first video of the whole video seems to have been done in the 80s I had trembled to know that it was released in 2001. The second field was everywhere, far away from the story is confused. If there is a short talk or introduction a story would be better. I also enjoy fantasy but this film was very big. It was wonderful and done wrong. The exhibition did not go well and the characters were not ordinary. It was hard to follow and maybe it was translation but it was hard even to understand. I love Chinese epic movies but if you are looking for a Chinese fantasy film I would suggest a promise (visually surprising, the plot is interesting and good character development) not this film. Beware of despair.
