This movie looks like it may be good at the beginning, but it has never happened to it. The director is talented and possesses a good camera and artistic ideas (eg Asian directors), but does not know how to create or say good news to go with it. The story was split and seemed to leave all sorts of different directions in the film, never finding a solid, expressive, interesting. Basically, the film is never appropriate for information on the media. Acting was very good, however. All the staff gave the best performances, and the Law of Judah was best if he was at all times. It's too bad he chose to make the film weak.
