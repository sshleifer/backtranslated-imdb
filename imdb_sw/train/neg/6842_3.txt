"Paula, I can be a bitch, but I never have a gun!" <br /> <br /> The line of pride in the flick of the otherwise cruelty that has a good honey Stacey Walker, but that's all over. Gal is a real tease who loves his boyfriends, co-workers and even his wife shared Paula in his bedroom, but then returns to a whack job who cries out to "rape" and calls them police! The schizophrenic design of c ** t is certified for some time in a short time, but this story eventually turns into a real reminder. The final course is to wait, for those who still care for that time.
