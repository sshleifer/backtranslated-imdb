I'm not a big fan of Star Trek, but I looked forward to this. I was surprised by the original definition of Enterprise, its low marine style and harsh technology compared to Treks we had. I didn't see anything interesting to this attempt. I have found the plot to be shattered and confused. <br /> <br /> I confess that I did as a development of character - the exhibition of men as a form of 'young' already offered to their britches was of entertainment. <br /> <br /> And the Vulcan child had one hell of a strange rack. But I don't think I will come to this series. <br /> <br>> 3/10
