What happened to Martin Scorcese to restore this film? And not just the one who used it, to destroy it completely? The nonsensical decision to make a character played by Robert DeNiro (in its more performance, and that says a lot) in the fanatic religious is ridiculous, and the image of Hollywood perspectives (and Mr. Scorcese especially) - attitudes that compel the writers to consider the best way make a false character is a tattoo cross behind it. In any case, this film is bad. <br /> <br />
