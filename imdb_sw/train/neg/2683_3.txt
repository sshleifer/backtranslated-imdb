What? Have you ever wondered what will happen if two characters from Beverly Hills 90210 were cured in Thai prison? If so, this is your movie. This is Midnight Express for MTV people. That's right, but the story didn't work well. Composition elements, poor dialogue and potential issues have increased. This small film does not get the right to be like crying as it ends. Spoiler's probability and inappropriate position of the faux-tension of the faux is full of time when the hotel employee sees the girls do not have a room there and is almost beat out. (This time it is played for legitimacy and the same size as gravity as when they are caught on the gunpoint). Later the hotel employee is a certain way of access - and Bangkok is a big city, interested, I have been there - and I testify against girls, as the two free Ta Tais people confirmed 40 years in prison. C'mon. Renting Another day in Paradise instead.
