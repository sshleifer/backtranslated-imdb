This film may have low-quality production, but it also makes it very good. Specific effects are out and are well done. My favorite part of the movie had to be Chrissy played by Janelle Brady. He is fires of fire and also has a good nude area. Robert Prichard as a hilarious group leader, like other members. This film is trying to make sure, saying that nuclear plants are bad. 4/10 Comedy Fair, the largest film.
