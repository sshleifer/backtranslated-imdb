Once in the Indian movie comes along with a film like Sholay which changes how the audience sees a beautiful movie. And once in a while (in hope) we have a RGV ki Aag that break all levels and creates one of it. Very low, can not be broken. Ram Gopal varma can take a pot of talent and create a plate so you can explode from a distance. Take a classic like Sholay and kill it is completely forgiven and I can't believe he almost called the movie RGV ki Sholay. Although Sholay had a lot of festivals in it, the movie managed to build on its plot by simply defining the characters so clearly that they lived forever. What Aag does to pick up these characters and mess them in large quantities you need to pick up the worst. The realistic feature is not entirely available and what the film is about to offer is a group of "executives" that move around in the bottom of the planning and non-interactive. One star for this film is a voting poll vote. The time of RGV to wake up to the fact of his failure and pretend another conspiracy "can be divided under the cinema."
