Movies about Vixen (Erica Gavin) who has a husband Mountie who loves ... but also loves sex! During the movie he gets many people in bed - including her husband and brother! There is also (tame) sequence of lesbians. This video has posted Russ Meyer on the map and it was (I believe) first of the first X story was tested. It was a great hit when it came out. Unfortunately, it's not a good date. Well-led by Erica Gavin is just fine (it happened to him), and it was so beautiful ... but with today's standards it is very tame. I wonder it has a rating of NC-17 now - no hard sex and has women with no capabilities and no male ignorance even. It is also very sad (and sad) to add to politics at the end there was concern (and very good). It is important to be infected although seeing what appeared to be very surprising in 1968. I actually saw a cutting-edge version (which has R rating rating) but I've heard a few seconds here and it's not there. The next Meyer film "More of the Dolls Valley" is better and better suited. Take it instead.
