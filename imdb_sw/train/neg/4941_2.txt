In fact I had no idea of ​​the first business of Geico's six times that I saw them and we even saw them wry and exciting, but much more! This is the BEST thing that these people can come up with ?! This show is available! It is bland and it feels like looking at the "Office" section and the hiding characters as a cemetery (I know a lot you hate me for saying that "Office" does not do that for me). Okay, I get it: we have a poor slob just try to keep his nose clean and he has a crappy boss who hates him; an intellectual scholar who really has a very inexperienced knowledge; and dopey who just wants to be accepted, but SO WHAT! I have worked with these people and found them just as angry in real life as I do on TV ... why would I lose another 1/336 of my week looking more of those types? Please call your parents and ask if they have left you on your head if you have thought about it, you are still deceiving yourself to believe that this is entertainment.
