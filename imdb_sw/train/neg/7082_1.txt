Ok, I wrote a good review b / c movie is bad. While I was waiting for another review (for Derrida) of the growing mine, I decided to explore the previous review of this bad film. See all positive comments. ALL, I say ALL, come from donors have not seen any other movie than this. Crimminy! and wait until the verification of "rosebud". See other films of reviewed and recommended movies for suggestions. Oh, shoot! It happens to be just another movie with two authors and director. Sacred wound-Wipers Batman. Joe, Tony, swallowing like authors, and tony, you can't eliminate the bad script. No work for you! How to train MVIE METAL TRAINING!
