Although it has been 2 years, I still remember the full amount that includes the whole plot of the movie. Unfortunately, I watched this movie after my friends and I chose to browse through new updates on Blockbuster. We decided to take a movie because it was the only one we didn't see and looked like it could be fun. Although it has been a long time since I watched the film, I still remember the lack of conspiracy (with no weight, no real plot), and completing the time spent watching the film. If you're in a video store and this film catches your eye, continue to see the best film. If you have finished watching this film, I understand your pain :)
