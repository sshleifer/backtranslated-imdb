So I had a low expectations of this movie to start with, but it failed to meet even those. when there were some funny places, even one or two shouted loudly, this film was very short and what I called. The funniest joke was not expected and very quickly, leaving us sitting there to go "WTF just happened?" In addition, there were a few jokes you found and continued. The place where he falls down the mountain had me yawning. Also, editing was missing. there was a bad change in the area, but it seems to be a fashion today. It made me laugh, but I wasn't looking again, and I'm very happy to wait for the lease. provide opportunities, you can enjoy it, but do not think you are for anything beyond the 40-year-old, or Superbad.
