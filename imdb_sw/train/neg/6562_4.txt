Can you tell the production of Lew Grade miles away? open to UK in style; Epic in pregnancy; involved with all international stars blowing; usually put in foreign climes. It is a formula that Brazilian and ITC company was employed in 70 to 80 years, leading to titles such as Eagle Come, Fire, and Add Titanic! In 1977, the Bridge was produced in March or Die, an extraordinary adventure of the Foreign League which shows all the features mentioned above. Guided by the most common Dick Richards? who was helped Farewell known My good years earlier - March or Die is a bad desire. The Foreign State Company led by the headmaster of General Foster (Gene Hackman) has been sent to Morocco shortly after World War 1. Their mission is to protect the historic body of Francois Marneau. Max Von Sydow) dedicated. Archaeologists are doing investigations in the ancient city of Erfoud, but fear the attack of the Arab tribe after the decline of an ancient archaeological group. Foster is not happy with work? he does not think the remains of history deserve his men to risk their lives. This creates an ongoing tension between himself and Marneau, who believes that the composers should offer their lives to the pain as much as possible. Problems are increasing when a beautiful woman named Simone Picard (Catherine Deneuve) tags with leaders.

His presence arouses ambition among the soldiers, not even more than a gypsy thief Marco Segrain (Terence Hill), a strong and brave man who at first shows apathy for his legionnaire colleagues but gradually grows into a situation. Things have grown up in Erfoud, as well as the Arab tribes who are united against a minority of legionnaires while trying to protect their lives. <br /> In the paper star star Gene Hackman and Terence Hill seem to disappear? Hackman is an actor character of Oscar-winning heavy, a beautiful but small heart of Italian heart from the west west of the spaghetti. Someone expects hackman to act on his act away from the screen. However, hardly, it is a hackman who offers weak and improper performance, while Hill lifts its game with great levels. The film is very interesting in the desert areas, but pacing is very slow and a few of the characters should be concerned. Maurice Jarre Music is usually very flat too? very desperate from a boy who gave us the Lawrence of Arabia. It is amazing that anyone had the courage to try an old adventure of this kind in 70 years (it was a kind that reached 30 years, and was forgotten during the decades). Sadly, the player is not recommended to pay? this respect for the former legionnaire flicks becomes more than a plod than a demonstration.
