Every time the movie comes that will be so bad that I feel compelled to warn people. If I work all my days and I can save but one spirit to watch this film, it's a good pleasure. <br /> <br /> Where to start my discussion of pain. At the beginning, there was a music video every five minutes. There was no development of behavior. Each character was typical. We were swearing, a fat man who eat donuts, a foreign guy, etc.. Script felt as written as the movie was hit. The production value was too low to feel like I watched a video video. Have directors, producers, etc. have ever seen the movie before? Halestorm is the worst and worst for each new entry. The concept of this movie proved amazing. What? How can you go wrong with Gary Coleman and a few of some legitimate participants. But I do not believe when I say this, things were bad, ONE PERSON.
