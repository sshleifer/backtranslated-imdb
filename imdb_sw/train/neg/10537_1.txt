Well, what can you say about Barbara Cartland's change? There are other amazing actors in this (Oliver Reed, Sarah Miles, Christopher Plummer) but they are obviously freezing money. Lysette Anthony and Marcus Gilbert have been found in two other Cartland bandits - Anthony and Hugh Grant (who seems to fit with Gilbert and Helena Bonham Carter). If you want to see "search" change of Cartland, one of Bonham Carter is one of the going ("A Hazard of Hearts" - it's a title!). Gilbert is a weak link to it, but Bonham Carter is very good and he can certainly do the truth, and all others play in language with a strong in cheek (Edward Fox & Diana Rigg)
