This scenario is about other girls in a Catholic school that has no trouble because of putting red color in one of their school shampoo and after being abused by this act they decide to remove Florida for a holiday. On their way there they meet some people at dinner and decide that both will meet in another area later. Girls go to the road near the wood and stop for a while and when one of the girls decides to walk around she sees the murder being done when the local sheriff is involved. He is afraid and runs to tell others what happened. Some girls decide to go with him and two of them are killed by the killer. Then the remaining two girls are murdered and put in the cell of the inner prison. The deputy deputy at the same time keeps watching over the girls and despite their insistence that the sheriff is a killer he hates both and does as ignorant and everyone else in this movie who can not only put two and two together under some lousy detective job at that time. The best part was the rape scene between the killer and one of the girls who decides to bury her in the cell of the jail and it seems that the girl really wants to be raped by this person and the chest area that I realized was good but before their lips met with other things in mind. This film reminds me of the exciting under-budget "Blood Blood" and Frankie Avalon who look into it, only one focus on a different character. It is not a film that is worth hiring even with a less than 80 budget movies and the end is the most endless I've ever seen in the film and you have left me looking for my money back!
