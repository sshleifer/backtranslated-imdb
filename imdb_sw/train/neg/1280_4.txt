When I saw the name of this film, I'd always think it's music. As "Harvey Girls." It is not. It is a pudding that was cooked, closed the ceiling of the kitchen, and was beaten off by knit together. There is no music and not a piece of time but it is impossible. Starting with Sister James Woods telling the elder of his three daughters, a young child growing up to be Barbara Stanwyck, that he must have a family name and home. So we think it would be a historical interactive story. And it's for a short time. Then it turns out to be the anti-cold story of Stanwyck against lawyer George Brent. Why is he so dead to put on it? Well, why else? As we learn in the wonderful series of series written by Stanwyck, he immediately thought he could inherit the money (for his sisters like himself, of course) to get married. He hit a man who took that land of bumpkin, who was actually a lawyer Brent. Nor should anyone think of their child, the eighth boy or during the main plot, is - well, you know ... They had a quick marriage and in a very short time when they were together, he was born. One of his sisters likes and a painter named Gig Young, who plays with Gig Young. Another sister tries to take her. Likewise, etc.. <br /> <br /> It is a fraud, unengaging mess - fully acted but without shred of logic or plausibility.
