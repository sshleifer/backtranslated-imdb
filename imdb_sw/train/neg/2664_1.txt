Few young people are interested in the study of the most interesting American killings, as road partners and a young female girl and her proud girlfriend - who is a real psychologist. Arty and abandon, the sound of the film exchanges between pouty pseudo-irony and silly flamboyance. It is possible to intentionally, but eventually it became laughable. Brad Pitt's performance as a low-paying taxpayer is godawful. * from ****
