Semana Santa is a jaw-stop effect. It's very bad in many ways I don't know where to start. So, let's see ... Mira Sorvino, whose husband is shot while protecting himself, goes to Madrid to Seville for his police work. In the holy week (Semana santa, you see ... everyone begins to sleep ... said you were bad in many points, even from the beginning), the killer works for his victims as a cow in the field of cattle. She cooperates with female pig's chauvinist Olivier Martinez and beautiful Feodor Atkine. Recently she knows she will be the second goal of the killer (who wears a red dress). Why, oh but why? <br /> <br /> Why ..; that's the question that has been on my whole movie. <br /> <br /> Q: Why are you going to see A: because love Mira Sorvino (I even charging for that AT AT FIRST SIGHT crap) <br /> <br /> Q: Why we just 8 people in the hall this Saturday on the last week of release? A: ah-ah-ah. The spider man began again the same day. But also the fact that the movie has been blasted and execrable reviews. Q: Why is this film made? A: Money I think. But the boy made Mira wants money. <br /> <br /> then ... why? First, there is always something wrong with the production of European cooperation. here you have French-English-German-Italian-Spanish-Danish production. it's ha. It wants to play in a similar group of games like US / slasher / whodunit / hidden / anything. Even VALENTINE, though not required and printed badly and shot, was much better to emphasize and enjoy. <br /> <br /> Then, in order to lend to the story, the scribe wanted to add a political comment to the story. Reverse: happens on the feet of flash in Traffic image, it is certainly the most interesting thing i n movie. It can be connected to it, it will not have to stay through the entire movie. Better go directly to Guillermo del Tros of BACKBONE DEVIL (El espinazo del diablo) for cheerfulness. <br /> <br /> Then shortages. Bullseye! The first victims are gay and S-M twins who have been killed. The annoying olivier Martinez goes to a dating agency conducted with a large shade of stretch on weight and platinum. You call the character of Mira Sorvino dyke great at all. What? We need this kind of stuff? And. Just words of the wrong objection, such as ol'times. <br /> <br /> Then doubts. Give it. There is no clear objective. The first murder is a clear illusion if they are a representation of popular paintings. But no. And the murderer's revelation (a bad retired, of course) would have been made from the beginning at the end of the movie as, I think, was the time of the director to say "thumb, when to finish the damn movie let us open right now who is a killer and why he kills". <br /> <br /> Then the director thinks he is the director. Hasila: no sense of insistence, no sense to lead administrators, no change of speed. Great river, of mega-bearing. The events of the holy week do not need (perhaps a collaborative rule of saying: ok, shot in Sevilla but show some of the creditsof this beautiful and historic city with Easter celebrations. > <br /> Then executives. All errors. Mira Sorvino is involved in death: he does nothing but is injured by the right hand. Everything that he did well (Aphrodite, Great Aphrodite ...) were as if they were not there. Olivier Martinez ... hello, anyone here? When manufacturers will learn that he is not an actor but mannequin without speech or emotional capabilities? Feodor Atkine, bland and transparent. What? Only we highly respect Alida Valli, one of the greatest actors of the last century (and I hope the most roles in the current one). He is the main attraction here as he alone can give life to his rough lines. I will not mention other executives since they are the only, non-interested and unknown. <br /> <br /> Improper orientation, inaccurate artists, unintentional plot. Idiocy is generated. <br /> <br /> Superwonderscope says: 1 <br /> <br />
