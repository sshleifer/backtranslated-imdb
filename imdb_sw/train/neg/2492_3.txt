I think I've got the worst movie, so I have to give this 3, but it's hard to remember what they could be! It is possible to Xtro (bad & bad) or it may start (it's just dull), but it's hard to think of something worse. It's hard to know where to start. Let's just say it is under the siege of a poor person, with one star who had the poor of Jean Claude Van Damme. The only aspect of redemption was the Casper Van Dien - I always wondered what happened to him after Starship Troopers. Yes, he was Johnny Rico, if you want to know. <br /> <br /> Judging from this site, he has been stuck in the cinema of the television movie .... Casper, have to choose more .... please !!!!!!!!!! Arghhhh, I have just turned to a semi-honorable film called criminal law ...... now I'm getting very angry about 1.5hrs last !!!
