I rate this movie with 3 skull, only the coz girls knew how to shout, this could be the best movie, if the actors were better, twins were the same, I believed they were bad, but the older brother and younger, they sucked very bad, it seemed like they were reading the scriptures instead of making them .... spoiler: if it's a vampire why they bleed? Vampires cannot drink the stored blood, the sister in the movie says we should pray when she is alive .... but when they move to another house, it takes more cold than the blood stored. The end of the spoiler <br /> <br /> was a great waste of time, and that made me a coz mad I read all the views of how this movie was good, it's a prize this movie won, and this movie was f * *** ing s ** t !!!!
