That's one of the most amazing films made - even for Fellini. About just one of the most wonderful is his SATRICIA. This is two and a half hours run through the wonderful world of night of destruction, opulence and gender challenge. Sutherland makes Casanova less attractive and unusual events in a series of unrelated vignettes that have been taken from the partner's principal partner does not include viewer. The focus of art and design of the clothes is however. The college did not even appoint an old but did the right itself by awarding the OSCAR to the end. Also chosen (oddly) was a meaningless and useless mix. Go to the figure! The video on the video is only 150 minutes, 16 minutes short during the initial run. The viewer was grateful.
