Creative film fans should tolerate most recent films. Blood Surf shamelessly join a stupid stupid list, redundant massa-horror about ridiculously great animals that want to turn a chain of food upside down. Crocodiles are particularly successful if we had been fighting our way through the "crocodile" crocodile (headed by the terrible Tobe Hooper) and 'Lake Placid'. Surf of blood is everything bad as these other films and ?? about it ?? likes to expand significantly. The saltwater crocodile thinks it is 90 years old, more than 30 ft long (!) And kills with joy! During the film, he bothers to destroy a group of fools of surfer-dudes and dudettes who came to search for a new refrigerator by opening up a shark area. The only good feature of this film is a tropical area. Although it is a very improper arrangement for a film like this, lagoons and nature looks amazing. Every other aspect is just dangerous. There is a bit of gore but all looks fake and laughable. These discussions are sad to listen! You will not believe some of these characters say! I know the ride surfers are supposed to be a group of intellectuals but I hope they themselves are not stupid! Earlier in the film, one of the characters refers to Jaws as a 'mechanical toy' but croc here appears at least 10 times less than a shark white shark. Visual effects in the 'Surf Blood' are amateurish and massacre failure. I won't say a lot about acting since it's second to flicks like this. Girls seem to be mad in rainy shirts and their boobs thrive when running from the animal. You thought the right: The blood Surf is a very bad film. Not too bad it becomes fun again. But 'funny' for the rest of the reason than James Hickox target.
