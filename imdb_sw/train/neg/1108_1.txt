Dreary and does not mean fluff (fluff blood, but fluff). Written badly, with wooden and wooden discussions. You don't care if the characters (in fact, even if the actors themselves) live or die. Little grace or charm, a little bit, little point to the whole thing. Perhaps some set and set will have interest - these limitations between all the board buildings can be true through a living life. The accumulation of the system is not needed and tend to worry, and the character of Hoppalong Cassidy himself is boring and inept.
