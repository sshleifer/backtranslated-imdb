Everything in this film is bad, stories, acting, effects but funny, funny, funny !!! Scott Valentine and the uniform of the army that the ten largest sizes are bad and the permanent attempt in scowl on his face as the leader of a special group of ops his hilarious group! '' Terrorists' 'is awesome and realistic as' raptors'', this is a phone and bad in everything trying to laugh. The place where the T-REX bigger that somehow snuck on board the ship and then somehow underneath blows and you see a metal pole locked where its head was fully ends. If you're getting into a bad movie, this is a gold pot, here a bb-bad lisa !!!
