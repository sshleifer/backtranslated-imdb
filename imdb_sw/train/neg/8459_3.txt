Some of the most fascinating works and the most powerful stories. But it has never come together as anything other than thesis of a graduate student in a school of film. <br /> <br /> There are two basic reasons for this. Fist, there is no good character, not even we can praise him for his chutzpah. Second, all the acting is bad - even from the old WFLL. Ham is very much here, you feel like you're on a picnic - but one of the picnics of an employee of a bad company that drinks cheap beer and get your hangover before you even stop drinking. Then you eat the lowest hotdog and cast. Of course, I am very bad for a young director who can go to the place - as I said, the camera function is very good. and the installation of a DVD has a picture on that which shows this too - but no one is connected to the film to make it seem to know that this is the type of film they should do. It is a brutality that hurts; but even without it, the fact remains that we do not like these characters, we feel embarrassed to actors, the story will not be optimistic, and in the final analysis, we don't care. I removed it from a DVD player about half way. but the rental shop does not give me my money again. <br /> <br /> Now, that hurts.
