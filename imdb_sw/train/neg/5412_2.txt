Pyare Mohan can be safely placed on the black list of one of the worst films made by humans. The film, one of the many people with disabilities - people with disabilities who came out after a wonderful Black achievement makes a seizure of disability. Vivek Oberoi and Fardeen Khan are the only caricatures of people with disabilities. When Black showed the gentleness and feelings of a woman with disabilities and gave us a glimpse of her world, Pyare Mohan shows two monkeys such as those who have no reputation on being disabled and beat half of the world to protect their interests. Music Property Malik is fair enough. Vivek Oberoi who began the start of Saathiya is sad to lose his fast balls in Hindi movies. Fardeen Khan was not an accepted actor and deserved to be banned from the film industry. Amrita Rao and Esha Deol are just fine young people in distress to have nightclubs in Thialnd and no one to save - except for the previously mentioned desperados. Boman Irani, like Don Toni's rebellion, is accepted. Avoid the film if possible.
