The show is average. It doesn't make me laugh. However, I think Courtney brings the truth. He does not look natural. He has these three ways to talk, all robotic. He speaks quietly (without thought), speaking normally (without falsehood), or does something that he starts talking normally, and starts singing gradually. However, screaming for him is like "let's do that I shout because I shouldn't be too high on the set". He makes himself known that a good actor does this amazing thing. It is sad. We cannot find his personality, because it is not emotional, and should not be. He has this husband, who does all these stupid things, and there is no answer from him. Very dry and acting clearly.
