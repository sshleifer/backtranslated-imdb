Story story: A 4-hour non-fiction story covers enough details in the Kargil industry near LOC in 1999 when Pakistani crosses crossed the LOC and entered the Indian and Indian territory of India. To find out more about the story, I would like readers to read the same news items with Kargil. <br /> <br /> Comments: If someone wants a story of a form in this film, then someone can be sure it doesn't exist. LOC is the story of a clean offering, patriotism, courage and lots and lots of lots and blood. The movie theater where I saw this film was full of Catholicism and was delighted when Film shows India's Restoration. Film artists looked like the listeners like the cricket match of India and Pak. Watching the film as a tribute to the Army's sacrifice and by the merits of the real war heroes (4 heroes of PVC) who have sacrificed their lives so we can see today. The movie has made a brilliant show of the Army who have fought all the difficulties in the worst weather conditions. The film's criteria are that it has also been introduced by the most popular songs.
