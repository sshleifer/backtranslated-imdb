I liked this movie, I will accept it. This should be better (automatically go?) Video video I've got. Okay ... me and my friend just decided to just shits n 'giggles that we would like to rent this movie. We knew what to expect and we got what we expected, as well as more. When the red neck was hit against the tree and the Sasquatch, we looked at that part three times four, it was amazing (hysterically, of course). And why? Oh, why should the main character strike? As honestly, we know that you are in danger, you exceeds that amount to help everything. But in fact, if this film is located inside your local video store RENT IT. It's worth the money and not too bad, if it's bad, but it's not too bad. In general, the amazing accomplishment will save you if you lose this film.
