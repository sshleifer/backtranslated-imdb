The only thing that surprises me than the number of people who loved this movie is that it was led by Clint Eastwood, whose work I love so much. The guide had no chemistry at all. Not a second can believe that there is nothing more than a desire among them. The story has not come true. Add to the planned conversations, tons of presentations, and a slow plot that causes anywhere, and you have made a real stinker. Kay Lenz's improper work may be useful for those looking for fares, but otherwise this is a great waste of time. My thoughts when I watched the movie was that it would be more known as "Cheesy."
