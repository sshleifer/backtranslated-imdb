At any time the movie is so myopic in its desire to give a certain end or view that not only bothers the real story, it is annoying. That's the kind of movies where the end or comment is the first pregnancy, and the story only takes into account. For this reason we often talk about the story "fly through hoops" as it includes over, trying to succeed and continue to end up with a logical way. Myths in the "Comet Over Broadway" does not just t jump through hoops, it's three circus rings. It's amazing, it's been a bad pregnancy, so it feels that, if you like to speak out loud on the screen, you will be going much further before going through. <br /> <br /> The main theme of this cesspool screen is a woman who chooses between family and profession. Since everything has been so frightening it will come to the attention of people of any opinion. So, finally there is no certainty for the story, the theme is not good and, as usual with poor pictures, acting does not save something.
