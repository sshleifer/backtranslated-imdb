When I saw this film first, it was called TERROR ON A TRAIN and it was half back to the element twice. Glenn Ford, a weapons specialist is called to eliminate a bomb that was hidden on a train carrying a high bomb. The tension is slow and consistent; with this black and white film runs only an hour and twelve minutes. All years later on TV; tension and drama have lost its many effects. This is still a good movie to the early level of 50s. <br /> <br /> With Ford is Anne Vernon and Maurice Denham. The striker / striker plays with Victor Maddern.
