I did not say that Twisters night was terrible, but it was far from the big. Assistant for better. I seem though every time one kind of movie is given, the second must be around at the same time. (Think about Armageddon and Deep Impact, Volcano and Dante of the Night) Night of Twisters is really just Twister unless bad and for the results of the special mundane <br /> <br /> I have nothing against actors who starred in it, even if they were not great, it was the movie itself, leading, special effects, the whole story was very amazing to translate. The series of hurricanes hit the city and basically the movie is about people trying to find family and friends and deal with damage. <br /> <br /> I do not know why it looks like though duplicate of the disaster movies are presented close to sync, but this would be better with Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt.
