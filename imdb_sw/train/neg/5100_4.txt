This series of anime begins well: Interesting stories, exciting events, interesting characters, for beautifully supplied and implemented. Not everything is explained immediately, it refers to the carrot in front of the viewer, to convince the viewer to look at every success area. But consider the desire to see that the adventure of a robot / great robot is just an increase in the psychological simplicity of the brain and religion. If you want to hear "You're right. It's good to have you." after interference with bad ideologies and feelings of characters, then this is for you. If you want to flick a beautiful sci-fi which is just fun to watch, forget this. All of the original, and its end was very misleading. All this, and this movie was also preaching.
