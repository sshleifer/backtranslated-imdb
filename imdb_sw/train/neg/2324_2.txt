I agree with other users' comments because two major roles performed well, being a boy playing Gary Gillmore and Giovanni's role. The mysteries of the story was very interesting. I have not heard of the information I didn't know of Gary Gillmore before the movie so I didn't know what to expect. I thought it would be something like the Holy One who walks or the party but how I was wrong. The whole movie was just talking, talking and talking about mother and father. The only cold frost was a patch where the father lost his temper. That is the only interest I received from this symptom.
