This movie is a waste of time, the plot is bad, the conversation is bad. <br /> <br /> Acting is the same, but characters don't have a plot or script to work with. Photography and some special effects are the same, too, but there is nothing interesting in this movie to watch. There is no logical development of the story, the story line is meaningless. It's not even terrible. For the film to be scary, there must be at least a little reliable aspect. This movie does not trust any. <br /> <br /> There are only three characters in the film. Each character is unknown and has no personality. <br /> <br /> Most of the special effects and work is wrong, or largely. I hope to read this and do not waste time on this film unless you are eager to see the worst movie.
