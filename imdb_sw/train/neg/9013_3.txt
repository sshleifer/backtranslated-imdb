It's hard to praise this film. CGI for the dragon had done well, but had no good example of light and shadow. Also, the same image is used forever of the dragon forming a pattern that has little contempt. <br /> I was surprised to see "Marcus Aurelius" in the features of the act, wondering what the former Roman Emperor Empire was working in this film! As "Whoopie Goldberg" it must be a stranger, and someone who can accuse him using one if he appears in this stinker. <br /> <br /> Stories can be interesting, but acting is flat, and leadership is amazing. If you should watch this movie, go next to your friend's house and alcohol while doing it - then it will be fun.
