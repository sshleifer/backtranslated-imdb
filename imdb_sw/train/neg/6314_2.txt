I love Seth Green. His appearance on THS 70s' Show is always worth watching but last night, I felt the needed show overhauled. Four young people inherit the New York City apartment where most of us will die. The bride must be a heiress to have the same place in the first place. So I felt the need for authenticity should be brought out. However the plot about four best friends to get this apartment was not believed. I would like to be happy if they had to enter with one of their parents who could give great and unpleasant humor on the introduction of the show. It didn't seem to have much humor in it. I just watch because it falls before my name is Earl on winning Thursday night. I think they should go back, scrap this series, and start again. We need more families involved. What? Sete and her friends come in with her parents wacky in the suburbs after fire burn their place. That may be Dabney Coleman playing dad and Christine Estabrook, playing mom and unemployed brothers. A list of possibilities with someone like Seth Green is not enough and the network you are calling.
