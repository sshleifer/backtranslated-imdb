I wanted to love this film, I did. It has other good actors but eventually falls flat. It tries to be complicated in some areas (the daughter on hard cheese experiments), on reaching others (the area where she clears someone's yard, so she agrees to join the team) and has events that, when attractive to the gentle, are actually just filling (all area work). And I have not found the "villians" of horrible, or hateful, even though I discovered that the anger of children. I have met people like those who are in the film when playing a church ball. And I will say that the judge sees himself, however, at the end, I was not worried about the characters, or their efforts to the glory of the church football. Maybe because they were all so direct, which I might be very interested as the film were funnier or seemed to flow slightly more thoroughly. Kurt Hale, and Halestorm entertainment, have made some good films, but this is not one of them.
