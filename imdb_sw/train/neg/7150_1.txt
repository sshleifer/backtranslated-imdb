After seeing the preview I felt that this film would be a better improvement on a quick and bright series. So, I already expected to have a missing story, but at least this time you will not be able to carry with a non-capable civil society group with fart cans. Unfortunately, I was wrong. If you could only think of a quick and angry movie with a bad story more than all the films of this film are for you. This is the worst movie I've ever seen (I am happy - No I would like to take a baseball button for my peers like what others have said). It was not just a story that was not there, but the action was also too. I think the director thought that they could only give us a group of women and foreign and then call it movies. For example, there is uncertainty in a movie where a person hits Nos and Lamborghini's imprisonment takes air and jumps on SLR McLaren to win. And after a little while Eddy Griffin fought one of his "girls" (Imus' s opinion would work in this case) the girl asks to smoke and get out of PLANE and of course they do in the middle of the desert. After this wonderful place I could no longer. So, I just need to see this half of this monstrosity. This is the first movie I ever walked. Later, I had to leave some drinks to kill all the brain cells that were damaged. I paid 1 because 0 is not an option. You are better off to go to the local car show and stop on the cooperation of robbers along the way. I will put all the audience in my prayers.
