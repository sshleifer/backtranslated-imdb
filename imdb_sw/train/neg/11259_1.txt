I gave this 1 film. I can't understand how Ettore Scola, one of the major directors of Italian movies, made a film like this, so it's stupid and ignorant! All stories of people involved in the movie do not know, it is interesting and not interesting. For a very long time, it is also boring. The only things I save in this film are Giancarlo Giannini and Vittorio Gasmann. Hope that Scola will change the theme and great style in his next film.
