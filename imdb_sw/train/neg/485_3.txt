When I saw the preview, I thought: this would be a good movie. And really can be. The main character play was very reliable, and the beauty of the picture is not acceptable. However the dialogue cast a dark shadow into the whole picture. The language level was very unknown and very modern in the year 1610, and it eliminated most of the film's film. However, I must thank you for translating, because English titles were better and they should be the original French origin, and perhaps the best description of the movie found on imbd!
