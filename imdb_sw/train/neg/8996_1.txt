In the future of 1985, the Howard Hesseman-led government committee runs a discussion on the first network of an open network. They tell the app, which plays as a series of skits. I can mention a good skit film with one hand, not using my finger. "Women of Amazon on the Moon", "Modern Fried Kentucky", "Meaning of Life", and "Video Mr. Mike Mondo". See how I said "Vision of Tunnel"? The reason is that this 'movie' is death in the form of movies. There is no even skits off-to-play, or even very clever. It takes a very small form on the part of the creators of the film even to get one laugh from me. <br /> <br /> My Bridge: F <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Dody Dorn goes full
