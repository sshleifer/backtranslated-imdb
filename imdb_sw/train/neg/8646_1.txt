This is the worst movie I saw. I was standing and leaving Tape 4 but I included it. Now I see myself a Masochist! Afghanistan? Come to the boys! Who wrote to forget the Sanskrit billboards? I thought the leading actor (George Calil) was not very familiar. In addition to the vibrant and hard cameras, I thought using 9/11 events as a reason to do "Larson Implodes of Lunatoni, everywhere on the screen next to you" embarrassing and innocent to 9/11 victims. Using a phone from Larson's wife, Sarah, who is called from one of the aircraft to fight the terrorists that day, was terrible. Shake the camera did not make me feel sick, that stunt cool heart made.
