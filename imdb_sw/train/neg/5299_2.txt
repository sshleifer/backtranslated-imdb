I really love slasher movies, but this is very bad. Acting is blind, the script is bad, and the situation does not exist. The plot is as follows: The ruined garden Charlie Puckett kills people in a small US town. That's good - this is a plot. Naturally, eh! "Night brings Charlie" not even enough-if the film will not be awesome, at least they should make it blood. Leave this piece of cheap rubbish at all costs. If you want to see beautiful beautiful flicks look "Madman", "Burning", "Prowler", "Just before Dawn" or "Humongous" - just don't waste your precious time and this doesn't mean a piece of garbage.
