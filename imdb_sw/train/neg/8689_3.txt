The main problem with the "Power" is that it shows the way it can also have useless letters and streams that add anything to any movie. It gets boring after some time, stay around waiting through the scenes that do not connect to find something leading the car ahead. You may probably adopt all of them as a character development, but they are all re-created from the original screens on the film, or are just flat and unavailable. Lumet does not provide enough time to allow any supported flowers. He should cut a few of the characters (hackman, wife) and focus on others (Billings). It may be a great political excitement rather than a jumbled mess that loses any message in the sea of ​​bad writing and acting, the fact that you have surprised by considering the cast. Even the hack of hack hackers was not high. Denzel Washington is the only note actor here. Gere and others have done more exhibitions elsewhere. Sidney Lumet needs to go back to a rough man who shows him in the seventy years (ie Serpico) and stop trying to achieve his achievements with "angry 12 people" and "failures Sala". It hasn't worked yet Sidney, and it is never possible. leave the ensemble dramas to Altman. * / * * / * * * * *
