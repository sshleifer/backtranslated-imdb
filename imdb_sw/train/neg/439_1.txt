Removal of the best way to "Kill, He wrote", is quite surprising that this unregistered garbage for a long time continued for eight years. I am sure many of the people who watched this unscrupulous trick were in seventy-seventy years and were only found because they had nothing better to do, or just remember his star from Dick Van Dyke's old show. Van Dyke, who had only a good job in the 1960s, had never been a very great actor (by his own entry) and was too old to play a doctor when the series started in 1993. He looks very old as a result of many years of smoking smoking and drinking heavy. His true inexperienced life, Barry, a wooden actor who has often been in anything that did not involve his father, plays his son in a row.
