The one-line summary should describe it all, but I will go and go there. <br /> <br /> From going, this film was seen as an extra soda opera, and that's about all I can comment on. There were few interesting events, like "Big One" that hit the middle of the film, but, wait, what is it? Earth's earthquake *, wait a minute! That's the top of Dante! Yes, its parts are played by clapping. I can't believe how this film was wrong, "borrowing" pictures from other films, better. A person who asks himself is the director who thought the audience was dumb enough to believe in the mountainous mountain-esque mountains in the city of LA, the Dante. <br /> <br /> I advise you, don't forget Bond Want-be, Nash, in this film and go to the real thing (again, someone from Dante's Peak coincidentally.)
