This is changing to the WORST film I saw. I bought a DVD and did not work, well the DVD did well, its film was not, it's really bad I think non-actors worked since (or before judging from acting). There is no real plot to say with no real fear. Production ethics are even trash for small budget films and other external events that are difficult to hear because of the wind on the microphone. Everything in all the bad films had a viewer who could think it was going to return to porno if they didn't know better (that had been improving). There are only two lines in the film that are interesting, which all revolves around the transvestite partner. (Although it is difficult to watch all 76 minutes for) <br /> <br /> About the DVDs I feel quite comfortable. I mean reading back what I expected to be bad: <br /> <br /> He chose his weapons. He chose his victims. He took his nose. It turned out to be a GIRL! <br /> <br /> But I thought it might be funny. Also the case claims that it is the so-called electronic, I would like to see it previously, the publication is largely can use as a sand sheet. The case also says that it is a very disgusting movie, WHAT IS? This video is always welcome for the first five minutes, (if you think buying this I would like to buy bad taste 'instead it is a very good film and it is interesting, it also has Peter Jackson's director of LOTR. Unfortunately if someone knows anything about any actors (or director Patrick J Mathews) and what they have done since then, please send here if I would like to know, just know if there is a worse movie out there, or if anyone in this film has ever been concerned to learn to act
