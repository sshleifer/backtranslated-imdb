First of all I would say that I had to think a lot about writing comments for this film. The best assessment of this type of Cinema can be simply silent. Modern is taken by the housewife and by the grandmother. This movie tries to look "real" and the characters should be "real people". Italian can never think that characters can be "real": it's just a "negative-profile" fraud. It offers the worst vision of life that is in Italy. The plan is weak (what is the plot?) And humor did not make anyone not laughing more than 12.
