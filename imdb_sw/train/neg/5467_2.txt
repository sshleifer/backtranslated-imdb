What to say about this movie. Well it is about a group of good students who have bad drugs and turn out to be false students who sell more drugs to people. Two of these people have a negative impact if a person returns to the type of retaliation and his partner gives us a creature that grows under school. That's about everything there is and it isolates it for 84. The movie is very bad and should be closed forever forever. Although it is not fair, some people like Troma movies and can look at it if they want. Troma movies for me though, the worst movies are out there. I just looked at this with curiosity.
