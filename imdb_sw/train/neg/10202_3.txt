The killings are one of those movies you expect to be made for TV but they are not available. Considering only the details of any information is Bullock (although Michael Pitt seems to be going to a lot of things and better), it is not surprising that this film destroys quickly and records to be replaced by more important things. As ... remember to shut your front door when you come out. Or wear clothes when you leave the swimming pool. <br /> <br /> Pig has Cassie Mayweather, soldiers and personal affairs (not all). With his new partner (Ben Chaplin-looking rain), he is called to investigate the murder of a young woman. There is nothing common there except that young students think they have planned and killed the perfect killings. As the investigation goes on, the war of love takes place between Cassie and the chief Richie Haywood (Ryan Gosling). The point of breathing here is that the two dimensions are hopeless. Guns, though they are very good looking, are up as reliable in the role of tough hard cop like Rodney Dangerfield (in fact, she's better!). Chaplin, for his sins, is complete non-group and I feel that he should put this film on his CV in an attempt to get into Hollywood. Of course Gosling and Pitt, as the defendants emerging, are adequately enough. If the dodgy leadership was not bad, the story that would send anyone to sleep with the last shot (but unknown) ended this film on the head before it had a chance to run. "Accidental Accounts" does not have anything to go with, even the nude nude area and Bullock will not redeem you. Well, just a little but still not enough to save it. Forgetting, it is predictable and large - this is one film that will not encourage cop type. As Cassie says in her next case, there is nothing to see here. Continue together, keep moving ...
