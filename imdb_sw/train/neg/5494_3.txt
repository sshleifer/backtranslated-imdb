It reduces the cheap, this film was not found to love children in the audience, except for the good joke of toilets. Christopher Lloyd is a way of being reduced by his chief and in fact he is very active in this role, although the sad excuse for jokes and journalists is not helpful. Elizabeth Hurley is an embarrassment of an amateur in the role known as comic. Jeff Daniels and Darryl Hana avoid abuse. Certainly there is no reason to make this film, especially that it is impossible for someone to compare with the friends of Robin Williams often brilliant in Mork & Mindy. <br /> <br />
