When I watch this film, it is interesting to see how much it gives to Black people. The movie spends its time showing how the most invisible person of Black in it is (except at the time of the hero). For many films, some Black people (and white-black women) in the film are the back way, unknown. <br /> <br /> The character of Vanessa Williams was strong and compassionate. The viewer can identify and feel sympathy with him. There are also characters of a clear and three-dimensional appearance who have thin colors, and some of the white characters of heat and respect. But 99% of Black men in this film are nothing but visible. Unknown shades behind, no results. Then such horrible, but nothing but unusual in the usual media.
