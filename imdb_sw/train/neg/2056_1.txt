Anyone who loved two classic novels by Edward Ormondroyd will be confused in this film. Magic and romance all have been modern out of its original story of a girl who does a good act for a wonderful old woman, and given "three" to return. What is it? It's not three requirements, but three climb up to the 1800s on the rickety elevator ... The first novel is the Best Time. The second is All Time Time.
