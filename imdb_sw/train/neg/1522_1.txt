You should know that I am the kind of person who looks at even the worst films to the end, often due to health curiosity. I looked at the Leprechaun even before he went into an attempt to remove my eyes and beat them. You should also know that this movie was in my VCR for less than half an hour before you make a string of refusal to stop the stopping and hitting back to the rental store to put a great distance between me and possible.
