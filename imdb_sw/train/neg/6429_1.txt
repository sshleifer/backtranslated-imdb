Of course I would like to advise people to stay open to this film. It is about the birth of all to watch and fighting is not very much appreciated. Decreased and not very persuasive. If you are buying a Hong Kong Legends DVD movie this movie, then the only thing to listen to is the voice of Bey Logan. But in any case, since you have ever had a film of Ninja worth looking. I can't think of one and really do not want. Overall, when it comes to movies, I have one golden rule: Avoid any movie that has the word 'Ninja'.
