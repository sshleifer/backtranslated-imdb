This movie was amazing! (It's not as good as Leif Garrett Longshot) but it's still amazing! I thought Ashley appeared to be very big compared to Mary-Kate in this film. I wonder why. Who woulda thought they could swith such places and almost away from it. Dad was kinda jerk though Mama was a little chummy and Helmit Great. I offer 4. Anyone who likes this movie shoudl see Longshot.
