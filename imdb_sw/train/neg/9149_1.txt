There is absolutely nothing in this film that shows even a little fabric of the talent. No one has ever tried to try before, even the extra in the coffee shop looks like they have been fighting a place. Nothing seems to be displayed.The quality of the film is awesome. Most of the 'action' takes place on narrow roads or cameras that are busy as after discovering, turning the camera back and forth between 'actors' when they present their lines. No three and no sound microphone, there is a sound quality is awesome. Even 'Manos' gets better than this, at least they had enough equipment. What plan is lost only in the production of production. Stick on home videos, preferably with a 5-year-old child trying a video feature on a new camera camera. You will be in a long search to get a no more film than this.
