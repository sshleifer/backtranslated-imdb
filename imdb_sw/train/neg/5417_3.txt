The three British Englishmen rise above the quarrel of Monte Carlo, despite the fact they are under their last franc. To support their good lives, three use fake services, and use information on casinos, hoping to change bogus to jackpot. Andrew Hughes, a US member, comes to Monaco with his wife Helen, and the three decide to make pals and visitors, hoping for financial support. One of the three Russians, Count Sergius Karamzin, has a plan to go further, and go forward to Helen, misleading the Counter, who loves Sergio. Finally, the environment involves three staff members. It is clear that Von Stroheim was trying to convey the message (for the foolishness of American women and improper behavior of the seniors), rather than telling the story, and the film could produce modern viewers, like me, easily to do so. Even acting, which is good in the future EvS like Flower and Wedding in March, is just running the mill here. The film could use improvements at different levels. Testing, 3.
