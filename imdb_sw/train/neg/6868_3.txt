Okay, certainly as an Orthodox woman who lives in Boro Park, I will have a little preference for this film. However, it seemed that the goal of Boin Yakin alone in making this film was Orthodox-bashing. For our vigs, casual clothing, and different sets, we are a very simple goal ready. Yakin did not ever pass on the face. The result is a hollow film than Swiss cheese: 1. Yosi tells Sonia away from loving G-d or their parents. Then they deliberately despise his father's command not to go swimming because of his bad health. 2. Sonia emerges during the burst of her son. Why does the Hasidic woman from Monsey have such answers? It is hard to believe that he did not attend one before. Let's look at, even the Jewish Reformation celebrates the ceremony of today. 3. Was Mendel lying during his classes? He should satisfy his wife's desires in bed and stop kissing on the street. Especially in the middle of the busiest road in Boro Park! 4. Sonia and Mendel had to get married for more than a year, and now they saw that they had no meaning for each other? A little clue - getting married does not mean that a girl needs to take the first woman to her parents. Then he will be left by the community if the marriage does not work. 5. If Sonia really wanted to enter into a flower business that was bad, she didn't need to go through her husband-in-law. There are female Orthodox doctors, lawyers, teachers, etc.. Sonia came as whiny more than mercy. Instead of taking control of his life, he sat and waited for things to happen, then complained that he did not want the results. That didn't stand in a human setting; that happens by discrimination. In fact, I think he got what he deserved.
