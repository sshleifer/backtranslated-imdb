Cannon burned off the real beauty of the epie medieval which looks attractive (except for the dragon player). Now the long-known studio for Chuck Norris has ever had a complete lack of knowledge in the first place? Case for sure: the act of amateurish and a horrible plot is a sign that the revival of the medieval story is not a cure for lousy. In fact they went on and made another cheaper supplier with hundreds of lust, so that we might look better. For two "Brothers Brothers", they will surely know how to make a noisy noise than to be very brave and brave fighters to save their native land. This is the biggest waste of potential that I have seen from the "expensive" film of the lowest budget, and much worse to allow the attack to cut through the poor printout. All this took an advertising campaign that bought T-shirts according to BARBARIANS! The movie alone makes a great souvenir!
