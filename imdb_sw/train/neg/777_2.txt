I can't believe that these things are planted, jingoistic periods are passed to Americans as a tool for art. Earlier, as a result of such lines "we want to make sure they play for the right team" and make a careful design, Love Division shows the real face. The way to lose which Irish Catholics are shown to be hegemonic, Protestants like peace and downtrodden, is as poor representation of history as early western America that show the struggle between cowboys and American Indians. The fact of the story is misled by the discrimination and effectiveness of the Irish Catholic story in the story; The bribes confessed by the filmmakers themselves! It is a pity that people today still think that they can overcome ethical values ​​by making the film easily recognized with open intent, so far and trying art. This movie has no business to be anywhere on any legitimate movie or library.
