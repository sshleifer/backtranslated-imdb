I will bet no one knew that the famous famous winner Hernando Cortes made an initial voting trip to Mexico before taking the Waaztec. Good made because he did not want to know about those T Rex who lived in the same valley where the people respected as gods. It was understood. I was not beaten with blue Ian Ziering as Cortes. Even with red hair known in Beverly Hills 90210 black, Ian seemed to be ignorant. At least he did not attempt a Spanish emphasis. The real Tyrannosaurus Azteca boy is Marco Sanchez also at the end of a television series and a regular role in Walker Texas Ranger as Detective Sandoval of Dallas PD. He finds true love and royalty of Aztec and life will be perfect only if it is not for those historic historic inhabitants of worship. Tyrannosaurus Azteca looks like they used some from the famous Sid & Marty Krofft Country of Lost. All needed is some Sleestak appearance. If you are interested in knowing about this reconciliation journey that did not make history books in all ways see Tyrannosaurus Azteca. Then try and sit through the same face.
