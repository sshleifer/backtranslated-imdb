For the first forty minutes, the Empire has built itself: it seems to be a strong, courageous, and unknown group of gangster. At that time I didn't know why, I thought it was good - but now I'm doing. One of the main problems with this film is that it is unique and quite enough. I don't care about movies and psychology and things, confirming the point- take Jackie Brown, for example - but it's all very bad in this, but it is definitely thrown for entertainment. You feel feeling throat in your stomach. Another big problem is the protagonist. He is tough, arrogant, however - unknown enough - not bad. He doesn't seem to be good enough to be a murderer of a drug-addict. The fact is, at the end of the day, this film is completely engaging. It is not easy, not clever, it is small, and it does not mean - this great concern should be avoided at all costs. <br /> <br /> * out of ***** (1 out of 5)
