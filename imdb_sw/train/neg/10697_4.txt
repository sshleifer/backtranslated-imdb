First of all I thought it was naughty they say in credits that the story and screenplay were Preston Sturges. Sturges was one of Hollywood filmmakers until his talent was lost and he retired. However, not Preston Sturges, was Preston Sturges, Jr. The story was essentially based on the short story of Robert Louis Stevenson "Bottle Imp". A good person gets something bad that will give him anything but that will eventually make him a hell of hell. Its okay. No one said screens were to be original. The audience is generally able to provide good text which they should translate into the screen. My biggest complaint comes with an end. The hero thinks he has found the way of his problem but is trying to solve the problem in some way differently in an attempt to save the innocent person. At first this seems to have worked but it is true for the modern film code of fear, they feel they should give one last gold fear of the film. This is a stupid agreement. The old horror movies got fine and allowed the hero to win out at the end. There is nothing wrong with winning evil no matter what the current crop producers seem to think about. You can give the deaf a healthy and still make them happy at the end. In fact, I think it's good.
