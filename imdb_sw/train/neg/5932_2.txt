What kind of document about the musician fails to enter one song with the artist himself? Unlike "Ray" or many other films about music artists, half of the fun in the theater (or on the bed) is dedicated to the main songs themselves. Here, all songs deal with impressions, and these instructions fail to capture the traditional style of Cohen. Often, the covers were better added to the people. Yuck. <br /> <br /> Interviews are more or more with other musicians and statistics instead of Cohen himself. It was only a rare feature of the film Cohen read his own work (never singing) - like letters, poems, etc.. Movie is not very good about the story of the artist's life, either, or about its development for years. Great desire for a big fan of Cohen.
