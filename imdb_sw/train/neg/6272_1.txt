That is a snippet of good conversation presented by the evil woman, a gun player who is a prominent assistant to his first woman before going to bed with three university students and a home for a change of behavior change. At the same time, on the inner bar, people drink and dance dance rock 80. Punk's biker has sex with a slut of rotation on the pinball table in front of the crowd, then tries to build a daughter of scientist Jessica (Debra Hunter), who likes to other biker (Dale Midkiff, from PET SEMATARY), who, in turn, is in partnership with the assistant! Go back home, panic fears swim, bathe, change clothes and have sex with men from the bar. The small secret of money (the experimental part) comes to the mouths of the victims and turns them into small, killers zombies! If that is not enough to welcome you, there is a song of the hilari theme ("Fantasy fantasy"), skating roller, some heads of daisy heads and a psychic puppet hand (??) Which warns "DANGER! space and proposes to photograph as one of the best ways to take men! <br /> <br /> This refined-in-Florida aggression is so incredible that most comments are proposed to squeeze and internal. And, is not that the Blue Detective of NYPD Blue Jill Kirkendall turned out CNN newscaster Andrea Thompson as one of the nude bimbos bimbo? Certainly it is! In fact this started in 1982 with new photos added later for video release in 1985. <br /> <br /> Score: 1 out of 10 (and I mean that in a good way!)
