This film was the worst film I watched. It was like "homework" for the class of film. Absolutely not a "mark" mark is TRYING to restore. The characters are on the widespread, working poor and as a plot ... well is quite amazing. Shoot the lid is what made me think that it could be a good film, co-actor is good and that's about it. The view of this film: Do not judge MOVIE IN AWAKE! Save your time, money and energy and make your own movie at home and you will be better than I am. It was painful to see and frankly I am surprised that anyone will spend money to make and distribute!
