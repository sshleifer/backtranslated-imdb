From the destruction of Turkey, a mix of anti-Nazi music (!!), before war Americaana and Agatha Christie who have a spoof for one big trouble, great: it's very serious. In addition to IQ one-digit. The plot and talk, the most amazing aspect of "Lady ..." is the inspiration of berserk. Gene Wilder (star and co-author) tries to all: plays a romantic shot (with his look at her and her age! She and Woody Allen should start a club for clueless, big comedians of glass), and tries to be moving with funny poignant and smart, and tries to sing and dance, and succeed in no! Aloong shot from his good old days by Mel Brooks. For some time I thought I had myopia fit, because everyone in the movie continues to say Cherry Jones is this pretty hot chick, and that Michael Cumpsty is this very stallion! The boy who plays with Claire's male secretary is a good actor as a sexy actress and is a passion for two women leading !! On top of Mike Starr acting as a very good, furious player who EVER saw he deserves a reputation among the 10 most offensive films in recent film history. The most tragic explanation is that Claire Bloom and Barbara Sukowa were completely lost. At least I hope that both stars paid their bills at home (and finally expelled their agents) and this flop. Not surprisingly Sukowa, the actress, returned to Germany after seeing what Hollywood was saving for her! <br /> If you want to see how to complete a very bad film from a very rough script to be beaten by the director berserk, learn this one - otherwise stay away !!! - 1/10
