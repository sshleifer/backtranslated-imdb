This is the worst part of the cr4p that I have ever seen in my life. It's very difficult. It was not quite scary (unless the class scared loudly and screaming?) Sarah-Michelle Gellar needs to stop with these awesome films. I think everyone in the movies agreed with me when I shouted "SHITE" when the credit was closed. In my list of the worst movies that have been done this is how it will go. showed some awesome scenes, but others were cr4p completely. Same and the cabin flu, did not know, but return to that list. It's worse than the Hill of Silent and Fever of Cabin put together
