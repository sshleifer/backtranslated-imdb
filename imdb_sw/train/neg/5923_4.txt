During the Civil War, there were many instances of trust; obviously, many came "In Border Borders", where North met with the South for the occurrence of geography. From the border, Father Owen Moore goes to join the Union Army. Soon, the Confederate Henry B. Walthall, who separated himself from his regimen, went to the enemy's property, demanding water; finds a supply where the little girl of the Gladys Egan Union resides. When Yankee's troops follow him, little Gladys helps hide the secrets of Confederate. Later, when she returns to kill her father, the girl's kindness is remembered. Sweet stories, small from D.W. Griffith. The place of photography and humanity is expressed in love. <br /> <br /> **** In Border limits (6/13/10) D.W. Griffith, Henry B. Walthall, Owen Moore, Gladys Egan
