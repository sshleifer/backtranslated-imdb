This film has a feeling of Broadway - background, acting, 'noise' - and it's still all that has. Some 'mean' of Broadway without bang. <br /> <br /> Movie is experiencing slow, image locked, singing 'pops up' up to you so that you can be reminded of suddenly it's music. It is not possible: Sinatra lover - indeed, the pitch and voice of his voice was not necessary. Possible: Mr "I remember the number on my dice" <br /> <br /> Enjoy: sing under the Brando (highly recommended!) <br /> <br /> Surprise: how much Jean Simmons looks like Vivien Leigh in its events in Havana. It's bone structure! How I would have killed that I saw Miss Leigh in the role of Brando challenge again.
