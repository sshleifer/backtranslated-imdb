Implemented by good actors, I expected much more from the "Deceiver" than offered. The program is very well-manufactured and operating. Most publications only add confusion. Honesty comes from the window and the end becomes incredible and infinite. I would like to strongly advise anyone who loves their movie stations to have something that is possible to avoid the "Deceiver" because it will be too busy. Maybe I'm not just hip enough to get, but my doubt is that many others were quite confused with story stories and especially to the end. Break the line between truth and falsehood does not work because the whole movie did not know it. - MERK
