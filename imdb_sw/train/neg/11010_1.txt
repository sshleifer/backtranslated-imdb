This movie is not recommended even one. This was completely lost in time. It was a loss of film and money. It was not hate but everything was provoking and disgusting. My Spoiler is one that I think should be read by everyone. There is a complete evil and disgusting language. But not just, no line of conspiracy, artists are awesome, accent is awesome, artists are limited time and I was EXCITED to watch this film! The only reason I rented was for Brian van Holt (who only got a second second, by the way). I think this may be a mistake for directors and editors but they repeat the same groups two or three times, adding just a new sentence. Films like this is the head of Eraser, maybe an exciting movie available. There is no plot line, and not funny. Although I don't try to be funny. DO NOT SEE MOVIE.
