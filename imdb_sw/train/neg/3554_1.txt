I rented back to 80 years and honestly can not remember anything known about the film - just that is the worst movie I saw. This is not one of those "was very bad, it was funny". This is not one of those "was very good, leaving the bad movies". Wasn't even one of those "what was this?" movies. I can't remember the performance of the actors, but it was not shot, the story had been entered, and it had no known style. When it was over, I was angry that I had lost time. I have seen many movies that I did not understand because of unknown cultures, styles and / or stories, but it was clear that the films had some of these properties. The incubus do not. <br /> <br /> I really did not comment on this "piece" for fear that someone might look out of curiosity, but I am obliged to warn anyone who loves film to skip this movie.
