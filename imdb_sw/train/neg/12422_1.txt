I lost this film to see what could be a blood film, non-stop action and get this very interesting and low-cost budget action-drama which makes Kickboxer look like Die Hard. Lou and Reb are Vietnam and if Lou saves the Reb from the gooks, he is shooting the head for what is the simplest one of the worst effects ever. The Vietnam park is hit on some farms, here! Lou is now brain damaged by Reb and she lives with a bar. Super homoerotic. Lou has fought in the fort for money and Reb continues to kill him by returning. There are no good events to fight completely, the punch is two inches away from the person. The characters are changing in terms of seconds. One boy is bad and in the next area he is good. Acting is bad and music is a great song of Frank Stallone song that makes you sick. I hated this film.
