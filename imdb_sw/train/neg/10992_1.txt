Movie of Underground Comedy, it is unlikely the worst trecks I've ever seen. Luckily I did not pay for this film, and my friend agreed to wait again emphasizing it was bad but he needed to prove how bad it was. I love comedy colors. I thought at least it would have been that and I would be interested. No, instead of acting was very bad, "joke" was very good, and the plot was not there. Maybe there was no plot so I can't hold it against this film. It is very sad when the funniest thing in comedy is an old woman with her head facing bat ..... and Batman ... Someone wearing a baseball uniform with bat. Hilarious. Just simple. I felt the feeling of watching this film that its creators made and laughing hysterically with their friends about it. Maybe this was full of the jokes that we just didn't understand. Or perhaps it is the worst piece of waste ever made and should be closed off by the Arctic Sea. <br /> <br /> P.S. Don't give this film!
