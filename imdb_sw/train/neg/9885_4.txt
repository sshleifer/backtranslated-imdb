He gets only three bills (back to Arthur Treacher & Virginia Field), but this was the first achievement of David Niven's star and he is a pleasant affiliate like PG Wodehouse who had a high head of Bertie Wooster, a master (just name) for Jeeves, which can not be defeated by bonds. If you deal with that situation, it is more than a response to less than 39 STATE than to actually enter the Wodehousian. And that's very bad since the cooperation between Treacher & Niven is not too far from the mark. Alas, B 'movie trophies and compulsory desires increase even for 57 minutes. Next year's observation (STEP LIVELY, JEEVES) was more than a score, without Bertie front and Jeeves (of all people!) They had to play the game.
