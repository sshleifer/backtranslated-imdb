Enjoying madcaps in London looking for treasure hunting, and a young woman builds a political woman married to a strong, independent woman who did not love. Giving an early car to Katharine Hepburn, playing Amelia Earhart-like aviatrix who is very involved in giving to anyone. Director (Dorothy Arzner) and the scribe (Zoe Akins, who changed the book of Gilbert Frankau) were definitely given this project to get a female perspective, but why are all old clich√©s reserved as preserved residues? Billie Burke has a kind of mixing, a woman who lays her bed when something is wrong, and the last Hepburn area is another gun. Wonderful art, but not unusual for Kate observers. ** from ****
