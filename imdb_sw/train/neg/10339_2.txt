Mike Hammer lived - inside a house with GAGF BAG bounced around the corner of a big cathode ray tube television with a snazzy fireplace? Nah, he would knock back the rye bottle with twenty cameras unfiltered on the bed or floor of his jumping-specked office or in the fear of lousy in the middle of the flop house, wiping the dry red zone with oil smeared mud off his face, so it is. Spillane wrote trash paper, in fact, but how do you get worse? Providing a desperate producer without looking for because he thinks any film's Noir film will work on the box office, add more hot tomatoes and just usually erase the story line by delay, the external screens, the same how!
