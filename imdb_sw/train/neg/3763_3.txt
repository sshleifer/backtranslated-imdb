The forestry group and scientists come into the trees to get fossils. A few punctuate. I used to think that there could only be a good movie of Bigfoot to be made. But now after many sad sad movies about the story, I have many doubts. In order to shed the salt in the wound of this film, a very beautiful girl can not get naked immediately. And when this one MAY be better than "Boggy Creek 2" (no meaning and there), it's still sad that the best non-memory film on Bigfoot still "Harry and Henriksons" <br /> <br /> My Grade: D
