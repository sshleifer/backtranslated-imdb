My partner and I went to see this film as "First Surprise" that was purchased on a preview ticket to the movie before it was opened here in Denmark. We stayed an hour or more and then left! The movie model was seen to show only time (with 54 clubs), but it did it during the development of the character, which did not, and the plot that had little. I've always been different from characters in the film! <br /> <br /> Music was good. So if you would like to hear a good music and get a revision of the mood 70ies I think it's the same. But do not wait to find a trusted group. <br /> <br />
