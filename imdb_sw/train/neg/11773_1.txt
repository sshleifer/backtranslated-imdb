I have come for several years to focus on these boards due to a lack of intellectual sensitivity through the views that are often seen in the IMDb position of this film. I saw this film with the splendor of the new subway cinema of the subway cinema movie (which had a good choice of movies this year, see important, June, NO's AJI, livelihood style) and have regretted every day being a scene The movie itself separates itself from the back of my mind, and becomes a clear memory. I am sure you can read a summary of the laudatory film on the Cinema of Subway, which is why I made the mistake of inciting my friend to the film. The information created a kind of horrible film that I desired for some time, one that depends on terrorism rather than cheaper parts. P was really different. It depends on cheaper laughter. A very awesome advertiser described this film as "Lesbians team to fight monsters." Quite completely. There is a subplot built in this film to make it look like a relationship between a girl and Pookie is actually going somewhere. More lies. This movie looks like a short release to "You are afraid of darkness?" The story is ridiculous, and it only succeeded in attracting laughter and confusion from viewers after finally stopping their attempt to see this film with any weight condition and try to forget about 9 dollars that lost the door. I almost want to paul spurrier was in the audience that I might laugh and ask him why he lost 5 years in Thailand to make a horrible horror-cum-porn porn that is located at the spice center, which succeeded only to get the recipients removed by his family, resulting in little inspiration at the Belgian Film Festival. Give only that this was caused by gurgle in the lower abdomen if it could not isolate itself from sh * te which it is. However, I hope that I can deceive anyone by making a big mistake of seeing this film, in fact it was one of my greatest experiences of the third film, hit the soul for the number 2.
