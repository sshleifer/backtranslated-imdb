Yes, it is not true. It's not really a good movie, but it's not as bad as I thought it would be. I don't really feel the abolition of my rental money, and sometimes that's how you can pray. The plan is the same, no brilliant or new, acting is very bad, but cast is good. Redirecting can be approved, but the effects are terrible, especially the effects of waswolf, which in the movie waswolf, is a very serious problem. There was a decent amount of weakness, which to me is a very good thing, but not all it wanted. For all, it is the average average video film, not the worst movie that I have ever seen and if you're tired of a kind of fan, see sometimes. I'd like to look at it again. The truth of the bonus for geeks of fear, Kane Hodder (Jason Vorhees in a few of them) plays waswolf.
