I gave this film 2 stars just because Dominic Monaghan put forth an effort through his acting. Everything else about this film is very amateur. Everything that was associated with the direction of this film was very unsuccessful. Not only should the director think about what he does for the work of life but perhaps he should watch a small film. If Dominic Monaghan is a very reliable actor, taking him to this film of this caliber makes him look bad. Anyone who "actor" was the best friend of Jack should not enter the front of the camera. I did not expect too much from this small film, but maybe a little time and effort should be put into the characters and their environment. Don't waste your time or your money on this film (like I did) you will be very disappointed.
