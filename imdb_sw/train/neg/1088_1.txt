I have often witnessed the destruction of such talents. There is virtually nothing good about this valley with no hope of film. What a few interesting films are seen as the initial promise seems to be a little more than a red mouse. Anime stature - Robert Duvall, Robert Downey, Jr. - used in roles that are not anywhere; The director of the constant thinking provides a film that looks like amazed by the lens of a refined coffee camera; The author (John Grisham) who has never produced anything of value, finds a deep depth of lack of inspiration. The film has a cheap, improper feeling - but difficult at the definition level - its true part of beauty. Typically, I come to IMDb to write an equality opinion, generally appreciative. This terrible tragedy of films makes me want to produce an endless shelf of bills. I can't, but because I don't need to take another "my mind" with this garbage.
