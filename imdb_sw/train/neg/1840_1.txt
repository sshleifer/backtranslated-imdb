This must be the most brutal comedy that I have ever seen in my life. Ben Stiller, Jack Black, and Christopher Walken if a homeless person is homeless can not make me laugh? Something should be wrong with this picture. This is the only movie I ever felt like walking. I used the free passes, and I still heard if I wanted my money to return. I can say with all my heart that the only movie I ever saw more than this was the HOUSE. Ya. TU. The worst. movie. I laughed very little at the fun-going area, and so. Using 2 hours in something given as a comedy should get you more than one laughter, right? I don't know, I think the film vendors thought that "flan" was an amazing word, or something. And another wound strikes a dead horse - in fact.
