This movie is bad. If you think about that look, there is only one place of respect in the film, and it is about 5 seconds (the top of Amanda Carraway). Some of the films are awesome. I think high school has probably done better. The plan is of no value. Seti was very good, and was not even good to laugh. It was lighter and worse! I watched this on Starz so I thought it was at least good. The mini details seem like it would be the same. The girl commits suicide for no reason at the start of the movie, after watching a terrible music video. Changes between events are sudden and it is like someone who tries to tile clips on the film without even thinking about how to change them. Only reduced from one area to another, there is no gentleness. Such kind of changing me random from talking about how the movie is bad, explaining why the plot takes. The voice gets low for some points, where you can hear it, and then scream to the “blow of panic” that was cured at random stations on the film. It's the same sound every time. That is now the worst movie I saw. / It It takes: 0/10: 1/10 Stories: 0/10 Music: 3/10 />: 1,000,000 / 10
