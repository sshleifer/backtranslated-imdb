I have almost tried in CHEESE to watch this film. In fact I couldn't even finish. I want my money to return. One more of Hollywood's attempts to come up with a new idea. Good good I put a bowl of lemons in the fridge. Just in case. They should give Nic Cage hat and a cow whip. Swashbucklin '. Performance of Cage in Caring Arizona or Leaving Las Vegas hits this "lemon". People who are completely sold and sold (and most of them are) must love this movie. If this film has been alive, I would like to call it more heavily. I would like to be paid to see a totally stupid film that doesn't try to hide. In my opinion, this was an incredible movie and has made the most difficult attempt to try and hide the FACT. <br /> <br /> EVERY time they seem to love.
