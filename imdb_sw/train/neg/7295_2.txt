First, because I fear this film 2 star instead of 1 is because at least Peter Falk gave its normal performance as Lieutenant Columbo. He alone can get 10 stars to try to save any other worthless attempt in making the film. I started to erase all when reading the comments of one producer Andrew Stevens in this film gave "his performance." suppress all kinds of insults with someone who made previous comments. Then I wondered, what else did Steven do? So I looked and, you know, that man was exactly right. Over the past 17 years since this Columbo movie was made, it seems that each of the 33 projects that Stevens has been since then has spread, so it is doubtful that anyone has seen all his work. <br /> <br>> If you like Columbo, check out all 69 names before this look. Make yourself a worse and worse storage at the end.
