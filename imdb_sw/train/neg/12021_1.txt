That may be very difficult for me to say this, but sadly so far in his leading career is true. Just look what he did so far. They should not pass the star mark 3. <br /> <br /> Why did I watch this film? Two reasons. Lucy Lawless and Heroes stars Greg Grunberg. Lucy was the best in this film, its performance carries the entire movie. I hope she gets a "blockbuster" and breaks into a great league of actors, she has a clear skill. Greg was not surprising, typical of the acting acting TV. <br /> <br /> The movie is unusual for the community as fear. The only “fear” is short, and it lasts for 2-5 seconds and a little blood in them. I will personally call you "drama / thriller". But no matter how interesting stories are true, conversion, editing and acting (bad from Lucy) damages. You don't have any connection with executives, something that is very important in this story. You just sit there looking at any feeling. It's like watching bad soap for TV .... actually I think the TV soap will be more interesting. <br /> <br /> I advise you: Stay away from this film ... or better still just avoid anything Michael Wrath is associated with.
