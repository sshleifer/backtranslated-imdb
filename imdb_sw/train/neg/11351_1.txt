For MASSIVE ads this gets Nickelodeon by Nick Jr. and that ilk, my son was asking us to see. Among the DVDs and movies, I have seen everything very good now from the best (Incredibles, Shrek) for the worst (Wall-E, Brother Bear). But this was the worst films I ever seen, children or children. Was it "when this stupid thing will cease?" type of experience? Well, it has a goal for infants (or better it is - it's against anyone's mind more than 3), but I've never seen anything that is predictable, repeat, and going on. Then once you are turned on but you have been removed that movie is over, there is nothing to end that you think is set up to joke, but no one - it's bad, though it's hard to say what they're trying to accomplish. 3-D effects ... yes, if you have never seen their viewer is a great deal, otherwise no (if you look at the screen without glasses, it appears to be the same process). Even my son was tired and end. Both my wife and I looked at each other and said "wow" last. Steer in every respect.
