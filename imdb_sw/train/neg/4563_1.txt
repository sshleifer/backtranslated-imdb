This film is likely to be cheaper, more humble, and the poorest made. However, it is a funniest and idiotic movie beyond Disney, and it will make sure it laughs on folklore stories and stadiums from start to finish. It is a group of short stories that look like bad surveillance. > ER * O O O kwanza kwanza kwanza kwanza kwanza kwanza kwanza kwanza kwanza kwanza kwanza kwanza All the first about Garden and Belle are limited on the pathetic move. Then, three lost characters decide to focus on creating a letter of forgiveness to give Belle. Part of the section through this small section, Belle has the eyes of the wall, which made my brothers and I laughed hard. Then, he and the animal fight more than the letter ... and later learn the meaning of forgiveness. How old are they? Surely it is old enough to know the meaning of forgiveness. <br /> <br /> Then, the second of all about Lumiere is a great dope of the world when it comes to romance. This comes from a person who could have any female. And they make FiFi the psychological eligibility that tries to kill Belle, and sends it away from the end without end. It's a message to send children! <br /> <br /> Then, next is about Mrs Potts to be angsty. And next after all this about the Beast is the most powerful aircraft, up to where he just looks just silly. <br /> <br /> Animation is very bad, kills. There are at least 100 errors you can see clearly ... and color is bad. Belle is a sample of simpering who blubbers everything going wrong. Also, she is younger and quite different from the normal Belle. And the side parties are sad ... (I mean, Cogsworth's battle with Lumiere almost every time. I know they did it in the film, but it was overthrown in this.) <br /> <br /> But the worst behavior is Mrs Potts. He is destroyed in this. I can't even describe it. Just sign in and see for yourself. <br /> <br /> I offer 1/10 for sams, but I offer 10/10 for comedy.
