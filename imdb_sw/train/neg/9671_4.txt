I would like to give you 6 or 7 films on this propaganda film because it shows the time and how the propaganda film works. If there are people who look at this piece and think that “the Jews would have to do something to be treated as WW2 treated”, then the film has been made with a trick to hide 'why' and 'how to also combine the right with a false investigation on how people they live. What's more of the propaganda film intends? The part of the American movie about the Rothschild family is included with the courage to use here, for example. The question why a Jew takes his possessions away from an officer is never asked. No one describes the tax system within that social type. Besides, the level of excitement (or, the level of hate) in the movie increases slowly and the end of the target suits of the target film and propaganda. The audience will be happy and grateful for the times that come ... well. <br /> <br /> In the movie, there is a kind of simplicity that looks at the basic emotional views of the audience. The movie is a kind of history today, so there is no need to discuss a lot about it. However, with this simple expression of ethnic destruction, a wise observer can find the importance of today's cultural hatred, violence, civilization and collaboration problems. In general, good rubbish.
