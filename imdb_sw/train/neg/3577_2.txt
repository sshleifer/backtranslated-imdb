The original method of Zadora also followed the usual form of Harold Robbins: the main character of pride allows for the destruction of the way to find a way to some of the chosen but interesting, in the case of the film industry. But in spite of being so formulaic to be quite predictable, this film will be able to simultaneously be impossible. Zadora (calling an inexperienced as an actor is being a helper) never convinces you as a screenwriter. One can expect a film about making movies to have some insight into its industry and creative process. But the script does not give him any attribute that makes the authors interesting movie characters: celebrations, skills and words, love-hate relationships and creative abilities to himself. Her character is empty as a hole of donut. And this is just a hint of not able to show here. The movie shows that it is very difficult to see that it is sometimes hard to see what happens. And the events did not exist together, so everything looks like a bad timing of bad parties in Hollywood. Avoid.
