First of all, open the script on the fabric. Who needs more than that? After all we can't be a Hollywood film. <br /> <br /> Get amateur actors. It will be good for the festival festival. After all, who needs people who have spent years respecting their trick? Then, a movie consultant who does not know how to shine. You see, if it's good, it won't look "real" and the celebrity people didn't like it. Who needs to have a picture of a professional level however? Then know the ten-year-old who has never made a camera to be your operator. It will give you your movie that is so interesting that observers of the festival will make a mistake to "truth" and assure you that even if you remove the seats from real people, critics and a little more intelligent audience will explain "thinking" because they will not believe this was just a perfect amateur. Once you do that, buy your ticket at the Bad Movies Movies Festival. <br /> <br /> What a sad waste.
