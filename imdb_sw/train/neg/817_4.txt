"You can't beat these small creatures. For the first time, they didn't use any harm. In the second place, they may have radioactive." Ah, happy no budget 50s sci-fi? However despite such an unusual gem, Superman and Mole-Men are pretty uninspiring to go even with lean 58 minutes while running. It's more affordable (one shot of Superman jump is an incredibly inept few frames of animation) and pretty light with it, though it has an amazing altruistic message ?? Male Mole-Men, the slower and more aggressive and worn-out clothes that appear more like Mr Mxyzptlk without hats than foreign critics, released from their groundwater to extract oil is not harmful, not recognized, by George Reeves' Steel tries to prevent the village of a small town led by Jeff Corey to kill them. The interesting Counterpoint of the paranoia of the day, perhaps, but for a little more than good intentions to recommend.
