Does this film welcome! Worst horror, bad script, terrible effects, terrible terrible awesome! There is nothing liberating here even so many fans are not too scared! The killer hits students in college. People show that they have died in the hallway, but still, the class continues as usual? After about the fourth body, I would think that they can allow students a few days to break! LOL. This about the bad as it gets people. This film should be displayed as a means of suffering for criminals. You have been warned!
