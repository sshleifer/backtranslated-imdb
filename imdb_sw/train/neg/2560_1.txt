Well, I watched this last night and one thing that didn't make it so bad that it was straight ahead. There was no stroke near the bush that this child was the Antichrist. However the movie was written badly. For example, they did not tell how they did the dentist's event as "Accident" or at the end how the fighters had finished with a miracle at home when saving the child without police even called yet. Death events were very serious and not even entertainment. The child they chose to play Anti-Christ was very fond of and could really take a good child. Just don't waste your time watching this.
