To describe these reviews, I must say that I was, I think, I had a little feeling about this film. <br /> My view, this movie shows how one can mislead. With my eyes, the worst thing about this Springer thing is not the same kind of people in "Jerry Springer Show" as they do (which is a very easy defeat), but that many people are very curious and are happy to watch and hear about their lives ( yes, I think it's with me .. at any rate it is true). If it does not promote such behavior (as some people may say) at least we can damage our minds and / or isolate ourselves from this kind of behavior. <br /> <br /> But enough soap box (type). Here's the skin: the movie has R rating, and when it can only be worthy (I look far away from scenes, so I am not quite sure), I see that NC-17 (tip tip for another reviewer) can be more appropriate for major gender content (The concerns of concern that the movie's view was just a great reason to show sex on the big screen). The program is very strange, uniting family history of the less active and the darker group of blacks that will appear on different Springer periods. Finally, the movie catches one with a solution-and springer rhetoric about the need to see the real world (looks like shown through his show). I agree with him there - it's important to know how the world really is so that we can look for a better change. After saying this, I would just like to tell you - a very bad view of the world in a news magazine or news to see it, but let's not put a good money in order to support the type of a weak and inexpensive trick.
