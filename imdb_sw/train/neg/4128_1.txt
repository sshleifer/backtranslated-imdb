This movie is one of the worst I've ever seen. It's not just a bad conversation, it can't end. You will think it is the end, but not. How long, 140, 160 minutes? I don't even know. I know that I will never look at it again. It was like someone took a romantic comedy, took a comedy, then decided to discourage the romance, leaving us with a bunch of crap that managed to make its way screen. But don't take my word for it, learn yourself how this movie is awesome.
