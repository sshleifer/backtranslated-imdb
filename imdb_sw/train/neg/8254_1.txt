I have seen the best quality of production on YouTube! I have compassion for the executives, for the scriptures were awesome and shock shock, without any doubt how they can get the lines out - I am quite sure any actor could save this film no matter how good. The characters were not developed at all, and there was no real cooperation in the program that seemed only to go anywhere. It's a real embarrassment, as the basis of the film was good and the best quality of production, leadership and script could be a good movie. In fact he was not comedy, unless you laugh at the sound in dubbing - which was amateurish, even English actors seemed weird.
