We entered this film because my husband had enjoyed the original version of my 'Martian famous'. We had our 6-year-old daughter and us. He wanted to leave half through a movie that was good with all his parents! The elements we saw were just a few of the most interesting, very large or very bad. I would expect that this film can appeal to children between 9-12, if it is. It is obviously inappropriate for young children. From what I had in the previous series was greater and if you were going to "learn the past" perhaps you'd be disappointed.
