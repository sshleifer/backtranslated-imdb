It is not worth a video rental or time or regular effort. <br /> <br /> * Makeup that a child can do. * Working was on done ... poor lead. * The editorial was very busy ... many things did not know or seemed to be free. * The voice was mentioned very much. * Music was not very good. * Run was too far ... must be on the crack. * Zombies that talk about themselves ... car, dance, work ... just make me. * And the bad man ... Crap Holy! As very frightening as she was ... was the best zombie looking all. Which does not say much. The File Cover was good but very cheat ... as it was the main menu of DVD ... a good art and music. DON "TON!
