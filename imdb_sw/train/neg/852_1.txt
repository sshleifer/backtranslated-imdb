I'm going to keep this short time. This "preference" of the King's remarkable book is a bad joke and no more. In fact there are many fans of Kubrick and Nickolson on this site and, for this reason, this film has found its way in secret in over 250. Jack Nicholson is delicious like Torrance and is also Shelley Duvall. Myth, which has no connection with the book, is an odd mess with the characters of Jack and Wendy Torrance is a perfect joke. I advise anyone who has not read the book and wants to understand the characters of this story: stick to the TV series .... <br /> <br /> Oh, and people who say that Kubrick was and the right to destroy the King's story because the King is ... not a good writer should focus on "art works" as "eyes of closing".
