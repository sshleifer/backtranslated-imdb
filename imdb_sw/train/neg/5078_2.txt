If 1977 "Exorcist II: The Heretic" is not kind, it is hard to imagine what is so well-known by Richard Burton in these non-exciting exercises. You have seen all of this before: Burton writes a writer who discovered during the age he has the ability to move things that are not strong for his mind (and you thought "Carrie" had no effect on Hollywood!). Although it was taken from the novel by Peter Van Greenaway, "Medusa" plays as a recycled product, although the special effects in the church's finale are strong (if it is normal). Lee Remick is obviously a doctor, but otherwise the help used is very weak. Burton is a hammy but tired ... even even telekinesis can save him at this point. * 1/2 from ****
