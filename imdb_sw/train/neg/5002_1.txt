How has this awesome script attracted this cast? Fraud, predictable and unpredictable, this has been well taken and well-directed, but the material is still bad as it is one of the worst of all the time that I have seen in the years. Surprisingly bad, and not a fun way. Avoid at all costs, even if you are a fan of the beaten person.
