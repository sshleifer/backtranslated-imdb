Only this PPV'd. I don't want to waste a lot of time on this as many posters here put it better than I could, but I wanted to say a few things. <br /> <br /> I did not know what was funnier: Redgrave chasing a small moth and tripping over its nurse; Right to the voice that his boy "worth" (whom he and Mr. decided that he had rejected alcoholism) has turned into a road; that Ann-deaf drops schmoozed by Peggy Lee; or the sad CGI of Crypt Keeper Annie expecting himself a little! <br /> <br /> I have never bought a dad like Redgrave a little. I couldn't buy Richardson and Collette as a sister, either. If Meryl Streep's daughter wants to be an actor, she should tell Mama to give her a few lessons! I had no idea why a girl (or Buddy) would make fools themselves on the raid of the Harris! Ann's daughters are as white and worried as she is, Luc is a long-term slacker on the crack, and I don't give a rot on any of them! The evening provides Chick Flicks bad name!
