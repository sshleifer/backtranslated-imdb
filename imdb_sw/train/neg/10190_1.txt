After watching this in MST3K, I wonder how many films this film gives. It seems to combine the features of Logans Run, Farenheight 451, Final Offer and at least several others. At one time I was expecting Cpe Makepease to call Lee Majors ROWSDOWER. I wonder if the director has any clue that many holes have been on the field. as the fact that, although the gas is not available, there is a lot in the gas stations, and the nearest nearby stations to keep the F1 car going around the country.
