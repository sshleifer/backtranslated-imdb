As the first child phase ("The Little Mermaid") was my favorite movie. It was filled with characters, songs, and a happy family film. One week or more I watched this film for the first time. I believe that this film was like many columns and did not exceed their original nature. I think I feel this way as possible because I had great expectations and I grew up. However, it is not a bad film. It starts when Ariel is born just a beautiful baby, Melody. Eric and Ariel feel threatened by Morgana (the sister of Eurselas), so they build a big wall near their house above the sea. As Melody grows up he begins to wonder about the walls where he is forbidden to go. The problem grows as Morgana tries to control the seven aquatic. I don't want to give off any film so you should see it to find out. I liked that the sound was the same and no longer singing it. I think this is a good family film though in general!
