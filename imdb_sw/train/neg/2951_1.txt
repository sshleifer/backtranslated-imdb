Don't see this film if you appreciate your mind. At the end of our collective view, my friends and I are estimated that each of us lost 5% of our mind during the course. The only person involved in his decisions that was not a clinical victim was the manufacturer. Many movies leave a bad taste in your mouth. Now I realize that instead of a sense of apostasy, this movie has created a great hatred in me. I love this film very, very much. Others might say that this film was not intended to be taken seriously. If not only did it not focus on itself. But it does. The program is a high temperature of the World's Blade Runner-esque version that was hit by cheap rubber suits that spread to the bad dinosaur films. Discussions are not only powerful and useless but often cause pain. Whoopee Goldberg does not even try, but George Newbern as the voice of Theodore Rex is like toes on the soul. And as Juliet Landua reiterated with the brilliance of Britain or Richard Roundtree (aka Shaft) as the sleep commissioner, he looks into a growing state of conflict and frustration. I recommend this movie only to anyone who wants to see the depth of folly that men can fall.
