In fact, on the endless effort of fear, we will come to this film, it seems to be released again on the DVD soon because of the non-God. Transfers are bad and quality only follows. I don't think this is due to bad remaster or anything, I just think the film is not done. It seems to be locked in a school leaving a budget that was undoubtedly lost on cheap beer and hack hacks. First, we see 'nerd' as he picked up with a group of ... I really don't even know what they were supposed to be ... jocks? The sender, with his sharp hooknose is very bad he should be definitely thrown as a nerd. Then, there is a 'big man' with dumb and dumb ones who should be 'hot' but they don't. It is a mystery why this group of rejection takes one of their own, but I think the viewer is assuming these are 'good kids' picking on dweeb. The choice of making is bad if most of the secondary schools are played by thirty-somethings. If other critics here have described, executives (if you can call them,) are a group of Brits whose permissions are inserted frequently in this section. We are left to think that this group of 'children' is the only students in this school, as their 'reunion' is the only school, which has now been abandoned, is just. <br /> <br /> You kill it crippled, gore not great and script is like Scooby Doo and real people; The lines like: 'This position gives me creeps ...' and 'Another person gimme beer' is important ... It's not just good. Skip this one unless you get lost with other friends and want to laugh on a blunt attempt on the slasher. If you want to see good, get the Bay of Bava Blood, which was 14 years earlier and better. If you want to see a good BAD player, see "Before Before Day" or "Burning." 2 out of 10, children.
