Rodney Dangerfield is not the main character of this movie. He is hard in it. Most screenshots are guided by unwanted jokes. One of the driving gag is that character is called Jerk Off. There is also a lot of joke erection, where the punch line is someone with erection. This film is just like the British brilliant Kirstie Ally. <br /> <br /> This movie started as a motion of a weak action: five minutes of story back and then bam! Unfunny joke. But, apart from awesome text, movies are also well-directed and acting is awesome. Also, this film makes an old picture of the bad comedy by having lots of B-artists known. Harland Williams, Gilbert Godfried, Randy Quaid, and Phil La Mar. These are just some of the people who spend more time on the screen than Rodney, though they are considered as the main character. Do not be surprised to find this movie on the drug store sells five bucks. However it is too many.
