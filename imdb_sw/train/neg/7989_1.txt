I had the following great expectations "Laundrette My Good", "Dial as Beckham" and (below) "East is East". The history of the British Muslims in their approved home has had a very good performance on the big screen, with the best television and radio series (Beauty honors me, etc.). This falls down. Confirmation of a good start quickly climbed a hill. Finally, this was a bad attempt on the BBC, full of regional brightness, whacky over-acting characters, "those were the day" sound, and "many issues" in an attempt to be worthy. I found myself scoring many points during this film. Writing is predictable. Each possible cliche was thrown out and displayed. In fact, I have trouble thinking of other cross-cultural / genetic material that can be used which were not. The characters were thin and stood: a non-conformist minister; good but still an old woman; more weight, aunt; Indian parents of pushy; neighborhood class; 'wise' bride; a motorcycle running a pig. The script was weak, and every chance to shock the audience with more racist conversations from two colored colored characters. And why it had to be put in 70 years (except for excuse in the 70th voice) is a secret. It is possible to make unreliable characters a little honest for people born after 1979. I don't know. Even these things aside, a good actor would make this a decent attention. Instead, the usual "BBC faces" suspects were beaten wheels. "Bend as Beckham" had a better job of comic (and a strict job, in fact) than this, and throw it unknown. <br /> <br /> In summary, the script triggered lazy, on the act, a predictable story. Do it. <br /> <br />
