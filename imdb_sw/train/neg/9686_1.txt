Author / Director Peter Greenaway puts his head as Head of the House of Art Design and his latest exercise in self-sufficiency, 8 ½ Women. The film follows English and its wealthy son for their sexual efforts, because they attract and involve women (I think how many) to join their elite. Think about any possible way that this premise can be bad, and the space is Greenaway has done. Female characters are a little more than a list of fetishes for two participants involved. There is Mio who has been engaged with Kabuki, Giaconda emerging with Beryl, who has something for farm animals. Giulietta does not have legs and uses a wheel, he is a "woman half," to find it? Greenaway completely refuses all the misogyny charges, but if this is not, then what? The film continues to strengthen everything and everything related to Japan, the promotion of the theme from its snakes - (but less sex) 1996 film, Pillow Book. But where the Pillow Book was good and grace, 8 ½ women get horny and effective. Greenaway's work is not good and is proud in its fetus, and the only person who can enjoy it is the author himself.
