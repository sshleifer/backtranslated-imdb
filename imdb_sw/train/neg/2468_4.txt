This is not a big thing. It is not horrible or hateful or anything, forgot. It was kind of, um, reluctant, reduced air, if it didn't know exactly if it was going to be going to laugh or for sweetness or for satire. So we were left with a weak mix of three. Workers seemed lost. Also, thoughts were very tired and modified, almost emerged. How many times should we be told 50 years in countries infected with a sense of ban? And that this was developed by misuse? And the lack of emotion in men is a matter of bars? An old hat. His greatest crime in my eyes was how it was prevented from reality. I know it was comedy and all, but - especially in a full movie where you should put the interest of the audience for a long period of time - you still need some kind of anchor anchor, another relatable guide through the story, to make a collaboration. For a child 'hero' to look at an old woman, two school students and eventually his father dies to the pain of zombies or anything and for him to greet them all with a festive smile and a combination of shoulders, then I just try to deal with it in any form of A good way. That mother was right. If you make your two main characters a human being at that level, then you become a risk of losing me and that's what happened. The most beautiful thing I can give is that I like to look for that kind of suburbia pie and this apple was well done, it was a very good film, especially some broad street shots and inside the house of Robinsons. Also, the opening news was good, in a way that was made-before-yet-funny. And I thought Billy Connolly was the same as that comes from someone who is not a big fan of Billy Connolly: Star Star. I just had this fear he would be changing it and trying to steal every area, but he played with him in a very low way and probably withdrew the tender attitude throughout the film. All in all, not great.
