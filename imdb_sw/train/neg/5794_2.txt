All the Germans stand open and hit by a machine gun. They do not die at all, except for great purposes. "plot" has many interesting holes. (Where did the German soldiers go when they had finished the fuel tank on the train? Erik Estrada? Please!) With the whole idea, run the train? How values ​​are that! Germans KNOW know where you are going, not like you can leave the song and move! What is it. I would like my own bonk on the head with a hammer hammer 10 times you must sit in the same way again. I mean, for weight, it is FELT as it was done in 60 years, but it was released for 88 !! 1988 !! A team is more realistic than this bad excuse. Just check if you need a good laugh. This movie is Tele Sevalas what Green Beret was to John Wayne.
