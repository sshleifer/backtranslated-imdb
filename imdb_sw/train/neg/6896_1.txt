Unfortunately IMDb does not allow me to measure Judges under 1. It is embarrassing. This ghastly film is so bad that I really wiped something damaged before it was finished. The script had a very short time, but the leadership, editing, drama, sound quality, and timely delivery of the line was as simple as making the judges without authority. <br /> <br /> The judges were declaring as a modern day of comic style style west, but in fact it did not sort of kind. What is very similar is the wolf under your shoe. You can try to pretend to be the same, but it still continues to smell. Why the video stores think it is right to carry this trick and the occasional shortcomings in sound and worse than the class of high school drama acting school is more than me. We rent movies to see something better than what is on television. But Judges are worse than SciFi Channel's original concern. I am interested in returning my money from Hollywood Video.
