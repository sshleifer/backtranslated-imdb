After the great achievement of Amenabar and Balaguero, Spanish Horror movies spread as a disease in an increasingly sad world of horror movies. All the results are in the film as El segundo number, the production of TV as bad is written, but made and redirects the worst. I have not read Ramsey Campbell's book, but I am sure that the author of The Doll who Ate His mother had no amount to this terrible production. Avoid at any cost, unless you are looking for a sleepy night sleep in the new movie hall. 2/10
