It was a while ago, that I saw Sleuth (1972) and two chief executive Michael Caine and Laurence Olivier. Michael Caine is back, but now is husband and Judah Law lover of his wife. Story is still the same and it is a wonderful game. At the time of the film I had the feeling of watching a play. That's one of the reasons I don't like this remake of this classic. When I watch the movie adapted to play I still must feel to see the movie and not just play. Director Kenneth Brannigan made amazing movies in the past, but this time he missed. Another reason was looking for a film. The layout was modern, stylish, uncomfortable and cool. I have never heard that anyone has ever lived in that house. Photography was not bad, but the light was sharp. Sometimes there was light blue, dark, green light, around it not friendly to the eyes. It was very good. Michael Caine and Judah Law does a good job. I would like to see these 2 children playing together on stage. But I must admit that I was not a fan of Judah Law. The weakest part was the middle part. I remember that in nature that this part was still very strange and dominant simply. I tried to look at it twice and always in the middle part I felt sleeping. The last part is the best and most interesting. Sleuth (2007) is not bad, but it seems to be more films for critics than for the audience. Sleuth (1972) is still more entertaining and entertaining than Sleuth (2007).
