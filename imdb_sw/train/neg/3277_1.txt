If you have ever seen the Dukes of Dangerous you know that you have never been concerned about drugs or agreeing or behaving badly to be seen by young children. If you see a movie you know is no longer good! This movie was HORRIBLE! The main actors who do drugs and think are funny and cool are certainly not what I call entertainment. They took a wonderful show and just turned it into garbage. Daisy who was a little player in the original show now looks and does as she has on the road to paid for her services. I was so happy to see this film before I left, 15 minutes on the movie I had left to leave. I thought I had to get better but instead it got worse for a minute. I would never have seen this film. It followed a good show and I left nothing but a bad taste in my mouth when I left. Make yourself a permit, go see what is worth your money, because it's not just losing money but losing two hours of your life will never come back!
