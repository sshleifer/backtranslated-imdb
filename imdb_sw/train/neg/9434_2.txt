It was prevented as 'Video Notes' in the UK, Unhinged has found a small amount of recognition. However, the most horrible thing I found about the film was the amateur in all departments. The blood disorder that I could handle: the worst acting, good editing, good direction, the lousy script and the sound of an unusual sound was very difficult to take. Three girls on a music trip fall on the rock during the storm. They are saved by a friendly stranger who takes them to a nearby house. The owner of the house, a woman of many years, and her daughter spinster, invite girls into, and enable them to stay for a few days to return. However, one does not want girls to leave? forever! Directly become victims of an invisible defendant. It takes a long time to go and point out some of the worst performances on a horrible film (and that takes some action), Unhinged is actually a bad film. Music is a general aggression (it looks like a three-year-old has been opened on the synthesizer) and like that, tightening the movie completely. It's just bloody epidemics to end up with a bit of free weaknesses without saving Unhinged from getting the lowest possible score. <br /> <br /> If you are perfect perfect (and unfortunately, I am), you will need to see this to remove it from the video surveillance list. But warn? It's true, it's very bad.
