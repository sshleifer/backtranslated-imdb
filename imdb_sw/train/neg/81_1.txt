Life did it again. Can we say it is stupid? I couldn't wait to stop. The plan was useless. Acting was bad! Especially with young people. The story has been played a thousand times! Do we just want to give operators work? The review was interesting and I was looking for a good thriller. Unless a person does not have anything to do to avoid this at all costs. This was a waste of two hours of my life. Can I stop them? I would like to stretch my face against the brick wall for two hours and then put it on the peroxide. That would be more entertaining.
