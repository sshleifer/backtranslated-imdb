May (Anne Reid) and Toots (Peter Vaughan) give a regular visit to their son Bobby (Steven Mackintosh) and his family in London. Even when visits start, Toots have a heart attack attack, leaving May be sure, and questioning his life and future. Finding himself to impress the partner of his daughter Darren (Daniel Craig), her actions are caused by the inevitable consequences. It is done in beauty, but with all its origin and manifestation, the mother provides a collection of unhappy, even filled characters, and asks the viewer to share with them. Reid shines as May, and it is his skill and dedication as the best actors who show the film from the very muddy mud, but Michell and Kureishi have allowed Craig, Mackintosh and Cathryn Bradshaw to create all the non-emotional characters, that are difficult to keep up in May . As it is written, the characters who played with Mackintosh and Bradshaw are actually so selfish and cold-hearted that someone begins to ask themselves what is actually trying to say. As directed, they do not want or cannot lift Bobby and Paula on two pieces of selfishness. You should see for Reid's performance, but a little. Shame of crying ...
