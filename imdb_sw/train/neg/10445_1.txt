This should be one of the worst movies that I have ever seen, graphics are ridiculous, and the pathetic script and the big question is how this script below the script got the foot process selection. I would like all movies from deep dramas to more men kill everything you see a film, so I can't say I am picky. I've been struggling to find something to compare with, but I can't imagine anything similar to this, maybe the starship troopers. . Good acting and script should be awarded. You know when the movie is bad in a pleasant way, this good people are not one of those who kill the minute of your soul for a minute.
