Sorry, it's not good. It begins to look attractive, but it drops its way a few minutes on the film. It is not helpful that no ordinary characters (Quaid, Glover, Ermey, Leto etc.) provide very good performance. It can be paid for the fact that I saw the dubbed version (German), but Dennis Quaid's behavior was particularly woody and horrible, and Danny Glover does not do it honestly. Additionally, Jared Leto's character does not really contribute to the story (save one person at a time, but the area is important as a windshield wiping out of the submarine first place ;-) <br /> <br /> Talking about unwanted events - a major complaint is true of a tangled story with a cliché: Investigation (of course!) He can solve a personal issue with man and is (of course!) He is suspended from his official work deficit. The murderer (of course!) * Wants to be “monitored down and played a cat-and-mouse game with his opponent for years… I don't know how many movies build the same plot - many of them are better, however. The plan has galore holes and many incredible and unnecessary incidents that do not contribute or work well with the whole story at all times (eg a car stop or drive on a cliff edge etc.) To continue, the end tries to be original and exciting, but it fails completely with this. We have seen * many more finals and similar kinds of set-up-to-the-train-of-forlorn-cool-setting setting ... At the end there is a mortgage waiting to move the parent and child ... hokey, at least.
