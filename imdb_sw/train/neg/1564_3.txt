... it was so that I could, with a good conscience, tell everyone how awesome this movie. I did it in twenty minutes before I started to ask myself, "Wow, this is very bad." And, being honest, I would like to give you this 1 star for not just for Isai Morales (though he had a very short screen time). He is only responsible for the film's efficiency, which is a shame because I love Gil Bellows ... or at least I thought I did. When I was looking at this I began to think again of his part "Shawshank Redemption" and realized it wasn't as good as I thought it was. Problem: prison-house / tough guy acting it looks like it's just, act; His conversation showed as he made a very bad impression. What? Has he ever met someone who speaks like his behavior was gone? I testify, but maybe he has to. And, to make things worse, they have been able to incorporate a bit of a prison-house philosophy and make it seem not too short to be found, especially when you think that the rhetoric was experiencing a "rasta" who was so strong that it seemed unusual. I did not make the film like this, but when I saw the movie it was a good review. I felt as if I had been led and led, and I thought I should try to save a person from having a look at this film. <br /> <br /> I say BOOOOOOOO.
