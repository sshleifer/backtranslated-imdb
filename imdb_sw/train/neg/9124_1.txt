This may not be the worst film than Peter Sellers did (I think that the laurel goes to "Zenda's Prisoner") but it is actually more sad. Traders, especially without makeup as Nayland Smith, looks like he's just got chemotherapy. Like Manchu Fu, he seems more difficult and uses more of the films (except those incredible events that find the electric wheels) around and fall under the weight of all the makeup. Supporting players also seem tired and run, and the presence of Sid Caeser is offensive even without regular references and "Chinks!" (One bright spot: this would be one of the last major photographs of motion will show the Asians so horrible ... or, for that, star to Asia as one!). The movie looks cheap, with photographic pictures and fabric sets - even Elz-bang Elvis number seems to be reduced. It's just amazing Helen Mirren and a thin, thin, nervous who finds her wet pants increases the spark of life for this sad thing. All in all, this film provides the deaths of the great comic, and even the eerier documentation of its death.
