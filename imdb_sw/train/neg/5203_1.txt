I have seen poor movies at my time, but this takes the cookies! Why oh why this film has been made? Here is nothing here. Please trust you, make switch away and destroy your copy of this film. There is a plot ... which can take up to 5 minutes to show on the camera. This is the main problem, the story 'comes from the true story' (mmm ... whatever) in any way it does not happen for 80 minutes. And so we should stay more than an hour to watch people walking. That's it! In the first half of an hour at all nothing happens, away from looking at someone walking in the shop ... and then 3 boys walk through the wood. This time it may be perhaps used to develop character ... but no. And so there is no relationship with the people on the screen, and so when they start to get shot, we can't keep a little! In fact I had finished with baddie so the film would end! On this function of the camera is awesome! Director / editor / author / producer, Ti West is garbage. I hate to beat someone, but in fact, his work is pants! These are always interesting, and then they take the following people as they walk - I'm sure she thinks she is clever, but these results are lighter I wanted to leave the film and crush my hands! How this man is brought to lead the next movie of the flu fever is more than me! To finish, acting is also shy, ... which goes to the general film. Keep your cleanliness, close the pile of total dirt!
