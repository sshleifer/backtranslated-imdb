I've seen this movie today for the first time and I've never heard of it before, maybe because of the wrong message. Before all, leading itself is quite good, the actors play well with CGI (not a fan of CGI) is too great. But that alone does not make the movie. There is no story at all, no message of talent is wrong. Or I can make people remember, the art of the director is not just your vision but know how to tell the story. And this is the whole 7 minutes. <br /> <br /> There is a simple 4 rating.
