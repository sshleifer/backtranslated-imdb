Kiyoshi Kurosawa movie movie is pretty wild, and it had at least one fly scare that caught me off guard. But for all, the movies are very stupid, and the detective tries to track the accused suspect of suspicion, just knowing that he can make one of the crimes. Then he finds himself being beaten by a good Asian woman, and he does not know why (and no viewer). If other killings have emerged, they become more mixed as murderers are easily found, and this spirit continues to hate him for some reason. It's not just a completely stupid plot, a woman's spirit is more funny than anything, especially when she suddenly jumps into town, like Wonder Woman. And the endless meaning, in fact, the whole movie is useless, and I can not recommend it altogether. If it was not based on itself, I would think it should be a black comedy. Out of the "Bright Future" this is the worst movie directed by Kiyoshi Kurosawa I have seen yet.
