Would I like to back my $ 13.00? I would like to look more "Hydro- Electric Power Comes North America". Again. This is a single sound movie. The same voice, which comes from every mouth of characters regardless of age or gender. To listen to the same voice again I should pay at least $ 150 an hour. And not take insurance. It was looking to look for Ferrell hats in Woody. But I think the cast of the image is enough. Someone should wait until they have a story before they bother to make a movie. Unless he does just for money. And if that's why not just restore the All-Rap version of "What's on Tiger Lily?"
