This movie is thought to be amazed and close to Seattle. Why Porteau Cove P-R-O-V-N-C-I-A-L Store is shown? The regional squares are CANADA, and not the United States. The inspector uses the Pilot of Palm to fill and stylus 'read' that someone has entered the computer shop. I did not know that this is possible by using a data storage device. The woman is seen in the movie without any introduction and has never been brought. We learn a half way in the film that this woman works in the District Attorney's office. Then, in the center of the real security guard helps Jenks through the door and puts it back to the offender !! This can never happen in real-time adjustments. The director actually lowered this - this does not work in real life. Acting is enough. Plot is good. Style is beautiful. However, most of the errors found in continuing to lead 3 out of 10 votes.
