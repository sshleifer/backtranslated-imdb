Jason Lee is back! If you are looking for it, see again. If not, add more ... <br /> <br /> But about the movie. Clich√©s galore, some shooting but foreign kinda fight scenes (used JKD) and a lot of bad act and cheap effects. Poor Lee looks like he has pain during movies, and it is not surprising. It's not returning to return. <br /> <br /> Movie does not even cut as a movie B-surely, there was a German bleached blonde Rutger-wannabe bad guy, but no free sex area or even one shooty shots. Nothing. Zip. Nada. Even in the Starship Troopers 2 they had a common sense of involvement with unnecessary nudie items (as in my other opinion on the good quality of classic movies, please check our upcoming review on the same mindset ...). I got the impression that the author was retaliating for someone with this - so I would not enter the "plot" of the movie or pretty anything else related. Except that it had non-heterosexual overtones, so 'nuff said. <br /> <br /> However, this movie has one thing to go for it - no Jean-Claude :)
