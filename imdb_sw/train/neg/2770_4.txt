Hollywood Hotel was the last music movie which Busby Berkeley explained to Warner Bros. His leading style had changed or changed to this film that does not contain a signature or a large array of production and extra thousands. For the past few decades, the big band of swing style recorded the most commonly beaten year. The Swing Era, also called "Big Band Era," has been written separately from 1935 to 1944 or 1939 to 1949. Although it is not possible to achieve when Swing Era started, Benny Goodman's participation at Palomar Ballroom in Los Angeles at the end of summer The 1935 was certainly one of the earliest signs that the swing was entering to a young American understanding. When Goodman was showing his repertoire instead of music dance music which his band had played, the youth in the audience went wild. That was the beginning, but, since the radio, live concerts and mouth words were the basic techniques available to spread events, it took time before swing made into enough to produce great hits that showed on pop patterns. In the Hollywood Hotel, the appearance of Benny Goodman and his Orchestra and Raymond Paige and his Orchestra in the film shows that the film industry was ready to dedicate on the taste of music taste (the film was in production only a year and a half or so after cooperation The Palomar Ballroom of Goodman). There is a short time of music in and around Hollywood Hotel, but except for Benny Goodman and its Orchestra of "Sing, Sing, Sing," there is not much to congratulate. Alternatively, the most interesting music series is the opening of "Hooray for Hollywood" that emerges and "Let There Be Your Lessons" the production number in a driving restaurant. Film is more interesting to see and hear Benny Goodman and his Orchestra play with Dick Powell and Frances Langford singing.
