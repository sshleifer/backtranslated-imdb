I went to expect the movie to be completely mute. For low expectations, any kind of entertainment will be a good surprise. The voice sound was the most beautiful part of the film, but the excitement of the concern that goes to the special ward is also exciting. This said, there were many things about Ward Singles that were very angry. The entire film was not well named and made the look-ups when listening to their loudly angry voice. This lack of professionalism was found only by the fans of Mormon fans who have no work to do. This film will do well between Mormoms, especially in the college communities where one district is located. However the conclusion will not give hope to the poor poor who find themselves single. (Only beautiful girls in Ward Singles wedding, fat, bad they are not, but all bad people) Finally we realize that the whole film was broadcast to LDSSingles.com
