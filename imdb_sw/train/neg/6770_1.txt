I went to see this film and 17 y.o. my. daughter. I insisted we go to matin√©e to show, not because I am tightwad, but just the feeling I had. In the spirit of NASCAR, this is the dream of the sponsor. Many open spots, approaching graduate as news-mercial, if it was not for so-called act. To keep it traditional, the Herbie franchise continues with its lines of fun stories, the car is just 'drive' (no pun required) for this motion picture. The original Herbie sessions (though cheesy too) were produced during the worst times, making them easier to crush. Mrs. Lohan, the Disney Domino game, has a limited ability to act. I was surprised that Mr. Keaton and Mr. Dillon would be involved in the project. Just a snack bar, it was the biggest!
