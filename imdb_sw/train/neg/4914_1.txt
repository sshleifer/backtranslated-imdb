I love the good story of sappy love (and I am a boy) but when I hire a "Love Story" I prayed for the last to come quickly and with bitterness as possible and just the opposite of Ali McGraw's behavior. Ali / McGraw as Jenny separated it from me in the first 15 minutes. When we learn that he is infected with a life-threatening illness I couldn't help but wondered if his death would be a tragic loss to poor Oliver or if anyone could watch this film without any service. If she had not died her husband might have beaten Oliver on the edge and eventually put them in court of divorce. People love this film but it is one of the worst of over 70 years.
