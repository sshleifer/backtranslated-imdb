This movie takes the beginning to (especially) end. Perhaps not more available, acting, story, photography, camera function, the worst is so bad, it's very bad. But that's what makes 'look' good, it will give you more good laugh. Worse, better! I have no clue what these people thought to make this film. Great movie of viking? The story is ridiculous, it's more like a comedy to hide, kinda like the Mafia, also useless but damn funny. <br /> <br /> And check out the end of the movie ... uhum.
