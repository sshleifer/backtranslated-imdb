The awesome film of fear about the rich man (John Carradine) dies and leaves everything for his four children, and his servants divided equally. One condition - they should spend one week in his property to earn money. And if any of them die, some get more. I think it happens next .... <br /> <br /> I saw a new copy of this film on the cable. The colors were bright and clear and the house itself looked good. That's about all the good things I can say about it. Let's look at just a list of problems that this film has: the killer is very obvious; servants are called Igor and Elga - come up! some sound recording was so bad I couldn't make a conversation (no great loss I am sure); the year was declining; The other killings were only confusing, stupid or impossible with this movie has a really disgusting practice - not just bad looking at the screen without unbelief. Even the Jeff Morrow pro was bad! Only good good work was from Mr. Domergue who was more eligible than this by John Carradine (who appears to be old and weak here). I need to accept though - the closing line in this film is gem! Why this was the name "Blood of the Blood" is more than I - there is another awesome film of 1978 with that name! </> <br /> Whatever his name is, it's a bad movie. Avoid at all costs.
