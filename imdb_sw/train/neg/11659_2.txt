I liked * Movie's original start. I am a great fan of skill - it's my favorite kind of love. Sometimes it looks like a sense of humor. The Wayans boys seemed to understand the concept perfectly in the original film, then they forgot it when doing good. I think the Jews' are a family of wonderful skills. Alas, even scholars make mistakes. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with a promise. I liked "The Exorcist" parody, especially "come out, ma" gag. Now, that's the quality of the Wayans. But, moreover, I can think of just twice I laughed: 1) when Tori Spelling is thrown in the middle of the night with the spirit, then it becomes clingy and starts talking about marriage with him. At the same time, he says, "It was a call to call!" That was kinda funny. 2) "Save Save End Dance" parody where Cindy character inadvertently beat the girl while doing her new action. But even the most difficult moments are not the same as laughing on the modern-day scandal. <br /> <br /> Some of the films are clean litter, full of cheap gags. Jokes from the first film that was cunning or meaningful has been promoted and increased. For example, in Scary Movie I, several Scenendos are being made to prove that Ray's character is gay. This was a hilarious. But, in Phase 2 of the horror, the area of ​​the penis-and-the-ray of the bottom of the bed was taking into account the mind and unhappiness. This is an example of the entire film. The only shock * shock * does not take the film too far. This was a trend in 2000 and 2001, unfortunately. It also confuses me to measure the Wayaan movie very low, I must give this 2 out of 10.
