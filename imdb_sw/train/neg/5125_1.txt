As a young pastor I have heard positive things about this movie. Then I looked at it. Acting was not good. That's forgiveness. It is a message that is not: Give Jesus your life and everything will change - you will be able to cope better, make amazing surprises, stop hitting fumbling, start making passdown, and even make playoffs. All because Jesus turns the hardness of power under all American attackers. I laughed loudly when the coach quoted texts to explain to the kicker why he did not have the goals of the field. But wait, not all. You will find a new truck, add $ 6000, and you and your wife struggle with deficit will suddenly end in pregnancy - twice. Then you will win the government championship because God helps the weak kick to win the field 12di more than he ever kicked before - and in the wind, not down - all because "God wanted him to do that." Then you will win the government championship next year. None of these good things could happen if the team was not chosen to follow Jesus their whole will. This is what I removed from the film: God can do whatever He wants to do whenever He wants to - and it's all about making our life better, easier, and more enjoyable. He chooses his favorite team and helps them win games. Which Bible is this story based on? I will beta beta Saint Stephen wanted to know the keys to life safe before the stones die. One should make this film before the 11th apostles were killed by following Jesus. It saves all of the trouble.
