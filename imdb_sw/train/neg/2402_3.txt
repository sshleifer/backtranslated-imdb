A shocking shock from the usual Larry Cohen (God told me also, Q, etc.), Full Moon High strives to be funny and fails in amazement, even with a return with respect to Ed McMahon (!) By Kenneth Mars. Alan Arkin is embarrassed in all his performance and the child Adam appears only to be in trouble. This makes Young Wolf look like a classic comedy.
