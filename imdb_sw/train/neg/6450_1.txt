Well this film is very amazing. I felt sorry for the actors involved in this project because I am sure they did not write their lines. Which is sometimes supplied with little fear, which leads me to believe that they did not take this movie in detail, nor anyone who watches this obnoxious away monster slasher stripes. While watching this "Creature Unknown" I could not help but I think that there were no more budgets or a competent author over staff. But, if you look at this for laughing you will be happy, the cinema is not ashamed to deceive yourself because I do not know how anyone can look at this and brag about pushing this directly to the DVD clich√©d want to be an amazing action / fear movie fightfest for light.
