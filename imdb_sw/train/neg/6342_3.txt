I chose it in a video store because of Tarantino's recommendations ("If you do not like (this), f & f ... of death "... not real violence in this one, or plot, of character, or discussion. See post. All here. Stunts, and rock. It goes back and forth. A week or so in a LA band life that makes a magic show of crappy, to the extent that you would like to see in one small casinos from Strip, and a new Aussie player in the city finding his feet ... , they play. End of the story. The obvious band needed all things because they are second-second, and playing the style that was already set up in 1978. It is said that the stunt bits in the film are actually spinetingling - that Aussie colleagues really are The object, and the film looks significantly motivated by love and respect for "art". I hung there to see what he could do next. Just wish he could get the best car.
