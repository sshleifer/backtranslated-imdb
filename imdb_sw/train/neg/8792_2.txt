This film is another example of a movie in Eastern Asia: Two or more stories are linked to one film. Other viewers have also been seen on it because there are several "first part" talks and "second part". How can you develop any characteristic or intensive strategy when characters and stories are included in a very short time? I enjoyed the first part until it suddenly stopped (it was not "last", standing in what seemed like the middle of the story) to be replaced by the second most unreliable part that seemed to focus on the girl rearranging and cleaning the guy's apartment (wow!) I hope the day when Wong Kar Wai has been given a good script to work with!
