This is an unforgettable and irrelevant chat of unexpected conversation of boring conversations and monologues. That's not spread: you should make a great effort to try to deal with it. I thought sincerely Fassbinder could do something interesting to find out why Erwin / Elvira is killed at the end, instead of this, everywhere someone tries to explain: "when he was younger, this happened ..." and "returned from Casablanca and ordered to cut everything down ... ", etc.. </> <br /> Recently in the movie, Erwin / Elvira is in the house of being killed and talking to a friend (surely the house of slaughter is a good place for very good conversation), and while telling the story of Elvira, Fassbinder shows The killing of one cow after another. It is difficult to choose between giving priority to images that are distracted or what transvestite says. Of course we come to the compulsory and very powerful sign of "I have been severely injured in my life, and almost die". In one short time that really happens something, Erwin / Elvira meets an old boyfriend, that after making a homemade gay and two other boys (like going to the appropriate level of homosexuality) is that he recognizes Elvira. There are some interesting shots and ideas, I must admit (such as the time of nun describes the story of Erwin limited), but everything on the lost movie because of fun for Fassbinder.
