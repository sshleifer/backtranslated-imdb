VILLA RIDES (1968) turns into something of great desire! And although Sam Peckinpah had a hand in the screenplay, along with Robert Towne, it still looks like a written movie for the guidance led by unknown Buzz Kulik. First, on Yul Brynner fees as Pancho Villa is appropriate for parts! He is not charismatic enough to play the great Mexican reforms! His work was not hot and gusto Anthony Quinn or Gilbert Roland could bring a chance. Brynner looks just like the Russian aristocrat dressed as a Mexican girl who is in the midst of the Mexican revolution instead of the Russian. Also, the second payment Robert Mitchum will disappear completely in the picture! His part as a flying bomb for a home-driven bomb bombing because of the revolution is an unprecedented role that could play with any small star. Mitch does not have a line of respect in the entire movie and brings the attention of another man to the Mexican revolution of the "top bandido" (1956) which unfortunately no one seems to have interest in the release of the DVD. In addition to lack of any style "Villa Rides" also suffers trouble without the presence of female stars! There are stars Grazia Buccella as a little Mexican girl who gives Mitchum eye but but her casting is just a perfunctory. A person like Claudia Cardinale or Jean Peters may have some of the most needed tips on the bad story. There are a few incidents of action in the film but good action events are not a film with a small picture of Panavision's incomplete image as well as a voice repetition of Maurice Jarre's inappropriate issues. <br /> <br /> As with no extra level - do not even trailer! Yup, the despair movie and the presentation of a DVD that would have to be better.
