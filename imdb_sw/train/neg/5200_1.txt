This movie is very bad. I have seen the best movies. There was a bit of tension but not much to make you come from your seat. It starts slowly with the construction of tension. Which is not successful. At least if you ask me. Although in some points or when I must say it was funny when people were shot and how they went. <br /> <br /> They would have to do something like Movie Scary, then it could be the best movie. Because I watched only the pieces of the film by breaking the scenes and it became boring through the movie. I must say that I felt sleepy watching this film so that I could say not worth it. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time even thinking of doing something with this movie instead of leaving the place already. Some dusty place.
