Despite bad reviews, I just needed to give this film go? it makes, after all, the HK super-babe Shu Qi with 6 other eastern east as all the gun teams. Surely that's worth checking out? Well, if the babies are going, the martial angel is hard to beat. The eye of the eye is the highest quality. Shu Qi looks as strange as always, and for all the other girls, Rosemary Vandebrouck and Amanda Strang touched my eye in particular. Unfortunately, if someone is judging this movie with any other possible attributes, it's absolutely stinker! Stories are weak, shoddy action and special effects under pathetic. Director Clarence Fok and Wong Jing Producer have given a photograph to something else. If Shu Shu is the only reason you think to see this, you would better see sex with Zen 2 again!
