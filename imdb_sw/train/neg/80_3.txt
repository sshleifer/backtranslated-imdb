I should say I'm surprised at the high level of this film. I found it to be quite unique. Mother gets a "vision" when she touches certain things or people? And one thing he touched twice made his vision continue ... just seemed so ridiculous. The performance of Deedee Pfieffer was very bad I thought. He was very angry. The girl who played Lori did a good job and so many gave support to what they were working with. I love LMN and I am very good at the movies but this film seemed to have a plot of ignorance and high acting and not just for me.
