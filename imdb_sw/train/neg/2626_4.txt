I saw these years of film films in a group of a Films Films group, where we would decide to rent a group of B movies and vote for who chose the worst. At night we looked at this, it was well chosen, because of the similarity of the plot and fun with pleasure. <br /> <br /> Certainly this is a silly, kitschy, movie, looking under a perfect understanding that you're looking down budget fluff. Personally, however, I will not recommend you any other ... this film will leave your score on you. <br /> <br /> Made it enough for me that I've tried to get hands copy for a few years. <br /> <br /> Good choice if you expect to watch bad movies. This is fun, and I remember bouncy music ...
