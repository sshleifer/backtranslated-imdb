I've never left a film on the internet, but I felt moving to do that, after seeing this. One does not show in the funeral of someone and tell the lost, "My brothers are dead, why do I care about you?" Reduce propaganda, there was little, like anything called "art." As the daughter of a parent's parents, I was particularly angry with the use of deafness as a gimmick. Anyone who does not feel emotionally feel the vibration of the same size could detect, not reject it. The word "chutzpah" comes to mind. As a writer, there are a few subjects I will stay away from: Holocaust is one; this is another. I wish the movie managers have never been proud (and they don't).
