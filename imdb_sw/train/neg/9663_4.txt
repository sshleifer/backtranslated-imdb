The authors are concerned how, to wait so. I might be an American citizen, but I don't need to see other Americans face back to an hour and a half to enjoy the film. I wonder that a few have witnessed on how to jingoistic, feeling and talking in this film is true. The historical films of the film are no longer as bad and offensive as "U-571" (which change British traders to America) but you may still feel slimy slightly. True, the Germans in this film do nothing but praise Americans among the events of war! It's sad, not necessary! I would like to tell the authors: it is obvious to many of us that you can't catch real people, and real problems, under real pressure, and that you have taken very tested shortcuts. Lucky for you will always be a national nutjobs to appreciate your tripe coated tripe.
