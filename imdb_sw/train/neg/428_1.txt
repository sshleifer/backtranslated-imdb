Wow, films about NYC politics seem to be written by someone who has never put foot in NYC. You know there is a problem at one time expecting credit spread and the movie will continue for half an hour. The characters are boring, the emphasis on John Cusack is delicious, and the decision of technology between stimulating and despair. Bad movie.
