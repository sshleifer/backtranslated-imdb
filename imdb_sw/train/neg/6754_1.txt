The only reason I engage in commenting on this film is to save you every 97 minutes of your life and maybe your money. I bought the first time to rent Â£ 3.00, it seemed interesting, so it used space. <br /> <br /> Within minutes of turning I realized I would make mistakes. The whole mission must be stored until the winter and then thrown to the nearest fire log, where they could meet their type more. To Devin Hamilton (Author and Director), he should be just shot, sadly this would have been done before making this garbage. Avoid this film, If you see it in the mall running. </ 1/1 / / 1/10
