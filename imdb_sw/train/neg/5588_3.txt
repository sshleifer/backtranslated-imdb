This is an attempt, and all author Edgar Rice Burroughs and film artists, in the "Tarzan Waa" of Arabia. But, this desert film does not show any beauty in the Jungle's most successful adventure of Burroughs. The view is on the love between the handsome master English Jon Hall (like "El" Lion "Chatham) and the unique beauty of the Arab Kathleen Burke (as" Princess "Eulilah), for revenge that happens with their reunion. that, although the conduct of the conduct is unacceptable, the boy's mother lives - but, he does not know it in the picture. Unfortunately, "the Lion man" has been damaged, and it looks like there is no picture. The Lion Man (1936) John P. McCarthy ~ Jon Hall, Kathleen Burke, Ted Adams
