I am a B-lover, give me a bat of mutani and I'm in heaven. These movies are good to make you stop thinking about everything else going on in your world. Even the stupid B movie makes me laugh and I still see it as good. Then there was Hammerhead, which was so bad I needed to register with IMDb so I wouldn't warn others. First there was science to create a man of shark, which the movie did not touch. To keep the audience interested they made sure there was blood every few minutes. During a single attack the camera left the attack but you saw what was the blood bucket dropped by stagehand to let you know that the attack had blood and that person was probably dead (what is a special impact). To return to science, I thought it was very interesting that the study of the female test was done naked and testing equipment needed to be monitored through breast tissue. However, this film had a good development of the plot, a horrible story, and I have the poor say the worst act. Even William Forsythe, Hunter Tylo or Jeffrey Combs can save this stinker.
