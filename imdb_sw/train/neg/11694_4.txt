So 'Thinner' ... Yep. This Steven Bachman (read Steven King) learn about someone who gets his desserts just from Gypsy Elder who just killed, the story itself is there, of course on it, but I don't know for I did not enjoy it more than I did. I think what prompted them is the actors. I mean, who is leading? Robert John Burke? Who is he? And crying loudly, someone can please stop recruiting Joseph Mantegna for every Italian role of Mafioso there? And when we're there, does every Mafioso need to have a Italian mother cook? Just a good job of doing here is less than 10 pounds of makeup, Michael Constantine as an old gypsy elder. He is very good. But others, I do all of them, "the best actors ..."
