Detective Russell Logan (Lou Diamond Phillips) has a serious problem in his hands. The fatal killer, Patrick Channing (Jeff Kober), who Tess (extracyinaire) Tess (Tracy Griffith) helped her capture, raised by the First Power (given by Satan after he was killed in the gas room) and can possess weak bodies. Somehow, Russell, who joins Tess (who knows what they are against), will stand Channing or most women will continue to die in his hands. They will support help from Sister Marguerite (Elizabeth Arlen) who has tried to inform her leaders in the Catholic Church of The First Power, but has been denied access to weapons that may stop Channing. He will take over and give credit to Russell, who will need all the help he can get when Channing kid Taps is preparing for a particular form of Satan / ceremony. , Mykelti Williamson, always welcome to a reliable actress, gets a lover of Russell's role ... and you know what will happen to him. Like in this kind of film, everyone around Russell is dying, but while trying to kill Channing, he kills only the weak army of other poor people he has. Try to clean the magic ... the gate to the finish line. Try with Phillips and Griffith, I will give them, but in the flick like this they have no chance. Kober, who is often more effective as a heavy, is not given anything more than a goofy village that rises in the air and throws rotten quips.
