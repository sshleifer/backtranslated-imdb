I really start to believe that Seagal is in a mission to see how his films can be. This film is full and perfect time to see. My first time was a DVD cover where they made their pic and made him look younger and less time in the film it looks like a sketch. She has her big nose and two chairs coming to her and looking more sad and tired on her face. The whole plot was ridiculous to start and implement a very long way. The whole film was leading to the end where the Seagal and his team had to take a group of people under the influence of the military chemical adrenaline enhancer. A lot of meaningless conversation and not to mention the voice of ignorance and frequent sound of Seagals even in the middle of the statement. The dubbed sound looked like a man with a bottle in his throat and it was normal. Fighting events in the film were awesome.Before when Seagal foug ht you can't even see what is going on. There will be tight shots of him hitting his hands in the camera and then someone will fly through the wall or something. .They used a very slow way of war events. I believe this is a very bad Seagals film so far and I'm glad I didn't buy this film or I would be very angry since I was a big fan of Seagal Aikidoist. The action star grows faster and seems to be getting worse with every performance.
