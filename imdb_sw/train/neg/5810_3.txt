SPOILERS IN: <br /> <br /> The Gettaway is a particular movie action. And what action there !! Shootout, chases, dumpsters and much more. It's star Kim Bassenger and Alec Baldwin as Mc Coy. <br /> <br /> This is remake and I haven't seen nature but certainly doesn't care for this even though Bassenger and Baldwin have good chemistry screens. But the movie itself did not do for me. The Gettaway was very tired. This plan has been covered and fought with another track and the violence continues to speak, Bassenger and Baldwin look at their wonders regardless of the risks they may have. In fact, at the end of their movie they seem to be more active at first. I don't think Bassenger's eye training instantly causes the whole picture. <br /> <br /> This is not the worst films I have ever seen, certainly not, but it's not very good unless one purist movie action I can't see really enjoy this movie because there's not just a lot here. The Gettaway is not a natural nature or, and it may go all the way from the abnormal cruelty. It might be better to guess. <br /> <br /> Bassenger and Baldwin provide OK displays but do not have much to do unless they are expelled and running their lives. Sometimes the bottom is more, after seeing one thing often often gets stale. It does not enjoy this in moderation.
