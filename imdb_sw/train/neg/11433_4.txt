The first half of this movie is pure fun. Novel. Funny. Wonderful performances. A close relative to a sister who lived in Manhattan to fall in the woman! Adults. Bright. Witch. What more can you ask. If this romantic comedy begins to quicken. It comes in an unknown location. And then it falls off. It comes from being an ordinary adult who plays with a come-out-of-closet story that has been done many times before. What a desire. If the film of people begins with that promise. Why it needs to turn into a walker like "I am who is" film. The last freezing shot to Heather Graham in the air to celebrate his "fun in finding" emphasizes the ban on the final part of the film. It can be different. It can be magical. It ended that old old man.
