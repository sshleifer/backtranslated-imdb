This is an awesome awesome movie. It makes little sense that it begins to make the kind of internal sense itself. Well, it would have been if it had not continued to cut off the side pieces until finally playing under the weight of his absence. The movie can not create his mind as it is directly in front 'Someone Turns Monster' flick (like all those 1950s 'INCREDIBLE inserting the verb ING ING' cinema), or movie ghastly serious plot plot of theory, or mystical story of post-life , or ... or what? Take your choice. It's just a mess. Store on top and run off all sides, leaving the ends of disappearing lost everywhere. It was like Tobe Hooper had taken David Lynch's medication. Unfortunately he did not take enough.
