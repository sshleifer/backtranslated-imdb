"CIA Codename: Alexa" is a great blast of Luc Besson's film "La Femme Nikita" (1990). The film is essentially about a woman who has been taken and taught by CIA and is forced to work in secret. (Pretty very similar story story of La Femme Nikita) combo acting of Lorenzo Lamas and O.J. Simpson is probably the worst in movie history. Lamas "acting" is simply odds of Steven Segal. Watching the action of Orenthal in this film is a very good experience. <br /> <br /> Writing and acting is poor in this film is sometimes delicious. There are many practical film films in the film that is ridiculous: unwanted car explosions, people running windows of glasses, terrorists, bad ponytails, etc.. The music mark is like David Michael Frank's logo for "Hard to Kill" (1990), which develops the Steven Segal theme of this movie. There are a lot of military art in the film, and it is very well for the lowest production of the US budget. The thoughtless and above-acting action never lets you, and I must admit I was well accepted. Lorenzo Lamas had a look for a star of action behind the early 90s but she didn't have a star of action, that's why she does so and not blockbusters of action. My recommendations are that the jump "Codename of CIA: Alexa" and see "La Femme Nikita" instead.
