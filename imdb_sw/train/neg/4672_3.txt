This movie has a beautiful set with Albert Finney does a good job as a bad father. The movie fails because Jennifer Jason Leigh is also jumpy as a daughter with no match for Olivia De Havilland's most nuanced, mature delivery in The Heiress (1949). The female conclusions of the female films also face a no-nonsense conclusion, Washington Square, whose author, Henry James, deals with female feminine in some of his other novels. Like a Hollywood fan of old and many books, I've got this disappointing movie.
