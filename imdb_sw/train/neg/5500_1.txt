This movie is trying hard, but it is not quite good for the 1960s television series, that I am sure people are remembering with joy. Although I am 17 years old, I watched some series on YouTube a long time ago and was fun and fun. Unfortunately, this film has little rights for succession. <br /> <br /> Special effects are rather low, and this does not help with a flat camera function. The script was also lighter and did not have any strange feeling and humor. Other films with low scripting are Home alone 4, Cat in Hat, Thomas and Magic Magic and Addams Family Reunion. Now I would say I liked the idea of ​​the story, but unfortunately he was very killed and run out of the steam too early, and I don't really believe because this is something to family enjoy. And I was angry with the talking suit, despite the voice of the sound from Wayne Knight. But what made me so angry with this film is that it lost the talent of Christopher Lloyd, Jeff Daniels and Daryl Hannah, all very talented actors. Jeff Daniels has dismissed good performances before, but he did not seem to have a clue what he should do, and Elizabeth Hurley's sad attitude was useless. Daryl Hannah is a good actor and generally was not overlooked, and I liked the idea that he is a passion for love, but sadly you see him very little, (not to mention the Monster's attack is likely to torture children than to love them) as well as Wallace Appear as some kind of The operation of the government. Christopher Lloyd gets himself better, and as an actor I love Lloyd (he was in two favorite films that I liked and who used Roger Rabbit, and I enjoy Back To The Future) but he was given a little to work with, and he had a very rebellious attitude. . Overall, as I wanted to make this film, I was left no matter what. Instead of having fun, it happened without meaning, and that's a shame because it had a lot of potential, and talented executives with a good idea, but lost to poor performance. 1/10 Bethany Cox
