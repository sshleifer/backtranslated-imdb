Horror. I see a lot of user feedback on how this shows. In fact they are Wanna-Be-Friends - Made in Taiwan knockoff. Jokes are lazy like ... and plot is ridiculous. The executives are obviously struggling to be funny and may be hitting when they hit those bad punchlines (if you call them). Most of the other users who have described it are obvious from other planets (or at least other continents). There are obvious reasons why TV companies want to erase ... and no time when it shows good. Make sense? However, clear - even if rain and nothing else in this world to do ... go to stand in the rain instead - more fun.
