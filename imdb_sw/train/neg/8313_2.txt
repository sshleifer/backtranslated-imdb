I watched this for shock because it was available and I would like to hear the Thumb films were interesting. This was not. Most of the jokes were based near the "physique" of Geranium and, in turn, Kate Winslet. I think it's a sad thing for the creators of "Thumbtanic" to bow down to make jabs for a respected actor because he (heaven forbids) does not know hunger in the image of modern beauty. <br /> <br /> My favorite part is a line going something like, "Hey, I have a great idea! Let's go on this short raft which no one can see!" Thirty seconds of an amusement of the movie 26 minutes does not redeem its value.
