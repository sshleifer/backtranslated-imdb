I couldn't believe how this film was bad; I rarely look at commercial TV, but I think "Well, Diane Keaton has a value to watch". I'm stopped. Everyone involved is worthy to be put to shame. I know that there is no great job for women of a certain age, but the script for this was not inept, clich√©d and baffling that I was surprised you had ever entered into development or that Mrs. Keaton thought she could make a silk bag of the ear of the seed. There were no credible characters and they were so very different. Acting seems like a practice in BEGINNING class - I looked at the open-mouthed fear through a lot of these wondering "What did they think?". Very, very sad that has come to this. Don't waste your time.
