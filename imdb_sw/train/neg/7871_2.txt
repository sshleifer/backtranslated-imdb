Therefore, the sequence was inevitable and unfortunately, this sequence is among the worst things that have been done. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that is not recommended for its promises.

The problem is that Clavier feels quite easily in the world of the twentieth century, and thus arudie in the Middles Ages is difficult ... Instead of this, the movies continues several other stories without succeeding the main plot. So, the movie is sometimes head-on, sometimes it's a mess. <br /> <br /> But the movie is also facing the performance of almost all actors. Reno and Clavier fall into a trap that can however escape in the first movie: they go up and become angry.

Some procedures and conversations are affected. It also looks for holes because Poiré takes elements that got the first movie. Therefore, the little girl takes Reno to the immediate family of her family and asks her to participate in her wedding. <br /> <br /> Monitoring and frustration. Otherwise, what is the interest of this otherwise commercial film? <br /> <br />
