Certainly I must watch a good movie soon, because it looks like any other entry or so is something that I despise. Yet my story speaks, I must not lie. Bobby Deerfield and everything on it climbs a large peel of green bananas. I have never thought that I would like to see a movie film like a thunder like this did. Al Pacino doesn't work in this film: he asks. There are many, many instances of his character, who is the driver of the race cars, just looking at the camera. She is very bad. Marthe Keller is just bad. These two should be in a loving state, and there is not just any chemistry. Sydney Pollack inspired this film? There is no elite information behind Tootsie here. Is this the same person that I was happy with Wide Shut Eyes? I can't believe it. Save yourself the awesome experience of the film. Run, don't go, away from Bobby Deerfield.
