I started hearing about Noise white when I got a TV announcement. Before that I don't even know there was. I watched the trailer online and I decided to go and see it. Now being a fan of a film like Six Sense, I thought this film would give me everything I wanted. It has Michael Keaton in it, and he starts. Unfortunately the movie has not provided. It tried to be another Sense Sense or Stir of Echoes, with a good failure. It has a very promising start, but in the middle it just repeats itself, and ends with the worst twist that any monkey can appear. Unfortunately, many "scary" films today depend on the loud noise and pigs so that the audience jumps. This film can be much more. It's a shame because it was a good idea.
