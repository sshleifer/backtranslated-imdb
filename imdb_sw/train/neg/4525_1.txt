Some of the beautiful conditions, but the story itself - which the Japanese (Lesley-Anne Down) visited Egypt and, when doing Egyptian things in a non-Egyptian way (eg photographs of a monument, cemetery; etc.), defines the black-black black market and somehow (for two days, not less!) becomes that the jumpsuit-worn-out army is more awesome than any riddle that Sphinx has found. Below is as bad as a British pupil visiting (that he seems to know nothing about Egypt's culture and even a little over the past is the fault of the authors, indeed, but that he feels like all when it comes out is his own fault), and all others who are beaten, including Sir John Gielgud and Frank Langella, they seem to have been confused by the case as I was. In short, you would not expect from Schaffner (Planet Apes, Patton) and cooperation. It should look at the area that had been beaten down under the lessons of all male scholars, and accuse him of a failure as a professional, while swimming under the light of Hollywood Hollywood would move. At the top, they spend the next hour of photography and withstanding and running from anyone who can find. Wow, talk about your beautiful understanding! Check out that they would be Egyptian: take a year or two Arab at a grad school. It will help you for a long time ...
