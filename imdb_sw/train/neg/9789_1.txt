They should call this film: "Accepted Mouse Brother's Headed by a Person's Capture of Stuart Kidogo who dedicated only a little book, but is often remembered only" If not so misleading I will give you a better review. But people with weight, make your children have a permit and write them a book. They can actually learn something instead of having their own ideas and what we all know as a Hollywood film. <br /> <br /> The little Stuart book is not on the mouse, it is about a person who happens to be very limited and mouse-like. Born of his parents, it was not accepted. The book is about his life and his departure from home and journey starts. There is a cat called Snowball who thinks she is food and wants to eat, but snowball can't talk. <br /> <br /> In the film they beat it all. I think the only things that have saved it from the book are the boat and names.
