Wow, my first review of this film was so bad that it was not there. I'll try this drop down. Let's be real !!! No one wants to see Chuck Norris movie where HE is not the main character. There was a good match for the fight at the end, but all the other films were hit. I need to ask myself if the old Chuck can't just depend on the better. What? She was so low that she should stop the junk like this and hope that her reputation will take her through the whole movie? Chuck is an amazing military artist, and as we saw from Walker, Texas Ranger, a good actor, but the trick is to combine all these qualities in his movies, and this is not recommended. It is very sad for Norris fans. Chuck, stay like the main character in your movies, because this doesn't work for you ... Gary
