So you can have some of the comments posted on this film, and you may wonder, "Huh. There is a point of view of the REVIEWS group on December 30." Interestingly, many of these rave reviews like them come from that person, or to a large extent, the "Open House" coordination group. True, my friends, is that this film is not quite known. Because it is "self-reliant" does not mean that you get free money. If you make music, whether on a film or in action, be on Broadway or in a community playground, you should make sure that (a) your executives can sing, (b) your executives can play, (c) you have sound equipment well, (d.) you have a well-written, and (e) you have words that are beautiful and interesting. Even Anthony Rapp can't save this. It is one of the unfortunate experiences of the film where I actually felt very embarrassed for everyone involved.
