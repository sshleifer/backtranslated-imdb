Full demolition of time <br /> <br /> Halla Bol is a perfect waste of time. Script and discussion were not well written, the direction is lacking and the boundaries of acting on hammy. bad practice, good direction and social power messages that have never been preached but have been shown. Compared to the closest jewel, Halla Bol takes a step back by using items such as a leaked brave on the Persian rugby and a brave consultant playing shooting down the truck! All of this could be acceptable in the 80's when there was a decline in the quality of films and bad movies like DivyaShakti and Phool Aur Kaante were beaten very much, but the film's decision had been_be was a_this wise and thoughtful. </ <Rajkumar Santoshi is a competent director and I am glad that he wants to give a social message in every movie he does but maybe he doesn't know how to do it! He travels to talk regardless of whether the listeners' minds are trying to understand what he is trying to say. Maybe he should focus on entertainment and leave a social message for Rakeysh Mehras and Aamir Khans. Even if you agree with everything I say, you will agree that during the investigation you will be thinking that Rang De Basanti was the best and Mr. Santoshi deserved to leave the industry for Om Shanti Om. Industrial-burn? That's right !! Santoshi has shown this sector as the right back place, filtering and the bed bed that the hero enjoys with the star known to Sania. There are other people who will think that these parts are showing the real face of the industry. Don't believe everything you see! All of them, mount your voice against this movie and do not use your hard money on this bomb. <br /> <br /> * out of ****.
