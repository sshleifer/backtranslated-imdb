Appearing attractive, but falls flat in the natural department. This stimulating excercise in the style becomes thin after the opening battle. Jude Law has a choral toast burnt, but in its defense this film has some of the worst talks I've ever seen on the big screen. In fact the script is very bad and continues to take you out of the film, making me think about work, bills, my dog, etc.. There is a lot of time that cries bluescreen. Paltrow is like the wood they get. This can be saved by the film's film snappy film or on top camp. My only complaint about the technique is that the black and white film (sorry, the computer) would be helped because it looks like a colorized black and white Turner. Just a thin clich√© mess. I would like to break my femur than to stay through this test patience again.
