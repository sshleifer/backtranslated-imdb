Well, here we've had another attempt to turn the movie. There were many worth watching, despite the exhaustion of the change of gender. However, this is not. In the preliminary audit, I think I have made my point on the overall decrease in the enjoyment of Haim movies that followed 80 years. This is one of them. One 'Girls' is about Corey Haim, who tries to avoid her escort by dressing like a girl and attending another school. She shares the cheerleading squad and makes friends with cheerleader counterparts, Marie (Nicole Eggert). In fact, he cannot continue with the pastor for too long. I thought that this film was stuck, and it was not even amazing. But, based on many views, it seems like the fans of Alanis Morrisette or the young lady of the sex, Nicole Eggert, are the only ones who would like to look at this. If you are looking for a good feature of Haim (or the role of changing comedy), don't see again over 1989. That's about the stage that Haim's work started.
