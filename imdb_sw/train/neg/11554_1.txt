This movie is shy to make text. I can't believe it was even listed as comedy - not funny. It's not just that the script was angry, but the cast people should be shot. Gail O'Grady is just a good actor, but more of it ... 99% of the other lost ... auch. Pretty much everyone else ... wow is hard even ... wow. Here is one code of the number about comedy "JUST NEED". There are many talented actors in Canada who can make drama and comedy - none of them used in this film. Canadian preference and disposal directors help develop bad decisions in Canada. I know this is a "US" film, but look at the director, administrators, location, etc. I've seen this in Bravo - they should be embarrassed that they bought the rights to show this film. Again, there are many beautiful films out there that can't find during the air and show this trick.
