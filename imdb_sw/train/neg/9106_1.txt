From the opening of the opening you will see how they have worked hard to be more confident and capable of 'Violence', and how it was flat. You will also see the terrible choice they made by throwing Robin Dunne as Valmont ... Then in the second area, you meet two beautiful things in this movie, Amy Adams and I Rogers like Kathryn and her mother. That is, if you can pass the fact that Kathryn did not have a blonde in the first film ... Then the movie goes, you see a romantic story from the past miles, and you see Sebastian already encountered Anette in the past, here is called Danielle, and Cecile, here named Cherie ... How originally is that for prequel. Then it turns into a film under 'Wild Things' by lots of lots of oh-my. As I said, Robin Dunne was a very bad choice. Not that he is a good actor, he is good. He just doesn't have a charisma Ryan did. Amy Adams, who is my opinion one of the talented young people of our time, once again offers. But for all the world talents, there is no way that can save this garbage. In general, this "movie" feels like 'Beverly Hills, 90210' section. Items have been stolen from 'Violence Restrictions' and 'Jawbreaker' ... Yes, they used symbols from JAWBREAKER ... Did you? Can't leave it alone? You will need to pass this. If you want many brutal barriers, see the Liaisons Risks of Stephen Frears.
