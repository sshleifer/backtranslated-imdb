The only reason this movie has been tested is that zero is not one of the selection options. For a more concrete plot than cabbage soup, a terrible acting, and special effects that appear to have come from the TV series "Thunderbirds", it is amazing that Widmark did not kill the director of this black mark on his journey. Even with the 1950s, special effects are angry, except for a couple of less water. I can only assume that it was chosen for more special effects because, except for 20,000 Leagues under the Sea and THEM!, It had no one else doing harm. In fact he did not have a Disney race that year if this was just their race. I can't recommend the film, even to the cage of the cage based on the castle, as the most realistic submarine area had a single shot where sea water could be seen falling below the top inputs. There are other, better, small films that you can enjoy from this moment, such as Ligue 20,000 described or Torpedo Run.
