The most unusual movie about a man who had religious religious hippie religious service in 1960, who fights for sixteen years later. The man has a child with another pastor, who during the raid and the police is hidden, and taken by another man called Hawk who lives in a small cabin near the river. Worship kills some of his followers or some people in the city. It is difficult to keep track of characters who are, or when events should be done. The leader disappears sixteen years later (I got it from the box - I missed the film time). No one looks at any old person, nor is it obvious, however. One killer is carried out with a large circular saw, others are made with knives or rainbow. I have never heard the name of the title of the title mentioned in the film, but he is the most active, voting and screaming. <br /> <br /> The movie is patched along pretty pretty, with a voice-over help (not much) to express what's going on. Some sound effects were very bad. The man is beaten, and we hear the sound of the whip. The woman blows a gun, and we don't hear the fire, but hear the ricochet instead! It doesn't seem to have been done for a pleasant effect.
