Good movies are original, others leave a message or touch you in some way, but sometimes you don't feel it. <br /> <br /> I wanted something simple, not just thinking a clear step when I look at this. It started well and was quite entertaining, why it is a bad review. At the end the movie lost trust. This story was not quite interesting, the action was not very special but good overall, working was the same, so more than enough to meet my needs. But they are all destroyed because things happened above, and they left me with a bad feeling. They should put a little more effort in doing everything reliable and they would get 7 in "no one just think of a clear" group action. So in conclusion if you know you're going to get angry because things seem to be quite legitimate: don't look at it! otherwise I would like to go ahead ...
