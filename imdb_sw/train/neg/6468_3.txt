It's a good thing The Score came for Marlon Brando as a resort function because I would hate to think she'd go out of Free Money. It's not what his fans should remember. <br /> <br /> Brando in his last years is looking more like Orson Welles and Free Money is a kind of film Welles would have made his money search for his own work. Brando is an administrator of a local jail in America, when it is in a small rural environment is usually the most common employer in the area. That gives the person with a lot of money. Unfortunately she has one weakness she includes, her two twin bums known as daughter. Even when they are pregnant when one of the lost widows, Charlie Sheen and Thomas Haden Church, their hearts still belong to Daddy <br /> <br /> Do not be afraid because Brando has agreed to give them work in jail where they work under no better conditions prisoners. What to do, but do the trafficking of trains that go through the area regularly often carry money used to be burned by the Treasury. Although Funds have money during the downturn, for a long time it is under the talent of all involved. Some of them include Donald Sutherland as a devastating judge like Mira Sorvino as his grandson, but also a FBI member of the direct. Of course these people and others had to work with someone who had a high level as a great American actor of the last century. It was not for the presence of Brando and it was 40 years earlier, Free Money would have played a car round in the American red where people could see how they were suffering. Or a sufficient test is made to purify them.
