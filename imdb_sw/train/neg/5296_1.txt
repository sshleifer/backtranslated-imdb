It's not a big fan of slasher as a form, but even with low levels of budget exploitation, this is actually a limp. Even on the level of magic and gore, it is very strange (there are both both, but it's all kinds of ... meh). Before the home video revolution, it may never have been released (although it may have it, after all, * 9th from outside websites * you played on the movie). Specifically there is one good (and highly effective-released) line in the whole movie; I think they stole from somewhere. Acting is one of the worst I've ever seen. I mean, even Ed Wood had two potential participants, and some liked to be a few hammy, which could be fun to watch. However, most of its executives could pass much like learning. Here, those who do not read their line as the smokers of cigarettes seem like they learned by phone. And this film has one distinction: it can be very bad for many films, and then overlapped by the end. <br /> (Finally: I should have chosen to play a role play as a servant. Not that he is good, but certainly not wood.) , but with this, there is no even seem to have anything there to work on ethical temperatures over. Do you know the funniest thing? They expected to do good! <br /> <br /> It is so rough and stimulating that it is amazing in a wonderful way. I sat in the video for many videos wondering why anyone would go to trouble making it.
