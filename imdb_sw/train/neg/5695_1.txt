This film is described as an act / comedy. The first 15 minutes and the presence of James Belushi suggests that the group's arrogant film. However, the introduction of ignorant female leadership begins a large number of ignorant acts that are not hidden. The movie goes between comedy (information is used freely) and a drama on some of the adult events being played in. The head of the head (Angel of the title) does not work and the actor has not been helped by the script that is amazing, the odds displayed. James Belushi is the only one who handles his part properly but is also allowed by the poor script. One to avoid.
