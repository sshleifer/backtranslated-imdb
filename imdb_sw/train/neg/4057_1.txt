This is a very interesting film. If you grew up in Vietnam it was, as I did, then you have seen and heard all the photos of the film and move here a hundred and now. But what makes this film boring is a description of Carlton Sherwood's director. Most of the films are sown by Sherwood to speak directly into the camera about his views of the current anti-national history. If you are old to remember Vietnam, then you have won 't get anything new here. There is no new evidence to judge John Kerry or new evidence requiring another document in Vietnam. Small viewers who are interested in the subject should see the best film George Butler go Go! The stolen honor was meant to be a protective job against John Kerry, but it failed to achieve this goal.
