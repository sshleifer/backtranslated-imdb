I won't say this movie was bad, but it wasn't good either. I expected a good thing but I think Hum Aapke Hain Kaun was much better than this. This was quite old. At each stage of this film, I was hoping to lose and get what? The girl gets burned and will win her aunt's love. Even if they are involved, they should take consent for every small step they do. They are darn shy even after many meetings. I expected aunt to be more cruel than that. All he did was clapping madly. Hey, we have children too, but we don't watch them and we have tears in our eyes. This movie is a dream. Happy family, one cruel woman, a good wife and a man who loves to die. In HAHK Anupam Kher was the father of the poor and is now the opposite. And I somehow knew that Mohnish Behl would be in this film. However I believe I have lost my time. I offer 2/10.
