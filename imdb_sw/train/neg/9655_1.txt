I finished watching this film even before even through any comments, at the request of a woman. Because of curiosity, I thought, let me know if there are people who recommend others to watch this film. I am so surprised to find a long and positive comment on this site that makes it conclude that it is a scandal. <br /> <br /> In addition to my opinion goes, I need to ask, "Do these filmmakers have lost or do they think that the audience lost?" The movie is angry on many levels and I even talk about stories or presentation. So, this group of guys with one girl (leading actress) to create a Music band; The guessing from the constant presence of guitar should be a ROCK band. Hell, where did the players begin to be part of the Rock Harbor? However, I would like to admit as a voice-of-the-rock-band, but in fact all the symbols that actually had these two guitars do all sorts of "ROCK GESTURES" and I think they were playing instruments, the guitar sound was is completely lost! I can't understand the magnitude of folly here ... <br /> <br /> I'm going to complete here because it is not good to mark any errors in the movie. The voice directors seem to be embarrassed again !!!!!!!!
