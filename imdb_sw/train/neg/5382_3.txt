Of course young minds, this piece can appeal to a crowd of 20 people, who are still trying to find their place in the world, while investigating every neurosis. However, I do not think that a large amount of narcissistic -veling-gazing, humorous humor, or banal thing will be particularly cooperating with anyone more than 30. , it is used with amazing amazing images for comic effects, which fail to be overthrown in any real way. However, one should give a number of styles for film artists, who usually grew up in a video generation, and using each of the editing techniques considered in the book to destroy an unusual plot. There are 2 points to remember here. First, beware of the concert lovers. Second, although we live in youtube age, not everyone's account of their daily life deserves great treatment. But young filmmakers have the right to make their films, and if the other 20-somethings can find something in it to recognize, then all the better. However, I could not help but think at the end of this film how this recent generation, which now comes to age, will happen in the real world that gives many challenges and problems. At the age of every child being reassured on a regular basis, and that they all deserve 15 minutes of access, confidence and ability to cope with the problem is not appropriate for this generation.
