I had to do research on film artists to get this film board because the title is now an unexpected Love. It's not worth checking but I didn't have the usual instructions and I wonder why they were describing the lesbian flick on Lifetime. Everything is blocked and you have no idea who these characters, as a viewer, could not have an emotional investment in the story. I think it's not the target audience for this but I don't know who it is. Everything has been tamed and tons of the world ... nothing is very interesting. I was determined to see two women go out but it is dealt with courage that I was desperate. Use Better Business instead.
