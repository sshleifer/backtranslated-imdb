In 'Carrie' and 'Heathers'? Try 'innocent of both of these two films, but' Evil 'and' Light 'also. He said, they don't have bad movies like this again, and that's a shame, because it's gas. The Rainbow Harvest is a substitute for Winona here, and though she does more than wiping her line (and often screams, 'WANT !!!' in her haunted glass), she is Goth way before fashion, so you should respect him. (And she is also creative on it too, accessorizing with red scarves scarves and a kind of black-spray-painted Hawaiian-Punch-guy hat .. Eat your heart out, Cher.) Karen Black overacts slightly, but not quite without respect, and you can't help but sympathize with him. (Unless you are a friend of mine, who asked, 'Who is, There is a horse from' MASH '?' The first time you came to the screen.) <br /> <br /> There is a beautiful display of Kristin Dattilo (as a player a square who is a friend of Rainbow), Ricky Paull Goldin (in his trade of hunecracking hunk), and William `Larry, Darryl and Darryl 'Sanderson (as some kind of pet farmer, or something). But it's sad to see the smokin once 'Yvonne DeCarlo cuts play which can only be considered as Charlotte Rae section <br /> <br /> The eight is a heyday day for hilarious, deliberately uninhabited horror movies like this, and' Mirror , Mirror 'was the last one of its kind. Certainly worth checking.
