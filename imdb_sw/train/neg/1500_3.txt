Oh, this is very bad, it's wonderful. The only way a person can describe something like this is the sex party and drugs that caused the resolution to make the movie just for fun. I mean: you get to see unsafe sex actors, sexually assaulted, then killed by human mutants. There's a lot of gore, including the classic "something wrong with him, oh no, it's half the man he was" with an emergency murder caused by panic. But you can also find interesting things like the intestines that are kept through a man with a boy who walks into the bushes and then finds himself wrapped in a wire bound between two trees (which makes the sound of the future voice, like in cartoons). Somehow there is a market for people who go beyond porn, they need to know what is in the male actress, just gender is not enough. So you get to see a lot of summary tips on the deadly bimbo. No NO dialog. Jenna and Chasey have a very small part and I wonder what Richard Grieco wanted when accepting the responsibility here. I think this is one film that should look at the fastest and just look at the juicy things, just a reminder of the old movie class of the awesome class.
