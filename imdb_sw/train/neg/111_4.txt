My intention in Dorothy Stratten has led me to buy this video. Although it had great actors / actors, there were many things that continued to keep interest. Plus was not just interesting. The discussion was complicated and confusing and the story was so striking to be reliable. I had been disappointed in what I believed was one of the last movies of Audrey Hepburn. I will always love John Ritter better in slapstick. He was very heavy here.
