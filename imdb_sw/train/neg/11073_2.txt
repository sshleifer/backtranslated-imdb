This is very serious and attacking for Canada. We grow good wine. Our writers and poets are among the best in the world. National Ballet is ranked among the top five companies in the world. But we do wonderful wonders! This is not the worst. It is typical and bad, beaten in two small hotels and public parks and narrow trends, high school level working with "gee whiz ... lets you see what this button on the camera does?" photography. If Michael Moriarity was willing to make a simulation of Jack Nicholson, could he do at least the best of Jack Nicholson? And if the movie was shot Vancouver, actually one of the most love cities in the world and also the yacht building center (part of the "plot") why in the name of God we then that common Canada inferior inferiority forcing to hide as Seattle ??? Not only I like on this film, I am ashamed and more embarrassed. Astronomers provide many royal items. We produce the second level of a large piffle. Gawd !!!!!
