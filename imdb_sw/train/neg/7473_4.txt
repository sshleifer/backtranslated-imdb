My husband and I were interested in the concert - a powerful South African woman to solve a crime for LAPD. The first season was a must-see TV for us. Unfortunately, the stories of his personal life in the second season were provocative and inappropriate behaviors that we left to manage. My husband and I were suffering with a place where he is trying to hide the mother fact that he is shacked up. But the breach of the program was a place where he hid his pregnancy as much as possible from his boyfriend but he tells his master. Why does a strong woman in the middle do these things? The answer is that he did not want. In addition, my husband and I are looking for a bad person for the perfect accuracy. It is almost every white man or woman brought in to come into the scene of death or in a suitable family. What? The script writers can not do the original thing regularly? As I said, we can't be viewers again. We prefer the exhibitions that do not betray the perpetrators and destroy our minds.
