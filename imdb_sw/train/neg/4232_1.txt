Karl Jr and his father are now driving an army on a remote island. They catch three people on the island. Who over time fight back. (well victims) This has a non-stop blood, gore and murder, which would have been good if any of it looked away in fact, or if the production was not seen as if it was done by a weekly lunch worth saved money (I might be more powerful there perhaps it was only a few days). The dreadful Dubbing did not bother me and I suspect if I was too drunk, some of it could be a little humorous .... maybe. But as it is, for just 78 minutes the movie still feels a very long way and .. Oh don't know ... 78 minutes. Do not waste your time. <br /> <br /> My bridge: F <br /> <br /> Additional DVD: movie Bonus: "Zombie '90: Increased Disease"; and Trailers for other Shock-o-Rama released film
