If I could give ZERO stars for this, but unfortunately I must give one ... <br /> <br /> No one place I could laugh about ... but the game didn't make me laugh either. So if you are people with a disability, go to your local movies, watch this film and give 10 stars, as some people here have already done. but to me ... on a film where children are shot dead to achieve humor ... good taste goes over the edge ... this was the third time I lost my time to see the Boll film and it was obvious completely! <br /> <br /> 0/10 ... I'm ashamed to be from one country like Uwe Boll! <br /> PLEASE PLEASE Set him from creating more MOVIES !!!!!
