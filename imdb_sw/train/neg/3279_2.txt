Oh Geez ... There are many other films that I want to see out there ... I agreed with my nephew for the weekend and this was what she wanted - Yes ... I used to watch this show when I was at university ... was unwise, enjoyable , and describes a certain step. The show had a good heart tho ... and the characters were cute; no one has ever been killed or even hurt badly ... it was like a cartoon is coming. Cut until 2005 ... What happened? This doesn't work. If others said, there is only a story of cooperation and the exhibition is weird ... almost angry - definitely not loyal to the original characters ... The whole thing is like a TV TV Mad and lasts more than 100 minutes! This was one of the few times I've been EMBARRASSED watching the movie. What were they thinking about? As best I can say, it must be for sale of goods, toys, etc.. What I have said is, then let this man die a quick death. It makes the original Dukes of Hazzard appear as the Theater of the Head ... I think the only remake left from the TV is the Gilligan Island ... Good luck!
