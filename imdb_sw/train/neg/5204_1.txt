"Trigger Man" is definitely the worst and most silliest movie I ever seen in my life. Best Aunt's holiday videos. <br /> <br /> Officials seem to be employed on uglypeople.com. They do not have any talent to act in a convincing way. <br /> <br /> They go and walk and walk through the forest. There is more to walk around than in all three parts of the "Lord of Rings" together. After the first hour, I started reading the Porsche brochure when I watched "Trigger Man" along the way. Hasila. <br /> <br /> Damage of time and money. I would like to give 0 stars of 10 stars, since this is not possible, I must give 1 star.
