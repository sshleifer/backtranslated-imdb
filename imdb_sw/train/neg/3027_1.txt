If it looks like litter and if it looks like rubbish, it must be desired. That is one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my entire life. Tony Scott's poor mentor puts shame on the strange and untrue stories of Domino Harvey's life as a treasure hunter. The story is completely gone and combines look. Some aspects of the plot were ignorant and not entirely understood. It seems that all practical events were linked to privacy and bad points of conspiracy and acting wrong. Keira Knightley is not completely naked in this one though. That's the one and only the top of this film. If you want to see naked quickly the movie up to one and a half hours in it and you'll get a lot of nipple. I strongly recommend that no one sees this film EVER! </ 3
