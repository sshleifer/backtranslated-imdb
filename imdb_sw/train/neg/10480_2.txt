It has a great name, but that and you don't get more of it for your money, in fact the first 30-40mins of the movie you can find is kind of funny but after the story goes from one side to the other and there is no reason for you you can't understand what is happening until the point goes. However, producers (Roberto Angel Salcedo) calls him an actor, but I don't think he does it may be unknown but overturning !! .... period. A child who plays as a child does not have a sense of action and I believe it was only a grace he did or something because he had no clue about what he had done. <br /> <br /> For some reason when making a casting thought that by hitting the comedians they could do it, but it wasn't !! and sometimes the cheap humor is so bad, I don't obey. But this hope is bad if it gets. To make people accept these DVDs for the good taste of the public they should provide food with it, which can work out. <br /> <br /> Maka
