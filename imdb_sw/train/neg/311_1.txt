I have finished looking to the board. I tell you that we should send every copy of this film to Iraq and make them look. I even tried to find the blind women to look at this and put it away as 20 minutes. Adam Sandler could not get a better project than this? For writing, if you want to call it, those involved should be forced to watch this film forever in hell! I believe that somewhere I read that this film budget was $ 10,000 and they were way down. Wallmart got a good deal on this? Each shop has a great big bin of this craft flooring sales. The only thing about this movie is you can use the DVD as a coaster, or business with a friend, but then they can be your friend again!
