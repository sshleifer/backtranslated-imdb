Happy Go Lovely is losing time for everyone and talent including audience. The stability of the old identity of the hat and the fate of the scandalous thinking is completely forgiven. Very few people watched these movies for their squares. But, often they had a few interesting characters involved in streams - not here. From time to time they had interesting choreography and interesting and interesting songs. Not fun Going to Lovely. And Vera-Ellen as a female guide played the whole movie as a second banana looking at the stars for the stars - and instead was called on the film, and she could not do it. Scotland area lost. Usually direct to any Scottish whimsy liquid does not exist. Photography was a trip. Music numbers were on foot. Cesar Romero offers its normal academic performance, chewing the environment because no one else has done its part, for the role of the most frequently tested producers by Walter Abel and Adolph Menjou. David Niven is very good, and no one can make David Niven like David Niven. At the end of the day, if you serve Niven like me, it is enough reason to lose 90 minutes on Interesting Fun. If not, skip.
