In general this film is awesome, and should not be done. One of the problems with this movie is that there is no link to viewers and characters, for example, if he has almost attacked, you want to feel, "Oh my God, No!", But you don't have in this case, you don't care because no link was made to know the character . In the trailer, it seemed like a movie would be good, but no doubt what so ever true. There may be some secret but no. "All she has is a tool of tools." said on the back of the DVD, you would like to think that it was carefully planned this movie, and with cunning, but not, lastly, it was very, very similar, and worthless. Acting is moderate or less moderate, perhaps even less. In my opinion it was a waste of one hour of my life. "Special effects" and sets were moderate too, nothing special what so ever. There is not a big cloud, or blood violence, not much blood displayed. This film was announced to be quite amazing, but in fact, it doesn't even seek, I recommend this to anyone, except possible, and a few clashes with a fascinating story.
