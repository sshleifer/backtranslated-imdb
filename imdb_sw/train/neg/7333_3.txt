I enjoyed feeling for a few minutes of opening, but 20 minutes I was using a quick button. The biggest Shots of Stewart (Michael Zelniker) walk from room to room, down the road, through the doors and down the road, and many shots he looks to look and confused. Give me the impression that the story was meaningful for a short time (20-30 minutes), and then it was put in the element as a work of love between Mzito's director and star Zelniker (wrote the screen configuration). <Br /> <br /> It may be more entertaining if any of the characters had anything to say that I had never heard of other films before, or if the end was not - a disappointment - that I had predicted three minutes in the film (atypical for film) independent / small label). At least his heart was in a good place - it was not your usual formulaic Hollywood manipulative nonsense.
