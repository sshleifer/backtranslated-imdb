The beautiful child of Portly falls with luscious blonde; he also likes, but not the reason you can think. The black-seen black comedy from Pat Proft's author has a very good exhibition by Joe Alaskey and Donna Dixon, but it is not recommended permanent effect. It's just an attempt to quit, assisted by Norman Bates himself, Anthony Perkins. Even on the B-comedies level, the same-same "Eat Raoul" is the best bet. There is definitely exciting amusing here; unfortunately, the picture has no chance to go into his second act. An exciting attempt, but it damages. ** /> ​​<br /> ** from ****
