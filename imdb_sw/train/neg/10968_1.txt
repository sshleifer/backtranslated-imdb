*** SERVING SOME PEOPLE, PEOPLE OF PEOPLE, DO NOT WORK IN, IN THE WORK IN THE RIGHT FOR RIGHTS *** <br /> O my God, where do I start? Well, here - this is the first time I have come home from the film and said "I need to IMDb and write a review right now. It's my civil duty." That's the evil of this flick. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * \ t I am not Harvard-art-great-film-black-weenie (in fact, I went to university on the other side of Mass. Ave in Cambridge, where true people who do not have wealth and faith money go, which should put me easily in the group The nerd-census-who would have been obsessively-loving-comic-book, and still hated this film ...). My preference to watch is for the work of the top movies that includes the Park, Bond flicks, Advocate, and Grail. I love Titanic has never been sinking, not so much for lost life, but so we can't be under the same button. And one reason and the only anticipation of the snooty French art film is like there is limited and often disrobed Emmanuelle Beart in it. I even gave a maximum of the maximum of one of the 10th of its value here to IMD, for God. So I am not as severe, so I did not criticize this film because I am looking for the quality of the movie - it's because Elektra is like a goat that died for three weeks. * to stop suppression * <br /> <br /> Well, there is so much evil here I need to try to place it. Here goes: <br /> <br /> MS. GARNER: One of the reasons for compelling a man would like to see this flick is to see lots of JGar (I don't know why my wife wanted). I think between this and "Get Nemo", the latter was a sexier film. Do you know the red wear that has been announced to wear on every freaking ad you see? You see him in TWICE - once in the beginning, once at last. Bummer. At rest, he essentially looked like what Morrissey looked like he was a woman - many dresses and black. That brings me to the amazing exhibition of JGar shows in his act - from "advocating" all the way to "advocate and right". O my God, you would have thought he had been forced to do on Ben Affleck or something terrible like that. Um, waiting for the ... / SIGNATURE OF GUAD / GAL: They show about the same level of expression and action that you would like to expect from a little. At least close to JGar's performance, it has not stopped. One boy's role is to stand there and be great, another is standing there and having things from him, and the woman's role is to stand there and breathe on and / or kiss the people. They can pull this amazing disappearance. The worst person has the most difficult role of all - he needs SIMULTANEOUS a) appear angry and b) seen Asia. He does a good job for this. I think there was a fifth bad man / gal, but my brain has begun to block the parts of this film for self-defense. ! This movie has many wonders as a lecture by the National Democracy. Let's put this way - my wife, who has just been the United States for half a year and speaks only a bit of English - he criticized me when the first girl appears on the JG pad, and I swear by God I'm not doing it: "She goes home to kill a girl and the father also. " And this is before the father appears on the screen. Now my wife is not stupid, but she has not been used by Mensa for her gifts, or, and she has had zero for Daredevil or a kind of comic book. And she thought this out in 1,00015 seconds without passing and no information before. That is clear of this film. <br /> <br /> IN-IN-INSIDE STUPIDITY! Okay, so there is this great dude in the film. He can take a shotgun explosion and shoot as a bullet, and he can take an error of Electra on the chest and just hit it (or sprinkle it - or something - more protection to enter, thank God). But JG jumps over his head, and rises? Noggin's Achilles? OK! That is the stupidity of this film. Ack. I begin to feel the lack of brain blood to come, so I must leave it. But you have been warned. If you have to hit your tires deliberately to protect yourself and to see this film, Make. And if Armageddon will come, please let us be in front of this on the DVD.
