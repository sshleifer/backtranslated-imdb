A couple goes to their dream house, not knowing that she and her neighbors have been built on the ground that had previously been used as a cemetery. The film is said to have taken into account the true story, although how much it is supposed to be true. The plan is not the only one - see Spielberg 'Poltergeist' (1982). For a short time, they find various unusual events: these are from the shadows of a strange-looking, ill-tempered daughter - for real deception - toilets always come out and the garage doors come out. There is a deep story: once it has been confirmed that the land is used as a cemetery, we do not learn anything more. The program does not appear to develop. The characters are not found well or in any way remembered, nor is the situation very specific. Film may be concerned for a particular audience. No sense of catharsis or any kind of positive message from him.
