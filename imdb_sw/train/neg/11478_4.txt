I am wondering that retired @ IMDb released this TV film as a high rating as they did. It is a blameless, sweet, non-complicated photograph that had two names from the back inside of it (all who did a good job), but the reeks of the underground budget work we can see any day of the week on the small way of cable. I would like a good romance with anyone, but as I and my wife have looked at this - and before seeing the rating - we said, "There are people who will weigh this film too because there is nothing in it to challenge their mind, their faith, the level of comfort or their cultural preferences. It is possible to make such a good film (and far from him is an example), but this was at an hour of age. For some of the most beautiful films it was much lower than this. In fact, another in a long line of inappropriate films Look at the family stone. It's a mile in front of this schlock.
