Robin Williams gave good performance to the Night listener as did the other delegates. However, the film seems to be running and it takes away many of the freedoms that are considered "must be seen." I think the problem is happening because there is not enough adequate connection between the phone caller and Gabriel Noon (I had to call it this way, because IMDb wants auto to fix the correct spelling for "No") behavior. The film runs more than 1pm and within the first 15 minutes, or so it seems, the day begins his search for Pete Logande, a young caller. This happens after talking to a wonderful 3 or 4-time caller. Talks don't matter much about how you are ... I'm in hospital ... why your outdoor partner ... etc. In the book, the child is almost reduced to the day of Noon Versa and the reader understands why he is going to look for this young man, once he sees the child disappears and thinks he can be hoax. <br /> <br /> In the movie, Noon faces the search for Logande, but viewers are left to ask why? Since there is really no solid guarantee of solid between Noon and caller, why are you worried? Who cares if the caller doesn't exist? I know there is a difference between the book and the movies, but the call and connection was important to set up on the screen, because it provides the basis for all films. Since it is not suitable, the film falls off. This is amazing because of the other work of Maupin, City Tales. When it was made a mini series, it worked well.
