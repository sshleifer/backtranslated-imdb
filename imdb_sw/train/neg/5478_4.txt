There is nothing better to do that I decided to explore "Rex Aztec" (as paid) spiritually. <br /> <br /> Silly stories could be better if the dinosaur effects were persuasive. In fact they were seen as drawings (rough drawings that artists use later to complete the effects of CGI, add more details, smooth movements, etc.) The most frightening dinosaurs, which is the only reason you would like to stay this way. One reason for redemption was Dichen Lachman as good as Ayacoatl. He set my interests; if only the budget was closed and some of the dinosaurs of lobby can be used. At least people sent by workers got a free trip to Hawaii, where the film was made.
