The Japanese director of Takashi Miike can not be seen to find the moving wheels and this stupid surprise, to solve the book of Yasushi Akimoto about an old woman (and an abusive child!) Who is part of a new urban story: if your mobile phone rings and sounds amazing - and you can see the message 'One Mobile Phone' - you will send the message just to hear your last words before your death. The most successful part of this film is the satire of a series of Reality TV cameras for future victims, but unknown deaths (which include a piece of red candy!) It is a desperation and a fight. Regular shots of damaged corps are carefully observed, and all this gentleness may be the reason why the film is finally so. Hollywood predicted a descent on a far-off plot in 2008, but the version of U.S. not done much better. NO STARS from ****
