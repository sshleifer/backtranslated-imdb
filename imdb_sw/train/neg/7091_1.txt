This film was very fast and I can't believe what I saw. It's shot on VIDEO! SI film! I have not seen these favorites since the beginning of 70 years, when nighttime networks showed a shot of "week of fear" in the video ....... It looks like a bad soap opera, and that's paying compliments. Some actors offer their best shot. Michael Des Barres does exactly what he was given to do, which is acting as an addict sex without control. I can't say that it is advisable to look at. <br /> <br /> Nastassja Kinski as a professional seated chair for the entire film, and very small differences in the camera of the camera. I can't blame him for the poor one, but he really believes in his role. Her little girl's voice works against her here. And I feel like a fan of Nastassja Kinski. He is certainly uninhabited and foreign, but he is out of his kind with this. Alexandra Paul is very corrupt. Each line he takes is three points of enjoyment. One must lead him to shout at all costs. Why Michael Des Barres wants to have sex with such a strong shrew? Finally, Rosanna Arquette as a good wife, the injured one comes right out, and maybe more trusted to the group. But that's not much. <br /> <br /> This must be the worst films I saw in years.
