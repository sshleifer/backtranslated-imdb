I was hoping that this would be a wonderful show, due to all parts of the wind and clever. And talking about the breach, I've heard an interview with the creator of show on BBC World Today - a show that takes place around the world. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this show does not even close to offer. All jokes are obvious - the kind that seems to be the first time you hear them but afterwards appear to be lame - and do not get any new or lost treatment. All characters are one-dimensional. Acting is - very good (I am good). It is a catalyst for the classic CBC - one that always fails. If you are a Muslim I think you would be foolish to believe in any of the white characters, and if you are white you might be a little guilty of the fact that almost every white characters are shown as either beaten, unknown, or all two. It is not that hateful white people is a problem - most of the best comedies are rooted in it. It's just a problem when it's not funny - like this show. Canada comes with funny people - many that we export to Hollywood on a regular basis. So how do the producers of this show not get any?
