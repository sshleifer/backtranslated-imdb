The group is not really a movie. It is a movie of the wannabe, and the witches actors. Not with Richard Gere, he gave a good performance, but when only one of the characters volunteered to his character, and the rest were just doing ... the result was amazing, like this film. You see, the idea of ​​acting is to hide the fact that you're doing. What? Hell was what Claire Dains did this? He is the most improper actor for this character. In 99.9% of the movie looked very out of place, out of everything! The only thing he was doing was to ask stupid questions, if "you think so", and make silly faces. I was ashamed of her acting, seriously, and I was like him ... She's a kind of romantic movie, I don't know who chose him among all the executives there .... LOL, and seeing Avril Lavigne? This really made me laugh. However. If you want to get a sense of throwing, this film will work for you! I would like to vote - 5.
