This movie is not the same as the 1954 version by Judy Garland and James Mason, and that's a shame because the 1954 edition, in my opinion, is much better. I do not reject the talent of Barbra Streisand completely. He is a good actor and a talented singer. I don't know another job of Kris Kristofferson and therefore I can't give judgment on it. However, this film stops many calls. Faced slowly, has a free fraud and bad language, and it can be very difficult to stay. <br /> <br /> However, it's not a big fan of rock music, so it's just normal that I would like the best version of Judy Garland. Watch the 1976 film and Barbra and Kris, and judge yourself.
