I went through this shelf a few times, looking at a lot of great quotes (and small names) in front and wondering if I missed something. One night it was on one of the film stations, and I went in. I did not miss anything. I must admit that I just watched the first 30 minutes. Probably the movie becomes a golden comedy after that. Due to the slow pace, the plodding with a complete lack of laughter in the first 30, I am very doubtful. The leading actor begins the film in the classic "I don't know how to start my movie" style, having a very long time, very hard about how he didn't want to be judged. It's not funny. It is not even the most beautiful. Some have said about "San Franclisco" bit; ok, the small chuckle first says. Then he gives you down, exciting on the camera as the funniest thing is written. Get on your own. In fact, I think talking to a little camera is the reason I immediately love the film. Do not think skills with your audience. Knowledge is _earned_, as well as respect. <br /> <br /> From there you do not basically a guy with a color to speak in a very beautiful way about his beautiful life as temp. I did not know that he was a Jew; it is contempt for the Jewish warriors to call this "Jewish humor". It's an unpleasant humor. Because you are a Jew does not mean you have a knack for comedy. WASP, Spalding Gray, works better than self-humor than this person, obviously not on ethnicity. If one of the bits I saw has worked, I could stay close. But another club continues on how much she likes the names of women working with her, and then puts them for five minutes long, does not make a good movie. This is a clear attempt to expand on the popularity of "Space Space". Do not let yourself be a victim of target markets. Just say no to "Tunnel's Haiku".
