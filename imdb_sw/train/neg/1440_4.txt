Swayze does not make Alan Quatermain highly persuasive. Compared to Stewart Granger; which grew up was my last hero in the film like 1952 "Scaramouche", "Zenda's Prison" of 1952 and 1950 "King Solomon Mechanical"; Patrick Swayze is completely defeated. Even to be shown to the Alan Quatermain-aged and Sean Connery in the "Amazing Lords League" was very good in otherwise great. Alison Doody also does not have the grace of Deborah Kerr in the role of the woman who led, and the last but not less than Syrique's surprising position in Umbopa makes it difficult for anyone to fill (shoes) !!! For the person who was disappointed by the 1985 edition of Richard Chamberlain, I now strongly recommend if you can't find your hand on the granger version.
