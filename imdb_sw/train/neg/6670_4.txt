This movie has started too much. It was possible to change the story of romantic love and movies that wrote love between "Harlan" and Tobe in long scenes, poems and inappropriate. In fact he didn't need to be anything more than that, and for a little while there I was excited that someone would finally make a good film for himself, another classic timeless, modern story perhaps. Why, oh, why, then wipe it up through half by doing the leading character (Norton) other psychology? Maybe I'm not sure, but we need another film about psychology? Or is this need in Hollywood to show the patient's side of human nature symptoms of more malaise in the movie industry? For a little while there, I would like to make sense of the name of the director; now I'm left feeling different. At least it must be added in the defense of the film that all actors seemed to invest in their roles. Also, Evan Rachel Wood is really pleasing to look with a good actor with lots of lots.
