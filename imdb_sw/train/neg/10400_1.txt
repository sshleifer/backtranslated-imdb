Enough is enough ... sometimes they just need to stop making the film according to the concept that has been dead for a long time. The first movie drops was good. The second thing was ridiculous. The third was trembling. The TV series was very stressful. With this movie driving it more. Another foundation is computer effects and the price of puppetry, now we have a series set up in the Western District, the 1800s, and are fighting with graboids. If the first renewal, they should learn how to beat again. Without entertainment I think. Otherwise the direct-video release, like Matches 2 and 3, goes too far. Oh and I keep wondering how there is no record of these events happening ... do you? They just simply forget to record this unusual event? I think something like this will be to create history, so our pals in the first film won't be ready. It is just a movie that destroys nature only makes me crazy. Avoid this waste.
