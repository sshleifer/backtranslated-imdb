This film is very bad ....... and i mean really bad. Tony Scott is a bright director. from all the films that he has made me just as an enemy of the state, instead of being one of the worst directors at all. what I liked most was Richard Kelly (Donnie Darko director) made this screen. Richard Kelly is now an expert in my eyes but involvement in this makes the learning has learned his lesson. Now I love the new roles of Mickey Rourke but I don't know if he is in this because of the scary story and his look. do not make a mistake I still love Mickey Rourke but he has made the event in his time and this is one of them. I don't know about Keira knightly, I think she's a little too overrated. I just feel feel in him in the film. <br /> <br /> All in this film are all bad. That's .................... j.d Seaton
