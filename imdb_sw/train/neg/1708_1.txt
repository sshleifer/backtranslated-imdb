Well, I don't have much to say about this film, except this: I have seen more than 4,000 films in my life, and more than 2,300 of them were terrible films. Although I have difficulty deciding is the best (as opposed to my loved one, which I can tell you is the DAA of George A. Romero's WOMEN), I can tell you without hesitation that Todd Sheets' ZOMBIE BLOODBATH is the worst films that I've ever seen. Nothing / I can say anything about this film. Acting, discussion, lead, decisions, music ... Every aspect of this film is far less than what is acceptable that comes to my mind that this is even given. <br /> <br /> Even if you are a champion of fear or a movie zombie, please beware of me and do not waste your time on this trash. There is no joy found from watching this. You can't even find anything that makes you out of the absolute powerless ... I don't believe. Please.
