Sorry, but every time I see a film where a woman-shepherd strikes someone and someone has nothing but a cower, the film seeks all honesty. So the new Starbuck (woman) once deceived the plot before it even fell (no planned pun). Dirk Benedict had many more qualities like a multi-year-old hero than Kattee Sackhoff's sheep - who overacting probably be known as "exciting, exciting, must-see, breaking ground," and the political correct new speech editors of today's copy; but in fact, it's just tired, the old picture of a woman with a chip on her shoulder as big as a townhouse: the biggest picture on the screen today. I might give this one more lead series, but personalized caricatures did not implement it. As James Hilton shouted, "Stories, please, just give me a story."
