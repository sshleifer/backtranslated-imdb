This film is about a family trying to negotiate with the death of a mother / wife by moving to Genova, Italy. <br /> <br /> The plan of "Genova" seems to promise, but unfortunately it is empty and without behold. The film only contains a collection of events that show family life, like swimming, taking piano lessons or cooking eggs. Most of these events are serious and causing, can not completely involve the audience. The latter is very disappointing if it is not surprising, moving or emotional. I can safely say that I have been neglected and exhausted with "Genova" The only thing about the film is the sunny weather and beauty of Genova. "Genova" can be used as an expansion of the city, but not as a favorite movie.
