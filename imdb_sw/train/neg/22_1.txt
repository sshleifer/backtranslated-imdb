I saw this DVD in my home of friends and I think that this was a Turkish movie act and some Hollywood-not very big names in it. It was enough to decide to shoot a shot later. It was hard to bear experience believing me. Then, after finally seeing the credit score I am experiencing "We Turks actually absorb in Hollywood style film do .. This is insulting to heist | hostage genre .. 'but then wait! I watched some names and no, they were not Turkish names. and no, this was not a Turkish movie; on the contrary it was a real shot in the United States and a US director and staff! That made me think again! - Can the world influence the names like Micheal Madsen, Edward Furlong or even Arnold Vosloo to participate in the project and probably the money. That continues I think more. You can raise such a money to give it and is known to be thrown in the world? Then all my meditation will be paid and I have found the answer. to adjust your budget then: by writing and leading the movie you want to produce-or illegally I don't have any information about it- so down this is not a bad movie as everyone is engaging in presenting as. It makes you think-in my case even to think- and there are many movies out there that does not even provide that it affects. This at least makes you think; It makes you wonder. It leaves you without faith .. and then asks you again.
