Here we have a simple story about the little girl of nymphomaniac who has been involved in intellectual reserves, and since the first night already, has been taken into a drug network, psychedelic penalty, rape, torture and dildo-action. True, LOT's dildo-action. A sexually friendly nurse tries to warn her, but she has her throat fallen the same night.
