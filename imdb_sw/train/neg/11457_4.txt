OK. I know that you want to have John Hughes' s movie of 80's all flat straight, so the prospects for this film were very moving. However, after staying through this craft there is one important thing I can 't look out of my head: <br /> <br /> I just sit through Rob Lowe's 80 movie and the magic and the only views of sex in them. <br /> <br /> Work is bad, boring and flat characters, Oxford show is a general earthquake, and incoming, non-verbal, and inaccurate events. <br /> <br /> Unless you don't have Ally Sheedy or Amanda Pays (or I think, Rob Lowe), there's really no reason to see this.
