God, I am very sick from America called "Cartoons"! Since the anime was known, American animators provide a cartoon with a 5-year-old ass of drawing (Kappa Mikey) or some Japanese cheep animation rip-off. (Normally delete classic characters) Not amazing anime beating American cartoons! <br /> <br /> Don't even try again! Oh, I've just heard this last night; I live in the UK and when I got this first show in 2005, well, I never knew England was standing and presentations.
