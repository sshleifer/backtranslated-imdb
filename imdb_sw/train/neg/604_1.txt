Interested in this film, I felt I must warn others. This film has no story, plot or sense of purpose. The movie begins after the "scenario" scary film, which now every movie viewer has become accustomed. So we can ignore the very beginning. Recently we have been introduced to the main actor and from this point becomes clear to all that you have lost your hard prize and would better look at the static look. (Unless you have seen the white noise - EEK) Acting is a DISGRACE and all should return to the port of travel from where they came. After saying this, even the best actors in the world will strive to make this film more visible. Their poor demonstration only contributes to disaster. Unreasonable violence and what I can only think is the written word of another author who was junked up, who might think he is an artist, has caused a film that will try your patience. It wasn't until my friend turned to me and said, "We've been looking at this for 45 minutes" Do you? I realized that this film is thin and improper as a cup of tea without a tea bag. The obvious thing was lacking and unfortunately it was not the audience. Instead of suggesting what the film is missing, I would like to tell you what it has: Dumb Blonde (surprise surprise), Victims, something bad-boy, about 2 hours of a story that has been introduced over hours, days, weeks, months ... and features. <br /> <br /> Want a money lamp? Well, a blonde girl is a little saucy looking at some of the events, but expect you to see her face rejected for the rest of the film!
