I love Clash music and I love Joe Strummer and Mescaleros music. I went to this film with the hope of learning about someone behind many. But I came out of the playground without knowing more about Joe than I did after reading on Wikipedia. The movie never really finds for man, his thoughts and feelings. They did it to collect the little material they had, inappropriate videos and interviews with other people about Joe Strummer in the camp fire. It turns out that many of these people knew little or not, and that the director wanted only in the movie to have many other people who say, "Oh, he had a lot of inspiration for all of us". Like Bono or Johnny Depp (who seem to be asked to put her pirate outfits in order to benefit from her present achievements in the Caribbean Pirates). It seems that the director could not even wait until the body was cold before jumping in to sell his version of a "big rock of punk and hippie heart" who had ever lived, to sanctify a person without knowing the truth about it. > <br /> In fact, being a fan I enjoyed seeing the pictures of the band, I heard the back of the tracks of the songs and that, but the last I felt like what was left like Joe Strummer's picture could easily be told in 60-90 minutes. <br /> Go to see the film if you are a fan, otherwise better listen to the music of Clash or even the best Mescaleros unknown, where Joe Strummer reached the peak of his music development before his death, losing all his gravity together with one amazing voice.
