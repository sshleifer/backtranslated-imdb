This is probably the worst excuse for TV programs since, oh, I don't know, WHAT DOES THE NEED? Nothing happened on this "stupid" series. Although it's more shot by Britney and Kevin themselves, you don't have any good information in their personal lives. They are just more ignorant, good talk of the seat and acting as white garbage. Look, I would like Britney's music as a second child, but this is just a full-featured national for a country that has ever been to Britney that will look at her video (yes, which can be a real part). Thank you these two God broke, because they had fallen together. Show this is TOXIC!
