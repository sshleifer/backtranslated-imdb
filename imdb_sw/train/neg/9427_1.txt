When I hire "Unhinged", I was expecting a movie movie. The box said that the movie had great incidents of violence from the exhibition exhibitions (I now have a great concern about this released in the theater). Having finished the movie, I wondered how it could even receive a video. The plan is as follows: A group of three women on a car trip loses their car on a tree. These women somehow manage to make their way to the house, which has a very sexual woman. Beyond this stage, the film includes an improper image that aims to make the film long release. <br /> <br /> One of the things that makes this film bad is acting. Lisa Munson, who plays the main character, looks like she reads a cue card. Some do bad work, but not as bad as her. Another thing that makes this bad film is the camera method. Most shots are taken by the camera placed on the ceiling. This is very interesting as the movie continues. Above all, there is very little gore, which makes the box very misleading. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time on this. My rating: 1 out of 10
