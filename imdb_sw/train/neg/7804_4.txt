THE TEMP (1993) did not do a lot of trade shows, but here is a direct-video surgery you want, however! Ellen Bradford (Mel Harris) is a new woman in Millennium Investments, a top brokerage company, who is getting help from Deidre Secretary (Sheila Kelley). Deidre returns to be a girl of a proud tribe who stops anything to encourage the cooperative level, including screwing the broker on the top can not stand up and kill anyone who gets her side bad. She carries bones in Ellen's bedroom, trying to cause trouble for her husband (Barry Bostwick), kills when he makes it as he does, has arrested her daughter and tries to make her give money from the company. <br /> <br> Harris and Kelley provide a powerful display, a supportive trap is the same as well put together, but that doesn't fully compensate for a script that travels under a well-worn way and offers a few surprises.
