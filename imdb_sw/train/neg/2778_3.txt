This movie seems to be going for it with camera, sound, film, sets, music, dress ... but wheel, Gary Stretch spoke! I don't know if it's his bad job or just a bad script, but it would say it's both. Considering his arrest in this role, I found it difficult to multiply him even to the end. I wanted to be dead in battle or one of the arrows of a sword / knife. Then, the plot of the plot to kill the king is because the king had no dinner and sex with her. Queen? Positive disability. And go too far to kill his son? And then push up her boyfriend as a good king? I see a thread or two here and there of historical bytes, but how all that was presented was normal. I don't recognize Gary Stretch from anything else, but he was awesome. I read another user's comments about a voice called, but don't think that he was called ... after all, he speaks English, right? It was very bad. The line was read on the coroner table ... the flat line. It may be that she does not have a voice to carry a voice change. <br /> <br /> Besides, I watched it to the end, so the film was at least "interest." It can be more if the script / lines and throw were given more work. Photo and film workers and a very good film are what made this film all the other. Sent and stories were both secondary. I offer 10 film workers.
