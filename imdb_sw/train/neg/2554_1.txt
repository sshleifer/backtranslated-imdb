I am not happy when I say that this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen! This film is not suitable directly in its flimsy dialogue or its line of story clearly. I can't even start counting the number of objects in this film which is definitely released from "The Omen" and other similar movies. For example, the nanny "Lucy" in this film is actually one of the servants of the devil sent to lead and protect the spawn of Satan ..... Does this seem very much like Mrs. Baylock to any other person. Another thing is that the orphans were the first to get a baby burned under a few months after she was taken, as in "The Omen". However, one luck survived the fire and avoided the burning of all his body .... unfortunately? And above all from the priest who was killed is to stay in the hospital room and pictures of Jesus on the walls of the walls, such as the priest in the "Omen" with the pages of the Bible on the walls as a wall. Please do not even begin to begin to compare between the end of this film with "The Omen" for you because as I said above there is so much to mention here.
