"Dutch Schultz", AKA Arthur Fleggenheimer, was a real person with his very fine written writing. This film depicting his life should be used for false character, because the overlapping events are very powerful from truth and time. Not only, it refuses an interesting explanation which other versions have included as well as public fiasco relationships in the north of N.Y. and its religious conversion. It is true that he was killed by Luciano, Lansky, et. al. but that's too far. The location of the plate which represents Luciano doing the Bo Weinberg operation of his home, supported by his mother is rediculous. Also, there is a place that Dutch approaches his mother to pay protection for Diamond Legs. It doesn't just work. Mrs. Fleggenheimer's behavior does not work either. This movie does not need to hitting the Hebrew mother doting for comic relief. The peak representation of Diamond Leaves was amazing. I'm sure that man is turning his grave. And, by the way, the Dutch actually kill people, but, it was not Rambo or 007. The situation in which he canceled the brewer is amazing. I don't know. Maybe it was supposed to be a comedy and I just caught it.
