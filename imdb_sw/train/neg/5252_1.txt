I read some of the comments on the web about this film as "... difficult to let Hostel ...", "camera cannot focus on when you get brutal ...". But none of them are true. The camera is not available, because there is nothing to consider. The same part is repeated again a hundred and a hundred times again. Women sit at the table, the killer lays a few women, the killer reduces women into pieces (you will not see this during all the film!). The police come and catch him. Kill the foolish fool. Top film. Germany would say: "Viel LÃ¤rm um Nichts". All in all, one of the boring films I saw. Certainly can't be recommended.
