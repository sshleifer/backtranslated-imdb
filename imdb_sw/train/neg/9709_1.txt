30 seconds in the opening features, I had this feeling that this would be a bad movie, but I didn't know how bad. Then the actor playing the Nazi scientist opens his mouth with my friend and I decide that in order to live this movie, we will need to fix the voice, create our conversation and speed DVD. But that did not help. Almost half way through we turn off. Now, I've lived through some of the worst movies before, both and without the help of "Secrets of Science Theater 3000" and "Svengoolie," but there are only movies that I doubt even Bots can save. The biggest part of the movie that had been hurt me was that people were thought to be green-born zombies. I think they were all healed in death, then they are thought to lock themselves. Put it in the actual B-movie worship books like "Plan Out Outside Out."
