The original is a relaxing look, and a certain interaction of memorable actually. Unfortunately, the good, when not the worst DTV sequels are completely unsuitable. It is a great lack of story. Like the magical world of Bella, the characters are told through a series of vignettes. The Magical World, when it is better, still manages to erase the story. Between vignettes, we see the mouse on the job, and I personally think the antics of Jaq and Gus are characterized by the liberation of this movie. <br /> <br /> The first Vignette is best, about Cinderella getting used to be a princess. This is the best, because the mouse were on their funniest here. The worst Vignettes, when Jaq returns to be human, is a good time, but does not lack of thought. The last Vignette, when Anastasia likes to love, was also good. The problem was, I couldn't imagine Anastasia being friendly with Cinderella, as I saw him a user out of stepisters. This was also destroyed by a wise debate on Lucifer's fall in love with PomPom. Normal music was very interesting to listen, however I hated those songs, he was not sure, and nothing like beautiful Tchaikovsky songs of natural origin. <br /> <br /> The characters were developed power here. Cinderella was concerned, she had lost her honesty, and a lot of her charm from nature, though she dresses very nice clothes. Duk had a wonderful moment but he had not enough to save the film, likewise with Prudence and the king. As I said, the mice were characterized by the release of the movie, as they themselves contributed to the film cutting. I also tell you animation is of color and on average, and the voice acting was awesome. <br /> For all, a good player, like an extraordinary, had been destroyed by songs and lack of stories. 4/10 for mice, voice making, animation and other beautiful clothes.
