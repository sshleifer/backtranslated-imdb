They break in front, but it's important? Have you ever read a review of a film that includes many questions? Could it be? Why did ancient civilization spell the rest of the world? Why is this question not answered? Why did the opening passage go? Why is the fool (he certainly seemed to be good!) Where are the robbers 20 weak? Is there always a gold mine in the city of Vancouver? Why does one of the gold copper mine come from the front of the orphanage? Why the Tara Reid character appears suddenly on the Christian Slater floor for sex? (Or do I just answer my own question?) Why not even an archaeologist not clear the precious gold chest and sledgehammer? Why modern computers still show green before the tron-era grid shows items, perfect and little "bleeps"? Should all explosive teams have digital displays? Why nothing in this movie makes any sense?
