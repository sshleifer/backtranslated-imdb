In fact I have loved Robin Williams in his most serious roles (e.g. Good Hunting, King of Fisher, World According to Garp). These are my favorite movies by Robin Williams. But that day, though well taken, is one of the worst movies that have ever seen and certainly the worst movie of Robin Williams (worse than Death to Smoochy, Club Paradise, and Alladin on Ice). <br /> <br> Every good story will have ups and down it. This movie, however, is one big bottom. I don't need to feel good of Hollywood cheese, but I need to have something more than 90 minutes of completion and no hope. This movie reminds me "Love Liza" (which is worse) because it seems that the only action of the movie is to see how one person can fall. Answer? Who cares.
