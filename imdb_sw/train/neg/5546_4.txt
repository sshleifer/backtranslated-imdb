This film is something like "White Zombie", for it is done by one person (Halperin) and shows zombies. Halperin, George A. Romero of his day, can not offer along with this, however. We have someone who can control the minds of the Cambodian people, and seek to destroy the source of its power so the zombies can be sent free. Also, the interest of love for the wicked. <br /> <br /> Where this film is increasingly located in the image. Cambodia Island and players are very good and watch zombie is very powerful in their large numbers. Unfortunately, we can't see a lot of zombies in action and the story of love seems to have a very serious role in a terrible film (though this has a reason for legitimate conspiracy later). I would like to see the 1930 years of zombies attacking helpless people, but this film did not provide. And no strong man (like Bela Lugosi) was waiting to make war against our heroes. And the use of Lugosi's eyes? Good effect, but it loses if he has never been in the film ... why not repeat this with the eyes of the new actress? In general, a film that can be good with a little script again to work and can one day be a powerful remake (especially if they put in the same time after the time frame). Heck, if they can fix "Mountains and Eyes" then this film has hope.
