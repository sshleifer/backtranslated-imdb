Very good video, but not a true story. Rubin "Hurricane" Carter was a non-sexist, murder and was not found guilty. New Jersey State did not just go for the third time as 20 years have passed. Carter received a version in 1976: "Review the false test and go free". He didn't take it. This film should not be done, but the money negotiation. Many people lose their life in prison and of course more black than white. Why choose a fake story? Jump
