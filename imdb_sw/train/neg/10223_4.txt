I remembered the head so well. For me, it was a film of Flora Robson and Olivier and Vivien Leigh in supporting the roles. And it had the voice of Vincent Massey from behind the whiskers. Well Flora Robson was good. Its second correct, for me, will be "55 days on Peking". The responsibility but with different elegant clothes. And the same sounds. As for the Armada, it was a lesson. I love black and white film. Did everything happen during the night of Elizabeth? It was a conversation and difficult to understand, sometimes. I could not say what the interests of love. Is it a Spaniard or was Vivien Leigh? And I do not believe that Elizabeth would be a brilliant strategy to suggest that ships of fire should be sent against the Armada. It seems to work for the Empire, but not for the script. This may be more accurate, historic, but Bette Davis had more scriptures involved. And I missed the day!
