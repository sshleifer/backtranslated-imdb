I agree with everyone on top who has said anything that will allow you not to lose even the best time to watch this amazing movie. The worst job, the production values ​​of damage, the direction of the walk completely, and the script so inept and the inland should not be written, let's be generated. Even Hollywood "experts" seems to go to work only for payment, though no one would have to be paid for this bad job. Work should be abolished on this improper drivel. OTH, there is something interesting about looking at something to be jaw-dropped. And Chad Lowe is bad and always bad.
