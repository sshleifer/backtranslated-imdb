I was almost 7 at this time of DIRE MONSTROSITY of the film was released. The UK was announced on TV in the summer of 1977 a week, as it was a wonderful film of blockbuster. It was the first film I saw on the movie, and I was removed for years to come. Next week I was invited to go and see the new film "Star Wars" and I refused. To date I have never seen, to resist having a Sasquatch look! To a great extent, even at the age of 7 I could say that I was looking at the trash. It's just bad, it's almost odd. Full play that you should not do with the movie. However, I was worried to read all the years later that the director had never been guided, as I was concerned. AVOID IN ALL EVERYTHING!
