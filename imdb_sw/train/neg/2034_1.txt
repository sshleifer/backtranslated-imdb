True, it is quite bad. What? How is this bad film done? I continued to wait for the action of the liberation struggle, the work of a spectacular camera, or at least some improper weaknesses but I found nothing. I was just looking for Cabin's fever and I thought it was a collapse of the train (except for magic and Pancakes) but it looked like a brilliant compared to this fall. The best doctor of the script in the world could not save this bunch of poo pill. The only thing that goes to this "film" is that it is over. I have only headaches to think about this movie and try to write something. Ugh! I am so happy I paid just 5 and so soon as it gets on the trip.
