This movie seems to be quite useless. There is no reason why anything happens happens, as it is written by a young child who was half-tired and thinking â€œHow can I close this? And what did Jared Harris and Christopher Walken think? Did they do with a bet? I couldn't tell you a conspiracy, I don't know there is one to be quite clear, but if it hasn't registered. Jared and his birds are going to Ireland after falling down the stairs as they are beaten, as you do. They go home with a very young girl who likes her, meet Christopher Walken who has digged some old woman reserved in peat. He brings him back to life without any other reason except he continues the story and shows his gratitude for once to show him. From then all finds a little silly. Several hours of my life that I would like to back!
