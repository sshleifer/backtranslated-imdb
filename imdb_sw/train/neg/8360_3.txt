What? What would you like about this film? <br /> <br /> Color! <br /> <br /> It has an interesting underwater image! <br /> <br /> It has a rhythm logo of the background that works for another time! <br /> <br /> So 3 out of 10! <br /> <br /> Sometimes the music is growing! Especially shark or baddies are almost entry! <br /> <br /> Sometimes it decreases! If that presentation to the audience is about that time of mercy! Like another blowing dust! As in the "Western spagetti" this has very similar to! It is not that Italy cannot offer the best products! There was a series of TV shows and head titles as "Octopus" numbered from 1 to 7, which was hit on SBS TV in Australia in the 1990s about the type of mafia conflict! And they were the best! But alas, you won't find here !!! I thought it was about the 1960s! Sadly it was 20 years out of date, as evidenced by the burial area near the end! Then there was a bright shark cake that was making a small dust that emerged from time to time in blue water! Of all, either in the bar-room room or in the study of recent blood damage in the sea and the hungry shark, the hero of the hero watches through his little glasses, like him he was also bored in his irreversible role during the lack of evidence of conspiracy or the development of any character! Of course the hero demonstrates a temporary concern, for his ex-wife! But, of course, even if music does not arouse our awareness, we have a bad voice in the voices of baddies, as if they beat us that another dark act is about to appear! <br /> <br /> And near the end, someone thought of deviation! Only when we thought it was all predictable! But keep looking, folks, for you can find anything else! If you look around! For, more or less, warm your heart! Follow the hero's advice, and have a few beers on the way! It will make your comment on the "Night Sharks" more enjoyable! <br /> <br /> Then you will be ready for something like "movie" 007 to slow your way back into reality when this is located on !!!
