In spite of the first season this series has never been closer to realizing its potential. Put as prequel's original "Star Trek" series was a penalty close to the beginning and executive executive, Rick Berman, who felt compelled to limit the artificially and prevented the definition of what "Star Trek" series could (which made this show this future increasingly anonymous for extremism). The real player of the show, Brannon Braga, did not help the issues with his heartless renewal and fatigue of previous Trek events and ignored regardless of the mythology of the franchise (it was obviously apparent that he was just in it for payment). I have never seen the series' who regularly did the cancellation of talented characters (Jolene Blaylock except) last for a long time. It is as if this whole series was produced in an existing bubble outside the modern television environment in which listeners (even Trekker's audience) need more and more sophisticated in their great needs and desires. Unfortunately it looks like Berman and Braga have succeeded to lobby over the Paramount that "Enterprise" is experiencing "fatigue of the franchise" and that its primary audience did not walk away but was dismissed. Make a quality offering that lives by high standards and its predecessors and their (listeners) will come. <br /> <br /> Just set, In the world of TeeVee where we are given a show like "Battlestar: Galactica" and "Shield" authority-that-must must provide the public to look at "Star Trek" which action is a great competition. It's just as simple and easy.
