This may be a good movie for children My grandson looked at once. he was watching the second time I was looking at some of it. <br /> <br /> When you carry a little lost on the ice burg and he is in the water he tries to find a piece of ice says "Return stupid fool stupid". I don't want my 3-year-old granddaughter to look at movies and words like this in it. That's why it was rated for children. You must be a friendly child. That's what I'll expect. put out with the warning brothers and G rated me expect this not cuss words into it. Words are not even suitable for the movie in most places as it appears to be added later. And the movie is approaching many places.
