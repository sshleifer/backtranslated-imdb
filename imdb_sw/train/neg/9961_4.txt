Amelia and Michael are a couple who cheat. Amelia has a long-term partner in the hospital and Michael employs a prostitute who is not happy. Two pieces and their loyalty but they can connect at the end. Not too much for this short time. The direction is direct and wonderful, which is good, acting is true, but the story leaves little to be desired. Why, especially do we care about these two people? It is very difficult to see how this story comes from any other story of faithfulness except that it creates more and does not seek meaning in it (change of speed as anything). I don't know, it is possible not to link these stories because I have never seen them. But I have found that prevention in these stories is typically the same, that is, couples are talking together and stopping the eyes from pretending to turn them into newspapers, etc.. Good things about a short film are that it gives a little room to try something different, and I'd like to see a different. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
