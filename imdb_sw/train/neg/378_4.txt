... but the main word here is "normal." I am known for worshiping the movies everyone thinks is dumb. But in the world of movies tested by B, this is Z counted. Of course not. What I respect about most of my movies that is recommended by B is that they don't take too much. The creators of movies like that kind of treat the film gently, even if it is a heavy topic. I get a feeling, however, that the producers of this film were distracted, as they put together a star of 10 stars, completed with evil experiments on pain lines and dumb shots. However, in spite of all of this, I have given 4 out of 10 stars, since I am interested in a movie like this. If you are a fan tested B, however, I will try hard to get this.
