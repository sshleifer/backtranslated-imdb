It's funny. I have seen a Fassbinder film group and I have found some to be very creative and interesting, while others are a buzz of pride and self-love - like this film. For me, it varies and great to decorate - without the middle. I know he has many fans among "modern", but I can't help but I think that a lot of his appeal is pure hype. From my point of view (and I know I will get a lot of negative comments for this), he made too many movies very quickly and was also very busy. His gender or sex films (like this) seem to be very bad - they have been hard, sometimes very popular (such as QUERELLE and PETRA VON KANT) and sometimes only (like this film). What? His message on the acceptance of the gender of a man could not be dealt with better than to show him or her to be killed? Show an understanding of the issue and do more for humanity and compassion - then, maybe, I would like to take care of the film. I believe for sure after watching this film so I can bother with other Fassbinder films - the worst looks out of weight.
