for a long time I was expecting to see this film, here in Latinamerica japanese or any eastern movies without a distribution on the cinema, we can find some of these movies in other underground shops, and I just saw Avalon, I expected something nice, but one thing in this film is the first place, all the film is interesting and meaningful, just a stupid, with many important events, and a fascinating story. I am wasting my time even writing about this film. Sorry but it's true.
