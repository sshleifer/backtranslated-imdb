I did not have high expectations for this film during the lease for $ 1 on a video store, but the box at least showed a little promise to "cut" of "more sex!" More sex! "It can't go bad there! Well ... they don't need to say, the box is a fraud. How in the state did the actors and artists of this caliber mark on this film? Everything is open and the university girl has gone out of the house a frat or other similar building and say some of the wrong nonsense to his girlfriend (?) as a camera on the worst bad follow. Then he is chased by a certain dude in a clear plastic mask with another rapture. you can see when they “cut” him that someone stimulated the cuts of what looked like a crayon. That is the salvation of the soul. This is a salvation with this film with a box not cheating me in flicking. and more abuse and sex .... I want more violence and sex! Match one full in front of 85 minutes from a chick who is clear and angry and a year that will not grieve the child did not cut it. If this is Killer Killer, what is Theatrical Cut? Of course, I doubt that these trash were placed in the movie on the first place. Shame for actors in this film. I saw them doing a discussion of their screens here because they hadn't done anything before, but they were all started before this release. I do not know if it was done before the introduction and the label was on the film until they were half the big names or not. But what I want to know is… they spent $ 14 million on this film?
