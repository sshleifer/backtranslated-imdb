I saw this film recently because a friend brought with him from NYC. After 30 minutes, I told him, "Should you consider. Is this a joke of some sort?" He thought it was good. I told him that I thought it was one of the most beautiful movies made. "What should have been?" I asked. "Movie's propaganda released to children?" The plan is stupid. Acting is even worse for most of the chiefs and real people who look at this kind of voting and think it has any connection with life, love or even after life, which gives a very strange view ... they need psychiatric support. Please, if someone tries to collect this on your DVD or Video player, think if you would like a virus to be brought to your computer ... it won't damage your player but it will destroy your evening. If they did Razzies in 40 years, this would have won in every community. (PS also goes under the worst sobriquet of "Stairway Heaven.")
