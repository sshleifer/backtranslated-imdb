Greenthumb Grace is left without bail after her husband's death so she returns to the ganja-growing to pay bills. It seems to be promising and Brenda Blethyn who cannot be trusted does not know but the material is not available. There is actually a place that Grace asks her small farmer "I get one" (toke) and she thinks she asks for sex and does all the work. Yes, so you have a fool you can get bored. Saving Grace doesn't seem to know what it wants to be: amazing movies and great speed causes memory of Ryan's daughter when whimsy of the light of the city's cities can be raised from any part of Antiques Roadshow. It takes speed after the first hour but at the same time it is also cliched to keep. This session may be unpredictable by introducing Deux ex Machines that I have never seen.
