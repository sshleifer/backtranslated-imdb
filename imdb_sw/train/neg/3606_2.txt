This film is the worst film, but it becomes too high for me. It's how the movie's slasher should be. It happens at a university where it seems to be just a few of the students. Teachers are dumber than a sack of hammer. It is filled with a good Catholic priest, sexual humor. Bad hair, bad clothes. These discussions are very easy to believe that I predicted the lines in quotes. The buttons have creativity and seem to almost turn people into genitalia. The lack of continuity in voice and characters who deserve to die because it is so bad, I recommend this film for fun time. Get a cheap beer case with other friends, see and laugh.
