There is this girl and she runs in the trees but she lives in the woman's clinic and wants a pregnancy. His father is out of van and he all angry about it. The whole part is done in and out of this pregnancy. It's not a true choice but I wanted a choice to kill this part. I laughed when I saw the baby coming out and entering the corner. The sound they made was very good too. I was sorry for the poor father during this period. She wanted to protect her daughter and I can't blame her for what she did. I don't know what happened to him at last or what happened to the father and other daughters in the waiting room. I was laughing too hard and I would like to look at "Pick me up" instead of this section. It was not the worst part but it was not great.
