This movie is extremely durable, very repetitious, and male and female magic (as this is known as gay and my adult names) is also free and unnecessary. A large part of a third of the movie can be reduced to ten minutes and be equally effective without trying the patience (and stamina) of the audience. I saw this film on Saturday afternoon, and the audience of the film festival; a crowd of people who tend to be more adventuresome, are attracted by many experimental or romantic movies, such as one without a lot of chat, short, foreign films. Close to the crowd in the 275 seat area that begins to enter the first half of the movie and while many continued to be "paid" (which has never been), I have never, in 14 years of attending any film party, experiment , gay and otherwise, see a large number of people walking away from the film. This game could be cut easily by more than half and it has been as effective as it was. It would also have gone differently, it still has a short time to run, and it has been more effective. <br /> <br /> As it is now, this is not something that one can easily recommend or one would like to look at again.
