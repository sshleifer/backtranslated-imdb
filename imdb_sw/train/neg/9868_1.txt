I have almost never commented on the movie, but I saw the 5th review of this beautiful "movie" and I decided to test for my own views. My teacher received this film by letter, confused by his Academy of the Academy (AMPAS, the boys who voted on Oscars), and were taken into consideration and how this much-built film was that he put it in class to show us how not to put together the film. <br /> <br /> This film is not conspicuous, events are amazing, they have been horrified (often use photo "24" pictures of faux), and displays (especially leadership, who even fail to work as an actor The worst) is for the most part, of no sense. Someone failed to understand the point of introduction, that is, to establish a plan. No setup! Half of the movie is not myself or any class knew what this film should be around. The opening wheel, which sets a certain type of murder, is not considered, and now thinking about it, it is possible to have a front speed, and all parts of the film flashback, but it is reduced from the same location directly to the next without the same signals. . <br /> <br /> Bah, I could keep going. At the very least, this movie gives me renewed confidence in my ability to make a film.
