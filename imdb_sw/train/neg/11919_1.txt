this should be one of those films where the trailer was better than 50 than the movie itself. I saw the first trailer in 1991, it seemed to be good. later. It just says I was very disappointed, not knowing that I was not a winner of Oscar but I still hoped it would be fun film-no brain in bloodsport molds. Unfortunately it was not, it's Pooh <br /> <br /> what and all rock music and rock of America and acting was very terrible was terrible. Fighting events were garbage and looking fake. It is worth £ 5 and I think I had a £ 7,000. Now I'm sad if I know I will never get it at that and a half back.
