Why would he do it to me? It's not that I expect Dean Cain to produce hit movies. Or even good movies. I saw Lois and Clark, I know how ... "good" Dean Cain is. It is clear that this will be flick cheesey, and every cheesey flick has its own special way to make you start your head. I don't want these few if you can't completely destroy this film than it is already. <br /> <br /> Start with ... why is that artificial helicopter? I mean ... why? How does that scientist coming from Chicago and that another scientist is from LA and no one can be more than Eastern Europe if they have tried? It would be very difficult to find either an American actor, or simply change the paper's breathing experience gives us to say that these people are not America? <br /> <br /> Why is there 2 times when a movie gives us a slug line? We get a day around and then the hall of the house. And then yes, he cares about the schedule. Be honest, who cared about it even when they were mentioned, but I think that is beside the action. <br /> <br /> Can movies be better if you see it through multiple split screens? The answer is no. <br /> <br /> That dragon can certainly walk under the reminder. more ... and more ... and more ... and more ... the worst ending in film history? It was okay out of scooby doo. O dragon dead now ... say, you want to get dinner? Indeed, but not somewhere on the Chinese .... and the dragon by name !! AH HA HA HA !! HA HA HA !! HAHA HA! I was Superman! NO! NO! black / black / black / black / black But don't be afraid even though the whole building exploded ... and no one was left alive. All of us. <br /> <br />
