"Modern Movie 2" is allowing under Scary Movie Franchise. Modern Movie 1, 3 and 4 were all good but this was kind of terrible and not very interesting. Fortunately they took their action after this and made two of the most terrible movies. This film is about a group of young people who are being exploited by their Professor to go to the haunted house at night. Things begin to go wrong and then you know that they should avoid. <br /> <br /> This movie is not bad but it can improve a few things. It's a bit of fun and if you liked other movies on the Scandal Outlet then do this watch - but I don't think you would like it very close.
