I sat through this movie this evening, insisting to join it even though I didn't care about the characters or what happened, for these two reasons, Gérard Philippe and Michèle Morgan, were the biggest stars of their era and I wanted to see them in "something different," which it certainly was. They both gave good performances, but for the uncomfortable characters. In fact, the whole movie is close to a small rural town in Mexico with a very close and worried actor (the doctor is, of course, a huge discrimination). What is Michèle Morgan seeing in Philippe falling in love and she is not explained. <br /> <br /> This depends on the work of Jean-Paul Sartre. All I could imagine was that, if the work of Sartre is something like this film, it must be an attempt to fight very hard in following the Camus' novels of the disease, involved in the epidemic of North Africa. Well done but the movie is not interesting.
