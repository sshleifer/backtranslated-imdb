If there was a call to make a bad film that showed how humanity would be, this could take a prize. The program involves biblical prophecies contained in the mysterious message of Scripture that causes a group of robbers to seek to control the world. How does the fool believe people to be true? <br /> <br /> Acting was worse. Casper Van Dien used his talent to make this film. Michael's work was a fair match for the role, for he was a film center, and he did a good job. This plan was a disease and was very stressful. There is no desire or intellect to see this film. This is how a good and evil plot can be lost. You must have many mental illnesses around the circles of the film, who look for ways to market this kind of junk. There must be something taken to get a rating of PG-13, but it was still bad.
