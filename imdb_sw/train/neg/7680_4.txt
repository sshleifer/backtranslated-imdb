Snow White is in my opinion the worst movie on artistic perspective. The program is very pretty visible, the characters are discriminating, editing is also widespread. However, the film does not seem to have many artistic expectations. <br /> <br /> Instead, I think this is a direct business matter. Including the character from the French part of Switzerland (the actress is the leader of the running band and the film - the band called SENS UNIK) seems to have a large audience view. The German movie-swiss could not sell the French - and vice versa. What exactly on my nerves was the product set in all the movie. Tournament events remembered the advertisements! I also think the topic of "youth drug addicts without other goals in their lives" is a great fact of spreading in Zurich. Therefore, it should be defined for more services. I hope Samir got enough money with Snow White, so that his next movie will show his true artistic skills.
