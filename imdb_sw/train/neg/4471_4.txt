The best I can say on this film is that it was amusing at times, and that was a long time killer. Unfortunately, this film is also very angry that I wanted to beat these characters around. This is a kind of film that is very sweet, hurts your teeth. The purpose was good, I think, but things can be scary when the discussion is screaming. When the two heads are not together on the screen, this is not the worst, but scared at that time often when a couple of love begin to talk.
