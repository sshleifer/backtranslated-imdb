There is no way to describe how true, really, very bad this film is. It is a shame that I am sitting through this movie, this movie of tiresome and predictable. What is wrong with that? Acting: There is not one function that is very far away and even being less-par (for it's all pretty much). Soundtrack (songs): "If we get an Orgy in a sound voice then everyone will know that they are watching a terrible movie!"; Voice Sounds (logo): OK, but any keyboard can make good sound these days. Do you even get me started on "Do you hell?" This time, here are a few: The murderer can move to the speed of the light door opens the actor returns, nobody is there, he is back, there is something in front of him; From now where the killer demonstrates with power, great power! The film staff earn points at least to close, but I can really believe that the killer took time to get the power to plug. I feel like one of the guards at the beginning of the Holy Grail and want to say "Where did you get the power?". I would like to keep on going on how this film is bad but I just have 1000 words. I will give this 2 stars out of ten. One star for making me laugh with another star for all redemption. By and large, don't waste your time with this.
