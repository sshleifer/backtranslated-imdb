**** SPOILERS MINOR *** As a bad movie player I must have tried hundreds of bad movies and still "Hobgoblins" standing away from all others in a unique way. Normal Baddies such as "Creeping Terrorism," "The Great Gorga" and "Manos" are the worst uniforms from beginning to end. "Hobgoblins" on the other hand, begins off bad and finds the worst stage when it goes. During my first look of the scandal of fighting the scene I thought myself that this was a very bad film. I was very happy to know that I saw only the best that this film had to offer. The movie takes its huge nosedive into cellulo hell during painfully inept "Club Scum" sequence which is a continuous string of one unfunny joke after another. For this film only, director Rick Sloane proves that he deserves to mention along the will of Coleman Francis and Bill Rebane as one of the worst directors at all times. What? Bad movies can be bad? See "Hobgoblins" and don't see it again.
