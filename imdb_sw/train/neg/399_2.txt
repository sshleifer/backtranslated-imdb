This photo started with good intentions, Bacon scientist exploring the theory of the invisible, and Shue is as good as its typical role. It all falls off after that, it is your exciting time of Hollywood now, held on sound sounds and special effects, reducing all sorts of humor, wit or spirit. In other words, don't waste your time looking at this. Get the tape tape with John DeLancie as an invisible Person, also with the star Leonard Nimoy. Now that was good, and HG Wells are well used, different from this mess.
