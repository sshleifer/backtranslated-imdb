What? "Sounds" does not make it get us to understand its character. Tim Robbins has a New Yorker River who is unable to respond to the city's voice again, especially with car alarms. It's an unusual idea for the film, which has about the credibility of creativity as "Death of Death." It's clever for points; especially the area in which our hero tries to read through Hagel, "I am very stupid to understand this." He reads it and rewrites the passage in confusion, we read and listen too. So the car bell leaves you. In the same movie is the constant interference of the bells and sounds of the city. Although, all is not recommended little to help us understand our hero, who allows all this to destroy his marriage and is prohibited by side plots instead of digging over-into his persona. The film's own decisions also do not recognize its voice problems, good editing, and visuals. No, "Voice" is not all bad. William Hurt is at least a color. At least the end doesn't come. It generally runs home action equipment, one that you may not think. At least I didn't. Although all for all, ninety minutes for a long time, it could not be completed earlier. The story emerged and it seemed to disappear just once it started. This is one of those movies that you can see on the film, but maybe not taken for distribution. Look at the DVD as part of the person involved in the project. Otherwise do not forget.
