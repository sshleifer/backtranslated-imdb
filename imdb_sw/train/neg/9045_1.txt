This movie started with a state of conspiracy, then left it to the endless series of random characters and encounters that do not relate to moving the story forward. It was impossible to remain involved with this film. This movie is a bunch of trash made by other people with animation skills but has no ability of creativity or storytelling. It is a great effort to get from the great studio. Obviously there are ethical and incentive problems in Disney, not to mention the lack of oversight and quality control. The management allowed this movie to see the light of the day describing the amount of inability and despair. This movie combines my short "worst movies of all time".
