This movie seemed well - thrown well, the most common topic and the opening of the explosion. Declined from there. Why was it done with a supported camera? It pushes, intermediaries, part of the capture scenes and just mixes the viewer. Bad choice really. If this was not enough, the worst silk in memory takes a doctor's view - should be if you want to get any comfort from him completely. And then makes the worst sin of all. After leading the viewer to all the impossible and unwanted forms to the level of fatigue, they incorporate characteristics without revealing the symptoms - the end - award-like what was causing? What? Can you expect to succeed by doing wonders without end? Doh! This movie had a great promise and ended up making a plant of the surface in the mud. What efforts to lose. The worst quest for the author and director.
