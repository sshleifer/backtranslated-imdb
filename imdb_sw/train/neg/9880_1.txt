I saw this film back to the first exhibition exhibition, on the field of unfair merits. Believe it or not, after decades of watching movies, this still makes it clear in my mind as the worst movie all the time; or at least worse than I would allow it to watch. Acting is far below the standard set by any group of girls who went to high school dropped out of the street and had to learn their lines in 5 minutes or less. After the first shock of unbelief, we laughed for a moment as each area touched the new traps. But over time, even this amazing pleasure was wearing and it must be very sad.
