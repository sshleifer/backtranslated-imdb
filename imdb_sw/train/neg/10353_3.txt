I have never read the book "Vaccination at a time". Be completely honest, after seeing the movie, do I really need? Well, I should not pass this film to start with it. The following I will say that TV movies are good to forget. Do you know why I say that? Because I have forgotten what is happening in it. I told you it was to forget. To be completely honest, no television film will ever be better than "Merlin". How do I describe a TV film? I have never written one review before. Well, I will only say that they often have certain celebrities. Well in time includes just one. Alfre Woodard (Au Woodward, I don't know), winner of Oscar. <br /> <br /> Film has special effects of cheesy, interesting plot, events that make you go "WTF". The movie is very bad and makes you go "WTF". What did I expect? It's a television movie. It is usually not good. Like this. Effect on time is a waste of time and waster great time. On the far, you will most likely forget about that second gone. Well, maybe not the second is up. But within a few minutes. <br /> <br /> Effect on time: * / ****
