The "Movie Secret 2" script is not ready to go. This is a problem with a visible film, for actors and viewers alike. Director Keenan Ivory Wayans, and many of the participants are funny people; and so the movie is not quite good. For their credit, the film has several moments of delight. But in general, "Scary Movie 2" is not recommended to be as clever and exciting as nature. The first "awesome scenario" was for a minute filming. It turned the smallest secret to the type of slasher film on the comedic gold. The humor in the "Movie Secrets 2" is widely supplied if not original. They forget the obvious opportunities for disease. Two stars of the movie are former members of the "Beverly Hills 90210," and this was a show that asked to be parodied! In the final analysis, "Modern Secret 2" is like a good wine bottle that was opened very quickly. Script required more time for age. 2 out of 5 stars.
