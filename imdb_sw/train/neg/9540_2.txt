The only reason to see this film is for good performance by Thom-Adcox Hernandez who is used in the movie inside the film. As usual Tom Villard is good, too. Otherwise it is c ** p. The material is not even how he turns the magic letters into the marquee of the theater to mention "Facilitator"? Lame.
