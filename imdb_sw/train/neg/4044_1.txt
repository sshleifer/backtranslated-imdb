From a conspiracy perspective and movement, this film was awesome. I found myself looking at an hour in the hall of expectation and finished after 80 minutes for a long time that was sympathetic. Basically, five characters appear in the film, the Son and the Father, the girl's girlfriend, and the two male men of the male age who appear and then disappear without the context or explanation. The movie and events seemed to suggest homo-eroticism, but nothing ever actually happened to reveal this one or another way. There were several brilliant events. At the beginning of the movie, the girl's girl shows on the window outside her room and participates in an unusual conversation. Photography and acting were very interesting for the relationship between the two, and ended with accepting having another person who was "old". End of the story.
