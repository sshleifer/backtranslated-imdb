I am surrounded by this film after watching 82 minutes "Borat" this night, and left completely disappointed. I was a great fan of Wallace and Gromit, and regularly going to see animation films. It is said, I found myself shaking away and one time almost walking out, but I kept waiting for this film to be better. Never happened. These displays are amazing and sound work is a top shape, especially in my opinion, of Kate Winslet and Ian McKellen (I had to recall a few times bulbous led by a villain fool was Gandalf and Magneto). The problem with this film for me is one of the connected elements for setting ADD. Writes after the fact as one act of slastick after another, compared to a full-filling plot that comes every stop in an attempt to show "Important messages." It looks like Oscar beaten for an animation field, and focusing on a method that involves critics, I can't be surprised if the Academy gets wrong and offers its equipment. But if you are looking for a feature that enjoys life about mice, get my advice and wait Ratatouille.
