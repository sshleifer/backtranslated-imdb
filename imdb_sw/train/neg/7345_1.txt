I hate this app, what kind of people sit and watch this garbage? Like my father and mother love lol but I'm sure I'm out of the room before coming. Its crumbling and dreary but the worst thing about it is acting I do not stand all the detective programs like this because the spies are wood and heartless. What happened to spying programs and secret real ??? I mean who wants to know what happened to the false characters who we know nothing about that who died over the last 20 years? I would bbc put more comedy on bbc1 cos now and win the dibley finish there is more space to crap like this.
