Three lines of story and enough to connect together, "Within Man" was a very jumpy and an incomplete attempt to become artistic and true. Although he had time, the movie began to look like a quick laughter that quickly stopped to crawl, jumped quickly between highs and lows, and did not take the steam again around the last 20 minutes. I will give credit to Denzel Washington, who played his part very well with the full understanding of his human side and not just "normal detective" and all the answers. Clive Owen also did very well with its duality as a "perception of evil" and "criminal expert" (all not the same in restoring). In general, though each individual created a small part. However, when the places came together and everything was counted, there was no "ah-ha" suddenly! or a summation of everything. It all ended with a very small amount of energy that started with, and many holes of holes, tons of questions, and as I said earlier, no where almost the normal level of Spike Lee. I must be totally against those who are called "academic critics" ... this is not the movies they are playing with.
