I can't say this is a bad movie *. Unfortunately for me, I feel that you know more about the fence, the worst finds only due to the fact that it becomes quite untrue. I have been a fence since I was 14 years old, and this film shows very well. F. Murray Abraham is good (and seems to have a history of fence), but most of the other participants - especially students - seem to be just lost.
