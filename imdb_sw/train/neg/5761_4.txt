Hollywood does it again. Too much money, no creativity. I am sure the authors were on something else except oxygen when they wrote this. According to the preview, I thought this would be a lovely movie. But if you're not on a recent culture of stupid pop you will miss more silly humor in this movie. Why waste your time. You can stay on the log doing nothing and have more fun than this film will provide. <br /> <br />
