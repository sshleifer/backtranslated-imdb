Don't show all the great names like Burt Reynolds, James Woods and Anne Archer. They are just the extra glory. Their exhibition may be made in one or more days. Whatever their intention to be in this film, if you have an actor like James Woods you should use it well. For me this is a sign of a bad trend through and through. The mark itself was not bad. And the work from most participants was on average. Cuba Gooding Jr. however it was bad. He was not amazing that I had cut into his great scenes. And since this meant as a great movie that can't be a good thing. Action events were not bad, but did not have a special punch to make it more exciting. Again the best direction was needed. Also, the speed of photography was bad for this film. It took the main character about half an hour to enter. With an exciting action of just 90 minutes which is very slow. The only reason for redemption is Angie Harmon. He does all his work to do all the work. Unfortunately the director left him dead. Yes, this film can be better with a good director. Andy Cheng also does not know the skills as a smoker. And for the action / stunt coordinator of caliber you expect at least more exciting action scenes. Don't waste your time with this. Avoid!
