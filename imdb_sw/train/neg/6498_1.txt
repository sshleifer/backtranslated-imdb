I have seen bad movies before, but this takes "The worst Secrets of Life Award" at a distance! Anthony Hopkins must be completely ill with his name linked to this - anywhere! I will no longer see another film in it, guide it, etc., etc.! I can't believe other actors and partners that I liked, (in this picture), which stuck so low to be part of this disaster! You must have great medicines out there! For anyone who is not ashamed to be part of the film, it's more than me! Save your money on this! FLOP great from beginning to end! Mr. Mr. Hopkins! Also, embarrassed on a Christian Slater! I can't believe you put your reputation on the line for this!
