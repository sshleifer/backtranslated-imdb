The movie is about two brothers who should be the same - but not in any way expect to be smart - one is the surgeon and others are able to write computer code. Scholars like to call themselves the most widespread if you can compare with personal characteristics you can know from the head of the head. <br /> <br /> I honestly did not like the film style. I believe that worry, frustration and deep blues brings there for a purpose, but what I have not found is why there are a lot of it. The movie is cheaper on scenes and tells the story basically with no human element in it completely. It offers a comic book as an experience. However, it seems to have criticized the viewer, somehow brings into the blues with short conversations, monotonic scenes, cutting power, music and sudden sounds. The story of the film is very simple, more than what is going on is that for example it shows for a long minute, especially in a mix of addiction to drug abuse and power cuts. I will say clearly that this film did not think my little dimensions.
