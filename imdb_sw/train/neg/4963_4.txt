it happened that another attempt failed by a lacible sci-fi facility. I don't know who wrote the script, and translate the poem, but I'm sure it was a 17-year-old boy who thought it would be amazing to have a bow bow in the movie. AAAAAAAH! when I saw that place, I lost all hope. Then ... they go to heorot in what appears to be a ship which Christopher Columbus entered! when they reach the Heorot, (which should be the gallery of the Norse mead) a group of sci-fi authors decided to make heorot looks like a huge stone wall. I saw that part. I wanted to scream. I wanted this movie to be beautiful, but sci-fi has not yet produced a good film, so I don't know why I've got my trust. Oh .. and Grendel and his mother, are also ignorant. (This comment has been removed from the title "Grendel") If anyone from the sci-fi center reads this ... there is good advice. Not everything you do is on the BIG MONSTER which can RIP people in one, not what the FICTION Celebration refers to! AND ALSO, FINDA USING THE TIME OF TIME OF THE BUSINESS IN STEPHEN BALDWIN TO FILMS! DOES NOT MOVIE, WORK TO WORK!
