As the front cover says "The hammer of our time, in our time". I was supposed to learn this version of the park planned directly after watching the version of Keneth Branagh and it was a desperate experience. <Br /> <br /> This version takes a different approach to several play games including sex; The very very one of Osric homosexuality and interesting interaction between Hamlet and Ophelia. I think at a time (60) this was a very good version of Hamlet but it can't compare to the full version of Branagh. I just got a video on my local video store (in Australia) and I'm looking for a real Keneth Branagh DVD to buy if there is nothing. If someone knows of one please tell me.
