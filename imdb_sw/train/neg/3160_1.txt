You know you're trouble looking at the comedy, while only the exciting part in it is from the Animal beaten. It is a pity then that the pastor, Cat & Dogs were just in support and not the other way around, as human beings were very good. <br /> <br /> If I was you, Paul, Eva, Lake (what kind of name is that), Jason, & Lindsay, I would like to forget this lark to do and do something else, like you all like like dry color , and evil boot executives. The main gag in the film is one of the characters shouting, I am not a Gay, which is strange if you are not, you can change your mind if you need to focus on three heroes, worries & dare say women very clear leads in The film. The worst films I saw in years, and hope never seen it as bad again, though I don't expect it.
