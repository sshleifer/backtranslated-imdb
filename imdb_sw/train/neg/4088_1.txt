This was a waste of water in my life watching the film. I went to see this in the theater when it came out. I was amazed at how bad it was. This film makes you wonder who put the money and who had to pay the approval - a very great grace. Specific effects are the first level of the grade, as with any first farmer. Slices of sunscreen on the strings and there is no attempt to hide the strings, the visible arrows drawn from the film and watch that the shape of the arrow you can find on the road sign, and the line of the laughable story. Ed Wood did the prestigious work compared to "winning". Every film student should see this only so that they know the very definition of the bad movie.
