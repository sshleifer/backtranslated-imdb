Do not make bones on it. There are many bad things with this film. It clichéd the whole way, not very funny, predictable, and illogical. Let's start at the beginning: characters. There is a good, unfortunate person - he still gives one piece in his attractive, unfortunate region - he claims to be wild, but in fact it is a fairly common, loving interest - who Aniston plays well, but really did not make an effort to so - oil, friend partner, and then discrimination of the clichés: a angry young Australian, a young Spanish man with courage, etc.. The story: the beginning is unusual, but then it goes to the usual film style, and each category can predict as much as your knock-on shock. The main problem is that the "development" of Stiller's behavior seemed to have come from nothing - like your normal school game, the authors knew where he started and where he had finished, but he did not keep enough stock to tell a little in the middle. Finally, the alleged 'claims' were nothing but a lot of water-giving laundry; there was a control of the chunder area, the dedicated men, etc.. In conclusion, the simple fact about this movie is that learning the meaning of the word 'shart' was the only thing. Hamburg actually broke the dog food here, and Stiller's and Aniston coating might attract the audience, but the last flavor was like rancid. <br /> <br /> Last comment: This film could be awesome, but Aniston still chose a movie between friends-season than 'Marci X' of Kudrow's worries.
