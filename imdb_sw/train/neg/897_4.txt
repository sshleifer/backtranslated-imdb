Two years before writing and directing "Arthur", Steve Gordon was hit by a small screenplay for this car known as Henry Winkler, then the "The Fonz" TV. The 1950 thespian college (and around the world) is connected to marriage without any job prospects on the horizon; to reach the end, he turns to the flamboyant world of war, finally being "George Gorgeous" -mother celebrity. Turning the worst Winkler seems to be an interesting idea for time (and a sure way of separating it from its changing TV-ego), but the joke and many situations are often helped and have been meaningful, done gently by director Carl Reiner. Particularly very serious that involves Herv√© Villechaize (the "Island of Fantasy") to put a step on Polly Holliday (Flo from "Alice"). Like Henry's favorite, Kim Darby looks at a little aspect of his feature - especially when surrounded by all these TV hams - giving a romance feature of the wrong script. * 1/2 from ****
