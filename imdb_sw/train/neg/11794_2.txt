Original original Sci-Fi Channel image. Little surprise, but not much. U.S.S small nuclear ship. Jimmy Carter is on the bottom of a huge frigid fridge next to North Pole as it faces huge electrical generators generated by electricity. The staff member (Simmone Jade Mackinnon) thinks he has chosen a way to communicate with the organism, but it is not given a great opportunity for non-transparent reasons. Also among staff are: David Keith, Mark Sheppard and Sean Whalen. This film would be better if the cloud / creatures were not so photographed.
