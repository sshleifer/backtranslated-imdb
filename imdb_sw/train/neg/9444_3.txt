There is only one thing I say about a cat in a hat ... as a movie of KIDS and a good movie of comedy takes ... I lost track how many jokes joke in a movie that not only sucked but they were 't exactly a proper baby. Oh and by the way the cat in the hat said it was awesome ... as for the plot I totally forgot. Who cares cares for however. I'm not sure why Mike Myers joined but I think the authors tried to make it sound like him in Austin's authority without a swinger speech and it was very successful - but so was what was offensive. don't see it is less than 100 .................................. joke is so unkiddy is funny
