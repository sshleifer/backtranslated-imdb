I looked at the part. Yes I sat in an unforgettable experience, and I must say, this comedy is one of the worst you will get. Consider Peter Griffin, the family name of Guy. Now consider Peter Griffin as a female (so-called little and few), except that now they have nothing that made him hilarious. Peter Griffin is idiot, but he doesn't know he is idiot. Sarah has no true character, no ability to work on her behavior. Maybe his joke, the joke of the formulaic who pulls his comedy even lower than his character can take for himself. Maybe it's a lack of trusted foil. His improper motive, you may be attracted to the senseless people, emerging unlike the massive appeal of Stephen Colbert's bad behavior, the four main character. Like Bill O'Reilly, Sarah builds a terrible, unpopular attitude. He has nothing that is necessary for a variety of satire, then alone to the whole world of comedy. Sara Silverman is missing what, it seems. And when you don't believe and realize, it's no longer worth it.
