The first power (1990) was a horrible film that came out during the early 80s / early 90s of films that were cheaper. I saw this movie being boring but highly hilarious in a certain place. This film is useless and very trustworthy that it is not even desirable. The fairly quick system in this film makes Texas look weak in comparison. Lou Diamond Phillips has gone over his head and this role (plays a tough soldier) and Tracey Griffith (more attractive Melanie sister) has a doctor. Don't waste your time with this because it's bad. What a minute, I take again. This movie makes a great film party. Look at the barrier to change the foot, has the most beautiful legs I have ever seen in Nun that was not in the opinion of Jesus Franco. Yeow! <br /> <br /> This showed the end of the era by L.D.P. His star had been destroyed and could not take the water to the pot. It was D.T.V. for him until his "mess" after a few years. <br /> <br /> Not recommended unless you want.
