The Center for Invention / Planet of Animals should be ashamed of themselves. This dream is directed after "Walking with Sisters" of the series. Although this is a fantastic 100% is provided in the same way as the old. Even combine amazing dragons with T-rexs and disappearance of dinos. It has been added to the educational center instead of saying Sci-Fi offers the air of authenticity for this show. <br /> <br /> Its only show is about 7.5 / 10 as far as entertainment goes. But the way in which it is presented must give 1/10. Don't make a mistake I'm not a problem with fantasy but they way to keep this out is very bad. I can actually see young children and adults when they believe that they found the dragon and that this is true. I also think this brings great power to "Walking with Dinosuars" because now you should see that and how much imagination it is fantasy on the same mini series.
