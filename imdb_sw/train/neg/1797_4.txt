This movie has a very powerful impetus, even with this type of standards. We have to accept not only that the playback record can bring a dead person, but that the record also has a secret message based on the SPECIFICALLY for one child, while the singer was not connected to the boy when he was alive, and of course there is no way to know who the record it would end. However, the film enjoys a moment, but ultimately the rule and uncertainty dominates. If they were really trying to create a new icon of Freddy as fear, they were far away: the villain here has no personality, no motivation, and no kind. (* 1/2)
