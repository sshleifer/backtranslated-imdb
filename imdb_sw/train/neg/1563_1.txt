I saw this movie in Sundance 2005 and I had a surprise how bad it was, though according to the catalog notes I was excited to see. It is known as the "motion" of two high school students who make up a life-long high school letter, it was associated with evil, bad leadership, the total lack of the characters involved as written, and each around is a general laughter. I like good movies on high school, and this is not one of them. Anime is one-dimensional and self-conscious "cold" though they should be outcasts. You get a general sense of a group of people sitting around to make a bad-to-do movie to show their friends, but somehow has entered Sundance. Define.
