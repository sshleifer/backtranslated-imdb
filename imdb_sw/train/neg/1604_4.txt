Remember the films you enjoyed in the past that do not really think such feelings as an adult? It happened to me when I returned to school. The National Lampoon Institute of Reunion. The film has a great opportunity to laugh, but surprisingly it goes deliberately when we see a wonderful collection of characters like a woman who sold her soul to the devil and can blow a fire from her mouth, a man who seems to be a vampire, and a sly killer dressed like a woman and wearing sackcloth on his head. You have a class president who believes it is the best thing since the broken bread (but as we see in the film, he is slick and soup), a few cigarette smokers who don't even know they are in their class fellowship, and a man named Gary who he knew one even knew there was (and no one could be seen to remember his name ... this is one joke I enjoyed). There is a whole offender who wants to grab women in the wrong places, a blind and blind woman who is afraid to flee for her dog, and cook (you know from "goonies" and "Giving Mom from Trains") who likes to put food on people's dishes and her hands ! The film is essentially about a nutcase who is (or at least trying) to retaliate for his fellow students with a gag they drew upon him (planned to sleep with his own sister!). The film tracks the actors as they are looking for a black killer, bound on the old school highway. They were told about the murderer and a psychologist who seems to be very strange. The movie has a few good things that work (very early), but the film grows slowly every minute. The real problem of the film is that it does not know where to go. The film is very good for one laugh because it has an uncertain dimension ... if it has any direction at all. Sent it is enough enthusiasm, but the material that makes funny just doesn't have the quality of holding any interest. It is a reflection for fans of early 80 poems that have forgotten (this is the same).
