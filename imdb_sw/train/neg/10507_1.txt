Like me and a friend we rented a few days ago because we like to watch b movies since we did ourselves. Also, the cover was bloody with girls looking for naked girls and things ... and Tom Savini! No way this film can fail! Right? bad !! It looks just like desired! There was no true story, the conversation was horrible (anyone in xx 1000 !!!), the characters were .. well, they really did not have any kind of personality ... The effects were terrible .. and what related to these shots long people fearful around them without doing anything .. with strong eye restrictions and objects? We had sat the whole movie waiting for something ... anything would happen ... but no ... "oh, here comes nymphs! Great! Oh .. kissing ... again ... and now for violence! OK ... no something happens ... again ... oh, now walking around ... and around the eyes ... again ... oh, heres Tom Savini! Oh ... he died ... right ... Well, maybe now The cold or even amazing thing will happen .. no .. oh! cool! head cut! last ... oh crap .. "And finally, since I'm full myself I will tell you this! Give me, six actors, a wonderful watch house, Tom Savini, a couple of naked girls and pigs and blood buckets and I can make the most cool movie you have ever seen ... I have made movies and a budget for two days in The best effect, acting better with the best script than this ... what is Johannes guy doing? Making cool movies is easy! It can be very good ... I am disappointed!
