Well, it's very bad. This was very bad. Not according to gore - which was especially CGI laughable - but to act, atmosphere and guide. The story was bad - the arc character of the main leadership was the general joke. Within a few nights of Vinnie Jones, she begins to be 'haunted' up to the right while photographing her boyfriend. Um ... are the photographers of New York this newborn, powerless and weak? The development of his character did not have any right or any action - and at the end it would be laughing very loudly, and it never lost its characteristic. At the time of gory it was just a clear, low-self-effort effort to fly on a modern MTV model - every cgi, blood still no real feeling. These parts were interesting without fun - and they contributed to their personal knowledge - the wacky cameras of the wires. What could be the atmosphere (until stupid creatures at the end) is caused by 'looking at me'style self-conscious guide. This film was not made by the audience - it was done by CV - the objective of selfishness.
