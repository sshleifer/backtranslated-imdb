Okay, the story - a simple loony enters the life of a little chick death and his baby brother to destroy life in their lives - it's a little interesting one. However, the idea is not something (everyone has some ...) - the implementation is everything. That is what bothers me with this flick. And that was so much caused. Rhythm (lead, edit) was slow, the speed was not available and the peak anticipated. We have seen those five, six, six-fold roads, why? Norton's behavior problems seemed like a newborn game, not enough to understand his / her / blah problems and to strengthen or against it. Is he a fool, manipulator or just a loony? The "Taxi Driver" reference was ridiculous and was not really recommended for this flick (or for E.N. for that matter). And IMHO, it is foolish to be executed at the end. The cheapest desire for young lovers somewhere in America. The boy would have to kill the child, accuse the father, and destroy the truth. Or the child would have to kill the father at the end, but no, we have found the end of the cheesy where children lose loony, the father is wondering about his own life and relationship with them and loony, of course, dies. Unhappy family can not be prone, safe and happy again bored so that we can enjoy our pop-soul, without stability. And the area where the loony enters the movie, oh my God, I would think for a long and hard time to find something beyond that! You do not shoot such a place with a hidden camera with hidden staff. The creators of the film probably thought that it was a good idea but it was more than offensive. Again, if you are a 16-year-old girl in Kansas anywhere or whatever-where and dream about having sex with a male man of your age, right, then you can enjoy this film with its "message".
