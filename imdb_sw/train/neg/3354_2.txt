It is my opinion that when you decide to make a very good film, you should strive to do better than before; or at least give them new ideas. Now 1963 Robert Wise is talking about Shirley Jackson's fantastic novel "The Haunting of Hill House" has a value to be included even today. Now proceed quickly to 1999 and reset. I was left to shake my head and ask, why? Acting is timber, an unknown story and the whole point seems to be a trick of the original trick and many special effects computer can produce. I had heard that this update was not bad; but they did not believe it was bad, based on source materials. I was wrong. After looking at this and telling my wife how bad it was, he said; "Well they have your money!" He is right, don't let them have yours. If there is no benefit in recycling, they will probably stop making them or reach a higher level that does not despise their audience
