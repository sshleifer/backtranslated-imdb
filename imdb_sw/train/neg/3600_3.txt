The question for all the girls out there: If someone who has never met before you deliberately called you and continued to do so at the wrong time you would be interested in him or so have you made your phone to the police?

Connor Hill's wife has been killed by a conspiracy about the question is Connor urging Marti so he can have alibi? But there is a great gap in the logic here, does Connor have used someone who hits? something that the charges seem to have ignored.
