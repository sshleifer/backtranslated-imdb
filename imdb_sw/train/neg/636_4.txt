Several followers are faced with life in a small village in China. Wang Lung (Paul Muni) buys O-Lan, his future wife, who becomes his slave (Luis Rainer). The American stars are seen in the roles, lead and fake accents and insist on the anti-racism and patriarchal patriarchalism. A good wife, many children and land are good for men. They look like assets and investments. Because it is a great movie budget, which extra surrounds collaborate, large sets have been built and special effects are being done, film makers cannot take the risk of hiring more unknown operators. Luise Rainer won the Academy Award for this performance, which is definitely the worst in the film. His unstable face builds a barrier between him and the audience. O-Lan should be the heart of the family and the best urge to entreat. On the other hand Paul Muni gives good performance, showing his talent again. Another problem with the movie is the end. It seems like Franklin didn't know when to finish the picture. This film can be dangerous as it is considered a typical example of Chinese culture and tradition.
