David Warbeck as the author of Miami chosen by the Atlantis ghosts (!) Leaving an evil businessman (Academy Award for John Ireland) using a telepathic fetus. use spores from asteroid to dominate the world. Do you have it all? In spite of the plot, this is actually the producer of ATLANTIS RAIDs clapping with contempt. In fact, the most creative thing (deliberately) about this flick is a little reworking of the theme of Herbie Hancock's BEVERLY HILLS COP with the opening names. A little more creative that involves a scene in the laboratory that is shown twice the return. Perhaps director Alberto De Martino wanted to find all the garden on us during the evening of his work? I was going to announce this ugly film on Ireland but then I saw SATAN'S CHEERLEADERS were listed there. I would also like to announce to the safety that I perhaps are the only person in the history of the world to make a double element of this with the VERTIGO's Hitchcock.
