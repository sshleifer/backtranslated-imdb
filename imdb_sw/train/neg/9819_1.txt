I have read some comments about this film, and I usually try to be harsh in my criticism because I try to be a good person. However, this movie is one of the worst movies I have ever seen (and that gives a lot of bad American network with the Cinemax night.) Anyone who thinks this film needs to be prevented from EVER to do another. This film hated me in a way that no other film ever. In fact I think these people are mad. Save your time and don't look at this fllm. Please - I would like to. Acting is bad, conspiracy (it's a plot) is STUPID and humiliating and insane. I don't think this really isn't good to be a film. But that's my opinion, and I'm trying to save you from losing your time.
