Well, here is: "The Mountain of Nazi think of Dalai Lama." What we are doing is the first we get a great star without any knowledge of German influence, and we allow him to move between French, Germany, America and the UK for more than 2 hours. Then we explore a series of unknown events and keep them far away, so that the inland plot is around. almost without interruption. But just to make sure the viewer is not asleep, we give you a very sad explanation, like our hero who smokes at 22,000 feet. Naturally, we should also keep in mind that our listeners do not want to read too many heads, so we have every character, even the lowest farmers in Lhasa, forbidden in 1943, speaking the perfect English, and also with a bad voice. Of course, the trickiest part is how to deal with the spiritual and political issues of the story, so what we do is this: we have a Dalai Lama to be a Nazi friend now-changed because the latter is good in fiddling and film projectors, radios, cars ancient, and other materials representing the independence of western capital. In return, our hero learns from his small leader of the mysterious Buddhism that has never been brought or treated in a great way. We also have many images and heroes to score all the respect and protocol that some of the Tibetan community accept Dalai Lama, even if we pretend that the hero has a deep respect for these people and their spiritual leader. In other words, we expect the audience to believe that this person is now a Buddhist, his kind, in his own way, though we have not only seen what his change is about or how we want to go. And last but not least, we put a figure on the end of the film about how Chinese were treating Tibetan (which is true), and thus opening up the charges that we have made a "political" film, though it is not that kind. So, zat is my idea. What? Huna? Can you make a films of?
