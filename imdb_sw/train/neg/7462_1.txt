Direction must be a problem here. Recently I heard John Cleese saying he was working on skit for Fawlty Towers. He had to attack his car and branch. The first branch was very flimsy and not surprising. The second branch was very hard to be funny. The third was just enough to be interesting. This type of attention is not available from "Corky Romano". No matter how much of the comic embarrassment it was, it was not fixed, and was not left on the floor of the cutting room. One value I can find in this film is like learning a very bad movie that has somehow avoided the distribution without making. <br /> <br /> I have examined several details here. The number of reviews for the long-term loss of time increases my doubts that some people are given to promote names. I can't understand how anyone 9 years old can measure this ranking over 4, MAX. I mean, come, 5 is average. I can't think of anyone, even those who make money away from this, making it even as average. <br /> <br /> This makes my list of 10 worst movies all the time. And, hey, I like LIKE Stooges Three and can even tolerate Ed Wood!
