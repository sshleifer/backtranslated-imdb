My nose has just been hit just as I write this. I sent a preliminary comment to this film a few weeks ago that has not been found, so I think it was rejected, although it met all the usual guidelines. I saw this fascinating film for the first thirty minutes, especially the performance of Jordi Moll√†, an old actor who has been seen in the massive production as "Blow" and "Alamo." Leonor Watling is also quite good. Unfortunately, everything is increasingly ultimately under the weight of a very bad script, of melodramatic. There is also a lot of improper fraud that does nothing to develop a story or lend even a nuance of feelings to what otherwise a piece of art. The real-day trip to the coast in Valencia would be worse than having these false characters anytime, anytime.
