Terry West had a good idea w this movie. He did not only have flesh. There are endless shots of amazing school stations that are going to go forever and probably a film time. Also in this school there are only 2 students. Misty Mundae is as good as usual but this film is always a Ruby LaRocca (which is the only reason to watch the movie at the beginning). If the script focused on its interesting behavior we would like to have a movie to watch. She is good! Good news for DVD buyers, original Terry West (and better) "Blood For Muse" is a special feature. One thing I would like to say is that this movie feels like someone who is not good at giving a punch line at the end of a long rice for the end it feels like the same way. Then again, look here for Ruby LaRocca.
