This movie was the first time I saw it, when it was called "Lost in Translation." But somehow Bill Murray turned out to be a black man playing with Morgan Freeman, Scarlett Johansson turned into a Latino who played with Paz Vega, and Tokyo, Japan turned to Carson, California. Instead of a meaningful and quiet conversation we were happy in the translation, we get an unnecessary inconvenience in the 10 things that sound anger. Instead of the characters who were interesting and uninformed as in the translation, we find the characters who advise them of useless advice on topics that they do not know. What? The T-shirt of a million dollar dollars has never been in the Target department's shop is aimed at advising a working class woman how to prepare for a job interview as an administrative assistant? Do not think that it leaves them. If she did not give her advice, she tells her what she should eat. The most offensive part of the film to me was how they thought to quickly make an appointment, and yet the characters continue to get at the time of the run sometimes, that is the car wash, stop at Arby's, or just put next to the list off 10 Items or less list of things they love and hate. I continued to persuade them to say, "Didn't you say that you should have somewhere? What is he doing? A minute ago it was too late, now you eat a roasted meat and reflect on your life!" Until I saw this film, I never understood how something could "insist on itself," but I think this movie makes it exactly the same, and so it is not recommended. Discussion makes the characters happy and uncomfortable? Unless I felt sorry for all actors by signing on this project.
