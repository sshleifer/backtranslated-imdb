This film is a lot of abduction of the "demon" masterpeice and that's the only thing that makes the movie look. Acting is awesome, action scenes are faster, the script is almost painful and the budget does not exist. If you think this movie is good then you don't see a real movie of fear, skip this and get a copy of the cinema movies.
