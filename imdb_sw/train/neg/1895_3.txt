The 1975 teacher of the GUILLOTINE walk is an amazing and amazing film look. This is not because the fighting is being done specifically or because the film makes any sense. It's because the film is romantic and so high-top that it is a classic - bad, but fun. Young blind stars who have a Frisbee device like a chain that triggers the heads of people as he hits this expertise for his enemies! Who cares that physics is not possible or that the film has things like 12-legged fighters of paper or that the man was blind! It's just a glance to watch from beginning to end - and one of my films that love "bad" and enjoy seeing it with friends. Because of this film, I was interested in seeing GUILLOTIN OF FATAL (1977), although it is unfortunate that it is not good but it is a bit of hesitation to take a lot of ideas from nature but refuse to make films be consistent or visible. Indeed, it is a fun of fun, but it has never been close to MASTER OF GUILLOTINE OF EXPERIENCE in the value of entertainment. Like the original film, there are these flying devices that are moving, but they are quite different - and so round and around their own mind. There is also a person who is not blind but rather a group of baddies who have no depth and listeners do not understand exactly what is happening in this English version, such as a plot is not fully understood. However, at the same time, some military actions are very good. Although it is not over the high levels of many Bruce Lee or Sonny Chiba films, the action is worth despite the most interesting and often combining plot. In general, this is a film that military fans can love (with its many mistakes, a lot, a lot, a lot, but also that others will leave or laugh hysterically rather than enjoy the action because the film is just interesting. has never been almost as funny or seen as a MASTER OF THE GUILLOTINE FLYING.
