I am glad that I saw this film after Lord Sandler became famous. <br /> <br /> It's badâ€¦ bad, bad, bad. There is no plot. It's like watching a bad movie at home. I enjoy most of his other movies ...... but if you're a fan like me .... leave it off with this. It can change your mind about Adam. You can never recover from fear that is this film .... I've had a good time looking at old people playing scrabble at home .........
