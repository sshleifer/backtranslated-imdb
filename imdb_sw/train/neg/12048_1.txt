I have walked from 6 movies to my whole life. This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I don't know how I stayed for an hour. I had to be in a coma that night. I saw it on the playground when it happened 8 years ago. I didn't even remember that name, but I knew that Penelope Ann Miller appeared in it. It must be greatly affected that I have lost my time to comment on it today. Yech! Vomit! Barf!
