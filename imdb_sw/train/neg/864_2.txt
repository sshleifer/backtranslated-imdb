Although there is a repertoire of more than 180 films of choice, this 'Succubus' is often called the best name of Jess Franco. Heck, even the famous film writer Fritz Lang calculates 'Succubus' among his personal recommendations. So, maybe it's me but I thought this was a terrible and very complicated movie. Opening is good, though, and shows Janine Reynaud doing the act of SM in action. It's downhill from here, unfortunately. The character of Reynaud is a maneater who ultimately kills his beloved in some kind of trance. Franco had a good budget to work and make good use of it in good places, photographing and coloring. This would be his great film really, if it was not for a fiction and non-fascinating story. It should be a psychedelic but I would like to say sophomoric is the best time to describe what is shown here. Half of the time, you have no clue going on or what it says even in a short time of 80 minutes it looks for many years. This is certainly not the best film of Franco according to me. I can't even suggest to explain fans of zeal. If you are looking for the best film of Jess Franco, try to get your hands on 'Las Vampiras', 'Emergency Dr Orloff' or 'Female Vampire'.
