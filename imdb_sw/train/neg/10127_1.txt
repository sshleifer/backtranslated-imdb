This edition made me feel physically ill, and completely canceled from the UK society in general. It was a plan like this with Blue Blue which made it there / there was no class divisions in England. They always say things like; "Go to your loft and you can get this." Or "Go to your back garden tonight and ..." - how about our kids 'scummy' class who have never had "loft", and "gardens" back "which was no more than 1 square meter of balcony on the 14th floor to block the council? Public marketing - yes! And on top of that, it was very difficult to see those stupid, middle class, up-their-back back kids mess up with old plastic bits to have 'fun' ... make me grace, and "why don't you don?" 't' go and crush your wrists or make oversese coke on "Mama and Papa" money ... you make me sick
