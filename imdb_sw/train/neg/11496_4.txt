The document was conducted / conducted on one of the most dark places of guatemala. is shown as happy, safe ... but sadly, sex workers' teams played on a football team, gathered in what they seem to be not over a week! The main aim of the document is to prove that the community is faced with this type of "workers", although there is no solution for poor women to achieve success, except that the people who wrote this, made them "stars" (such as the head says so) instead of using the document this truth. it does, however, its own reality ... but, sadly does not relate to the main story. I don't want to accept it again; but I would like to recommend for cultural purposes only general.
