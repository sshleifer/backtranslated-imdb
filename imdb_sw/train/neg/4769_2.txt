Sadly it was wrong. This movie dropped from beginning to end. It was hard to watch because I was looking at Clarissa defining that every day at Nickelodeon. I loved him. Then something else I found was spread in Maxim and had a beautiful color! I have never heard anything about it until I watch this film by accident. I couldn't believe he could even allow something like this to appear and named around. Everything about it was bad but it still looks like someone somewhere in the team was trying really hard to save the sun's ship. I hope he continues to do it and I would like to see him striking on a real movie.
