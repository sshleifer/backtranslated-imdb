Movie was "OK". It's not bad, it's not good, it's just the same. If there is anything else on this playground it would be descending. Sadly, quickly and angry 2 also blows, but I would like to see this than FF2. :) If you have a ferry to a port of ports or other small punk, this will be a "good" movie for you. Personally, I would wait HBO or Blockbuster.
