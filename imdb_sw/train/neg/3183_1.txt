Sergio Leone circles in his grave ... If there was any film that uses someone's life it does this work. Bravado's leading characteristic of leadership behavior is powerless and crippled, and the script seems to be written by a highly qualified monkey. Anyone this idea must have a beaten horse. The only reason I spend time is failure is because there is less than 10th. The Sergio Leone family should accuse him, not because of his crash, but because now it cannot be destroyed as MST 3000. Hate. I am blaming Hollywood ... at least Gary Busey makes damages that can not accuse anyone but cocaine users and weapons specialists ... this film is a breach.
