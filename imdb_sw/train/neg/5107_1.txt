There is an uk version for this show which is less attractive than the American version. The person involved will receive a new kitchen or perhaps a bedroom and a bathroom and is a wonderful thanks to what they have. The American version of this show is everything that the TV is not supposed to be. Instead of making a few improvements to homes that are unable to afford or make themselves the whole house gets rebuilt. I don't know if this show is trying to show you a lousy welfare system in the United States or when you earnestly pray for it. The sealing of the worst products, especially with Sears, was also unlocked. In addition to converting one family into a deprived area of ​​potential millionaires, it would be better to help the general community where instead of using hundreds of thousands of dollars in one home, build something for the whole community ..... maybe where the and power can borrow and return with building materials so that everyone can benefit when they like. Giving all to one person can lead to great hatred among all the local communities who still live in the same house.
