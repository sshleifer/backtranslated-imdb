This was the shortest spot seen in one of the "Night of the Night" in 1971. The Sue Lyon period (the popularity of Lolita film) and Joseph Campanella who are playing the baby's bed with the vampire, respectively. Vampire employs a baby bed to watch the baby (which appears to bewolf or monster) while going out at night with blood. Sitter child does not know the vampire's appearance when he first saw him and just started to put two and two when he realized that he has no reflection in the mirror, has an unusual collection of books in the library on magic, and he hears wonderful sounds when the vampire goes talk to the child. He realizes that an unemployed person cannot be what he thought he was originally. He drives out the door, vampire comes out of the puzzled look and the approaching period. I don't know what the purpose of doing the shortened section that lasted just 5 minutes. They should only extend the previous period and 5 minutes similar to this stop. Overall efforts have been lost.
