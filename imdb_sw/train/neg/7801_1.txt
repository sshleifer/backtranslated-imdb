I will put this for as long as possible if this piece of fraud is not accepted. ZOMBIE 90 is one of the worst films made - above and entering another terrible zombie's Schnaas - DOOM OF ZOMBIE (aka VIOLENT SH! T 3). These films are so bad that everyone involved in their creation should be shot. I somehow managed (without difficulty ...) to go through ZOMBIE DOOM - but ZOMBIE 90 doesn't know much - even compared to the other awesome movie of Schnaas - which I had to move forward every 10 minutes. ZERO skill acting, inept gore, bad camcorder-style camera-work, dubbing ignorance ... just continues and continue. Surely I can't find one thing that frees up this waste - and I usually get something to redeem next to any film. Certainly this is one of the worst films made - You've warned ... 1/10
