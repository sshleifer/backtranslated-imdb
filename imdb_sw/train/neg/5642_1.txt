This title looks more like a film exercise than a film that would have been released to be seen by the public. For David and his wife they should be happy to work together in the film for the first time, without considering that people can actually look at it. I felt like it was a lost 90mins when I waited anxiously for a plot to develop, or even started. Try to match this film to type and you can't, because it has no beginning, middle or end. I have seen 'arty' movies before and this has not come close to being arty, abstract or original, it just seems to be completely useless. I think it speaks of itself when the only people who tested this 10 were under 18 years old. That's like you can call it a sign. Certainly there was no taste.
