I would like to leave the movie half through if I didn't have the people who loved. The movie depends on the actual events, but it is more than the top did not really see. I have a certain psychological history, depend on many people of psychotherapists, and I have learned people so much, so it's not that I think people like this are not. But in the same film, only the characters who seemed regular are the father of Augusten (Alec Baldwin) and Augusten little (Jack Kaedin). (Although Evan Rachel Wood was an exciting combination - very sexy and a bad feeling of fun). There was a very interesting moment, but the sound of the whole movie was bad, strange, and bad. It is lost by giving us the best! When I looked at them through their turns, I felt like I was looking at the acting class. This brought home at the time of credit, when several people were shown just sitting there, not doing, not talking. These moments were more than entertainment than 2 hours ago.
