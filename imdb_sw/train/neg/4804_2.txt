I don't watch many television and found on this show. Reality show? I am sure this hope is not true. If I was a man and I was married and I married so, it's the reasons for divorce. I think he sets a poor example of how one should treat someone he loves. That is one thing that is similar to our world now, many people in bad relationships, selfishness and don't know what it means to love another truth. It is a sacrifice and not something that should be on the merritt. That does not give you one very good feeling, to look at what should be in private advice. If his personality in the show is in fact, then he deserves the best person that would show real love and care for whom. What? Does this show the real situation or is designed for standards? I would like to know. Trust, GB
