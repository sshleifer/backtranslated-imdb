For one instant when it appears to be interesting, it has never been there. People come from one step to another, without any point (if there was one was too small). There was no action, insistence or fear and the perpetrators were unkind, so there was no concern for them. All together the film was very good. <br /> <br /> I offer 3/10. I love that it was not a shaky works of the old camera and if there was a music it didn't despise me as some bad movies and acting was not awesome.
