To see if I would like to read a long essay to expect to be sure and despair, I will first tell everyone that this film was awesome. Downright awesome. And not, surprisingly for the reasons mentioned in the first review. I thought I might agree with him, seeing as he gave his movie the title, but he screamed for sadness when he read. I am very embarrassed to have one side as someone who said that movies "certainly do not have women who look good." Let me be the first to say, "Wow! That was deep in the eye." My mind cannot understand the philosophical seasons about this movie. "To a large extent, the lack of" good women "should not be considered to be important to the movie.
