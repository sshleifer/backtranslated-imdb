I think any novel that is relatively low such as Moby Dick does not get a great deal with the audience during the Depression who had their own problems. But any similarity with the novel of Herman Melville's ordinary is unfortunate. In fact half the film is prequel for the main story as we know, not that much of it was stored for the film. We meet Ahab The first truth (he has a last name with a brother) as happy to go to the fortune soul and two feet with a desire to marry Joan Bennett who is the daughter of Mapple's father. Brother Derek, who played with Lloyd Hughes, also wants to marry Bennett. John Barrymore is Ahab in a high performance period. Barrymore did not know the sound of the sound and gave out all of the silent history of histrionics as well as the sound of the action that would have shaken the rafters of any film of this film. We see Ahab lost his foot to Mohale Dick the big whale and I say the capture area was very awesome. This course was all before the Code. I'm still sure the 1930 listeners were afraid. After that, Ahab's hunting story for the whale that he thinks has made him look for Joan Bennett's eyes. That's not exactly the motivation of Melville, in fact there are no women characters in Moby Dick as he wrote. <br /> <br /> One of the things Melville empowered the crew of Ahab's Pequod ship and reputation. More than Queequeg spoon of cannibal names are, but not self. Starbuck and Stubbs can also be Smith and Jones. <br /> <br /> I'd like to see this version of Moby Dick for strictly curiosity and anything else.
