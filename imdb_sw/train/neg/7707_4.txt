With the title as "Attack of Tomato Killer!", Anyone who enters into this matter would be expecting a) bad movie fiction or b) comedy make fun of the worst false movies. It should be a combination of both, including the level of skill. Unfortunately, it falls flat soon. <br /> <br /> It won't be considered to take this movie seriously, I see that, but you should think it's funny, right? I found only a few jokes or circumstances were interesting (ie, telephone talk on the side, Olympic Olympics eating steroid corn, Superman walking with Lois, etc.). "Killer Tomato attacks" strives to be a cult group, but it does not. Classical worship is a movie that is very different from the only group of people they understand (or the same details). The "Killer Tomato Attack" may be interested in anyone who is 8 years old with a bad sense of humor, therefore, it is not appropriate to have a religious film. <br /> <br /> There is one good practice in the whole thing: Sharon Taylor as Lois Fairchild. He is a quick, powerful writer, but he has a beautiful personality, likes to overthrow, and is a natural comedienne. Unfortunately, he is used to misuse here. The "Killer Tomatoes" is not as surprising as, say, "Amazon Women on the Moon" or "Kentucky Fried Movie", but it does not have a short hilarious time, so I would suggest reviewing once. Avoid the cut of the director, facing the film producer and some of the "lost" pictures mentioned in African language (it can be found in English without publication).
