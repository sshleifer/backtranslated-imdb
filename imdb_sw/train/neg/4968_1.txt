I was expecting a film from Grendel, a book written by John Gardner in the late 1970s. It was based on Epic Beowulf, but told it from a monster perspective. <br /> <br /> Anything you can think about the book of Gardner, the movie derived from Epic Beowulf should not be entitled to Grendel, while it does not say anything more about the monster more than a few pathetic scenes that the monster CG is seen as nothing more than the Predator changed. On top of this, journalists should also be punished for spreading the original story of evil and contributing to the ongoing ignorance of television viewers in the United States. Normal Hollywood to get this is not correct. <br /> <br /> Awesome disappointment and full waste of time.
