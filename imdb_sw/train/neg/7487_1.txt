Unfortunately, this film is very bad. The original fighters was manic and very surprising, of course they used the script written by Neil Simon. For some reason Neil Simons script is not used in this film so it falls on time and from time to time. Even the audience I had did not laugh. The direction is very slow and interesting and when there is joke provided so far the joke dies i.e. Couples who have sex in the garden. They declare it is a New York lighting ceremony, and we all know the lights will come and we'll see the cute and insert Goldie & Steve to make a little stick. All the movie winds have been like this ... jokes are introduced and provided. Why is not Goldies hair standing even on the movie? You will also see every closer to Goldie (uses very soft soft lenses). I recommend hiring nature by Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis, that's like you want to laugh.
