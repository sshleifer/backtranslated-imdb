(Refer to English, since Swedish is not allowed.) / I see this film very optimistic, and I can let you know that the film has never been with them. As I liked to see Janne "Loffe" Karlsson on big screen again, the authors should realize early in the script process that seven people fall into the water, not original or funny. The story is very narrow and joke is used and predictable, those who are not, are very simple. I shouted three times during all the film. <br /> <br /> Placement of Swedish Findus products is (without pretending) funny, why not just a great sign to say; "Findus has made it happen!". GÃ¶ta Kanal 2 should not be seen on the movie or on the DVD, just wait on the air on television, it may take too long.
