From the opening talks and events, I knew I knew that I was in the fall of the train. He didn't want to look, but could not turn. If it was not for the eyes of this film, I could give one star. The fact that the interaction between the characters and the conduct of the relationship was widely available, added to the negative trend and sad story makes this film not more than a low budget disaster. Money is definitely not necessary to make a good film. But this film fails because it didn't have a chance to return. If you are already stuck in the bushes, your best childhood friend dies from an unknown illness, some friends who die near you, have been struck by a strange place, what would you do? A.) Get out with everyone and try your own luck. B.) Love sex with your partner. C.) Take a hot bath to relax your grief including stretching your legs. D.) Bash in your best friend's childhood and crush long for a shovel. E.) All of the above. <br /> <br /> According to Eli Roth, none of these answers are very common. In fact, they are all proposed and well represented in Cabin Fever. The general lack of truth and an unsuspecting attempt to explain what people will do in horrible circumstances gives us this film on the bone bin in your rental store. Stay away. Stay away.
