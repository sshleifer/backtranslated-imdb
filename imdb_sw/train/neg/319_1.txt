My friend bought this film for Â£ 1, and yet it was much bigger. Despite the presence of large names such as Adam Sandler, Billy Bob Thornton and a very skilled Burt, this film was almost as exciting as taking a chisel and closing it directly through your earhole. It uses fatigue, under the comedic drum technique - often breaking the fourth wall like Sandler talking to the audience, and the negative "" hot girls. " Adam Sandler has a sailor who wants to make it as a successful partner to be successful with women. When a sailor - a shamelessly named 'Dickie' due to his unknown achievement and gender - is thought to be lost in the sea, the character of the Sandler Shecker finds its great break. Dickie is not dead, still tied to the bathroom, perhaps the sea patient. <br /> <br /> Maybe from his mouth he just ripped the worst movie of all time.
