It is interesting that a non-conspiracy novel has been based on two films. When Heiress was good, if not quite accurate, to deal with the situation, Washington Square is a heavy and improper load, except for part of Dr Sloper, a film that would be better. The efforts of the director to do 'beautiful' scenes were very clear that I was a offender. You don't have an inexpensive and simple beauty which a non-conspiracy film can have, like Onegin. I agree with other views on Leigh's photo of Catherine as idiot, rather than naive and shy; he made me despise him not to feel. Catherine's transition from children as adult faith, anything to the story, was inward, as it was in the novel. But we have no advantage of the story of the story to tell us that in the film! I think someone broke the class to deal with the school film. I appreciate the efforts of the director to make a moving and beautiful film from hard text but didn't work.
