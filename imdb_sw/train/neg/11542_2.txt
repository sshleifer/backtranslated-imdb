An unhappy woman and unhappy man is violently and shocked by a two-stage psychological group during a night-long meeting on a forest road in Shropshire, England. The man and woman who have been attacked and made a assault attack against their attackers ... <br /> <br /> A piece of a trap of voyeuristic garbage, somehow deals with the 'triggering' game, when actually comes as Michael-Winner cr * p (you know that Oliver Reed and Susan George would be healed if it was very easy to do in the 1970s). What happens to Alice (Gillian Anderson) and Adam (Danny Dyer) is amazing and perishable, but Dan Reed can rub the nose of the viewer in every end of the world of sexual destruction. His camera stays hungry on the body of Anderson's nakedness all the time and after the attack, when the script leaves all the leaves striking the turgid sea of ​​two dimensional cliché. His script convinces its characters to behave in order to eliminate the viewer from 'victims' by hitting the worst situation on their faces (Adams tried to be attacked after the incident for both Sophie and Alice; the attack on Alice on Heffer AFTER suicide -Using confessing ). <br /> <br /> The child comes from the exhibition of the main characters - Dyer is a horrible actor, unable to have a light and shadow as a young victim of the first attack (he will end Eastenders, mark my words), but Anderson's incredible. Even if the angry script influences his behavior to live in a rough and appealing way, it somehow gives a rare and complicated reputation as a self-defiant, wise person who meets those fears and needs to take revenge. The worst and meaningless movie then, almost but it is not completely saved by female female performance.
