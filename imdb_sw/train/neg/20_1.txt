This movie was awesome. the first time I read the summary of the plot and it seems to be right, so I watched it. Acting was TERRIBLE. it was like an actor was almost a camera embarrassed. everything seemed fake. I feel bad for Edward Furlong, 2 layout I liked a few years ago. I looked at it at least 20 times. The authors were perhaps sleep deprived when they come up with lines. <br /> <br /> The joint side, is a good kind of bad movie. one you look at just to see how much worse, so later you can tell other people how you can believe how to scary the film. <br /> <br /> I think everyone should look at this, so we can understand better, REAL, movies.
