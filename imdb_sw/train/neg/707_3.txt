"The Feast of All Saints?" Where ...? When ...? Was the Feast of All Saints and the story made? <br /> <br /> It is losing a wonderful name! There is nothing in the story that has a distant relationship with "All Saints." There is nothing in the story about "All the days of the spirit" which the word refers. Why are you engaging in this title if you never involve any kind of storyline or theme about “All Days of the Soul” or “All Saints”? <br /> <br /> Wrong text writing and amateur scripts <br /> <br /> How were they attracted to such talent? Writing is dear - characters who have known all their lives go to a big speech for a long time about their life history for viewers. Not how people talk. <br /> <br /> What did the director think? <br /> <br /> Redirect is exactly the same! The compulsory and deliberate style feels young. In one area, the character describes “Take your hands away from me” and no one touches! The worst part directed, however, is the scene of a wonderful war on the beginning of the film. Too many in the fake area, silly <br /> <br /> There are many people who have died in the war zone. It looks like a Skit on Saturday night! You can see additional waiting cues for them to walk on the camera. Everyone plays the death zone as boys of the fourth grade - spreading every little thing to lose. Blood on the victims of war is excessive and indifferent looks like a person used a ketchup supplier and the same lines of red color on clothing. <br /> <br /> This whole area of ​​war comes as a spoof of a real cheesy war movie. You almost expect someone like Will Ferrell and Mike Myers rides and give punchline. Who in the True Life could Be This Way? A little bit of writing writing, leading and throwing is actually the focus of the area: <br /> <br /> The little girl standing under the death of her embalmed father - who is very mutilated, and The real blood dripping form its wounds gaping. Even the idiot would surely know he was dead! Yet he is - very much - repeat the frequency "Daddy, father ..." looking at someone with no screens. He saved it with sincerity and enthusiasm as you would expect from a non-actress who was coming back to the camera line all the time. Even if the poor child had any skills to do, it is not quite possible. Little girl can not even be in the middle of the battlefield after hours of murder - surrounded by hundreds of corpses, when she stood there! Natural nature would have a child screaming and scared, running away from bloodshed! <br /> <br /> Do we think we are afraid or laughing?? !! <br /> <br /> Details of one goofy, which gives the satire of satire of satire, is a twin father, and a big hook through his mouth and cheek. He looks like a fish on the hook! Non-deliberate details of funny, make the whole area a fake and silly. The La-La-Land Dream, Mother and Daughter is Their Age! Other strange details, is that you see the central character - the mother of the girl - at the end of the area and in the next area, which happens 20+ years later, looks exactly the same! She is still young and beautiful, and now it's the same age with her daughter! I have ever turned the movie there because the direction and writing was very clear - but I tried to reinforce it because I wanted to see Louisiana settings and I love all actors. I don't know what these artists thought when they accepted these roles! Who is the target audience? Most of the blood and violent violence in the opening area is weirdly out of place with soap opera drop stories that follows. It is also a wonderful way to start a movie which, for another period, seems facing women of romantic roman reading. A wonderful lack of sound!
