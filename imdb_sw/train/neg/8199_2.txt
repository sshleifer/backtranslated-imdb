I am oh soooo happy I haven't used money to go to the movies on it :-). It is not more than a combination of a few other titles such as The Thing, Final Fantasy, Abyss etc. written in a lightweight and useless manner. In fact I can't imagine what it was to create this film - it doesn't have anything new to offer in its story which also means. In addition there is nothing to look at - FX'es seems to have been taken from a second store, usually you have seen all in other movies. But it is definitely a good klalaby.
