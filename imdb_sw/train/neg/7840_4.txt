This film is sold through the eyes of a little teacher at a Catholic school, looking like the genocide of the RAWANDAN around him. The movie is approaching for a brief description of past history and the competition of Rawanda. Then it jumps to the story as described by the young boy's "NEW-COMER" little teacher who doesn't take life or situation very seriously. If he and the driver's approach to the road he plays near his drivers I.D. not realizing that this is a sharp time and that if the driver is not able to identify himself as the right tribe for the soldiers will be killed. And so does the thoughtful story of chaos and around him. Ghafla knows that every Rawandan (including his driver) is responsible for that European troops and tourists cannot and will not help. The media cameras cannot stop the tiles, and there are too many fights that are trying to shoot the gunmen. The name comes from the captain of the army saying he is going to throw the dog to the body of the dead next to his compound, but it will not beat the men of the squad who kill people near the area. Especially because they have not chased the soldiers yet. Finally he realizes the despair of the situation with a young man who explains to transfer the team that wants to leave his seat for one of the target victims, run with his inner tail in the middle of his feet, rather than face immanent death and school children he promised not to leave. It is more than a study of behavior, and coming to Jesus during one character, than a story about genocide in "RAWANDA". This film was not done by RAWANDA, it could be one of the holes of the genus of the genus around the world at any time.
