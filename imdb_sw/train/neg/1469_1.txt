If you watch the neighboring movies of the neighboring camp nearby, "Summer Summer" is sleepy sleep. Eight traders of the visitors have not been introduced, while non-emotional flashbacks are happening to characters who do not know about. The best artists, Alan Arkin, and Bill Paxton have completely lost this film. One observation observation that "everything seems very little than I remember" from time to time ten times, enough to trigger. Expectations are not surprising or original, unless you think that a few pieces are "real" player. This movie was a great disappointment in terms of many of the talents. "Indian Summer" did not make me at home, just sick. - MERK
