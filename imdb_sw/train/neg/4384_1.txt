The fact that someone actually spent money on such a bad script, it's more of me. This should be one of the worst films, with "Haunted Highway" I have ever seen. BAD developers, and bad stories. There is no common effect on any event in this film, and even though it is Halloween, ordinary people will have a great impact when they witness their father is killed, not to mention gutted, people with tape covering their air, they cannot breathe (in the room and at least 50 I can add) and someone dressed like Satan pulls the dead out of his house, even the 8-year-old would see the difference between the doll and the man. Not to mention the fact that no one can be ignorant and ignorant to believe the truth of Satan and the display of Jesus the same day, as this child does. When I was 8, I was much more intelligent than that. But, the stupid thing is that everyone else seems to be falling to this fool Satan is the same, no questions he asked. The question in the film is, Is Satan, or is it the man who killed people whenever he feels like that? Well, he has human hands, arms, built and nothing, so I think he should be in the movie too, otherwise they worked lousy to hide it. Then, with this man and all, he was able to kill an old woman, a man and his grandmother, 5 (!! ???) cops (both gunmen and train me presume), and a few other people. .... and obviously everyone was standing there waiting for him, or what? <br /> <br /> The whole concept and way of telling stories is the worst thing I have ever seen, and I can never recommend anyone to lose 1 hour and 30 minutes of their lives to look at all this trick.
