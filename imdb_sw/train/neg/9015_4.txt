The first 45 minutes of Dragon Fighter is quite acceptable and amazing. The characters are honest and interesting. Laboratory cloning looks high-tech. After that, it all falls. The characters begin to run idiotically, and the new feature comes from anywhere about the combination of fusion (and this is said to be "current day") goes to the key, which is just the right right which must kill the dragon - just doesn't 't. Finishing is very weak. Someone is wondering what made the film start as well as possible. All characters except Dean Cain are played by Russians. This leads to a situation with an extraordinary explanation, as a character played by Vessela Dimitrova called "Bailey Kent" despite its heavy smell (and despite him, at once, easily takes * Spain *!) <br /> <Because of A good start, I realized that this movie is 5, but it was more sad than that, so I just gave him 4.
