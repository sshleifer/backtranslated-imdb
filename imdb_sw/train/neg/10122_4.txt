Yet another original film from Alfred Hitchcock which appears to have been made out of contract obligations. As with Juno and Paycock, you can say that Hitchcock had no great interest in this film. There is virtually no style or trick at all. This story surrounds Fred and Emily, a young married couple, who enter some money and go on a journey that shows that they are a test of their marriage. Emily has been given an opportunity in a new life with a good, rich man who loves her, but chooses to take the highway and stay with her husband. This may seem trustworthy if Fred was not designed to be the worst donkey, who jumps to the first place he finds to remove his wife from another woman. Couples end up staying together, but the movies are not suitable for real-time reconciliation. The third act goes in a different direction, and the couple was beaten on a ship that was left to be saved by an Asian fishing boat. Joan Barry provides excellent performance as a faithful wife of an unbelieving husband. That's about all you can say about this.
