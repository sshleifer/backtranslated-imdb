That is definitely the greatest movie ever that I have ever seen and quite possibly the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. Workers and actors were horrible and seemed like they were trying the most difficult way of playing their roles as dorks, tough guys, jerks, knowing all, etc. And bigfoot itself was bad. It seemed to be some kind of computer-made photographs since Atari & Intellivision. One time near the end of the film as an attacking army was driving the survivors off, one was shot and if it runs it looks like a poor man's kong's own! And one is shot by the blood and the blood from it is a sharp animation. Another thing that was heard was music. The path to many ways (classical or whatever you call) on the entire film. It had no end. Oh, the movie is very interesting. One of the worst films I ever saw. I strongly recommend taking your $ 3 or whatever they charge to rent this movie and use it on a gallon of gas or a value value somewhere. STEPS!
