I don't know what Margaret Atwood was thinking to allow this movie to have the same name as her book. I have been a big fan of Robber's Bride and I was very happy to learn there was a film at work. I understand that the translation of the book to the movie cannot but this film was quite bad. The names of women are correct and some of the previous stories are correct but that's about it. I feel I have lost a good part of my time trying to make it through this film. This would really be a mini series to tell the story how it was written. Roz, Tony, Charis and Zenia were well chosen though I was concerned at first about Mary-Louise Parker. I just want to have the best script to work and for this reason he had nothing to do with any book.
