Jeez, just in 70 years ... Antonio Margheriti brings us this diversification of quirky ginger to the western kung fu flick around the treasure-hunt. The partnership of these trashy partners between Shaw Brothers and the Italian company one-off includes a fascinating story, far from the T&A wall. of the psychiatric cover of Yancey Hobbitt (basically suspended by Julian Ugarte, a person who would have to do more than a European breeding method than he did), you want a roulette-chat, music back to sound and sound effects accompanied by various events (especially every fly to Lo Lieh). When a small piece of action falls with a square in Turkey, it is good to see Van Cleef and Lo Lieh on the screen, and you can't deny the charisma of this duo. Don't expect too much, and you will get a lot from them. This is my reality. What is it?
