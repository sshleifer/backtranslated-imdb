Good films can not only focus on the beautiful garden and on the hill. Surprised to see is winning two awards. More facing. I first saw that kind of film from China, with amazing exhibitions but also with a very interesting thing to say, well, more than 10 years ago and I'm sure there is still more to come. This is not one of them, I'm afraid.
