This human film is greatly affected by the author / director of the deception of Paul Thomas Anderson. From a huge quantity of the best material (Altman's "Nashville," "Lumet" network, this crawling elephant takes too long to find anywhere. Poorly caused pieces along the way (interactive music music, biblical stress) is not recommended. Nor is the level of variation of the exhibition. Especially bad: William H. Macy, whose character and his story could be completely removed; Julianne Moore, for its angst unknown. And how often should we see Shtick Sad Sack of John C. Reilly ("Chicago" and "Hours" will be enough)? Tom Cruise comes well for comparison ?? its misogynist, Saint Roller's Bride was rather exciting. Speaking of dirty mouths, the script was very closed with "F" bombs, they lost their effect at any time. Do not even talk about that ugly voice, full of sad and provocative sounds by Aimee Mann. His "One," maudlin number starting with, has thrilled me at the start of the movie. I had to focus on the script on the wall and save myself three hours, at a time when I would be pushing along the abyss. One aspect of redemption, which I have never mentioned in other reviews, is the best performance in the group, and Melora Walters is unknown in Claudia's position, the damaged coke is based on personal damage. His honesty surpassed all the others in the distance. This film took itself very seriously and does not know when the end.
