I recently hired after hiring "Stepped" of Ben Stein and I think it would be interesting to compare them. Before going further, it seems just right to explain the following so the reader can see if I am hate or not. I'm trying to have a goal, for a record. I have enjoyed enjoying the Maher show of HBO from time to time, although I rarely think he's the source of humor. I don't care exactly for his stand. But he makes good points on the show regularly, and I liked Politics It was wrong, although he was still correct for politics (which I think is bad because this word appears Orwellian or at least fascist). In my religious opinion, I will humbly tell you that I am not a sign. A Christian has other views that are romantic and some of which are mixed. It is said, this is a bad "document" for reasons that have never been touched by many viewers - although those listed are also valid. The reason is unacceptable not only that he says the main thing without letting others speak (and his point will not have any meaning, "just come, really?" Which is not sure, just a question. This reason does not lie to its lack of experts on the issue. I saw this about two months ago and I just remember talking to a man whose qualifications were considered if he was not a pastor. There are probably hundreds of scientists or at least a professor and Masters or Doctor of Doctors like to do a bit of words, especially in the areas of History, Anthropology or other army. If someone compares this to Ben Stein "Expelled: No Allowed Investigation" will find Stein's interview about 30 professional professors, professionals, teachers, etc.. He does so with various sources and backgrounds. It also does something in his film about freedom of thought and education. Maher could easily explain the errors of the theocratic laws in centuries or suffering from this. Instead, idiotically refers to the worldly brutal rule of the 20th century as a confirmation of why guarantees requires more social and political power! (it is in the bonus elements where he stands in front of Anne's house I think.) This is a true trip to Orwellian. He says Christianity especially for many unnecessary deaths - which has a part, though it is much smaller than many! - without even considering the basic view of evidence. Perhaps this is because the argument is facing a tragic human record record of the 20th century alone. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < / He takes a weak noise of cattle. How difficult is that? How does confirming the existence of differences affect the universal principle? Not suitable. Wow, so the people in churches think out of ordinary? How to shine this know. Great work Maher! Again, it would be much easier to interact with someone like Laurence Vance and incorporate his work on rejecting the idea of ​​"the responsibility of the country" which requires a man to fight in any country his country is involved. <br /> <br /> Above all that, he's not just funny here. Some of the clips that are covered in "clever" out of the way / unfavorable conditions can make fun, but actually work to show how the actual argument of the text from Maher cannot come, even a bit of lobby. He spends a lot of time attacking Christians, walking accurately, and questioning the fringe groups that do not allow him to answer his questions. <br /> <br /> For a record, there are good questions to honestly ask religious people and many should ask themselves. He touches almost one of these. I feel that I could respond better to more questions than the people he interviewed, but the whole thing is reeks of the deck-stacking for the issue of what was included and planned.
