This serial is interesting to look like the MST3K feature, but for today's audience is all. I was shocked to see the year of 1952. The fact of this fact makes this strong (down)? 2 in my book. Cars are used even to be seen in modern times, they seem like things from 30 years. It is basically Cody (the only salvation of the world? Sheesh speaks of insulting to everyone else, like a military), however it is Cody in her pocket suit suits to fly against Graber and Daley's two dumb's player who plays games with a regular pretty blind gun for his own right, enjoy it. If you want to look very good serial to see Flash Gordan, it is full of missiles that attack each other with the evil evil Nemesis and also women look, this has the NONE's that. And Flash was made 15 years or more before this trick so you can make it. What was done in 1952, this wrong, deserves 2. Nuff said. give 6 if you look like MST3K, those people are very happy; tweak the strokes here, tweak there and I'm flying! And now as a bonus added, I will bring you a song of Commander Cody Theme as you previously sing with Joel and his two character bots Tom Servo and Crow into the love satellites for the eighth part of the enemy Planet: <br /> <br /> (Singing credit at the beginning); TOM SERVO SINGING YOUR WOMAN'S WOMEN .... She is the REWARD OF IN THE REPUBLIC, <br /> <br /> EVERYTHING EVERYTHING ... except She is saved by editing, <br /> <br /> IN HIS NIPPLES TRAINING ... SENDING IS HIS WORD, TOGETHER / TOWARDS OF PUMPKIN AND PACK ROCKET .. .. SENDING NAME, <br /> <br> /> (KNOWING JOEL) LABRATORY OF HIS WORKING ... TIME TIME TIME IN TIME TIME TIME, <br / .. AND CODY TO DO, IT /> <br /> HE ENCOURS HIS TEA IN CAFE ... THE WARES OF THE WIRES, THE WILD BECOMES WITH THE PHYSICAL AND TRAINING ... AND PLEASE TRAINING, TOGETHER (SENDING THE WAY) BEWARE ... CODY IN, <br /> <br /> YOULL IN HAIR HAIR HAIR HIS HOME HELMUT ... AND because we can't think about the beautiful RHYME, <br /> <br /> That is the end of the Author CODY THEME SONG ... SO SIT SUMMARY EVERYWHERE TO GIVE, TYPING THIS'S PLANET
