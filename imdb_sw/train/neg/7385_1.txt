The movie is boring, characters and events are unrealistic, amazing, action is hilarious. This movie is a great mess. It's almost as if the music moves, the most interesting skills are running. Any sound is called by Mr. McGregor or Steven sang very much and changed his voice. There is a great way to talk about this film, and it works very badly on every behalf. The movie is a great cure for sleep. Fighting is laughable. The eye to the eye of the effect of the pregnancy of the drug was honorable. The main villain was joke and his character was well developed. The main villain was used to describe the story through interrogation, he would just throw random squares such as (spoiler) "CTX (drug drug) will be in the water" that has not been addressed in the conclusion or even mentioned in the film. This movie is recommended to be approved.
