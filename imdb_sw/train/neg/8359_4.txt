Despite some time in heavy rains, meeting with a drunk with a mixture of a gypsy and monkey, and staying in sanitarium, this "Rosy" of the Arbuckle of Arbuckle silently decreased with help from Buster Keaton and Al St.. John enjoys only if there is a very good Arbuckle in play with Buster which is the last "encounter exhibition" especially because it is one of the few times we see the Head of the Great Smoke and laugh at the movies! Also, many incidents appear to be recurring because of the high use of film stock. However, if you are a Arbuckle or Keaton Cancer, Night Beauty, Nurse! certainly has a value to watch.
