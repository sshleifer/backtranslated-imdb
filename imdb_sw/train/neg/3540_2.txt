Guy Richie's third film (not counting the worst of God "has been removed" is exciting exciting gambling, robbers and chess. First Richie experiments will be reluctant to revolver as I did, with its change. Jason Statham plays with Jake, an old con-player, when he came to take revenge on Dorothy Macha (good OTT Ray Liotta), but instead includes two others (one of them 3000 from Outkast rap clothing). who give us and us listeners, several red inputs in the film, all that is so bad. The action on this movie is a little in the restaurant, where the conversation gets under the thrill of the shot, slowly-put in by Beethoven. The Moonlight Sonata.All in all, Revolver is an unforgettable task, not really bad but far from the best Richie. That still will be Lock, Stock. If this film was a home job The work of the task will be a barrier 'you must try too much!'
