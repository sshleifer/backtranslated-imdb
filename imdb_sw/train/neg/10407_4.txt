I found the 4: Legend begins, becoming lighter and stimulating. Each of the events of the action was stupid. This is called "GRABOIDS" has been reduced by the size of modern modern house cats, if not small. The job was awesome, and this film was just an unwanted movie in the rage of the rage, because even though it says the story of how graboids were established, the story is dumb and useless. GOD (Michael Gross), being an old man, when he is now in an offensive movie.Geez ... If you haven't seen this film, don't waste your time.Stick For Surprise, 1, 2, and 3, for a good time. This film, make sure, you are in the village sitting next to you and the STOP button that works quickly from this shortage.
