Salvage: 4 out of 10. Groundhog Day is experiencing a Christian Error of the Union. Well maybe it's not bad. But it's close. Claire (played by Alicia Silverstonesque Lauren Currie Lewis) is hit by a fatal killer (Chris Ferry who is a shocking and brutal shock). I explain the possibility because it wakes up and it was a dream? Or either? (Cue Music) <br /> <br /> The basic problem with the film is that fifteen minutes of the plot (Well done first time) is repeated again and again. And since Claire rises every time and every area is clearly dreamed or a substitute fact I just stopped caring for what happened to Claire and began to wonder what the blind twist had to go to pull this together. he had roots for the meeting (which would have much more meaningful) but instead of getting one of these too obvious and the end of surprise surprise (Consider Village or Low) Yup film fails faster than Donnie Darko directors. All of the losses in the awesome Sense Six Sites, the original Immune attack of the Body, the joy of my birth was performed because the audience did not wait for the information on the left field. (Heck even marine ended in the previous Friday of 13 was worth the jolt) <br /> <br /> Salvage on the other side shouting the twist ending with each change of location. Other errors that are emerging are the sound of the piano voice. there serial killer close. Some of the second job roles (especially Claire's mother played by Maureen Olander who resembles Mary Kay zombie) shows the first time the low-budget budgets. All too clever for half and not too clever Salvage puts your interests if you just see how they will make this mess. The problem is not true.
