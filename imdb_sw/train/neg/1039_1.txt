This "movie" is one of the most horrible things I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Please make a clearance and avoid this incomplete concoction. <br /> <br /> Download the camera and have your executives approve scowls does not count as "manual", which this film is required in groups. It is not that the text was so extraordinary, but we were left with a bunch of fake characters directed in such a fake (fashionable “fashion” style). <Br /> <br /> This film gives the impression that it has been made to scam to appeal to critics who do not know the first thing about films (which are many of them). It is very bad. It says a lot about Sundance and what is that Victor Vargas was open there.
