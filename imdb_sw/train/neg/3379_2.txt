I recently bought a DVD, forgetting how I hated the version of the "Chorus Line" movie. Every director Attenborough who made the story did not succeed. To make a connection to the Director-Cassie's popularity, all the music affiliate travels the window. <br /> <br /> Some music numbers are running and running. The hit song gets all the meaning that is corrupted when it's given Cassie's character. General skills feel very much. The only reason I give 2, is because a few of the big numbers can still enjoy despite an attempt to erase everything of fun and external winds.
