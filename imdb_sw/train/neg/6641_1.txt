I saw this film twice. I can't believe Pintilie made that movie of fantasy. I am also a director of movies / exhibitions and I know what I'm saying. This is no longer Romania, but I see events happening simultaneously with the event since September 11. No stories, no plot, no. There is no conclusion, no message, nothing big, nothing hidden. Just an empty picture. Most of the Romanians do not know, this film is for the French audience, not for us. They believe that it is true in Romania. Also for young people. Pintilie should stop making movies. I don't know if we can call this movie, maybe it's scared: And we wonder why we have the same picture in Europe. This was the truth, but it no longer exists. My best friend from the British embassy said: "You don't know how the Romanian people went for a long time from Ceausescu.
