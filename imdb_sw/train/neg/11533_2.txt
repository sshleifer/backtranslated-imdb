If you are given and predictable for retaliation it is yours, then you are faced with a few options ... They have no appeal to me, so I couldn't find anything to redeem this unique story. It looks like something straight from the 1980s, a different age when this would go straight to the video. Gillian Anderson and Danny Dyer do OK to work with a weak script and a bad situation. But what is Gillian Anderson doing to share with the film like this after his careful performance as Lady Deadlock in the BBC's TV's Bleak House change last year? The director is said to have been affected by the closest evidence of rape and his work in memory, but even that is not an excuse for a strange area where a pack of rural hounds beat Dyer. I don't think I was the only person in cinema laughter. What I can understand is the involvement of companies behind this film - FilmFour and Verve Photos. They have all been involved in independent UK films in recent years. Verve distributed Bullet Boy, Code 46 and Red Road - Straightheads should not be mentioned in one breath. FilmFour and Verve realize: this is the best you can do? What will the UK's independent filmmakers do for your artistic judgment? It's a great blot in both your features. Listen carefully: What? Can you hear thousands of filmmakers of the UK live in despair?
