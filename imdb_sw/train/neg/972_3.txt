This was a terrible terrible film on the little girl of snotty and her pain. For an awesome or "exciting" film and a foot, it is also a way to lose. There is only a short time here, not anywhere near the most should be of this kind of film. Even those events "when" was not much. Music made them more than that they were real. There is a lot of signs here, so academic listeners write this "awesome movie of thinking person." Yes, if they think, I am sure they will come up with the same conclusion I did - losing money on the video rental store. Summary: a yawner that provides a characteristic that leads to a distinctive and very serious act. It stands up and certainly not advertised.
