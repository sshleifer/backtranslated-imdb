I love MBBS munna bhai but "Lagge raho ..." SUX really SUX. I have never seen such an interesting movie throughout my life. And these high ratings really surprised me that they would appear to the taste of the cinema cinema Hindi? </> <br /> ** TO BE SPOILER ** on the phone comes someone from what part of the world u r ??? I agree that films should be false but these things are not enough. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10. (2 stars are 15 good hours starting)
