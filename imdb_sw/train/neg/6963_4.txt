Japanese have had a wonderful prospect in their fantasy movies. They have been ready to destroy the cities with huge plastic monsters coming from outside and elsewhere. The problem is that they have never had money to succeed in ensuring special effects. This film released in France under the head Les envahisseurs de l'espace, not different. His priority is to show the three creatures from the great sheep to the big lobster trying to have power over mankind. It is very complicated and interesting, but also very enjoyable too. After all, we do these creatures and these films after all, aren't we?
