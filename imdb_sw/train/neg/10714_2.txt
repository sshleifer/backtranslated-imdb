For two funniest players, the movie was bad. It quickly spread and never found the best! Wander the time and lose money! Tina Fey is a very good writer, I thought she would be very good at comedy. The review was too great, but only showed the best parts of the movie. My husband even thought that for a flick chick, it sucked. What is it with that. It was now very slow that was to stimulate. I won't recommend you to anyone at this time. I would like to turn my money to this! Boo from us here in Arizona. Thank you but no thanks. What kind of stupid things to make people think you're pregnant. I thought it would be very interesting, I had my children and I helped others have children. It can be more than the lines of truth.
