If you are one of the people who find "According to Jim" a great TV comedy, this will say your world. And it can add, kudos to prove that good talent, good writing and charismatic stars are all you need to really on any network except ABC, which prefers air crap as Jim Belushi show year after year. "K-911" is a big, steam, brown, German shepherd "thank you" for all scholars who loved the first movie. It is similar to the fans of the film and the little Belushi deserves. The comedic cometic of Jim and the choice in projects has never been behind his ability to wipe the blues level. Expecting to try to show all of his talent in every project he calls to the public as a surly chimpanzee. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy Jim's work, this film is your payment.
