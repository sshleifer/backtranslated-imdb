Imagine you are a high school boy, behind a dark, infinite hall with a girl and your girl. What? The movie would be so bad, so you could feel forced to leave the reminder and head home before it ended? This movie is bad. True. Movies are often very bad because they are good; This movie is more than that of the worst-ness. It's very bad. Fear, too much, crime-against humanity.
