Working in a video shop I see a small movie and sometimes I try to look at some of the less expensive movies. Pride happened to be one of them. The original idea of ​​telling a black shipping story during WWII had some characteristics. Yet in less than 10 minutes of watching the film you see that the basic stage of the film was to tell about the tension of color in WWII. The basic story is about ship, staff and use them in battle. This basic step is presented to you until you go through every stage of the movie. I am grateful to the men who served in the USS Mason for their victory in the face of trouble and with the difficulty they have endured. The film should be made to focus on the achievements that these people have done to themselves, the Navy and their country and not to make a film whose goal is racism during WWII.
