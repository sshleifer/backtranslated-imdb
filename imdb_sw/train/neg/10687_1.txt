At the end of the game started well, the little said on the last end. it was seen as what we do to continue to plot, for example the first journalist who is the most intelligent, intelligent, half-way through something is stupid and not at all, we are not given a reason for this and, the next place cannot have meaning without it. The whole story could be told in 30 minutes, it would have made a political celebration of the talent of Cuba Gooding Jr. it is very visible by James Woods doing a pleasant job to consider. The game was one of the worst films I ever seen ...... and that says something, I have seen Gigli.
