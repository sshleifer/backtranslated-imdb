Remember to all the science scientists everywhere: if you are going to turn your child into a monster monster, you need to give him a name that is not much better than "Paul." I don't care if it's a shark of a stunning hammer with sharp teeth and the ability to drive people out of the water with dry land. Give the child the most suitable name as, "Thor," "Rock," or "Tibeton." Because even if anila I am just maybe staying there laughing, "Ha! Get this load of this Paul Paul is blowing me shreds !!!!!" That's the worst part about this film, this shark thing is known as "Paul" in the entire flick. It makes what can be a pretty awesome, frightening movie that just looks bad. It is not that there are no other parts of the camp and "Hammerhead: Shark Frenzy." Scientists use the entire movie to walk this island, and one of the sudden one girl begins to stimulate madly from walking on lush forests, and it must have water on her feet to strengthen itching, which actually allows "Paul" to come out of the water and kill him. One thing SciFI Channel did well in this film allowed the livetie to live. But that's a little piece of money in another sad movie.
