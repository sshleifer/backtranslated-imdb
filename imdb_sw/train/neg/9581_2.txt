That's the only thing I can say about this movie. Cleveland is a star, I've been there and I never seen the city seen this is good. A beautiful river and cities of the city. This movie goes ahead as much as they expect will not see the lack of the real importance of the world. People riding around and hitting the gun without any result. For example, there is a shot out of Rob Lowe's house - two cars stolen, and the fighters do not show up there until later in the movie. The murder of the lease was never found to be impossible. Anyone writing this film should be at the end of receiving one of the non-bullets. Many characters in this film are much better than this. I look at the date of the movie just to make sure it is not written during the strike of the authors but this is not so. This movie now rotates to the Universal HD station - unless you want to log in to Lowe there is no reason to look at it.
