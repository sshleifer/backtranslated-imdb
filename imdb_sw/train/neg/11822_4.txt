I thought Harvey Keitel, a young man, clean from the pistols of sex John Lydon, then like bonus, music and Ennio Morricone. I expected an exciting school exciting, edgy, Italy which was made in the United States. Istead, I found the story of a missile that has never been wise and the remaining video I say: WTF !!! Many unanswered questions, and insufficient action. The result: The result of the tribal cult found was beaten under the toilet. Keitel and Lydon work together, so maybe Quentin Tarantino can reunite with these with the best script. O, and Morricone's logo: OK, but not memorable. Overall, not a waste of time, but not "you must see", unless you are a fan of Keitel hard.
