The first half was the same, but the last half really was broken. It's funny manufacturers even admitted they had no last clue, and showed. What sadly you must write ten lines of the comments below so you can write this. Surely I did not want to import vendors to qualify my words since the show is not worth it. When Battlestar galatica came out first I was very excited to hope the best remake, it did not happen that the first time of the season became a photographic opportunity. Finally they cleaned up a bit and they really had a good game, so I started looking again. But to finish the series with a cord to be the angel of cyclon god, similar to baltar and six was pretty dumb.
