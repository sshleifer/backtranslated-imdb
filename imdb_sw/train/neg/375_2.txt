Two years ago, at the Berlin Film Festival we watched a movie of Amos Kollek "Sue" in the Panorama program, with Anna Thomson amazing in the leading part. It is a film about solitude and sex, and how one thing is paid by another. In the same area on the festival now we have to complain to the negative sue resistance, "Lutte expansion field", which is now trying to persuade us to be lonely and that no sex is one and the same problem. But unfortunately we do not feel sympathy and "our hero" (how he is called by the storyteller), because he does not have to disappear completely with the company and himself. Error yourself, I'm sorry. I can't understand him. It is not enough, the author / director / actor wants us to accept him, that is not his personal damage or bias of his personality, what has brought him now, but the rotting society and his sex image. Yes, there is more insight into gender relations, but we can't follow him so far ... And the thing is that there is rather a sign of any reflection on his own part, without having sex. Who did not yet realize, is a very repressive film ... In the beginning, there was some start to be more accurate in the sketching situation. In the bed store "hero" speaks about the barriers to buy a new bed. Probably a very wide reach level, you should stay at home half a day ... THIS is a satire about the character, who does not know to take life and heart with hands, do something ... movie does not follow this way, but it involves its characters for lack of support. No one believes, that "our hero" can influence Tisserand for murder. Too bad, too good, too - not meant (not to mention Tisserand's complex; he has a barrier, but he cannot be, a female killer!). Conclusion: There are women and the world, not a modern sex tool. Help you as much as possible, but do not follow the message and the “wisdom” of this film, which announces the bankruptcy of human relations, without catching real internal conflicts.
