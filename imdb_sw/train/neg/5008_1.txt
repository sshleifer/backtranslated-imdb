There is no reason to see this film. The good idea idea is dealt with very badly. In the middle of the film everything is changing and from there nothing makes sense. The reason for the murder has not been made clear. Acting is bad. Nick Stahl requires a clear director. He was the best in the bedroom, but here he is awesome. Amber Benson from Buffy, she needs to change her behavior one day. Even those who enjoy sex and sexual abuse will be disappointed. Although the film was 80 minutes, which is too short for a good film (but for too long for this), there are no photocopies on the DVD which mean they were not having trouble filling the existing parts for the characters. <Br /> <br /> Don't use this time.
