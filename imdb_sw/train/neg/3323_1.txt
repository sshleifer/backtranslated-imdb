I've been looking at many cartoon movies or animation because I have a baby girl who likes watching TV. I started watching this film to see if I would like my little person to watch it ... and no. At first I thought it was a very good movie as a movie of Bambi, but all the way it was like to insert ducky was gay. The statement said they were making fun of him because he was not good at sports, but that was not the case. It looks just like a film released for children to learn to be the same as gay. It was also very sad, such as the ducky father and all. I don't know, I think if you're a gay you want, but I don't think I will look at you again with my younger.
