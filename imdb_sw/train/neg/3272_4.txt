I'll tell you one thing about this film: no lulls. You will not get looking for bored. The problem is that it is TOO edge. There are so many steps and it needs to cover! That is a risk that takes place in modern films. You want to be interesting but not recommended to pass. This is the way to cross again. Even though the act is good and has several "names" in Gary Busey and Roy Scheider, it still feels the film "B". The best part is the Scheider dialog: the only part of "A" of this film "B". All other stories are Rambo's ideas but they didn't have any images to stand up. One was mainly the area of ​​creativity that consists of land mines. That was not remembered. Not enough of other events required to make this a long-term guardian.
