Tony Scott has never been a very good director, but every movie that made after "Crimson wave" seems to bring him one step closer to that it can not be used today (Michael Bay could fall into that category, but at least his big, dumb, wonders of wonder attracts a certain degree of perversion). And such as other biopics than Hollywood ("De-Lovely" and "Intelligent Evidence Risk," for example) write the life of brave, high, or open counselors provided by the "mystique" aura and a community that enjoys the details of behind the scenes, "Domino" is a film that begins with a limited ability, and reduces the amount of large amounts before the mark of sixty minutes. For the run time of 128 minutes, the film feels twice a long time, and spend time with this arrogant and forgetful characters (unlike "Attributes," Scott's attempts to prosecute the wrong way through Domino's). The smug, the self-made-rich voice-only simply attracts the attention of the film's sledgehammer) becomes just an eyechists can get a delightful. Stories? Domino Harvey-top-top-sheep (Keira Knightley, in the performance of ersatz-badass as inferior as her good looks) has a poor life-style of the rich and famous in Los Angeles, and adds a bounty hunter Mickey Rourke and Edgar Ramirez to learn more exciting business; along the way, there are two crosses, shooting, media (with respect to Christopher Walken, calling for a trademark mark), and interesting views on romance. Scott eliminates the film together for groups that rarely take more than a few seconds, forming a resolution to make a dream-driven film that is not very good to look at - if Scott has been given the opportunity to create a picture, or mislead it, he will be; but all this overload of the stylistic importation exceeds a little copper, reputation, and emphasizes the film has (without saying anything to its value, ehm, "entertainment" value). Many of the characters come as being despised or disrespectful, often double (cautious, partly a few minutes where Africa-American introduces a new list of racism on "Jerry Springer"), and I found them all interested in getting "tail" the end of the protagonist at the end. "Domino" is an unknown rubbish, which is unacceptable - any interest of Scott's self is about to encourage his audience, disappearing in the sea to restrict religious feet for a few minutes.
