O dear. When Chevy Chase and the SNL group set new highs and structure to display these animations fail to each level. Fortunately Chevy is not suitable for this completely and cannot be judged for this victory. It is very seriously, very bad. Although it means having a political opinion on the US at the time of release (1974) it has never been funny or considered. The diagram is a very long way with any satiric effect that they might have lost because they are all delivered to the level of weight. This is the first character of the Chevy movie and I am glad to say that everything he did after this was mentioned. Avoid even if you want.
