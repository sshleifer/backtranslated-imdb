Really ??? I was surprised to see this interesting view here! This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It is one of the largest pathetic, grainy, clich√©. I would be laughing loudly, and a lot, but I had a date with an old military man. I couldn't hide my other answers, BOREDOM. Yes, I think my date, the flat line "beautiful boy", liked it. That's not glorious. I know the servers want to work .... Good for others. But Ralph, arrives. It was a broken tease from Ralph. I just vote 2 because Ralph appeared SO STUNNING. But I must pray, Ralph, how can you? And, why? <br /> <br /> I'll go to look at the end of Affair to heal and recover now .... C1
