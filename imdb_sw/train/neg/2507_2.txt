This is not a good movie. It has been explained, all the works are bad, and it has a story of cripples you have seen a thousand times has done better somewhere else. Not mentioned you can see every step of the plot coming from miles away. Nothing more, nobody was worried to tell Lonette Mckee who can't sing. But he cares, he is sooooo very good. But I digress, no new here. Under the line, a girl's fire group is taken advantage of, one gets alcohol, someone gets money, someone gets a mistake, and then bad things happen. Surprisingly, surprised. Welcome to the music business. I can't believe so many people out there think this is a good movie. Many of you seem to want to use the sliding rate when it comes to imitating the black color. I'm not playing that! If you want to support these films by going to see them - good! If you enjoyed it - super! For each of his own. But don't try to tell me it's good. Pleeeease! I like people of colors are not interested in these kinds of movies just because they have black-colored characters. Want to see a good African film and America? See Love Jones. Ray. Or color color. That would be a popular film regardless of the color of the skin performers. Why? Because they told compelling stories and a good actor, which made you a short time after leaving the theater. Just because our experience does not make it a good film. It's just good - when it's good. Period.
