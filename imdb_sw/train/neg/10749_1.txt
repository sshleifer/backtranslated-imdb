This film was probably the worst movies I saw. Here are the things that immediately appear to me: 1. The forest was more like mountains in Los Angeles and a few trees and brushes. It's not scary. Flash news, if you have movies in Southern California, a big bear is only one hour. In fact they have trees there. The Scriptures were not undoubtedly the worst conversation I had. Each possible line in the film was unusual, cliche, or just stupid. For example the camp name is "bloody bloody" (blind), the name of the clown is "clown killer" (blind). What clown do forest anyway? What? Is that the only mask they got? 3. Last but surely the least was acting. Quite a large group of executives and practitioners who have ever assembled. The most common Cornucopia lines consist of shitty and bad acting. The worst part was when it often returned to this exotic girl to get naked with pictures. It's a long area and I think she had to be sexy, but she didn't. Also, this was one of the few interesting features of my movie, it was this tool that should be "attraction." For example while screaming in the movie holds a few rocks and start making the currents with them. Then later he should run to the clown and immediately open to his "girl" as he runs, that is very far from athletes. Oh and the girl who played Kat, good master stops singing. The song that you sang for credits makes me commit suicide. If for some reason you see this film, I would at least recommend watching the special features. The jackasses group who made this film talk about it as the original story. In fact one of the girls really says that she allowed some of her friends to read the screenplay and none of them could predict the end. It seems he hang out with special children.
