Where to start. This movie started as something that seemed like an outbreak of "Dark Falls". An older, depressed woman lives in the forest, giving children gifts for their teeth. Sound known? Then it changes. In "Falls Falls", the fairy of the tooth killed just like you have seen him. Fairy's tooth in this film killed you no matter what. Why did they need a rock, a girl of hippie or Bubbas and their sister? I think the movie would be good without them. It seems like the producers sat around and decided that they needed to put extra people in the movie so so the tooth fairy would have people to kill. However, it is good to see a beautiful girl not shown as head-head for change. Similar rental, but I can recommend to buy.
