That's why Jane Show doesn't work. Sometimes the manufacturers of Canadian bones and authors can not build sitcom without setting some sort of spin on it. I think these people don't see many T.V from U.S. which you have the style of sitcom under the pat. No, here we have to do something different, we have to make it a wonderful story and then have a B-story to try to do it. Characters are two-dimensional and the lines of the story are the top way: Community mosques ??? give me enough rest. Here is a little advice for the authors of the show, Do not write funny situations, get funny in the situation. And remember, you should be born with a sense of humor to write real funny things, not just being a monkey improv.
