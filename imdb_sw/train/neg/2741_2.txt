Spoiler !! I would like Branagh, to love Helena Bonham-Carter, he loved them together in the "Frankenstein Mary Shelley" - but THIS - TYPE: I can understand the desire of the actress stretch, to avoid romantic behavior. They did, but in fact - the script droned on, Bonham-Carter's clothing were chic tres, and a series of regular "madcap" series could be from the Beatles' movie, or formerly Rowan and Martin Laugh- In. I've never been sure - other speakers say Branagh's character was a dream. I have never felt that way. He was sad, and not very aggressive, and he really did not like it. Business and bank robber hide was just a painful look. Certainly not exciting. The true Bonham-Carter way (one requires) experiments if the speech was really difficult to understand than the first minute of the Lancashire line in "Full Monty." <br /> <br /> End of poetry, with him on top of the hill and buried under the monstrosity of his flight was also played. Was there angels' angels, or just a voice of voice? <br /> <br /> Go back to the classic or something with its back and arc. Do this for PBS. <br /> <br />
