Anything that might be interesting in this material stands in the first few seconds by refusing that the events we are close to cannot be known and "This is whisper [rumors] is often told" about one of the most hidden "Hollywood Hollywood. . Okay. So we did not get anything new (and E! "Secret & Scandals" gives you the best possible experience on a particular event ... and not the amount of approval). What do we get? We learn that Hollywood is a nest of viper and sores. There is no great news there. More interesting we learned what the director washed and intended to do in order to retain his position of power in the entertainment and / or political establishment. It brings the question of whether Peter Bogdanovich says from his own experience through these characters. But what is said to be exciting and negative and we are left to be guilty of witnessing a group of hooey that sets itself as history. <br /> <br /> The film's sound has a wonderful madcap of which I found more irritating than fun. We have no compassion for anyone. With "Kane Kane" the principal eliminates the relationship between Davies and Hearts in a more interesting way. In "Meow Cat" we have never been sure of Davies interested in having Hearst. Once we are told one thing, he has gone to do another. And should we believe that Davies was the love of the pastor's life? Or does he try to incorporate one of the most powerful and active citizens of America. Film is not clear. <br /> <br /> What is convincing is the production values. There is a glorious entertainment of yacht clothing and time. I got more out of the look of some of the lapels on the jackets of men than following the stories which many libels most popular in Hollywood history. No one will remember that the screenplay is a true lie. The speakers who build the film make it more sensitive and unacceptable. <br /> <br /> Artists cannot be judged, although Meg Tilly goes to old techniques here. Kirsten Dunst has never been disappointed. It gives the most reliable performance in the sea of ​​chewing theme. Joanna Lumley just increases on the material, but so much so that it seems to separate from the whole business instead of explaining it. One of its first lines is, "I'm not here!" And I'm sure she wants she didn't. <br /> <br /> This is not the same as the trashy of Bogdanovich, so-bad-it is good "In Love Last Update." It is trying to try something big, but it gets scared and fails because it is full of bitterness to the "beast" called Hollywood. This is the "National Enquirer" functionality. And it's not just the soil names of those films that go to the Oneida board at the weekend, but the audience gets dirty too.
