O dear. Some of the best talented in the UK TV made this serial, and so I can only assume that they were working under the extraordinary pressure, and had to sit for the first time taking many pictures. <br /> <br /> There are some awesome scenarios in this Highland Highland (especially when "monster" attacks and we see it from its perspective), but I'm afraid that I've got many stories without fun! As when the hero finds a corpse corpse on golf course: Oh see, there's a hand ... oh, and there's another hand on ... this hmm is a little puzzling ... <br /> <br /> For many years The TV showers of the British TV show were declared to have this serial released on VHS or DVD, but the BBC always said no. Now I think I understand why!
