John Scott (John Wayne) and Kansas Charlie (Eddy Chandler) partner are supporters who make their way to the rodeo of Rattlesnake Gulch. Scott is an opponent of justice, but he finds that unless he agrees to accept twenty-five cents for a dollar's client's money from a defective advocate, he will have to collect his sources on gunpoint. By and large, the Pete bandits (Al Ferguson) and Jim (Paul Fix) decide they prefer to take all the rodeo; they beat Farnsworth (Henry Hall), and make it as Scott and Kansas Charlie are killers. Wayne and Chandler use the gag in the film where they are going to go with them with their fists on various small objects. Each time the Chandler takes the wild horn, Wayne's foot puts him in silence. If you are working too much, there is an ad of the favor of the Lipton Tea in one of the events that Scott likes to love (Mary Kornman) appears. <br /> <br /> Later in the film, these friends have been written once again on the theft of the action. Having a change of heart and seeing the fault of his ways, bad man Jim wants to come clean and confess to the sheriff, but Pete takes him away. When she was decorated, Jim says her story to the doctor and her sister Anne. In an extraordinary area, Anne enters the middle of the gun among the young and criminals to deal with sheriff. <br /> <br /> "Desert Desert" is one of John Wayne Westerns's deception from Lone Star Production during this era. Then there is George "Gabby" Hayes and Yakima Canutt, one or both of them are visible to those riding. If you are a fan of John Wayne though you will need to see it immediately, but that will be enough.
