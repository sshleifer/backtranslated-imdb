Advertising fraud ... I saw commercial through Carlitos: Raising the Power that says "From the Producer of Scarface and Carlito" LET GET IT STRAIGHT ... Michael Bergman didn't give Scarface, in fact he was 'editing assistant room' Scarface. It is not taking away from Bergman's talent ... but in my opinion he must have a much more class. I think I can talk to the citizen when I say ... We hate being a lie. In addition to the movie goes, it was the poorest. I thought Puff Daddy did a good job. Although, Luis Guzman should be embarrassed to work on this film. In general this film does not work well to fill the attachments on the Carlito Path. Obviously this project was an attempt to make a buck quickly rather than a good film.
