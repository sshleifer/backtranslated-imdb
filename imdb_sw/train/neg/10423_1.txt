so ... it's really a gender, and a class, and I thought that it could be in the early stages of movies, as when stella told steven that she would like to change herself and start talking in the right way and tells her she won't change. well, he really changed his tune, and it seems that other viewers followed suit. what at first seems to be that the story of love is true about social placement and women as a mother of sacrifice. The end of the movie does not make the hero, it makes the whole thing sad. and sad to him that people think he makes a hero. maybe that's the film's opinion that people should take. A good reception shows the sister's frequent currents in a social conscience. luck.
