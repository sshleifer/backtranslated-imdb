After listening to and enjoying the commentary of Harvey Bernhard of Omen II I was shocked to know that he was also behind that piece of rubbish. It's like the worst movie TV you can see in the middle of the day when you have a fever and it is very sick to reach the village. I think when Michael Lerner faces what I can only describe as a high school for Les Miserables opened my mouth without disbelief. Then my mouth was going and dropping because I was laughing too much. Trends. I do not know why I must write down ten lines, I have made my argument effectively, there is nothing clever about all these modern words.
