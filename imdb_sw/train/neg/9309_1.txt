Hey everyone ... <br /> <br /> There is really not much to say to this movie completely. The basic plan is that a boy (Brandon) takes a few friends on his cabin trip to the forest for a weekend holiday away from work. After taking the girl on the way there, things begin to get worse for all. <br /> <br /> The story of alone (written by actress Brandon, I believe, although I may be bad here) is unlikely and you don't know it, and it happens well. "The killer of Clown" himself is a sad cause of a psychologist. In addition to being dark, mysterious but most of all, the mind-maker, we instead have been given a buffoon of the fabric of the fabric, which seems to be facing a small life crisis. The only thing that was agreed to write in this opinion is the sex events and whatever the film was in the film (the quality of the film has led me to get pleasure from those things). In short, this film is below every possible level. Actually, I was sharing a few beers with a close friend when I looked at this, so we were able to connect the value of family entertainment from this film and therefore it's just right to mention that S.I.C.K just fell the embarrassment of two scores. However, in fact, (and for the benefit of repeating) one star rating is more valid for this film. <br /> <br /> 1 star out of ten.
