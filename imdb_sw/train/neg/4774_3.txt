I do not know if the film artists were after the Saw or 12 angry people (people include facts to find the truth). Whatever it was, it wasn't good and not worth looking. We look at the movie with blood and gore, but because this film had anything else going, it should have shown more real killings. Many were off-camera, reducing the impression that we thought to feel and death. It also tells me that cop was among the victims; he did not know he contributed to the innocent young man to prison for accepting planted evidence (given by MJH) in the witness room. (And without MJH's attorney, he had no access to the evidence - to make it and put an incorrect evidence - however, he did not want the help of a soldier?). Others, when too often do not know it was this man who was hurting, still played great roles in its final destruction. The gun owner should know his guns will be used for the wrong purpose. Insurance insurance rejected the person in need, etc. But the crime of criminals seemed to be limited in comparison since he did not know what he had done. The film staff could make it a step further and make him the one who encouraged MJH to create evidence, which would make him more guilty. And MJH says that he (the striker) took him to the mess was not worth any meaning. It would be more surprising if everyone died in a manner that gave others a clue why she was there and deserved to die. Insurance insurance, for example, may have a prayer that he refused to bury his mouth so that he could stir them; The Eastern woman could have her eyes because she was a false witness, etc. Yes, more violence that gun deaths, but better. Conversation was not magic, there was no loss, and the latter was one of the worst (if not worse) I've ever seen. The end hit three stars on my level. Responses have done a good job, especially given the desired lines and motivations they had to work with. <br /> <br /> Overall, waste time.
