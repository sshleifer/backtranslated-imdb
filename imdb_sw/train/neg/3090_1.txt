There is really nothing new but I just felt like I had to comment on this sack. So here it goes: <br /> <br /> Anger. I'm driving through my DVD MST3K collection again and I watched Hobgoblins for 10 minutes. It is true, it is very painful but it was close to the list ... You can see that there is a small kernel of a real movie under the crap all that is "Hobgoblins" but it couldn't come out. Everything about this movie is the rate of 4. Stories, acting, effects, women, "action scenes", ... ahhhh forget it. I can look at a piece of skin as "Bloodwaters of Dr Z" (aka "Zaat") frequently and more with any side effects of the disease (I really love it - btw, it will be on TCM later this month - October, 2009) but " Hobgoblins "is a" backbone "general. <br /> <br /> The worst part of it could be now about 12 hours after the movie was completed, I had a good night's sleep, some coffee and toast dry, my medication, and still ersatz dance music "New Wave "who Amy, Red Shorts, and Laraine Newman were standing inside the bedroom is STILL SEND through my head. This persecution will continue for a day. <br /> <br /> Good luck, aren't you?
