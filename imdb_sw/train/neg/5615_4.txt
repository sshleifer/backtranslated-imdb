I watched only 1 DVD. The correct plan can be 10 minutes of good information; otherwise it is beaten with snotty for religious people. It's like Brian Flemming's director recently discovered that atheism and fear, and feels with these tools can easily bludgeon its resistance. Also, Flemming walks in his personal affairs, and takes the movie. No longer available on the topic. Religious people are willing to deal with anxiety when their concerns about religion are open to the railings. Discussions from these affected people appear to be unimportant, and therefore do not know. <br /> <br /> People without religion will need more data. We don't need to be told that religious people are nutty, many American Jews need to be told how Christmas breaks are found in mid-December. <br /> At the best location, the Fleming Christian School of Early Childhood Education rather than the experience facing the director for his reasons. That looks like a part of the most trustworthy film, and it was too short. If Fleming was more aware, he could have a good story about him (past and present) relationship with Christianity, and abuse institutions that taught him during his youth. And perhaps he could borrow "Christ never to walk around the world" material for the worst documentary. I do not learn the writings of Saul / Paul to find out how weather is closed for all, but the quick browsing of Wikipedia says most of these arguments are discredited. <br /> <br /> The bonus interview is very good, they do not recognize the concept of Fleming too. Sam Harris is a good speaker of POV's anti-religion, and they have no light on other religions, non-Christian. Harris also has a good interview (and easily Google'd) on Salon.com, Amazon.com, and Samharris.org.
