Interesting concept (four African women beaten under the boot of the community to take revenge for robbing bankers) is destroyed by the great focus of F. Gary Gray and an exciting script (with Takashi Bufford and Kate Lanier) full-time delightful. Instead of commenting on the role of urban women are struggling to stay in the world where men treat them badly and humiliate them, Gray, Bufford and Lanier prefer to resist the audience with no views and ideas on the operational disaster. It's melodrama in the worst. Gray has its practitioners living on every line of fatigue and the lazy editor of John Carter refuses to take a slack, and choose instead to keep his camera training on artists' faces. And they were surprised they were: though actors such as Jada Pinkett, Kimberly Elise and Vivica A. Fox have other talents (Queen Latifah is fourth and as a film actor and he is a famous writer), they need a more reliable hand than Gray to lead them and like The result comes as an exciting and anxious front camera. Keep clear.
