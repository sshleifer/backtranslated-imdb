After Highlander 2 (which I am still in denial on), I thought it was impossible to make a layout that could remain for me because it was bad. I was wrong. I loved the previous Wargames, however, this live movies are accurate with computer details and details about the original movie. The original Wargames at least had some hacks that work. Anyone who wrote this film knew NOTHING ABOUT COMPUTERS except how to use the word program. I doubt she even checked the original movie. Acting cannot even influence. Please cheer yourself, no matter what you watch this film. I don't care if the center is caught on the TV and you can't turn off the TV. MOVIE THIS WILL CHOOSE YOUR LIFE.
