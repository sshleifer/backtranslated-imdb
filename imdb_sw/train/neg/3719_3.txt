Imagine connecting the killer's killer and looking for Barbara Cartland there ... that's what happens with this film. The opening shows the promise, but soon loses all of the thriller (or even the love story) of love and the only reason they made this story becomes very clear: filling the gap in their women's watch market reconstructing the 'incomprehensibility, having a young' (Andrei) meets 'innocent, modern beauty' (Paula). The film artists went straight to the lead-money: a good boy being hit by the elegant beauty. Then he followed the waiting string and the most pictures of clichéd contaminated by physiology / poetry. Andrei's entry into (eponymously) poet 'comes from all the attributes that seem to be the hero of Byronic must - but even when we are told in heavy text, who insisted who and what, it is still hard to believe - or to take care. The story requires deception, fashion and innovation - all that does not exist completely here. This is not a modern day Phantom of Opera, it just happens when a weak and wise woman (who has a sharp solution of glass) puts a bad man, who, after meeting him, seems to be dangerous as a bunny slippers. Exercise can be saved to this film, if it was good: female leadership has been taken seriously and sexy and 'otherworldly', no matter how forced or ignorant; and poor Dougray Scott seems to be a doctor when he burst through his part. This is not his best work. Many of the interests were brought by Jürgen Prochnow as 'Vashon', and Andrew Lee Potts as a small photographer / brother. The best movie would have given the sister to protect her brother instead.
