The fact is that Harold Robbins's novel film will not win any prize. This is not different. "Lady Lonely" is a picture B clean in the budget, cast and implemented. Technically, it looks like a film made for tv. Acting is very different. Joseph Cali is very awesome. Anthony Holland is shy. If one auditor said about certain performance of Katherine Hepburn, its scope is from A to B. Mrs. Zedora can reach G. Some of the cast are solid (and lost their roles). Lloyd Bochner and Mrs Besch deserved the best. However, the whole thing can be great fun in a way. If it fits Robbins, everything is about sex and dirt. If you are looking for fun ... and you are not very confident ... this may be for you.
