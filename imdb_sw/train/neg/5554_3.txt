Darkman 3: Die Darkman Die headed by Bradford May, the same person who made the first player of Darkman also. Darkman 3 is worse than Darkman 2, and not something special, in my opinion. Larry Drake no longer as a great man, who now plays with Jeff Fahey, whose character again seeks to get a Darkman job and create this time powerful men to get the whole city leadership. The film is very similar to the plot and implementation as Darkman 2, but I was very angry with the presence of many events from Darkman. Few events are stylish and come out, but this is a very tired picture and is often offensive, too. The characters shout and laugh and are very angry. There is no concept of philosophy in the film, and this is as a remake of Darkman 2 which still can't be the same. Darkman 2 had many beautiful events and work of a stylish camera, and the ability of Larry Drake to play a beautiful villain. Darkman 3 offers only beautiful scenes and time, but more this film is tired and full of cliches. A few good features in this film are a change of flashback (western killings of Westlake) and a wonderful couple of turns returns and tricks. And worth mentioning is also the most beautiful death scene of the main villain which was pretty comic book as with innovation without any gore. More interesting than the death of the main villain in two parts. Darkman 3 is the worst in the whole series, and we must remember that these two sequels were made directly on the video and did not even close to the Darkman's original Dark and Liam Neeson. Darkman 2 was a good runner with many events and doubts, but this last (?) Entering is tired and often stupid and boring a second piece. It has a good reputation as described, but the general feeling is that this should not be done in the first place. It can be a talented director and so hope can find other projects later known. <br /> <br /> 3/10
