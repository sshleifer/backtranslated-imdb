I saw this film at the Gay & Lesbian film film and I think it was very bad. First and many obstacles were the means of being shot; that is, the slow motion and the closeness of the arty architecture that seemed to be uncertain - the story of wisdom or modern - except to show the filming of movies (who I believe was also the director). This film was seen as a wise film student would come up with. The leading actor (Sam Levine) was very good, but he was a very good actor; and all others were beaten out of it so, so bad. The story itself was great predictable. I must think that most of the spectators seemed to enjoy the film; laughing and wailing all the time, but I didn't like the big thing.
