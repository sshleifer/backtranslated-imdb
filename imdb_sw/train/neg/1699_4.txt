I am a fan of Lynche's work, so I was thrilled when I got this DVD. Unfortunately, I was very permissible. It is a series of short cartoons that try to show a beautiful and interesting type. Animation is very bad, of course it was done using Macromedia. Each cartoon has a great fat man who attacks his family and usually does as a jerk for everyone who knows. For people who do not know and this animation velocity, maybe they will be attracted to it. However, if you have spent a lot of time on Newgrounds.com, like me, then these cartoons will not be different from other things you have seen before. Most of the most famous amateur artists in Newgrounds are doing much better than those shown on this DVD. If Lynch presented this work on the site, then he could fully combine some of the newgrounds' best artists. But, since I see this on the DVD, instead of Newgrounds, I give it 4/10, instead of 7/10, if I like otherwise. These cartoons are suitable for the web, but in the name of David Lynch on it, I expected the best in the story and in animation.
