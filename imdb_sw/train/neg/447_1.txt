Well, what can you say about sitcoms. There are quite often evil, volunteer values, and just plain. So it's this show! It gets a boring throw, though A.Bynes is okej in its special way, others are just the wonders .... as always. We've seen all before, and maybe we'll see it again when this show is deleted. Because, it lets you face her, show her fair and just. If more sitcom is ... <br /> <br /> Well, in short. If you want to see some good entertainment, you can rather take a pause of twenty minutes in front of the mirror. Do more faces and continue .... More visits than this show!
