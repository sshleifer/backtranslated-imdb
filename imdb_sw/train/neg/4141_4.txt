Well ... The movie was watch watch. The main problem with this movie is the fact that it goes contrary to everything that most vampire stories depend on. As vampires that goes in the sun. Although there are places that only make you enjoy how the community makes movies. The area where the vampire gets beaten and scream "Ow this hurts ... It's actually stuck." Then it looks like there may be some out-of-date events that are being used over time. And there is a random sequenes that do not really help with a plot. Coming to think about it, nothing really made sense, but I just have a group of friends and look at it twice to get the full effect. Coming to think about the events of the fighting were amazing, and the zombies were just enjoying it. Slowly as I write over this I would like this movie more. But you know, all in all you can not expect a list of Schindlers but look at its enjoyable.
