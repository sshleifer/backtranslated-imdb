This film should not propose, although little to the breathing environment, movies and wildlife management, it is difficult to bring its weak points to such a review company. That's these things, however, which make the lack of a satisfactory plot and its implementation so discouraging. I looked at this with my children and none of us was attracted to the end. Yes, the pictures were beautiful, broad themes in the forest and beautiful mountains, but what's going on ahead? A good explanation of the ignorance of a foolish girl who learns slowly on a basic lesson about being a wildlife friend - and gets away easily from such a record. Certainly not a new story, in fact there is no story away from it being told, and we have seen all this before, and indeed, it is better for Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry. The only thing available from this film is what it means to work with these beautiful lenses and forest lights; others are wasting time.
