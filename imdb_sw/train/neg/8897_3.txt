I remember when I saw this film first, I was in the sixth grade when it happened. Before I saw it, I had listened to the original Broadway record, and I loved it so much! But when I saw this, I was like, what does it say? This movie lacks many songs from music to the right loud sound! Who decided to do all that? <br /> <br /> I am a great fan of Gene Kelly, but this film is probably the worst of music that has ever done! The movie looks more like setting Hollywood than the Highlands of Scotland. And who decided to cut all of Meg's songs on the movie? I accepted the bet that when they saw this film, Lerner and Lowe could ask themselves: "Who in the world decided to do this for our work?" Well they had the right to say that if they did, they would hate it for the fact that Hollywood turned their great music into this empty movie. Words and wise Mr. Kelly, passed through observations and colors of flying, but you are on a film that does not have many texts. So for a short time, if you want a good movie according to music by Frederick Lowe and Alan Jay Lerner, this is not! <br /> <br /> 3/10
