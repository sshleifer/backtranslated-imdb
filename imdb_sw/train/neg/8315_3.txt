What a lost opportunity to make an interesting film about a difficult subject. There is very little research about what it feels like to be an individual (or gay) who works in a sexual environment. Players continue to talk about their art if they don't have an erotic element. All non-sex workers, but in fact are sex workers who make fantasies and sell privacy programs where more play is offered. From one film would have the impression that they attract more women who go to gay clubs and then end up hiring "players" for private sessions. Even the shots in the club only show women in front of the action and "players" only play for women in the audience. This is not the truth of these clubs. It would have been difficult to make a life of personal dance for women like a couple. So what do they feel about their gay and customer admirers? We learn very little. Instead we get the filling. Homosexual activist who does not add anything to the direct study of players. The manager who tells us about clothing for drag action but does not give insight into the lives of players and attitudes. Mexico City Photos are common. Montage phallic show burns sausages is ridiculous. This is a completely simple film that should be just interest for those who want to see a few pictures of pretty boys playing. Some of the movies are insulting to gay men.
