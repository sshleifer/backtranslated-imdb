I watched this film because I am a big fan of the Phoenix River and Joaquin Phoenix. I thought I would give their sister a try, the Phoenix Rain. I'm responding to it. He was ashamed and only the film has this wonderful plot if that's what you want to call. Sissy was very strange and the Jellybean sits in a toilet that they all sleep with this old man in the mountains, what's going on? I have never been very defeated in my life. It was just rubbish. I can't believe that the executives agreed to make the desired films, money, time and space. What? Sissy being 'good' did not get to me. I thought he was everything but that. The fingers were just stupid, and why do we care if she can make a cake? WHAT IS? 0 out of 10, the disgrace choice doesn't 0, it doesn't even deserve 1. Hope, Rain is better in other films, I forgive him for this one performance, I mean I wouldnt do better with that film.
