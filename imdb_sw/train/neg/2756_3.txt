{start to start} I didn't want to believe them first, but I think this is the people they are talking about when they say South Korean movies have spread and can even fall. After the movie's monster fun and promotional "Gwoemul" (aka "Army") of 2006 - which has succeeded in making a satire out of the B-type film - Korean supporters have been much older and more, even though their budget (mainly used on special effects) have been more and more wonderful. South Korean movie producers want to forbid all audiences and good investors, whose industry has built since the 1999 "Breakdown" film, making a whole series of major budget movies like China? ? {end-end} The only reason I can do this by making this film is to invest in investors to finance the deepest depth of Korean / East Asian waters that I have seen to date, for The end. Now if they had informed that the dragon at the beginning and gave them more personality and purpose as in the "Dragonheart" of 1996, the film could have several characteristics of more liberation than having many digital dragons. Remember "Dungeons & Dragons" in 2000? Has no one learned that the trick is not how the specific effects you use, but how do you use it? I hope there are more (and better) Korean stories that can be used, because they have been widely exploited by the international interest in Korean Korean stories and how they have published this. In short, I agree with all the wrong ideas and the wonder how Koreans felt about having their folk song "Arirang" is played at the end of the end. As a feature of the creature, I would have given at least 5 out of 10 if the special effects or surveillance of the action was worth it, but I have seen many video games and the best works of the camera and scripting (just under dragons).
