For those who would like to see this film? I would like to say: go! Without these details can be a good movie / text. But music, explanations and some of the story lines make it very difficult to look at someone who is worried like me. Following several animals, their lives in a number of seasons find the feeling that it is the soap that we look at. But the perspective of romantic writing can not reduce me, and if the pastor finally takes the prey (one of the discrepancies left there) the camera cleans or jump to another location. I wonder why this happens, if they would show the real situation, why would you cut the cases that the fairytale of melodramatic remains? I think the values ​​are important to the crowd of crowds, because of all: it will be waste to destroy this beautiful planet.
