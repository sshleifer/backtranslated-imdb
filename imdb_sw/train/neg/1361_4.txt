I was thrilled to discover this late comedy of sixty years looked some of my favorite people - Maggie Smith, very little Bob Newhart and, of course, Peter Ustinov. Therefore, my ambition included the film not working as a comedy or full film heist. Ustinov is playing out of jail who places his place in the largest US-based United States. Reducing its former way of CEO Karl Karl Malden and tech geek Newhart, Ustinov puts himself off as a computer expert and immediately makes a full component of the film. In doing so she needs to approve the security assurance system that protects the organization's protector. And here is one problem. His perfect plan works only because everyone else in the film is very trustworthy and ignorant. Its strong restrictions are taken on the face value and this should be the only computer center where it does not bother with video cameras. The second problem is heist (real deception) occurs within the first 30 minutes of the film stolen all existing images through strong tension. Maggie Smith caused the sadness as Ustinov's tsy neighboring neighbor / secretary who cannot work. I love Maggie Smith but she just looks together here, also includes, called more than wacky, physical player. Additionally, Ustinov and Smith have no chemistry together, perhaps a different age, but a future romantic relationship, if without true love as it is, still comes a little. Ustinov wrote the script, and it was thought well at that time, but I found it unfunny, meandering and sad waste of great cast.
