I don't know if this is one of the original SyFy Channel movies, but that's exactly what she feels. The lowest budget budget action that was probably done very quickly, has a devastating effect, output, and one of the stars that emerged to name the name (funny how many children from 90210 are making cheap movies now). Ian Ziering has Cortes, who we know from history as a striker who wiped all natural people during the conquest of North America. Here, he will not play as a hero or even compassion, but as a slimy opportunist; His behavior would have been killed off if this was not independent according to historical data. In this story, Cortes is on a watchful message, trying to find something worth to prove worthy to earn money to explore more America. He and his people have a small tribe of the Azazes beaten by dinosaurs. The real story of the story becomes Lt Rios, who shows that he is respected, wise, and wise. He knows the right thing to do every situation, which contradicts the Cortes, as well as the lesser Alert. Of course, a natural girl who is supposed to marry a head, a fighter fighter falls to Rios, adding her anger to outside outside Spain. So it's a pretty good picture. Dinosaurs are sent easily. Although it occurs in an area that is clearly visible, good stories occur in trees, or Aztec village at 95% of the time, so it does not seem exciting either. I don't even know Ian Ziering. They gave him a wig of ignorance and powerless force, and somehow he lost it. He does not see or hear Spanish for the second time, however, make a choice to throw us all wrong. If this film was released by the heater, it would have been chosen for Razzie, no question. Overall, it never forgot.
