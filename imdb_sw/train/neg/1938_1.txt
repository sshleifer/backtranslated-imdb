Where to start? The son of Amitabh, played by Akshaye Khanna, is 30. <br /> <br /> Amitabh has been in prison for 33+ years ... ) Telepathically sent home to sperm? B) Was asked a good Pakistani protector to take her letter? They are allowed for existing visits to the Pakistani Judge's Privacy Statements. All of the above very <br /> <br /> when they approved the script? <br /> <Amrita Rao (Yummm!) wants Khanna - she is yum, yum, yummy ... and apparently she wants - who can't, right ?! But, his father screams out, and then killed (I hardly think this is 'spoiler' if you should have a brain-dead and blind not seeing this coming in the film) he is pretty impressed on this tragedy and tip (romantic) of his hat, leaving him back to save his father, never forget his loss, and he says (paraphrasing) "If God wants us, we will meet again" ... In essence, "I will find my d d my job has been done, sorry for your loss - CHO! Buh Bye! "- callus more than the lowest standards of Hollywood ... <br /> <br /> # 3) There are many holes in this terrible waste of time called movie, that you can run all jeep , camel trucks and other extra items that way. Pass - really, complete and full of time to lose - Oh! There is a huge sequence of drums (yes, just one - like in a series of drums - no matter what quality) great belly play - but it's not worth looking only for this. Use Veer-Zaara or Lakshya (Is Hrithik Roshan going to take practical lessons?) for the best Indo-Pak movies ... In fact, Veer-Zaara is very good - 7.5 / 8 I would like to say !
