Do not make a mistake, this is not a fear, not a film. I strongly advise against the failure of this minute 82; The only reason for deserving stars was the existence of Chris Pine. Nothing is happening. You are waiting patiently for the hope that there may be a moving blow, a hint of surprise, an emerging plot - but no! happy with the real authors of real shame - before returning to the useless and players (bringing on the platform of youth). The only thing that could have been worse is to add the ethnic group of impotence. Those who encounter obstacles (being human or physical) are short, confused and insignificant. <Br /> <br /> Chris Pine fights to put themselves on the face while being pressed to cast. Lou Taylor Pucci can not be dry if he spent summer with Keanu Reaves fighting with the Navada desert. See 'The Road', see '28 days later', watch TV at the hourâ€¦ whatever but this; I ask you. We must weigh, unlike you can be guided to believe the film, this film is not available.
