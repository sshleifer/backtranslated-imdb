Ok, honestly I don't see why everyone thinks this is too big. Its not true. There were two good things that came from this film. 2. Danny's performance was good. No other then that had a good ignorance. And, Stanley Kubrick was thinking about preparing Shelly as Wendy? He was very bad. He looked the same as every time he was afraid. The problem with this film was the end. I would like to have more respect if Kubrick would have been different. And, the movie on all was just stupid. The problem with the movie is that the book was much better. So don't see the movie reading book and you will be better off. 3/10.
