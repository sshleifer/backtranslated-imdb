I have to give back to the film by all means because it was bitter. A painter that cannot be a perfect man? This movie was hit by a deficit which if I told all I would be giving a movie. Norm Peterson and George Wendt should really be in rut to accept this film. Acting was bad and the story was worse. As a wise and discreet person, I did not understand where the author came from or where he was going with this film. There was a lack of every part of the main character, there was a string of the events of evil and anxiety, then the movie ended. One wonderful act after another and the talk does not make the movie, it just makes the train fall.
