There are tons of women looking well at this flick. But not, this film is free-free. Grrrrrrrrrr One strike. A /. One story in this film takes place in 1971. Why is hell the main actors running Kia Sportage? Hello? Proceed, any? <br /> <br /> As you can know, this film was released on stereoscopic 3D. And it is the worst effect I have seen. I don't know if someone scored on this, but there was no 3D, just two blurs. I had no problem with other 3D movies, HUNTING SEASON and CAMP BLOOD. Indeed, 3D in these are also saved, but with them I could see a model of 3D effects. <br /> <br /> This is a great ball of anything. And every woman who played the dame's ear, yum! I'd like to see more of it. In the movies, too. It looks like Janet Margolin at a time. Purrrrrrrrrrrrrrr <br /> <br />
