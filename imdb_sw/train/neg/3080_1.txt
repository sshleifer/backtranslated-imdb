Hee hee hee. This film is so bad that it doesn't try to hide the fact that it takes a lot of time. I remember the first day I saw on MST. The sun was shining, looked like a good day. then, I saw this Rick Sloane product that had a horrible pastime that was engaging in 80-foot crappy land. Kevin, wussy extraordinaire, tries to please his girlfriend, can work as a helper to help, battle with rakes, and many more things in this very badly photographed series. No plot or story is needed. Obviously no acting is important as the film proves. The boy of the army and the little girl of sex will make you want to jump on a rock, and a friend of dorky who gets a sexually abducted sex will make you say, "She is wearing a beautiful red beautiful". Plus, I hated old guards and I wished to have an accident in his supermarket. Just when you think you are gone, wait until the Scum Club location. Ask Rash Road. I recommend that after watching this film, a good month to get back to feeling and cleanliness. And when you see Rick Sloane, give him a good brilliance on the mountain to show how we enjoy this trick called Hobgoblins.
