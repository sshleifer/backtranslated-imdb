GUERNSEY (Maria Kraakman - Belgium / Dutch 2005) With pain he avoids any fights with human beings, his parents and his sister, so we have a great character in a film that doesn't do much. We do not know anything about its history or its motivation. The only woman who seems to be stuck in the blind area, not only at this difficult time of her life. He really has a problem with something, but why do we in the audience also deserve it? I left almost the movie after seeing this unknown mess. These were very simple and 90 minutes. I usually try to avoid losing energy on films of films. I will take a stroke and run by a punch, but in this case the right warning is located. What on earth Nanouk Leopold earned money (largely from public money funds) to this turkey? Obviously, there was no script to say off. It can be compensated by an experienced film manufacturer and a movie or just a little referral. There is nothing, just an undefined concept, "I want to do something from a woman's perspective." The result is insulting rather than a tax on female perspective on life. To make things worse, there is no beautiful picture on the entire film. I can't think of a cast who could choose this, but Johanna ter Steege is (small) light in the dark, if possible with this lack of equipment. I'm trying to figure out how Leopold tried to lead Maria Kraakman: "Mary, look at the horizon, we'll show you the film for three minutes, just tell us sad". Full treatment of sleep. Get a copy and watch this night, guaranteed also sleep. Obscura --- 1/10
