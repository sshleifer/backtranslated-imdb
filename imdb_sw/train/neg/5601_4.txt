I just looked at this because it was directed by Lucio Fulci and shows Claudio Cassinelli, an actor I like. In fact I was desperate. The idea that they judged the prisoners will fight death at television levels inserted by Rollerball, Runan's Run, Blade Runner, and a new film, Death Death, which certainly will call me because star Jason Statham. This was just a great bearing. The task of "Kill Bike" was ridiculous. "Training" was the joy of snooze. It never took me and made me need to take care of anyone, including the "Dallas" star Jared Martin or Fred Williamson. Choose one of those listed and you will be much better.
