Recent Rumor is that Vh1 begins to call for I Love New York 3 in mid-2008. So this means Budhah or Tailor deleted New York or this means that New York drove the winner? <br /> <br /> I know Flavor of Love comes up to the 3rd season, so now you have a Flavor of Love 3 and I love New York 3 ..... Is there a real winner? I felt a few rumors that the chance to return to the 3rd season of I love New York !!!! I have felt rumors that New York will be specialized in the Flavor of Love 3. <br /> <br /> This hope was not a lot of spoiler to the end of I Love New York 2 .... I'm just saying a recent text.
