They are trying ahead if you want to call them to be ... <br /> <br /> I would like to recommend this film so that people can see 1/10. Where to start, we will start from the top ... <br /> <br /> SABA: Don't believe the base - the movie is not associated with the abandoned cars, and people are aware of what the secret events are. It's a explorer, base, go to the movie cabin without power or "quest". It is a loan to indie publishers, it is a hard job when you start ... but this is a decoration. The story is flat - it leaves you a non-emotional movie. The discussion is very weak with the proud lines of "Oah, you have completely redeemed me" and "I used to think if you would ... if you would ..uh, would you like to come with me?". It makes me lose all my hair, one string at a time and feed my soul. <br /> CHARACTERS: GIVING IN !!!! Others have described the characters as flat, I want to take one more step and say that they have the arch of a reverse character. They begin to work on the same world and almost start to work back ... \ t : Worse than the characters are executives. They pick up the poor text and add to the scary role of high school. "You have separated me completely" he said it is monotone and slow - as it was dropped. I was able to complain at an hour for administrators alone. <br /> <br /> EXPLORATION: LIGHT: An eight-year-old could despair with lighting on this film. Also shadows in areas, are also surrounded by others. The director should not use light as a sensation until he learns how to open the baseline well. Children's Steps! SOUND: How many voices do you take to make a movie of shooting? 9. Although many voices should hear a strange but quite the opposite has happened. There is one particular area that puts out, these drive in the car and the sound of the car is changing with every angle of the camera .... WEAK! CAMERA: Learn to use it. However, I have a chance to complain ... ... lease - I assure you ... Come and learn from them ... give them a rating ... it deserves. Sign in with ... Amanda Christmas
