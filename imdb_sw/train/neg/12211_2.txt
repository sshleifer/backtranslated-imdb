George P. Cosmatos "" Rambo: The first part of the First Blood "is the perfect fulfillment of the wish. The United Nations did not win the war in Vietnam. They made the demolition of this country beyond the thought of this film continues the story of the story of the oh-innocent soldiers. The only wicked people were the leaders of the nation, who made this war happen. Rambo's character is perfect to realize this. He is a very large ethnic group, crying that American Americans were not happy to celebrate the success of one soldier, but they are not honest with leading officials and politicians. Like all the films that protect the war (e.g. “We were a soldier”) also this prohibits the need to give a good reason to participate in Southeast Asia. And for this reason also the reason for every American and American soldier was there. Instead, Rambo gets revenge for the whole nation. It would be better to work on how to deal with memory, rather than stopping them. "Do we get to win this time?" Yes, you do.
