"Sleep with the enemy" is a predictable phenomenon, 'it has been there before' an exciting and unlikely event that no longer seems to be lost by the crew trying. I can't believe the group of my friends spoke to me and see this on the movie sixteen years ago. The complete lack of nature from Ronald Bass screens (according to Nancy Price novel) is not helpful, nor is the stale leadership of Joseph Ruben or the average performance of Julia Roberts. Support including including Patrick Bergin and Kevin Anderson do little help. <br /> <br /> There is really not much to say. Throw it miss. Sunday, April 14, 1991 - Hoyts Cinema Center Melbourne
