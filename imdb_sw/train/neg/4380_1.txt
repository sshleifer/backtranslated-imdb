Plot: A amorous couple decide to participate in other hijink marriages in a flashy car. They then refuse (literally) in a confused space, saying that the car is deliberately walking on the country until innocent couples are saved by the authorities. That's it. That's the whole movie. There may be conversations here and there, but nothing comes to mind. It should be clear now that this movie is not just useless, but actually physically hurt. The fact that you had two stars of the best-and-coming British actors (one of whom is now depressed) adds only fear. Ian Charleson was good at Oscar- win 'Chariots of Fire'. Let's remember him for that role, and try hard to pretend that this celluloidal detection has never happened.
