Those who are well known to the old Cube films are already aware of what they can expect: a small group of people are locked into a group of booby, paranoia, bad habits ... This is however different. About half of the film takes place outside the cube, where we look at people looking at people in the cube (or at least five). I think Cube Zero wants to explain what to deal with the cube is, but you can't know more than what is covered in the first two films. Indeed, there is a kind of definition there, but it feels very good compared to what was proposed in the first film. <br /> <br /> Cube Zero looks rather cheap (as it was before its predecessors), and the fact that it shows more than two empty rooms only emphasizes this feeling. I also fell confident to say that no risk of executives will win any prize in the future. They have brought traps from the Cube 1, though, (therefore I mean that they're almost the same, which is a little embarrassing). I know that many people like to know this film and its relationships and first, but I feel it is an unnecessary contribution to a franchise that was not very good to start. [1/10]
