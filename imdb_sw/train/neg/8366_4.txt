'SherryBaby' is a melodrama of pain and impressive programmed jersey, the story of a little mother who is out of jail on the investigation after being sentenced to drugs and fighting to stay clean, get her own place in life and especially win back the love of the daughter her child who is taken care of her family's family. The only reason for the film is being watched by Maggie Gyllenhaal, an actor at the end of her career, who is very useful in the role and carries all the film on her shoulders. This is not enough, however, if the story line is very simple and you expect it, and the emotional emphasis is placed on the wrong place - I kept asking myself about the picture if I had to be sympathetic to the past and maybe the future of the mother drug as a director and The author of the script wanted, or about the innocent child in the middle. Even Maggie Gyllenhaal's role could not convince me that I should not care more about the child.
