The worst movie in the world. I don't know where to start but I hope I can save someone else from punishing myself with this movie. When it comes to working with lighting, this film is the same as porno sex without sex. Vendors are some of the worst I have ever seen, and it would not have been bad even if they had tried to get full of this film. The movie must have a record breaking down the budget on which I sure had passed just about on the cover of the movie. This film has now become a joke and my lovers and has become a standard to match other films. I would like to say that no other movie even begins to compare. I feel myself responsible for suggesting a friend and I watch this movie and I am wondering yet he sees me a friend after the suffering I took. Don't see this film!
