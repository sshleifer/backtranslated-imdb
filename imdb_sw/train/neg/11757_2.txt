Hey Arnold! is a slow and triggering movie. The plan is not very creative. Paul Sorvino's (Shenk) character is buying all the low-cost, low-cost building to build large shops, purchasing large buildings and offices. This program is going back to many movies of the 1960s. It is boring. Paul Sorvino is not very exciting, so the idea of ​​him as a bad person is not very scary. Gramps remembers something about the historical document, and all the movies are located around the last 36 hours when Arnold and Jamal should get a document and help under Helga, whose father expects to be a rich thanks to Shenk stores. Children should move around the city on buses, and so exciting waiting for the area that is then not just silly, but insists how this film is written to very young children. Hey Arnold, cartoon TV is usually very entertaining, and has enough humor to appeal to adults. Cartoon's TV is usually faster and more imaginative than this movie. Hey Arnold movie, it's almost five times more sedated, and a good way to keep anyone, including sleeping children. Hey Arnold was tough to stay awake until the predictable and frightening way. If you want to send your children to a non-reverse movie, this is. I feel the feeling that instead of trying to make a 90-minute movie, the producers started with a 30-minute script of the cartoon of the TV and tried to expand in 90 minutes. This mall story was definitely covered in the TV cartoon. Hope Arnold will use the best writer if there is forever.
