I found this in the test exam. All I can say is: Is it? ... hell? This movie looks like well as Mickey Mouse read the script for "Scarface." It's more amazing to do a little bit of mind; and even when you leave your brain on the car, the film is still so wonderful that it is not even worth it. The plan involves the crocodile hunter Steve Irwin trying to “save” the crocodile which has a CIA probe. CIA comes after Irwin to find their solution, Irwin makes them wrong with witches, and puts "stopping them". <br /> <br /> That's up to all the stories there; The rest is to adopt on the Australian culture ("Didja see dat?" and "Crikey!") and an extraordinary process of adoption of action. At the same time, Irwin runs the RV speed with a knife and a CIA agent on it. Yes, that's the same: Steve Irwin knife fighting with a guy on the RV. Let's be so your guide for this highly ridiculously bad film.
