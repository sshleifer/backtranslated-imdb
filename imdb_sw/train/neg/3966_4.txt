In fact, I am not surprised by my partner's fear, but well put together, the clever flick is worth the time. My vibibbles, briefly: <br /> <br /> - Dialog is often weak and sometimes can not happen from the character given. It does not accept action. <br /> <br /> - The story of the story never caught fire. The authors broke the best bits from the twelve-half film, thrown into the kettle, did not shout around and tried to give us poor soda to cause confusion, aldente <br /> <br /> Long and short, while not quite awesome, it was definitely not worthy to grab one of NetFlix taxes.
