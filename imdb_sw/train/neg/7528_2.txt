This is worse than the original Death game. The story of jumbled, incoherent leads to "Billy Lo" fall from the helicopter down below, killing him, as we left to follow his younger brother, Bobby Lo. So it's not just starting with Bruce Lee's hippo, the film kills one and it takes us thirty minutes to a story. The main reason to look at this is when Bobby Lo fights with a lion, which is definitely a guy in a lion's clothing. Jang Lee Hwang is also a villain, who is usually very good but his screen time is very limited. Especially they looked at this and the original game of Death because they are part of a set for Bruce Lee's booth. Not surprisingly they include the finished work of Lee. No one could sell them otherwise.
