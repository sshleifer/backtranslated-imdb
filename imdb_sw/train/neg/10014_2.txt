I saw this movie in the 1959 car. Until "Howard Duck" I noticed that this is a very bad movie I ever saw. This movie tried to combine all genera with one; comedy, horror, teenage angst, and a hot stick which must have said "my mother, car." Perhaps it should be a second look to see if it is a proper reflection at that time.
