What? How long did this crap take on television? It's awesome. It makes me want to shoot someone. It's so fake that it's worse than the 1940 movie of sci-fi. I would like to have a stroke than to see this feeling. I remember watching when you first came out. I thought, hey this could be surprising, then I saw how completely, gently, ridiculously stupid was really. It was so bad that I removed my pocket knife and got my hand on the table. Please people, stop watching this and all other realistic displays, they are trash that tries to network and delete the best apps that require other creative ideas.
