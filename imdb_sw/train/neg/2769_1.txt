This movie serves as a warning at any time to anyone who thinks they can write and direct their own movie. Cover the face, you can't. Since no one around you is telling you when you lose good holes in your plot, you have to make an unintentional change, discuss it with an unintentional conversation and control to return to the Korean cool story in a steaming spoon of celluloid turd. <br /> <br /> I wanted to love this movie as a real popcorn movie, I really did; I love many fun movies. But once I have to ask what hell is just happened and why, Lord, Jehovah? more than a few times, I certainly can't pick it up again. Also, I would like someone to tell how LA became Mordor for the last area.
