This is said to be a private film by Peter Bogdonavitch. He put it on his life but changed things around and fit the characters, who are spies. These investigators are good examples and have no trouble finding them. It looks more like a movie player than a player than a detective, isn't it? All this movie is written by Peter, and shows how to communicate with real people. You have to write what you know, and do it, indeed. And it leaves the audience blowing and confused, and envious, for that. This is a curio for people who want to see Dorothy Stratten, who was killed right after hiding movies. But Patti Hanson, who, in real life, gives Keith Richards, was also an example, like Stratten, but it's much better and has a bigger part. In fact, part of Stratten seemed to be forced; added. She does not have much to do with the story, which is pretty convoluted to begin with. For all, each character in this film is someone who very few people can talk to, unless you are a millionaire from Manhattan and good supermodels on your phone. For the rest of us, it is a fury of anger. That's what happens when you're out of touch. You are attracting your few friends and local jokes, and all the other bears.
