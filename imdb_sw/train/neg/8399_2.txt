I am a great fan of Stooges but just one and only one of the liberation of this film is that Curley is in it. Made long before you start drinking too much he is his ordinary man in this (and Larry is not bad either). Moe's character is a direct part (especially) and this film will be called the best "Curley and Larry Movie". It is not that any Stooges movies were very good (in my opinion), but if one advertiser here said, it is sad that this film had real potential. The search was good, it was well-directed, printed, and edited, but the line of the story tried to be on the big thing with some antoons antics and the number of music (which I think were good back then) cast in. to do yourself during this film you should believe that it should be better than blowing sand and removing litter (which is subject to debate) is waiting for Curley / Larry scenes and sleeping or getting something to eat at the kitchen sometimes.
