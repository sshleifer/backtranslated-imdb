I wonder how the actors did in this film. Annette Bening was really, half and half out, was pretending or being natural? It didn't make any difference to consider that even if he was going on the ceiling it would not change the image of the film. Brian Cox did well. I thought he had done this in this way, a clever, honest, dirty person where nobody cared so much about cleanliness. For Gwyneth Paltrow, the question he was doing in this film. This film is a serious illness and humility. Who could pay to see that trick?
