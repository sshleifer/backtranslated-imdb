In short: this is a cut with a romantic cookie that is very popular and tries to be something more. It wants to be Harold and Maude, Annie Hall, Student. It wants to be deep and human. It has interesting camera shots, lights, music, editing, all that makes the feel of the movie important. Conversations are smart - sometimes. There are some "good time". But here's what they keep from eventually becoming anything more than a cable-late-night-cable, in-flight, killer-time: <br /> <br> 1. David Schwimmer - times How many Joe can sad-sack puppy dog ​​sends an empty space into space and his jaw is located on the open before it starts to burn? Maybe some drool would help. Gwenneth Paltrow - he is flat here and not only in the chest. His role is to be a beautiful, beautiful, caring girl who is constantly getting into a bad situation, it's very confusing as a result, and that's why a sad-sad girl like Schwimmer has any chance with her. But Gwenneth plays a lot. Combine this with the dog's dog puppy (above) and you have a very little chemistry to keep. (I continued to do someone else in this role - Kate Hudson for example.) <br /> <br /> 3. Script and conspiracy - things that occur primarily are not true; All the problems are covered at the end and the bow as beautiful and beautiful on which it looks like the clown shouted and the script said only "oops, when you close it, get the train!" So they took out the Hollywood book, examined all the boxes, and went home.
