THE EXAMPLE OF THE FAMILY is an inexpensive reminiscent of 1945 of David Lean of ancient times, which was the basis for playing with Noel Coward "Still Life". The doctor removes the grit from the woman's eye at the railway station, she is in a good relationship, she is a happy social worker of Italy. They encounter an accident sometimes, make an instant attraction and plan to meet every Wednesday. Partners fall in love, but after spending a few days together they realize they have no real chance of happiness and accept participation. The previous act of Coward's act was characterized by two common people who fall in love. Sophia Loren and Richard Burton, two of the Super Stars and Hollywood Epics fighters, have no idea of ​​'ordinary people'. Loren is particularly miscast - Sophia Loren in full decision-making, looking like a million dollars, working as a social volunteer employee at the Public Consultation Office is not really good. Burton, look haggard, and polluted hair, forming too much and wearing the shoes on the platform, has not thought of as General Professional Specialist. He said, you can't blame them for having something after seeing their husbands. Burton is married to a literary striker who uses her evening to write a review of poison and who is treating her husband with contempt. Loren's husband, Jack Hedley, the creators around the house every day and completely lost: the exciting thing that has made it almost almost six years ago. Their last part together will help nausea, ("You have been long, far away", etc.). The British actress, John LeMesurier, has three minutes to come as a friend of Burton, and seems to have little damage, pointing to his verses in an uncertain voice. It is a sad and neglected performance in the worst, worst of the most common movies. Avoid at all costs.
