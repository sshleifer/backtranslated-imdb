Now, I've seen many bad movies. I love bad movies. Especially bad movies of action. I have seen (and enjoy) all of Jean-Claude Van Damme's movies, including one where she is her own clone, both where she plays twins, and all three where she is cyborg. In fact I own one where he builds a fashion model and has to fight in a full truck of duria. (Hey, if there is nothing else, he has a big ass and you almost always see it. For DVD, you can even stand and pull!) That's why you can trust him when I say this movie is very bad, it makes 9 Plan to look like Kane of Men. Everything about snakes is bad. The plan is bad. Script is bad. Set is bad. The fight is evil. Stunts are bad. FX is bad. Acting is amazing, when the world is very bad, and probably reflects the worst performance of every so-called actor, including Lorenzo Lamas, and it's actually saying something. And I'd like to beat beta everyone involved with this film is lousy bed, boot. NEWS Lorenzo Lamas. It can be wonderful without fun, so it's not a total loss. However, I recommend that you look at this movie only if you are idiot born or very, very stones. I was able to sit in my own way because I needed to look at something to distract me from stretching out the cervix out of my laundry. It doesn't help much, but it was better than nothing. One way to Ron Palillo to come as a gay striker.
