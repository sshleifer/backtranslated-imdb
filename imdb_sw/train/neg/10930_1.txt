This movie is a total dog. I found myself looking for anything to laugh just so I can't feel like I would lose my money - and my time. Writing in this film is quite awesome. It is not embarrassing on the levels of other movie Hale Storm. They should save money by getting D-list executives like Fred Willard and Gary Coleman and spent money making script until it was correct. Even Gary Coleman was not used well for his role. <br /> <br /> This movie leaves you wondering what the point of the plot was - including low plans. After watching this film, I'm left with the impression that manufacturers were hoping to capture some sort of Napolean Dynamite-like humor, where not so much line as character and delivery. Unfortunately, this film fails to provide lines, characters, delivery or humor. I would go to a dentist instead!
