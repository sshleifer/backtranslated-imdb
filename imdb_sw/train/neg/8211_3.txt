I read the book "7 years in Tibet" from Heinrich Harrer and was impressed by it. then I immediately catch the DVD and start watching the movie. I remember the first time I saw it again in 98, I liked it. well, now I look again at the full knowledge of the book. and recently I realized how all the WRONG was told: when they enter Lhasa people start spraying their languages ​​from their mouths and Thewlis and Pitt feel that its way to contact Tibet, so they greet you ... in the book Harrer explains , that connected the language is a symbol of completeness and absolute trust in Tibet and can do so in front of Dalai Lama but certainly not for the two Europeans! not only mother but even Dalai Lama herself wearing glasses for the public. in the book Harrer says, that no one in Tibet was wearing glasses at that time (sorry forgot the reason, but also explained in the book too) .the young Dalai Lama made, but only when he alone and no one could see him! and what about Mao tse tung lookalike, destroying the mandala before the young "living buddha"? newborn ... and manufacturer made clothes of Harrer and Aufschnaiter tibetan not suits of European design! why so many incidents that have come from the story, to fill the time and interests of false love (female woman ...) which is not very important? like the whole story about the son of harrer, rolf. there is not one word mentioned above or even any family member of the harrer in the book. but that was right for me because "7 years in Tibet" is not a book about people of harrer. her about tibet. I am very disappointed with this "adaption" of the famous book. and I bet heinrich harrer also, ... 3 stars, just for movies.
