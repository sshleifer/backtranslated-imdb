I used this movie yesterday via web site Quality was good! I was watching the movie with great prospects (though I knew it was flop), especially if the film has star Amitabh Bachchan playing the role of villain.I though at least the actors like he would do some of the value of their duties. that no one can compete with the AMJAD KHAN trial of magic Rgv to restore back to the spirit of the spirit! Sholay, the former is an important step in Indian movies and all the star performances, talk of worship, stylish movies and brilliant sounds that are still hit by current generations as well. Good as TALENTS of Ajay Devgan lost and his performance was average. Prashant Raj, the stranger does not know what he does. Nisha Kothari confirmed that it was one of the worst supervisors who did not know how she still serves the RGV Urmila & Abhishek staff found in the song without excitement and enthusiasm Mohanlal tried her best job with Susmitha Sen was somewhat good at work in this film. The total Sholay of the original
