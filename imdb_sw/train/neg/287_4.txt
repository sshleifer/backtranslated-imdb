As a fan of Altman, I'd like to find this film for years, thinking that for such a cast, it would have to be at least brilliant. <br /> <br /> Big error. <br /> <br /> This is one of the biggest mishmashes of Altman, cast together carefully and improvisationally (or so it feels) and hope that all will join in the editing room. Not so. As Maltin explains, this Turkey is only known for the first performance of Alfre Woodard, who more vets around him. But more than that, try at all costs. (That's easy to do - it has never been released on the video - with my skills - and cable displays are faster to Comet Halley.)
