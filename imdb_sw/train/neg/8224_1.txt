Watch this Movie? I thought myself, how much litter. These girls should have rocks for the mind to even acknowledge their part. Long-term sailing, the desperate heavens we employ. Acting was less common and the story was not able to consider. Anyone who is contemplating this film, please secure your money. Film does not have any credit. I am a real buff of film and this is worse than "Green Tomato Attack" <br/> <br /> l just hope that this piece of garbage was not very expensive. The money would have been well used for homeless people in the world. l only hope there is no good in the pipe.
