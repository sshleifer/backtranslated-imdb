My comment on this film has been deleted twice, which I find a good failure, since I am trying to judge this film for other people. Please be patient with other people's views. Obviously writing in the spirit of the work Nietzsches is unknown, so the wrong change my opinion completely <br /> <br /> I think this is a very bad movie for several reasons. Topic: One should be very careful in making a film about a philosopher who even today is unknown to the masses and among their peers brings enthusiastic discussion. One of the philosophical concepts is that Nietzsche was a great thinker. So making a film about his life, which is clearly included with his 'mind' is one thing must be very careful and, or perhaps, do not do it. Wisdom begins with knowing what you do not know. One might think this is not the film's own inspection, but the movies are not about the attitude of thinking, it's about the life of the person who lived and had a great influence in yesterday's day, today and tomorrow. If someone tells stories about tomatoes, I can explain my ideas about the story itself, but also about the chosen subject, tomato. There is a responsibility for producers when they are making a film about reality. Especially in this case and this role was not taken. One of the first things I saw was sad. Why? It differs from what should be higher; Nietzsche and the truth he found. It doesn't help keep things in proper geographical position or time! Come, make English better or better yet; German! Even Mel Gibson got that part rightâ€¦ to allow its characters to say Aramaic of Gibbers at Passion. Secondly, it's done well. <br /> <br /> 3d, Assante is not an actor to show Nietzsche. Sending bad. <br /> <br /> 4, the truth is far away. <br /> <br /> and so on. It is a waste of cellulodi.
