First of all, I expected "Caged Play" to be with the same lines as "Ilsa, The Wicked Warden". Boy, I wasn't wrong! In any way no film of exploitation of 70, "chix in chains", or "women jail". Indeed, the plot has a group of women in prison, who wear btw road clothes (completely comical), but nothing happens. There is no great tension, no one tries to deceive a supervisor or doctor to try and escape, and no prisoners do out. There are two swimming screens, which are suspected to be just a print photo, but there is no warfare / no one being sent here - or anywhere for that! In addition to the lack of conspiracy, senseless, senseless, and flat characters, a number of prisoners who can escape really return to prison to "free" other prisoners? !! PUH-LEASE, the film should be just finished with the sun riding the sun ... contrary to allowing this mess to continue! <br /> <br /> I feel impaired.
