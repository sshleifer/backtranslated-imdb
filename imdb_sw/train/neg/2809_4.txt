As I look back at my school days at the University of Ohio, there will always be one event that I will remember with happy memories. The 23rd center is a local OU center and up to a few years ago, very much to play something that was sent. This included many DIY movies coming from a small microwaving marshmallow Peeps and then photographing them online, with a Macbeth version with only 8 marks just to learn how to make squibs. However, the king, in my opinion, of the 23-channel line was Midnight Skater. The first time I looked at was 2AM. I had to learn. Or sleep. Or look at normal TV. But no, it's all of pussies. My friend and I watched Midnight Skater, and when it was completed, I don't think any of us believed that any film had just happened. But in fact, it was a few days later, and we came to see that this film did, actually, it is. I would like to keep on going on how bad it is, but it's a very bad kind that makes life worth living. The plan is closed, a horrible task, everything of the soul being few, but for God, if there are others looking with you, it is impossible to have a good time to look at it. Its kind as the first time you hear "Cutting" by Chuck Pahalniuk. You hear, you are sad and troubled, but after five minutes, you want and desire it to make someone else have a bad fear that you have endured. Short-term, Midnight Skater, for all its epic errors, makes fun at night at the end of a lot. Plus, I want the Theme of Midnight Skater. Kudos to anyone who wrote and sang it. Dear God I love that song.
