Note: I did not really insist on writing a review of the Prom Night. It can't just be done. Instead, I went through what I thought about watching the movie. The things that I thought of while looking at the Night of the Night: I have been exhausted and dreamed of these deaths to explain, just for the main character of the right awakening before cutting it off. Of course, when I say "clarifying deaths", I mean the throat of the throat throat or burst into the stomach. What? Not all "is just a dream" to be destroyed by Dallas? Speaking of which, I wonder if a couple is losing their stomachs causes a quick death. <br /> <br /> -The film is only ten minutes and I can already count the clichÃ©s of fear on both hands. It's not a good sign. After the encounter with the main partner, I believe that he will die. Anyone wants to put a place? The killer in this movie is a teacher who is considered by the main character, Donna. (By the way, does anyone think that "Donna" is a terrible name for the main character in a terrible film?) He uses three years in a high security prison before breaking and finds Donna celebrating prom prom school. Although there is no accounting for flavor, I am very surprised who would take all the time to tell someone like swift as Donna. -In schools allow for promotions at the hotel and do not respond to students. It seems the pupils are able to buy a hotel room and enter it out as they please. I think if this plot was not available, the film would be 90 minutes of people getting out of their minds and beat dust whenever they went to the bathroom. I think that business for their excitement is my absolute trouble and everything. I've already played "counting pieces of bubble gum part under the seat" and "I think how much money I have in my wallet" and I just have in 20 minutes mark. How do I get it again? Independent way: Do not forget milk and bread on the way home. > <br The 1980 edition of this film was not good but compared to this remake was like Citizen Kane, or the least Manafather. It was Jamie Lee Curtis in one of its many after Halloween horror flicks and it had a little "twist" end. I lost Jamie Lee. I would like to do more. <br /> <br /> -View for prom there is no play too much. Instead girls are fighting with their boys on where they are scheduled to attend university. I hear these universities have been named by name, and I can't help but it is strange that these girls should cheat on the entrance door test. <br /> - The killer must carry the package to clean the equipment and remove the mess between the events. That is the only logical explanation of why he would beat someone to death on a chair or in the bathroom and when someone climbed into a hotel room, there is no description of the fight. (On the other hand: This is a very lazy killer Michael Myers went to hunt after his victims.) - It is official: all listeners in the theater are rooting on the killer. What motivated? Was it any time Donna returned to his hotel room when safe to go and order everyone to leave the building? It was his constant dream, and even after going through something big in a dream he stressed on fixing his steps to the tee? Or is it an incompatible performance of Brittany Snow? I will have to say it's all over. Who is the "defining screens in the third act"? You win the pot. <br /> <br /> - In fact, the movie is over. My friend returns to me and says "Donna was not very careful." That's the bottom of the week. Such a kind of saying that a hurricane is a small wind gustana, or a long week lost power is a little discomfort. I can't wait to get on Rotten Tomatoes and see if anyone gave this moving review review. <br /> <br /> -I can't recommend this. I refuse to recommend this. This is the lazy films of any kind, and the only way to enjoy its fragrance plot is if you have under the influence of at least ten beer. And unfortunately for exhibitors, alcohol is not used. <br /> <br /> Rating: * from ****
