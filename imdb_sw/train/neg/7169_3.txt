This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. However, a little slave girl, Alice and Jared Harris imitating Christopher Walken is what makes this movie entertaining. Drinking cigarettes, drinking and abnormal ways to show when his name is called strange and interesting. I should thank Jared for his example Christopher Walken, and Christopher Walken to allow this to be in the movie.
