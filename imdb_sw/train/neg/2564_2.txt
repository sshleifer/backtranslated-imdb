When I go to see movies I will sit up and look at it or if I don't like you, I would go to bed, but this was clean, got up and walked out .... This was a bad script and put together, I liked it. Also, they should not take Brendan Frasier away, better. This was not as good as I expected, considering that I loved George of Jungle 1, and the graphics were not as good as the first, for example, a bird, and whenever they hit a tree. I hope that this director takes into account, and the following movies he does, he needs to reflect again ... awesome! I would like to give the work of Ursla well, since it made a valuable film (until I came out) ... I generally give this 2 film out of 10
