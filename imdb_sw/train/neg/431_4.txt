True, I see Al Pacino to be pleased with guilt. She was a good actress until the woman's smell, where she seems to be engaging herself. I expected this film, which I had heard almost nothing growing up, would be a good gem little. Playing, the front-of-his, the intellectual and political characters. It is not. <br /> <br /> The City Hall is a movie that climbs its plot with many characters, names, and "real" city issues, that for a while you think that its plot for the scope is wide and impenetrable, that once you see the truth , it will hit your mind. In fact, however, these small and dirty scenarios occur in urban trademarks such as Corruption Power, Two Politicians, Mafia and Police Relations, etc. And theoretically, this setup allows good tension, fear that no characters are safe, and anything can happen! But again, it is not recommended. Unfortunately, the only things that happen can be predictable, and we are left with several "confession" text, which means generally to create a modern fable of a kind, a lesson in the "real world" values ​​of politics and society. But after ten minutes with the names of the names and reports available and a spider web and hiding, the audience is often treated with some manifestation. I don't think we have left that in the City of the City, and when it is a very full film, I don't give it to the rich.
