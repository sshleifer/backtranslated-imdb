I don't know where to start; Acting, special effects and text is about as bad as you can imagine. I can't believe that producers reached the point where they said, "Our work has been done, at the time of release". I am just the first two in the series they haven't done so until England. I would like to suggest watching this film so you can understand how many films did well. I don't know how other IMDb users can scare when awesome "dread" of dinosaurs under the corridors and rubber weapons around.
