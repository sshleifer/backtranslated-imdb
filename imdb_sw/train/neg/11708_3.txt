hits my mind how this film has been made. I looked at it when I worked at home by writing e-mail and answering the phone - I just watched it because I expected "revenge" part would be good. without saying, retaliation and losing compulsory conspiracy had no value of email when they looked. in fact, I don't even know what happened at the end again. The acting was as bad as the cases of renewal on the "FBI Files" show - to the far away, the worst laws (actually just "Arrested and Quiz" could be bad in the law again). I didn't even know that the lead man was in the third blind eye until I watched the film up here at the IMD, but it was obvious why he didn't have any movies since. I hope he is a good singer.
