In fact, Marc Blitzstein's off-Broadway deal with "Threepenny" was not so "Bowdlerised" as it generally believes. I have a special interest in "Threepenny"; my father was part of the first full production in the United States, the Dutch Theater Association did so close to the end of WW2.HJitler was very successful in suppressing The play which they had to reconstruct the script with a mark from the record in two different languages ​​{or English}, a script of the German prompter and the same sources.) Blitzstein - not "translation" - which had full authorization of Lotte Lenya - was closer to nature than believed. The problem is that its version that most people know is the recording of MGM (recently available on the Polygram on CD) (which includes Beatrice Arthur {like Lucy, "full-grown girl", and can't see her hands on the fingers and shoulders thrown back on the line - Bea was a great child in the 50th century, Paul Dooley and John Astin) was investigated by Mike Curb, the head of MGM Records - i mean, 17 (I think it was) "Goddamn" is cut by "only". (At one time, MGM also provided a 2-LP set of * the entire * play, of course if it was a very thorough search.)
