At first, three words: READ BOOK! True boys - this shows the problems of the actual artwork on esoteric issues. I liked the book and I was very disappointed with the film. It was hard, and half the heart and story does not explain. Novel - the first place! - did not mean to focus on the adventure! That's just the environment. In this film, the goal turns out to just that and the message has taken the back seat! In addition, the effect of the appearance shows the energy of all living things and the understanding of the last events was followers! They wiped it! ... I won't look again!
