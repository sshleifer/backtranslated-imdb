I'm not a big fan of rom / coms at the best time. Few have been quite good (see Dream for Insomniac), but this is just the same but less. At the right time of 100min, I expect more than 1 to laugh every 30mins. Only a real stomach laugh is when visitors and friends help Lee's behavior. All I can say is AVOID. I make sure that at least 10 other movies on the eligible shelves $$
