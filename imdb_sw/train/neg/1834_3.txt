I can't say much about this film. I think it speaks of itself (as shown now). I lost this two years ago and I was totally responsive. I even / try / love it by double checking, but I just can't. I can safely say that I have no desire to see the loss of this time forever, ever again. And I'm not one to destroy the movie, but I believe that this was bad. It was not even funny in little. The only bits I enjoyed were a little song with Christopher Walken in them. I think this film destroyed Jack Black and Ben Stiller for me. All I can think of when I see one of their present-day movies is this bad movie, and it reminds me not to lose my money. Amy Poehler is very angry, too. Overall, well, I think you get my point. Stars are Walken, through.
