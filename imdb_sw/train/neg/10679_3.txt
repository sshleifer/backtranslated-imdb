I did not expect the film as good "On the Fire Line" or part of "24", but it looks like this film was made for TV and do good work at the best time. Giving (good) could not hide the fact that the plot was also predictable and executives had to fight (they try their best attempt) through their lines of bad script, giving characters rather flat any extra. As I watched the movie I felt that I had seen more of these in other exhibitions (positive). In it you had a car running, voting big, romance, licking etc etc.; This movie is not available. ** Spoiler ** Once you see another woman talking on the phone for Cuban behavior, you know who is behind all of the tips given ("standing next to the president, look at my attitude." ) The silly sound. If it's up to me (and maybe it's a good thing that is not) I would like to rewrite the plot like this: <br /> <br /> The first woman orders her husband's murder because she is sick and tired and auditing of Cuba at all times.
