I watched this film last night and already struggling to remember about it. The story is about a group of criminals who flee from the colony of space penalty. They jump on the Moon in the dust of the dust; while there, it grieves the men of dust working on the Moonbase. It bothers me that low-budget films often involve desert planets or, or like this film, criminals running away from penal colonies. Why this I don't know. But I can say for sure that these films are always diabolical. This is not true. It starts well with a good credit sequence and a half way of dance music dance. Then it weakens the thriller of boring. So, a little bit of results are found in this film that I am trying to write a beneficial review, so if you read this I apologize for it could not be illuminated by films. For a record, I remember a bunch of baddies and trouble, a horrible group of spectacular, some nuclear warfare and a woman's hologram woman. Other than that, I'm struggling. If you feel you may be interested in men's day dust activities then I can't hesitate to recommend this film. I would also recommend to those who want to send their friends to sleep and steal their bonds.
