This was a very non-film. The exhibition is the third level, and the discussion has been so tense that sometimes it seemed to have come and died. My reason for this lease was simple: Search film and scriptwriting. I needed a visual aid for my presentations, so I thought why not make a video clip? The boy was wrong. After searching my local video store, I came upon this, where it was known as "Starstruck". I thought, "What hey", and decided to give an attempt. Well, I was not happy with my results. There is probably one area that I could use, and at the same time, I was sleeping because of a very flick banning. So ..... I took it back and took Ed Wood. There is a movie I can use as an example. Then again, anything will be seen as compared to "drift".
