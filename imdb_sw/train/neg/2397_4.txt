Nicolas Roeg? He described the amazing series of DON 'TUJONA now there was no? In an earlier preliminary film was announced on BBC television at the weekend that made the evening screening of COLD HEAVEN does not like what has been. You see that it is impossible to compare HEAVEN IN AND DON`TOA now that both of them have the same director as the same structure for the first third of the SPIRIT. of the dead child, in fact my thoughts were put on this film around the grieving widow seeing her late husband walking near Venice wearing a red robak. This does not happen but about a third of the way through the run period is a serious problem of conspiracy and despite the fact that it is a matter of losing a deep spell. In fact very little is explained in the SPIRIT'S SPIRIT which destroys the image of the COLD HEAVEN and it is impossible to identify them. If I had no difference I would have thought this was TVM since it was made for television to feel up to the bottom of a white letter letter in a series of headings. Roeg also tries to incorporate the illusion of the gallery through the thought processes but again this is not suitable for the movie at all. A person who can help to hear Roeg should put all his efforts on the problem of conspiracy that are completely flat on a screens / screens.
