I felt feeling after seeing this picture. It felt like I sat watching this film 101 minutes without anything. I don't understand what they thought when they did this. It's hard to get into Jeffrey Dahmer to kill and doesn't end. It felt almost as if they were lifting this film opened in order. It was like looking at the part of Sopranos television. Suddenly, and you know there will be another section next week. I also felt like I was looking at part 1 on a two-part film. There is a possibility of what is happening here; They were lazy, they lost money, they did not know the whole story, they wanted to make Dahmer 2. After seeing all this film it looked very accurate. I expected Jeffrey Dahmer to walk through the trees. Suddenly I hear this music, then writing comes to the screen and says how Dahmer served 2 years of his sentence and was attacked by a fellow prisoner and killed at the age of 34. How about showing how she got there. Would you like to show a Dahmer attempt. Would you like to show more details. I can't even describe what happened in this film because it flew everywhere. In fact I found myself saying in unbelief, "That's it, is it the end?" I want to conclude this review by saying there is still a good Dahmer movie that will still be done. Film representatives would like to say, if you're going to do that, do that.
