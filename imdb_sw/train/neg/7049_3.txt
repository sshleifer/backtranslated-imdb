The only thing than surfers without any waves is a film about surfers without any waves. For viewers who like to play this film will be a great disappointment since the number of minutes of attempts to play to achieve three. <br /> <br /> The story is a piece of life on beached travelers who don't know the full wave, but for any wave at all. J.C. (Sean Pertwee) is an old-age girl who deals with the commitment to her partner Chloe (Catherine Zeta Jones). As he will find great joy with the woman he loves, the three old friends will break up and persuade him to hit the beach to watch the monster waves on Yard Bone. The problem is, there are no waves until the end of the film, so many stories isolate themselves in a series of a series of coastal events. <br /> <br /> Acting is very common. Sean Pertwee has a short time, but usually his work was normal. Ewan McGregor was as good as wild-wild drugs, by far the most attractive and unique character of the group. Perhaps the funniest performance was turned out by Peter Gunn as Terry who turned out his body body to be a perpetual view. Catherine Zeta-Jones was normal as usual, but her behavior did not have enough meat to show great ability to act. It is really not here to comment. I beat 3/10. It's a real gun on the beach.
