Okay, I would break it for you men ... ITI HORRIBLE! If Roger Kumble did such a work of thought on the first Ukrainian Advice then why did he work so bad on this. Sorry but this movie is stupid, it can really be better if its series was notified but lets you be true ... this movie is crock! Very bad job * SEE the Shower area * "Daughters of kissing" ?????? What kind of line is that? "Slipery when rain" ?????????? What? We can say DUH-M! This movie had a bid, I will give it, but it was very stupid! They even tried to make them happy by giving brilliant house accents that really .... They don't want you! It was sad. Not to mention that they did everyone in this one look absolutely NO as the original cast. It's like they made them different for a purpose or something! I would look at it when I was actually a board that doesn't come out from time to time. For those who did the same ... Well, what would you be thinking about? What? You may choose to choose this film on another which had a good and wonderful job with Sarah Michelle Gellar? Movie is gold if Sarah Michelle Gellar in it, DUH! But this film does not exist, there is no punishment for Amy Adams. Oh, yes since Basin has a heart? UGH!
