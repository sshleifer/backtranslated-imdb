One reason I remember this is that it was shown week after the serial of the QUATERMASS of Nigel Kneale's amazing. The trailers emphasized that the main character had a hand-hand that had the prospect of being like Victor Caroon from QUATERMASS EXPERIMENT around London. There is no fortune because THE GAME OF RACING is just a thriller of gold instead of a gimmick to be a hero with physical disability trying to get under the rough horse racing investigation. I think if you are a fan of Dick Francis you can enjoy it but put it in the context of late 70s when SWEENEY was just finished with PROFESSIONALS still produced, there's nothing missing on RACING GAME. One trailer showed the car on the other taking on the way of cars, if it's a trailer of SWEENEY when you see Jack Regan on taking a car and beating to acknowledge out of the slags who have done blag while PROFESSIONALS would have been taken by the car and hitting off the terrorists inside. I think that counts what is wrong with this series
