What a mess! Why was this film made? This, and its other "caliber" movies should teach you how to make movies. Children can love it, but more than 10 people can or will refuse. The worst thing is the fact that good talents such as Whoopi Goldberg and Armin Mueller Stahl were completely lost in any inappropriate film.
