There are a few things to raise on this, but I can mention Matt Dillon doing his ability to do something out of anything with multiple split and graphics. As many movies running against the premise that car lovers are not intelligent, we end up with movies like this. Lindsay Lohan who was very surprised by the meaningful women makes the best decisions that take responsibility. Here he can only fail. Children will be considered gently because they try to appeal more to adults than children (although they are still dumb). Those in the playground I saw and showed no real interest after several minutes. And if the movie movie this movie is awesome. The best time is at the start of the screen to create a feeling and later in the car-bash fashion makes some tension. If you develop a car as the main character you should develop better than here. After a few contest events you enter the best part: be able to leave the multiplex in your own car.
