This shows stinks. For parents, they want their children to look at something good for them. It is usually educational, interesting, and bright. <br /> <br /> Is it education? No. Doodlebops sing and that's yes. They often sing about themselves, not trying to teach anything. <br /> <br /> Is it funny? No. Doodlebops instead say something that is not intended to joke, and laugh. <br /> <br /> Is it sharp? It is very bright, it is painful. In addition to color, everything is very bright, so it is good. But there is nothing wrong in Doodlebop's world. So, you always rejoice. a vulnerable child will be tormented because they have never been sad. <br /> <br /> The show is also very cheesy. Each weapon is said to have a high level of spread and very corny. Approaching. For children, it is entertainment, but over the age of 2 you don't want your children to see it. They can't know how to grow.
