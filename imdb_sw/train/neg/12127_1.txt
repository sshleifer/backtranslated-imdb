Sorry fans of Fulci, but I couldn't find this way. The sound was about being angry when they arrived, acting was puerile, the story was made and done, and the direction was not there. It was seen as a child film project. But I have seen some of these, and indeed they seem better than this! It seems to have found a lot of money that they could not afford ... ALL! Not a DoP, not a director, none of whom in the distance had a clue that did. It was a very limited experience of movies; one of the worst. It was on the most beautiful sandy-I saw, near the Terrorist War which is just the second for Killerns of Killer from External. I have nothing to say about it. <br /> <br /> Reduces 0.1 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fienda :.
