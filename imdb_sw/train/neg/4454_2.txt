First certain background; I am English and I have lived in London all my life. I have been in many games on 'Den' and over other London clubs. I know what kind of person is getting into racism and I know how they do and how they talk. You say this is bad, bad film. I can tell you that Green Street is one of the non-fiction movies I have seen. I lost many films for shame. I felt I had to write a mini review because I heard it needed to explain a few things. People are not talking like in London in real life; The film writers took anything far away and made it stupid. Unfortunately the types of hooligan are available, but those you see on the Green Address are more like parodies. b) Migiza who plays Pete Dunham (Charlie Hunnam) unfortunately appeared as 'English' or 'Cockney' as Osama Bin Laden. He comes from the north to Newcastle and I only strive for other characters to keep the face straight with him - how we should take him seriously. Why not just caught someone from East London playing a part that is my most. I could make 'bang up the work' myself, hehe. c) Mr Frodo. I mean what I can expect to take seriously Elijah Wood blowing the donkeys of his people twice as much and who are really unjust people. He would have died. Simple as that. In fact (like Brit) it was difficult to watch this film. I am sure this film will hit the bomb here in the UK. It can do better in nations because Americans do not know (or take care) how appropriate. Do our American and foreign friends, do not believe the word of this meaning. Yes these companies exist but are all underground and hush hush, and much less. The movie just gets 2 from me because they really have some movies in London. They usually try to hide these things in Cardiff (Wales) or something and expect us all to see.
