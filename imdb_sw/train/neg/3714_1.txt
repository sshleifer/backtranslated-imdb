This movie is re-rewriting of the 1978 Warren Beatty film, "Heaven Can Wait", but written in comedic style of Mr Rock. The premise is still the same: Lance Barton, (Rock) is taken before his lifetime and works with God's representative, King King, to return to the world as another person. As in the Beatty movie; he chooses Charles Wellington, a rich white, because he is a man Sontee Jenkins (Regina King) who happens in the home of Wellington during the murder. Mrs Wellington's partner and her partner are experiencing this remake and the idea of ​​turning a white-aged white man in a black-standing actor who is trying to woo Sontee does not work. Also the demonstration used to show Rock as Wellington and then as Wellington 'real white,' failed wrong. Reforms can be made with the original Beatty plot - which itself did not show life skills after death - but certainly not found "under the world".
