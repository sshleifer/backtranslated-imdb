Movie movie of crappy. First, movies begin with a soldier and his partner were raised out of the store / furniture. The "bad" caller takes the girl, which they had broken, in the warehouse, while the newbie girl lives out and thinks what can happen there. The "bad" caller finally returns to the duffel heavy bag, and the newbie soldiers don't think there is any trouble, but still wondering what is in the bag, so he asks, gets the hippie response, and then thinks everything is ok (now). The "bad" offender repeats this process, even once with the tit (he did it better). But finally people begin to get infected, which took time to consider how f *** would definitely be. One girl loses the voodoo placed her only if she dies, as to do. Now, the "bad" police finally kills this stored unit, and then removes the duffel-bagged body. Since she had magic oogey-boogey put on her, she turns back with a lot of shades of eyes, which should show that she can be a zombie ... too, the curse of magic causes all other girls be "shadow monsters". Some of the girls meet dude, who is obviously a coin specialist, and gives them a ride (they seem to be common to him). But when the girls see other people, such as one of the girls, she leaves out because she is hideous (some people come out, but others don't even know it) .... a big plot of conspiracy. So, in order to close, eye shadow shades kill a "bad" soldier, who in turn lives to be a zombie in the final area. It was as if they were trying to lead us in a series! If anyone could see part 2 of this cow.
