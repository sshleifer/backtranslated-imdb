I was watching the original TV series in the sixties and one thing I can tell you once, no comparison. This film was totally ignorant with a flying suit that was alive. Martian which made different shapes. Special effects that seem like something that a little child could create. By comparison, in nature, the characters were created by the impressionable audience of Tim and Uncle Martin. The only event in this film, yes, in fact there was one, happened when Ray Walston finally did appear at the end. He wore dark glasses and made a referral to this world for 30 years as a kind of respect for TV series. But even real uncle Martin could not save this turkey.
