The European holiday (the national holiday of Lampoon of Europe) is the most frail of the holiday films (the first and third most popular films). When Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo return as Clark and Ellen Griswold (with new participants in the roles of Russ and Audrey Griswold), this time they are given a weak script and very bad conversation. This leads to walking, and jokes are not very funny. In order to be more open, what exactly causes this film to suffer is the fact that "joke" as they are, is beaten together in a joint-joint script, rather than serving the main plot like other 3 films. Oh well, they can't defeat them all. 4 out of 10.
