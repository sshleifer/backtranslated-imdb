First Die 2003 / / <br /> I will accept my first mistake: I did not realize that this was done for TV film. I was thrown "with a" R "certification. The program is powerful, but the movie is about 40 minutes long. it falls completely in "flick". Although there are some cases of violence, there is no abuse you should call "R". There is no shortage or free sexual events. In fact, there are no sexual events. ), Kristina Copeland, Sonya Salomaa, and Glynis Davies were all guests in the series of SG-1, but this film did nothing to advance their work since all used as low-level partners. Mitch Pileggi made me think of the modern day of Lee Marvin. The most talented Megan Gallagher I came to respect as an actor during the Millennium series, was not given any challenge to show his strength. The cast of the cast was Tracy Pollan. In addition to being a low-performance actor and not very interesting, his voice is quite awesome. I found myself broadcasting TV during his discussion. I would like to recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys Lifetime TV programs. I can't recommend paying any money to see this film however. Considering I didn't find anything that caused control, this is a film that only deserves to watch on TV, since nothing will be removed. As a television film I would like to do this as 5 out of 10. As a feature of a feature with "R" and as a cast, I weigh it out of 2 out of ten.
