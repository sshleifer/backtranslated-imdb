Go back when Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger were helpless, warm-tempered, high-power Hollywood photographed this (close) scene-to-remake area of ​​1972 Steve McQueen-Ali MacGraw action-thriller about two refugees. It was almost the first job because McQueen was very important on the screen - even a silent stone and fatigue, you can see at her interesting, magnetism of cagey. Baldwin is in Steve McQueen's league, but he has his own patch and is probably the best actor - if he is, this is not a display of his credentials. Basinger does well and it seems to be good, but James Woods is a good hammy in the role of hard-magnets. A small deal involving other couples who had been abducted by a former Baldwin colleague could not be disturbed in the '72 film and bad games even here. For practical events, they are a good old hat, which causes a person to ask: why even fix the original? ** from ****
