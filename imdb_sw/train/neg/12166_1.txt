Angela Johnson (Pamela Springsteen - yes she relates to Bruce), a killer from the first film, is on her old ways again. He is one of the consultants at Camp Rolling Hills. As long as girls in the camp are good and stay away from sex, drugs and swearing things are good. But a few steps on the line with Angela kill them - staggering a bad joke all the way. The original Sleepaway camp was a bad and interesting film but it had good points. This is bad and bad but it also doesn't have good points. The program has already died and this adds new NO to the formula. There is a lot of deaths here (people who are alive, cut, throats are reduced) but the whole year is obviously fake actually really interesting. This also has a very small number of girls that I have seen and almost everyone is too old for their responsibilities (especially Higgins). As expected there is a female shortage of free (here is provided by Valerie Hartman too much) and a beautiful girl / good boy (Renne Estevez and Tony Higgins). With the exception of Springsteen and Higgins acting is lousy - even with the movie's slasher levels. There is also a brutal edge for this movie which one character is locked into an outside house! Corruption with patients with a conspiracy of ignorance, meaningless and misleading fraud. Skip it.
