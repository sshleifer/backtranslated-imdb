This series gets only 2 stars because it puts some Dickens' Bleak House in the film and maybe someone will read the book. Contrary to what probably finds the view, Diana Rigg was poor as Lady Dedlock. He was clunky and timber. Lady D. is a preserved habit but not martinet. Denholm Elliot is correct, not the same, not the same for Mr. Jarndyce. So I will bother and respond to all who say: "I have not read that book, so I don't need to take this person 's opinion because he puts his assessment in the book." True and not true. In the past, Diana Rigg is bad in her role because of the bad acting if she has not read the book. On the other hand, Denholm Elliot is a lovely Jarndyce (although very old). The series cannot be because it is not suitable to compare it to the book, but because the different lines of plot and characters do not coalesce make a consistent, wonderful, wonderful and wonderful entertainment. It is lighter and flat. If you want to do a good Bleak Good House, you need to spend 20 hours of film at 10 hours of the hour. But I suggest that manufacturers etc. leave Dickens alone (even the Carol Christmas). Television loses the thinking of Dickens as shown in its skilled fields and memory characters.
