Please don't lose +/- 2 hours of your life watching this film - not just. Especially if someone is lucky to be snoozing on your side. Dama cheek if you ask me. I waited for something to happen - never was. I'm not one of those people who stop watching the parts of the film through the way. I must always see it to the end. It's a big mistake. Are you gracious and go and plunge the wall and look at the dry - more entertainment. Please don't lose +/- 2 hours of your life watching this film - not just.
