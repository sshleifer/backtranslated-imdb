Some people can focus on this film to draw a picture - to be able to express your thoughts on the film to create a pain-filled film and the death of antagon. This movie is exciting, meaningless and useless. It's not just waste time but it makes you sick for the future. The horrible images shown in the film are not only able to understand the air but they put it in your mind and it takes a day to forget it. For such a shame people lose their attention on the terrible suffering like this "Kill Bill" will be another example but at least "Kill Bill" has its purpose, meaning, peak and decision.
