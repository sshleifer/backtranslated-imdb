After living in Japan for several years this movie does not reflect Japanese culture and even come around to describe what being geisha is about. Unfortunately, a great opportunity has been lost to the Japanese culture around Western listeners and helping to undermine the country where Zen, Samurai, the Geisha of the Kyoto region comes. Some of the most beautiful moments of movies are when Americans are shown in the Japanese environment. Geisha stories were not correct. There was too much use of Chinese music. The smallest but important information: the correct use of incense sticks was not found. Sakura Sakura was very close kitschy! Interestingly, some Chinese characters were persuading them as Japanese people.
