Back in 1985 I found this thing (I can't even call it movies) on the cable. I was at university and I had a high school friend whose hormones were full of power. I realized earlier that this was not hopeless. A stupid script (a group of older people recruiting young people to show them how to write with women), a bad acting (with one exception) and a pathetic joke. The biggest shortage of female here put my friend happy for a while - but even she was tired after 30 minutes. Remember - this was HIGH SCHOOL BOY! This was back before the weakness was very easy to access to the internet and such. We kept looking for hope for something interesting or amazing but never happened. The funniest thing about this was a preliminary advertising campaign that the studio admitted that this film was a buzz! (One picture had a false opinion that said, "This is the best film I saw this day!"). Just Cramer Grant in shooting shows any talent and actually gone to work in the business. There is no budget and t & a boring. Skip it.
