I saw this film for the first time not too long in the "important" TCM series. The eye of the cliche's eye was not more common. This viewer had little value in this. I was surprised by the incredible Lucy (Lauren Bacall) had it. In fact, Mrs. Bacall was a beautiful woman, but in this film her character comes out more mousy than attractive. I would like to think that people like Mitch Wayne and Kyle Hadley would likely ignore Lucy than fall on the spot with him. In Bacall's advocacy, this film was made during the last epidemic of Humphrey Bogart and its defective health could have affected its performance. Of course this part of this brutality on Lucy's side was separating from Marylee slutty, played by hilt and more by Dorothy Malone. The area that makes a world dance when his father powerfully climbs the heart attacking heart is far and far away from the film. Malone's performance decreases further, although Jasper Hadley's discomfort in her desperate attitude to two of her children is shown by Robert Keith. In general, however, I would say that I am not just a fan of melodrama. Characteristics of the cartoonish of characters only makes the story also implausible to my taste.
