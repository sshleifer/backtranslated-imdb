Director Fred Schepisi (Roxanne) explains this well-known comedy, but the lowest about Albert Einstein (Matthau) trying to tell his nephew (Ryan) and an ordinary man Tim Robbins to make him happy and enjoy the life of the 1950s. find Ryan to be like Robbins, Einstein tries to make Robbins look like a brilliant scientist. The idea is good, but the film falls flat with corny conditions and silly conversation. Tim Robbins, Meg Ryan, and a great cast help are doing the best to keep this stupid comedy, but they can't save the film. Unfortunately, these talents went into producing a movie that was empty. I won't recommend you to anyone unless they are a great fan of Meg Ryan.
