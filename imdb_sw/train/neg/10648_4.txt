The end of the Tarzan Weissmuller movies is very weak. There are few features that make this film. First, Tarzan uses a lot of film wearing floppy shoes. In my opinion, any Tarzan shoes, whether shoes or boots are sometimes displayed, are removed by the character, which should be anti-civil and pro-jungle. Second, Benji's behavior, as described in the previous post, completely eliminates the movie as a comic foil. For me, his behavior is not suitable for the plot of the film. <br /> <br /> Also, when Weissmuller still reduces the statistical figure like Tarzan, it seems that it had no better shape. Although in his later movie Jungle Jim, his body had improved somewhat from this film. Pigopus war is a strong idea, but I think it must be done on the original Weissmuller film when he was on its physical height. Also, the war, which takes only 30 seconds, will be more exciting if it is delivered for 90 seconds to 2 minutes as a great crocodile of Tarang and His wife. Brenda Joyce as Jane and Linda Christian as Mara is very interesting to the eye, can not save this last film of Weissmuller - the end of despair for good run habits.
