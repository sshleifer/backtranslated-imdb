It is a bad film, but I must give it a leading actor in this one .... Francine Forbes. He seemed to be doing at least and I thought he was very good. The worst he only appears in another film in the classroom. Besides, the film is filled with the events of death and fakey murder. People are beaten and they beat 2 gallons of blood! But, if you like to watch bad films, I suggest this one very much.
