This "bright comedy" seems very forced. Indeed, TRY executives very hard to do go of script essentially unfunny. And, for that reason it doesn't work anywhere. The idea of ​​a woman knowing that she was pregnant after getting divorced quickie is not all interesting. And then, when Cooper decreases with the child because he does not want to put up for adoption simply looks very unfunny and is really pushing hard to turn this to be a comedy. In fact it is too embarrassing, too, if the actors were more capable than the script and I found myself just bored with the whole mess. Considering that the Cooper made many comedies, I recommend seeing them instead.
