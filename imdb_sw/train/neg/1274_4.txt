This should be a film about Sam and his wife, Peter Falk who has a glorious and Dukakis Olympic glory. That would be a suitable movie to see. Instead it is Paul Reiser's car, and little Falk is thrown. Elizabeth Elizabeth is also in this film, but you don't know. I presume the Reiser is under the impression that he is a great movie star who needs a proper car. He is not. More of the view is that Reiser took the trouble of employing some of the best women characters on the screen today and then beat them all in its history. Dukakis does not provide up to 15 minutes last, but when it does, the screen is simple. The story is about Falk and Dukakis really, but we are faced with a roadless, ignorant, trivial road that Reiser gets to show how beautiful, precious and oh-so-deep and psychological (bad!) Experience can be. For example, In the restaurant area that I thought Reiser had hoped to be "Cassavetes-like" there is a fiction fight between the Reiser and Falk which is very deceptive, I was ashamed of the Falk.
