What a bad movie! The way to fight the robots is cool, but the storyline is ridiculous, the actual human action laughable, act does not exist with special effects (which, this type of movie must rely on) is archaic. I thought it should be made around '80 -'84 and surprised to see it was in 1990. That's five years after the Guests! Okay, many people say it's good to focus on the low budget, but I just think 'what is the point?'. looks quite enough. I can't see him remake with special modern effects and stories of a completely renewed because I still liked the idea of ​​big robots that bear fruit out of each other.
