Herculis Puaro is, in general, a good 'hero' who we know well from books and movies. This film or story does not work and I felt the Agatha's error. Casting is not good, executives are increasingly becoming a sign of folly, clothing is very clean and suitable for everything (even Arab clothes) looks fake and for a good viewer who thinks this movie can be seen as a comedy instead of an amazing game . Herculis Puaro plays a good job but nothing is amazing. The exhibition is, as mentioned earlier, is a full fake and watch. The story is very unpleasant though it is a mystery of murder but who cares about the death of the loony and the 45-year-old woman of Iraq? 'The victim' does not like.
