Margret Laurence probably did not intend to have her novels adopted for film, then alone Angel Angel. Hagar, as a character, was a man who repeatedly urged the social situation (Gainsay who claims, any?), And ends up offering his humanity in the process. Sign in the book (Angel Angel, Silver Thread, etc., etc.) is a constant reminder of these old and new fights, and killings (by saying) on ​​the way. Though the film is loyal to the book plan (but not the plot-of-the-story, is it?), I think it has lost the point of catching the spirit of the film. The contempt of Hagar (because of impurity) was not there. Bram could be worse than it was shown, and Hagar's father could play more "traditional", to say. If a filmmaker can insist on many models, the film will run directly at home. With the same vein, why should we see mobile phones, organic, and other modern products? Do we try to make some points for making certain points (e.g., Islamic girl and natural people). Hagar and his partner. it's everything but politically correct in the book, why we should see that in the film version. Modern reproduction can be a preliminary under-budget operation, but by using it to excuse the non-political politics (and film) is like giving us a lower punch. <br /> There is also an audience. It seems that we are well-placed to see people who are in pain as good and loved ones. Why should they laugh when every Hagar is angry? I doubt Magaret Laurence wanted her readers to laugh, or with, Hagar. These people are suffering and filled with angst, and all we do is laugh at them. I don't think it made Hagar and other people in its right any right.
