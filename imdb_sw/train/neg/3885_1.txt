This movie was not bad - it was bad. After looking at it, I really felt the need to take SHOWER to get the damage from me. There is a 'gag' race and an older couple doing outdoors, not funny, but it's disgusting. That time was cool, but that's all. Just keep the mistakes alone alone - at least I was. The editor is very bad. Nearly anything else you can do will be better than spending time watching this movie. Even if your friends' group gets into 'bad movies' this is unique in his ignorance, I couldn't even bring myself to laugh. You have been warned.
