OK .. This movie can be very good! All generations were revealed by Thunderbirds and came with this film with some of the features that can look at the movie. Craft themselves and Tracey Island had been transferred to the big screen, while they still continue with our favorite designs. Sophia Miles was, just, wonderful, like Lady P and Bill Paxton, while not exactly what I looked at Jeff Tracey to be, was strong enough ... but adults were taken out of the equation and we were asked to believe 8 years old could fly 200 tons. The truth was that the movie was surrounded by children who made me feel like the Jonathon hit me and the wet fish and laugh at my hard earned money. on the film, it was the fact that Alan Tracey had felt so much in the film and that he seemed to be able to fly the machine with his brothers ... who were at least 19/20. To a large extent, these are the simplest machines to use if this is the case. The film was not found as it was becoming bad or normal. It tried to pay the glory while trembling and generally just fell flat on his face. 3/10 (2 for machines, 1 for Lady P)
