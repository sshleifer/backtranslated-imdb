I have never anticipated the comparison of the film to follow too much for the novel (especially the loved one, like the evening) but when I saw that the author of the book, Susan Minot, was the author of the screenplay and the producer on the film, I thought that evening would be a good reform. If you enjoyed the book, do not worry about this film. That is very far from a book that two cannot bear the identities of one another. <br /> <br /> Here, our characters are quite different: the bride loves Harris. Harris is the son of the landlord. Buddy is drunk, with love with Ann and / or Harris. I don't think one character went from the book to the screen; oh only gets worse for every passing time. And, in fact, we did not learn from the Madison County bridges that cut off from the story we have inwardly interrupted, by the events of our heroes' children of fighting and youth fighting, not working on the film? This film is a tragedy. Skip it.
