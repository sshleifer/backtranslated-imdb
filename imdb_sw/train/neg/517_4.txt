"The return of Chandu" is obvious, if one can say so, for the cast of Bela Lugosi as a hero instead of villain. Why he finds even a girl. It is a story of the Black Magic of Ubasti to try to capture the last king of Egypt's King Nadji (the best of Alba) and serve as a sacrifice as a way to revive their ancient leader who just happens to look like Nadji. Lugosi as Chandu, who has magical powers, tries to stop criminals. Director Ray Taylor is doing a good job for small resources and detailed stock photography. King Kong (1933) fans will recognize the large doors that were used to keep Kong in several places. Acting is a big part, bad. The actress who is the high priest (I believe Lucien Prival) for example, uses the coach who worked the lead that was common in the original talkies. Few said about others is better. It is amazing why Lugosi acknowledged the section in independent stations at this stage of his work, because he was still an amazing star at Universal at this time. Maybe it was because in this case he had to play the hero and find a girl, who knows. If his work began to increase below 30s late, this type of lease will be common to Lugosi instead of discrimination. <br /> <br />
