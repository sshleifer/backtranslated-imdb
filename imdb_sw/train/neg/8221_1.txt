This "film" tries to follow the type of low budget, made by hand camera that has proved to be very effective and successful. <br /> <br /> This, fails, and HOW. It is amazing how many are called "awards" this piece of rubbish that was hit on the lid .... makes you wonder why these critics were presenting them .... <br /> <br /> Words cannot describe just how amazing this film is really. By and large, it is BAD. <br /> <br /> I watched it for 20 minutes flat, close to continuous speed. <br /> <br /> From the litter lights to lead by horror, the best models for sound, and of course not forget the ABYSMAL acting, this was one piece of it quite a bit and quite so-called film. It is seriously, it does not have the characteristics of redemption - nothing. Save your money and look at the flick of fear of low budget respect, there is a lot out there - Last End, Blair's Wizard, REC, with a few but a name. <br /> <br /> FINDA this waste at all costs. Don't waste your money or time on this trash piece to make it a real film. <br /> <br /> Beware of all other views! You have been warned!
