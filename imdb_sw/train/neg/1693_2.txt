My husband and I went to see this film, to be the grasses of the awesome movie we are. Two hours later I found myself needing my money and time. I was very disappointed. The viewers of this film were basically the best points of the film. There was anything horrible on the film except the best time to enter in surprise, etc. I found many parts of the “horrible” being more interesting than anything. After watching other movies according to the works of Japanese authors, I must conclude that what appears to be scared in Japan is not the one that strikes the United States. My advice: If you are a fan of real awesome movies, put yourself in pain by staying through this. I can't say I would like to recommend hiring either, unless you have leased free.
