After seeing the movie the first question arises in my mind was: What? This should be bad or not? After reading a few comments about the behavior of Doc Savage and the comic series, I knew this film was not intended to be amazing. Therefore, the story tells us about America and North America-Doka to save the southern republic of America from evil. It looks like a common story. But this comes in a false way that becomes ridiculous. The final battle must show the worst presentation of military art that I have ever seen. Film can be interesting for low-design film designers as a bad example.
