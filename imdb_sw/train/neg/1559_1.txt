This may be a very bad film I will see if I live to be 100. I think the first group of supporters can come up with a line of good planning as a class project than this. I am dumber for that I have looked at, and God has mercy for the spirit given to pay this film. And after finally opening it, I had a desire to vomit. <Br /> <br /> No one has a clue about photography when doing this. No one has a clue about acting. No one has a clue about anything. I can't believe F / X shows this trick sometimes. Just when I saw it on one of the Starz! The way - even even the main one. And it was about 3 a.m. at that.
