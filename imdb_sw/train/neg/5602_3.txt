"Pandemonium" is a shadow of stimulating the film that comes out more than the most beautiful. I don't believe when I tell you, I like comedy. Especially comedy spoofs. "Birds", "Guns of Naked" trilogy, "Saddles severe", "Higher concern", and "Spaceballs" are some of my favorite comedies that spoof some sort. "Pandemonium" is not there with these films. Many of the events in this movie had me sitting there quietly because the movie is not all interesting. There are some laughs on the film, but when you look at the comedy, you hope to laugh more than a few times and that's all this going. Geez, "Piga" laughed more than this film and it was more than a terrible film. What is amazing? <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (out of four)
