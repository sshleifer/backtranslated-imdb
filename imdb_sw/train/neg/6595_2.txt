I put this film in the hotel room to scare my children in the morning we were going home, because I had taken all their facilities. (Children do not like to watch "Regis and Kathie Lee" or "The View.") My four-year-old found the same place of play, but told me all that was "very favorite". This is the Fourth Year of the People, the people. Anyone on age, they say, nine will want to kill the television instead of letting this play itself. <br /> <br /> Saying this film is bad as saying Holocaust was a little mistake. No words of how ridiculous and quite awesome "this film". Acting is bad, the plot is stupid, and the script is pathetically unfunny. Since this should be a comedy, the fact that you can not even laugh at the evil of the movie makes it even worse. Bronson "Balki" Pinchot is the worst for the false false (Ireland-Pakistani-Bronx-Cockney-Cajun as I can say), but all the characters are bad. I haven't seen Laurel and Hardy's film for many years, but JUST that they needed to be better than this. What? What is the most destructive duo of comic and ... this? <br /> <br /> Below down: desired approx. Avoid at all costs unless you have a part of the Bronson Pinchot. 2/10
