This movie was a mess. It had the worst editing I've ever seen. It was near the end of the area that the author wanted to go to business, and the film manufacturer added a second of black screens to fulfill the dream writers. Under the direction and editing, there was a glimmer of something good. A good idea, a compelling spark. But else it didn't go. It is about a quasi-psychic priest who tries to solve a string of murder. The first thing that is hard to enter is Richard Grieco as a priest. Well part does not call him a good priest and he succeeds instead. The second problem is Dennis Hopper as a bad guy. He always makes a bad man mad. Ho very much. Oh, thought it happened to me that maybe every jumpy, bad editing and forbidden conspiracy was trying to add a sense of confusion to the character (Grieco) was facing. And just to prove that they have released them the backwords credit. Not a good sign for any movie. <br /> <br />
