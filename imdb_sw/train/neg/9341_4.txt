This Hal Roach faces short, cold, is ninety-nine in a series of "Our Gang / Little Rascals" and eleven talkie. Bascally display for the black comic Stepin Fetchit who gets special bills here, we see him going to his shadow where the group hang out. Farina gets a letter of love from the letter for her and is told by Stepin to read it because she can't read during the day going to NIGHT school. It happens that from a loved one in Tennesse so now Farina needs to have her ears covered with cotton since it is too hot to hear! In another room, Weezer sends orders to Mary Ann to make taffy from the radio but because she keeps coming back and returning to the kitchen, she has lost a woman's announcement to the rice pudding and the Spanish faint to confuse Mary Ann with Tabasco and Lux! After the concoction was completed, Jackie and another group helps themselves with a tasty but very subtle substance as everyone hides in the walls as a result. When they try to clean up the mess, Stepin works in an apartment on various plumbing and electronics stores that combine hardware works as a phone that leaves a vacuum, a vacuum, and a musical refrigerator! Finally. What I have described shows the beautiful condition of this short "Gang" used as a pilot for the film series Stepin Fetchit shorter. It is good that it has never been possible if the fetchitism of the lazy Negro was just a little dull with small doses and would be very angry today. Most of the exhibitions I have described are good for some laughs though the last sequence was so confusing that the results were just blah to me. So in summary, the cold is a good curio to see at least once. By the way, the real name of Stepin was Lincoln Theodore Perry.
