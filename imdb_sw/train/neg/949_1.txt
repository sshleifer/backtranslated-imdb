I have never understood the appeal of this show. The actress is poor (Debra Jo Rupp is an exceptional discrimination), most of the stadiums are mentioned and do not know, talk is weak, unfunny jokes and painful to try and stay even half. Additionally the relationship between this show and '70s' is tenuous too much of the style of dress and landscape and background used to show --it seems to be no more than modern sitcom and similar old unfunny, scripts that modern sitcoms are wearing up like to show pictures from twenty years ago and hope that they will receive the audience of nostalgic or something like that. All "Happy Days" and "Wonderful Years" use the same technique and more efficiently and in fact it is a pleasure to look contrary to this awesome, pathetic excuse for show
