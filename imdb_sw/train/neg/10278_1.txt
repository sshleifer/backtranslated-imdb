One of the worst films I've ever seen in the playground. I saw this film at austin film in 2004, and I thought that this film was accepted for the festival. it was an interesting premise, and it seemed like it could go somewhere, but it just fell every time it tried to do anything. first of all, if you do music, find someone who has a talent for music. The music had played a cheesy piano which seemed like they were playing on the stereo in the room they were playing. These words were written extensively, and when they were not obvious poems, they had beautiful voices that showed how they were walking to try to do this film work. and would you think you would be able to find people who can sing during music, right? not in this case. Fortunately they were half speaking / half singing for a long time, but as they sang they stood. especially when they tried to sing the harmony. and that you only mention music. some acting was good, but a lot of conversations were terrible, with many events. indeed they did not have enough coverage on events, or they had a bad editor, because they repeated the line every time and served bad choices during the film cutting. at least the director was willing to admit that no one wanted a script until they added a hook to make it music. I hope investors make sure someone can write music before making the same mistake again.
