This situation, like 1949 * Heiress *, depends on Henry's novel. * Heiress *, with star Olivia de Havilland, remains as a piece of respected work, though it is not appropriate for the original James story than this new remake, which controls James's original name. It is a story of an unusual daughter, still loving (Leigh), who gave her father (Finney) after her mother died during childbirth. A proud father has his daughter without any respect, and he considers him, with all the women, easy. When a young man (Chaplin) of a good family and a little fortunate comes to mind, Father is surprisingly common, but he feels that his daughter cannot take care of anyone, he believes that the boy is a fortunate hunter and stops him from seeing. Leigh is an actor collision? many or love him or hate him? and always has some beauty and gentleness in her style, as she does through the teeth. She is not bad in this, and she holds her role much deftly ?? it is an awkward responsibility for any actor, making the audience want to grab the character and shoulders and shake him until he comes to his mind. Although the behavior creates many sympathy, it does not like much. The most interesting Ben Chaplin (seen earlier in the * Truth About Pati and Dog *) has his role and the exact amount of privacy that the audience thinks if he is after his fortune, or really likes him. Maggie Smith is one of the best artists and lifts the movie very much with her aunt's best show. Finney is wonderful, indeed, as a father who threatens to dismiss his daughter because of his disobedience, but the daughter is ready to risk for someone she loves. But what? A strong host still wants him without his luck? This is just one example where * Washington Square * varies with * Heiress *. Another example is the ability to connect with them. It is a good movie that is as exciting as a crash pipe, it gives a very small story for a very long film.
