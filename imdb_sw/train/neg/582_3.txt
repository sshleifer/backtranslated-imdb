A brilliant book with wonderful qualities and human nature, especially addiction, which is still very much prevalent today. <br /> <br /> For film ... eh. No special. The viewer had a bad spinning around and closed everything, and made the viewer a noise. Why the director did not stop this is more than I - but maybe he was too busy to try, and somehow fail, to draw good performances from ordinary but improperly performing actors. All in all, dealing with weaknesses. Your three hours will read well (or read again) the book.
