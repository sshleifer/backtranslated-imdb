Cynthia Rothrock, (China O'Brien), "Manhattan Chase", 2000, made this enjoyable film look and of course, with this cute small gal burned screen with its modern and hot fire body. China O'Brien gets angry as a police officer and decides to visit and return to his home and return to his roots with his father, who is a local sheriff. His father is older and the city has changed, the robbers have taken the city and started to find local women to start changing techniques and people of the city were sick and tired of their city going to hell. In fact, you can almost guess what is happening, and you are right, China O'Brien fights back after a great catastrophe strikes his life. Still acting out of the picture, but Cynthia Rothrock brings this film to an amazing conclusion.
