This was a bad god. The story was about the place and more often than I was confused because of the terrible editing. I don't feel sorry for anyone because their characters didn't have enough development. They were very high people who had no direction. Cheesy, cheesy displays and subplots that are not available. The little striker was just a barrier, even if he was looking good. I don't know what this tried to be, but I had heard when they showed this trash on Sundance? I had deleted my subscription. You would like to think of such a channel that will show the best film. There is a lot, the best movie of gay and lesbian out there. "Celluloid clothing" is an excellent document. I really enjoyed "Wigstock: The Movie". I am sure there are others who have dropped my thoughts right now, but what I'm trying to say is that this was not worth it. If you take it on television, the same, but don't worry. It probably had three or four shots that seem to be very good (sad I can count on one side), otherwise the movie was pretty crappy too. Lighting was far away in many places. I think some of the effects were used to try and add something that didn't have anything going. <br /> <br /> I can't deny Johnny Rebel is pretty hot (without red hair of course). Too bad his act did nothing for me. Close with a real porn, friend. <br /> <br /> 3/10.
