Belmondo is a tough soldier. He goes after a major drug dealer (played by Henry Silva, usually a great man - see "Sharky machine", but here he is clearly named, and because that doesn't have his usual charisma). He goes to the scuzziest areas of Paris and Marseilles, asks some names, hits some people, gets names, goes to many places of circulation, asks more names, beat more people, etc.. The whole movie is punch after punch after punch. It seems that the people who made it did not have other desires than to create the same French and "Dirty Harry". Belmondo, who was 50 here, does good stunts at the beginning; away from those, "Le Marginal" is violent, episodic, trite, shallow and forgetable cop movie. (* 1/2)
