I just came to see this movie and I decided to see what others thought. I'm left wondering if these people who offer new comments see this film! This can be a very good story, but it fails to hit the mark. The script is very weak - the plot has many holes that could make a great artwork for fishing screens. The characters are not well developed and the storyline jumps so close that I found myself asking the question "How did we get here?" at least half times during the film. There was a lack of any chemistry among members sent. This may be associated with the antics of Lindsay Lohan during imitation. It was very clear that everyone showed and did his work, but did not do their work. <br /> <br /> This is not a suitable movie to see ... go for a walk, play board game, take a good bath of warmth and save your money for something that is worth it!
