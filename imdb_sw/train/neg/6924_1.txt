If this film was worse, it would have been directed by Uwe Boll. This non-nonsensical light makes Ed Wood look like Hitchcock. It's been time since I've seen this bunch, but I remember that I wanted to do physical harm to all involved. How anyone can give this film more than 1 star attracts me to the favor of all who looked at this. I give one star because there is no low score. All of the films of this film should be burned underground and salted and stored as a waste of toxic waste. No, one copy should be placed under hi hi security and only shown to the filmmakers as an example of how to do it.
