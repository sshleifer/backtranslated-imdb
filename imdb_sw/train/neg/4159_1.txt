In this strange-lackadaistiki apocalypse, the world faces two strains of zombies and vampires, but no one seems to be very worried about this Z-class film that is unacceptable like the famous short story of Sheridan Le Fanu than my sister's recipes . Motivating staff are still running gas stations and doctors are still calling for homes and helpful police officers still showing the radiator only when you need it. The plan, and I use the word freely, involves the father and daughter trying to visit and "the prince," whose daughter is not there, the church kill the vampire who, easily, comes with the father and daughter. I must admit that short or two of real humor can be found among the great stretch of improper humor. The film also boasts a sufficient weakness to put in place a fourteen-year-old boy. Any old person knows.
