Wow. That's about how much I can say right now. Who writes these things? Who offers these items? What actor respects the one who agrees to 'do' in these things? My God! I don't know how I did this film, but I think the fact that I had 8 cups of coffee that day was an important factor in keeping me awake. Good Lord! It was one of the many pieces of movies that I have ever seen ... and for the record, it's not any 'witness' again. <br /> <br /> I saw the first film when I bought the DVD (MISTAKE # 1). I mean ... I thought, hey! Julia Stiles. I love him. He is cool. I will look at it once I get home (MISTAKE # 2). I tried to look at it all right after five minutes to ask when this crash group would end, I really did. But I did not succeed. It was one of the worst things I've ever seen. I mean ... what and what does he think about what will happen next and then go back into real life? That was horrible when the father did so in 'Parenting' as a decade ago. 'Jokes' - and believe me, it takes LOT out of me to call it - it's stupid, the characters are destined to forget, the storyline is quite predictable ... this really makes it to a movie that should be WIPED FROM HISTORY RECORDS! I had to think of something wrong when I realized I had never heard of this film. It is more likely to be directly to DVD. For anyone who can think of this look, I have one piece of advice. You are! For LOVE of God ... SI !!! I am ashamed to have it in my DVD collection, and I can't remove it ... No, and I mean NOBODY wants to buy from me! And I'm talking about the second and third hand stores that could buy mud on your shoes and put it in the shop window. That should tell you how it happens.
