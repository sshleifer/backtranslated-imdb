Vovochka is your daily hooligan vs movie authority. Vovochka, the main character, known as early as a negative influence on children in the neighborhood. In the words of wisdom from a few young people who meet on the way, they find a change in their bad ways, but they deserve to do it. Personally, I have found an actor who played Vovochka also sad to hear, however the sound of the cinema will allow many to feel emotional fight Vovochka as he likes to be good but bad things still happen. This struggle makes the film very different from the other movies of the same kind, that's a little taste that I intended. For all, I had no feeling for this film, although it was more likely for the small audience.
