George Sanders's great car where it goes from being a thief to the police force. When Sanders was a very good actor, he was not a converted person and this film proves. It is completely beyond ignorance. Gene Lockhart gave comic aid until the fury has caused his fire to gun and causing a catastrophe. <br /> <br /> Sadly, George Sanders and his colleague Carol Landis have committed suicide in real life. After making a sad film like this, it's not surprising. Signe Hasso's most common appeal is not here.
