A group of friends comes face-to-face with a family of pride when camping in a beautiful German country. The concept of a 'mutant cannibal family' is almost as old as the hills that the inner shadows often call home, so any director who tries to breathe a new life in that kind needs to come up with something nice to create. Along with Barricade, Timo Rose tries to give them a well-designed and designed Teutonic, by stepping up the Black Forest and using Splatter's low German budget. The result is a lot of attempts, but quite unusual that happens anonymous thanks to the tragic decisions of instructions? In particular, the non-stop use of fancy filters and ringing techniques. He had a Timo Rose did not choose to use every trick of his editing software released by him, then Barricade could be a delightful pleasure: his cast without skill to do well; bloody effects are suitably stomach churning; and there is one or two trophies and even some good creepy time. All of this, however, has been completely destroyed by the bad work of cameras, choppy edits, and the greatest damage to the gimmickry of the repetition used to provide a look for trouble that is so unknown to the film makers today. I only give 3 of 10 of Barricade for an external year, which includes a place where a boy is obliged to drink acid, heavy injuries caused by various sharp instruments, and good damage to bullets.
