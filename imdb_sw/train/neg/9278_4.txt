The fact that I watched all this film says something about it ... or me. It's not a good movie. Horror indeed. But it's horrible in a way that put my thoughts in such a way of evil that is similar to looking at the tragedy and being unable to look away. It would have done a great thing of MST3K! Many things that make up a horrible film are here: bad conversation, inappropriate music, conspiracy, deception of fraud. You will be happy with the order of the death of the followers, the poor poachers and the agape and waaaaaaaay a lot of time to contemplate their approaching punishment, facing the death of their warrior. Your heart will be comforted by old photographs such as two women fighting with guns and going away, but who is WHO? They all look at themselves, then another, then, then (15 minutes later), one eventually decreases. You will sing together (in latin course) and the street carolers that turn into ghastly death-choir that, for a while, threatens to turn the movie into a lost music. <br /> <br /> So if you believe if I do it if the movies are bad they get better, then this can be a good choice for you. It is not as interesting as my current sci-fi, "They Live" including Rowdy Roddy Piper, but it's more fun to watch films like Omen II or III. 4 out of 10.
