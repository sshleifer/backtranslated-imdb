We all have seen some of the epics in our time, but this beat them all! The movie is long and so slow, that, just put things to perspective, I felt a lot more when I left movie movies, than I entered. For 4 hours of length, it can be instead of delivery. <br /> <br /> What begins as a comedy of a slow commitment to lose its speed. Nikhil advice has plotted around 6 love stories and cannot give justice to any of them ... There is no relationship between them and, and the links shown in the last 20 minutes seem to be forced to connect stories. The situation is getting worse and Silly dialogues (most of them regularly in Indian movies over the years) and stupid movies. <br /> <br /> Priyanka does not realize that he really needs to play with him a role rather than looking at glam on the screen ... The greatest damage to beauty without skill to act. And there is a great-highly-humorous-face-face-face-face-twist-better-than-jim-Karma Akshay Khanna who keeps clapping on their lungs to convince viewers already tired. <br /> <br /> Only a beautiful part in the film is the love story of John & Vidya & beautiful to make / comedy for Sohail & Isha. But they are very good in their roles that these two couples can have the right to a movie without locking them into a group of characters. Their attention is lost among other lines of a small plot. I think my - the director was doing two different films (it could be more!) And the other assistant at the beginning incorporated all the records, beyond the process of preparing them out, so the director was left without the option to show it all as one ... <br /> <br /> Check it only if you want to test your patience !!!
