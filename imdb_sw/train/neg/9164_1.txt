I must say this to say I am a great partner. So I wanted to love this film. So I write my thoughts to save some of you from the desires I have seen while watching. Leap years tell a story full of Li-Ann who falls to Jeremy suave and struggles to meet every year of leap. A very romantic cluster, based on a short story with a cast that does not feel like you're still looking at another Jack Neo flick. So why oh so bad? First, I feel the filmmakers thought they were playing a music video, because they chose to replace the story with any true sense for cheesy mountains, predictable actions and clich√©d lines. I am shocked to be one of the first few people in Singapore to look at the Leap years, but those of us in the movies will agree that our proposed interactions in the appropriate exhibitions speak loudly. My hope was to watch a romantic film that would have passed Forever Fever, the best modern romantic Singapore, and The Leap Years even closer. Some blogs have called the Crap Years which are hard but ultimately true. Don't waste your money or your feelings as I did. The movie will let you stop on love forever.
