The main reason for the review of this review I have received this "restructuring" of the great and worth film of 1972, the awesome experience of the film. If I can save someone from looking at it, I will do a good thing. This new "new" version is full of talent, and all goes wrong. Kenneth Branagh OK is bad, odd, one to keep records. Comes film film from every arty, distracting, self-centered angle as possible. We see the reflection of practitioners in stainless steel, on security monitors, shots of their heads from 200 ft up, close to the eyes, chins, and continue. Screenplay, and Laureate Nobel, precedes the long stretch of the worst banter of homosexuality, which is being faked with both sides, .... I think? Due to the behavior "changes" how would I know? Characters themselves, so it attracts a lot in nature, is crass and worried. During the flight you have been cut for an hour, which is a real problem or something more graceful Director did for us. Actors perform their lines effectively, but nothing they say or do is trustworthy. Jude Law is higher than Caine, but as a known producer, he must have the blessings of Branagh. <br /> Everything I have seen is bad look, fail the old classic shell. Why was it done ??? The lost people spent less than 4M dollars worldwide to see it! The work of vanity that fails on every side.
