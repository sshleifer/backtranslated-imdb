This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I rented it as a joke, expecting to get publications out of the first events, and just let me say I have never been laughing hard in my life. The first part where the ninja is out of the air and starts a great fight with fire is one of the most amazing moments of my stupid life stage. This is not a dinosaur movie, but more than a fun film (and it doesn't necessarily mean) the kind of act. I didn't see the first two, but judging by the hardness of the conspiracy, I don't think there is so much that I have died. If you want to see an ongoing movie with six packs or any herbal remedy, than I insist on hiring this movie and sit back and watch 100 years of development in movies you get thrown into the trash and get shat and carnosours
