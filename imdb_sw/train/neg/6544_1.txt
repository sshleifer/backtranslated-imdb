I paid one dollar for this DVD and for the first time I was heard, but then I started thinking about it and I must be grateful. I've got a holy grail, a real touch of bad movies. If you think the main opening shots of an unsuccessful field defines the effectiveness of the Evel's camera-level address, then wait until the opening opening is on the butt of the operators. Script seems to be locked together from the categories of journalists, and the books of ESL books. But ..... I can just believe how bad George Hamilton is. It seems that there is no relationship with anything he says, only a local controller I can explore is "gosh I bet they think I'm good." This is epiphany! Now I know how it can get bad.
