This contemporary says as a social definition, when in fact it is everything of folly as much racism is despicable. Cluster of this film: Africa-America = Power ... any color = weak. The worst part when Rapaport pulls a gun to Omar Epps and a Hebrew guy. The Jewish boy, in the form of consideration, comes out in fear and begins to pray for his life ... but Omar Epps, the great, powerful, stands up without fear. We also have a judgment of each member of the group as a fool or a pastor. The girl who was white of white, of course, begins to focus on lesbianism since she is just a little white girl after all. When a white nerdy boy is rejected by members of the brother he should certainly enter into the skin, which is a strange fear; especially a big muscle boy who is quickly beaten by black people. Waiting ... BUSTA RHYMES BEAT UP A GUY TWIZE SIZE? Well, right. Of course the black people will not cut their own people and Omar Epps go with them easily. The events where Ice Cube threatens its white whites and puts them in the line are just ignorant - he is the one who leads when his white supporters are sitting in fear of him and finally leave. This movie was just awesome and the last made me a great laugh. A slow long walk between the Epps and the Bank gets a surprise and the faces they are doing - it's like watching my nephew and cousin making faces for each other (and all less than 5). Are you interesting and avoid this feature?
