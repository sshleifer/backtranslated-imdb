One of the most 'read' Lone Stars, and the time spent on the development of behaviors and interactions, negotiations and business practices. The opening part sets the stage (literally) for gambling habits, Kansas Charlie (Eddy Chandler), and his friend, John Scott (John Wayne) star (raoh-Day-oh) star, both are a little randy. The film monitors their adventures, because they are trying the best to follow Juanita's Mexico, and later in their tracks Mary Kornman, who has a badly inexperienced brother (though she was lost by a true woman, and wants to repent). And, of course, they are accused of two crimes of crime and should serve during the jail before they run and charged last. <br /> <br /> The top step is Scott always and deliberately walking the butt of Mary grocery, and hit off the stairs that he stands so that he can catch her and catch him falling. All seems a little modern to the west of the 30s, but it seems to be better than it really is. Unfortunately, the exciting features of the action we get in many Lone stars are devastating here. No Yakima Canutt. The cost-effectiveness and poor use of the image of the buyers falling on horses. No George Hayes. An exciting helper as a player between Scott and Charlie, and Charlie standing with Scott, Scott hitting the foot and beating (twice again!). Expert Paul Fix is ​​not used. Eddy Chandler himself, here in his great star star, is not really reliable as a kick randy side kick. The Vineyard looks old and fat. Similarly Chandler, who used his future career in more than 300 movies as an unauthorized meatloaf. Mary Kornman, twenty years old "Genge Letu" (see 'Mary, Queen of Tots' 1925) is good at her events with John Wayne, but that's about it for one. The best western seed lies here. <br /> <br /> P.S. The colorized short version, which appears to be good, goes very fast, passed if you ask more than once. Thanks though, the incidents of disgrace by Eddy Chandler have been cut off.
