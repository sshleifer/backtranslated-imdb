I love the books of Henry James and Washington Square had no discrimination. I was so happy to see a new movie coming out, according to the title book. Jennifer Jason Lee is a unique actress and Ben Chaplin good enough to share responsibilities. Albert Finney has been sent out and has no responsibility. I wanted to beat Maggie Smith .... or instead her role of ignorance, stupid. The real problem with what does not exist in this latest version is a good script, music, and direction. <br /> <br /> I slept in the theater watching this long film, offered and unique. There are more rows in conversation than the Pinter Play. In the book I felt very caring for Catherine Sloper and her life. Movie had only effect. I also did not like to disappear when his aunt was attracted to sex with Morris. Eeeeeeeek. YUK. <br /> <br /> Check if you can't sleep, it's a snoozer of point. Don't look if you are broken. You will need Zoloft after this. <br /> <br /> Of course, "Heiress" was unique to Olivia Haviland and Montgomery Clift in title positions. The impostors who played his father was on a mark as a careless father, cold .... still sad for his dead wife and hated Catherine for her. The movie was not loyal to the book but even this is one. <br /> <br /> This movie was a box office flop. I have no doubt about what.
