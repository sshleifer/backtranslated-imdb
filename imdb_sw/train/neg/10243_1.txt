This is a great bunch of crap I've ever seen. Don't miss it! The creators of this film should be a band of sometimes doing film. It starts with some of the plot, and then opens up quickly. I think I would like to look at the dry color then as well as look at the lid. Employees were dirty, the conspiracy was closing, publishing left pictures for many of the work being done. There is not one thing to say about this stuck movie. Leading this movie will lose your money. I really enjoy the Lama National Movies, but this was a waste of time. Learn to write, learn to act, learn to produce, and learn to direct. I feel I must remove the holes that made this film for money to lose the cost of rent and time lost.
