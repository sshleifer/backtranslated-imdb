Alicia Silverstone (before "Clueless") has a modern crime girl who tries to solve the brutal murder of a local girl. Pat Verducci wrote and guided this B-flick, which is not particularly made well but it is incredible surprisingly very interested in relation to its leading behavior. Silverstone attracts and succeeds in drawing a attractive young woman here, despite the kitschy of the debilitating photo. Support (including Kevin Dillon and Michael Bowen) is not bad, although violence in the last act goes up. It's not a cheesy-fest camp, but there is nothing unique to remember either. * 1/2 from ****
