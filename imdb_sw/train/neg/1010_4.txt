I lost this film last week. I saw Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman were on it, so it seemed promising. And it was, until Justin Timberlake came to the scene. He is a very bad actor and should not be allowed to make the film again. I mean, he is one of the most heartless characters, who have never been infected I've ever seen. You will not put any feeling at any point. Why was hell for the role of Josh Pollack? I think Matt Damon would be the best choice. <br /> <br /> Kevin Spacey was another great desire. Her character is lighter, looks like a bad mix of her character in American Beauty and John Doe in Se7en. It can hear cold, but I don't believe, it's not. Now, Dylan McDermott's acting is very good. It's about one of the most beautiful things about this film. He is only led. Morgan Freeman is good but nothing special. He has true true verses however. <br /> <br /> About the story, though it was very clear and spread it was sometimes good. I expected a great deviation when Lazerov (Dylan McDermott) was killed, but nothing happened.
