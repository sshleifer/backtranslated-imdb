I was almost calling HBO and letting my money return for this month just because they have been hitting this movie. I can only see the film next to and go, "Well, we need to come up with something that is like Home alone, only we will add a group of money for a child, come to the level of reduction, and o, we'll do that not very funny!" "Well, maybe not the last part, but that's the foundation you have here. It's not worth seeing if someone else takes it. And as a movie for children? Forget. I can't leave my children to see this, not because of the bad joke of taste, but because I don't want to say, "What would you think to show us that a piece of ripe, Dad?!!"
