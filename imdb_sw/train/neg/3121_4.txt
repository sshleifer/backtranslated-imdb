This movie is garbage-poor. It has a terrible taste, and it goes to the feet and does not recognize in the script though it depends on taking into account the actual events - which does not add a lot of anything but make it more than a desire. The trend is not well done as events and discussions are out of place. I don't know what Robin Williams saw in this character or story. Starting, Williams can not influence whether gay in breach of the relationship is neither the relationship itself attractive. What's worse, his character is faced with a bad story of pedophile which is based and does not have a place as a plot of conspiracy. You have a little Rory Culkin who plays "d_ck_smker" - with a good fun - which is very irritating and then laughs with Williams behavior. Finally you have Sandra Oh as the guardian of the guardian of Williams and thrown to the definition of the whole fiasco towards the end. Characteristics of the Collete character is an open anger and re-hash of its 6th performance of Sense and poor direction. Very poor.
