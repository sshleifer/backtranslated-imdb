I was given a book of the book of Kazaam for my eighth birthday, and people always say the translation of the book is better than the movie, but this time they were right. At least a movie is located soon. This role is awesome, which I expected from a film with Shaq who plays a magical genie that comes from the old ghetto ghetto (which was probably a good reason was bound inside). The child in the Max playing film is whiny and awesome actress. She suffers from neighboring children, which she does not claim because she is a little shower bag. <br /> <br /> Myths are just plain and very cliche. About a boy whose father is always working and never has a close who finds a new friend who makes his life better and ultimately helps him connect with his father. Even at the age of 8 I thought this was a stupid idea. It is any surprise of the people who worked on this film had a job after the ward because it is embarrassing and should not be done. I will be able to move more on how this film likes, but you should know only by reading a plot.
