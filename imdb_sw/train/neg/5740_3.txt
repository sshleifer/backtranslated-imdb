I found that the darkness was just DARK. It had a kind of good idea and other arrogant thoughts, not the worst incidents of action and short-term splashy to make you go UGH! But, it was caused by confusion. You do not know what is going on in the dark events and for the film that is being played on the Super 8 movie, you already have all the wrong grain to handle. Like Nathan Schiff's movies, it's very much. Director Leif Jonker apparently wants to make the original film, but they don't have the skills to do it. The camera has never been made to the right place, the lack of basic as well as how to photograph easy conversations and how to stop the movie also hurt. All employees are inappropriate and hammy. But despite these restrictions, music is good, it's a lot of it and it differs from silly muscles for good materials. Is this a classic if it says? What? It deserves two characteristics? NO. But it is the first attempt. Now if these people stop back behind this film (from what I understand here only they have finished) for a while and try again, they can do better.
