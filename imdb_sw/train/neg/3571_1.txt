The B B film director has another part of the future as a friend of President Ray Liotta in a box office box. Playing Marion, has one line of dialog, well, one word of a real dialog. Shouts "Joe!" if the character of Ray violates the poor also Zadora and sprinkler garden hose hose. This film is very bad though it is interesting, from time to time. Boys in the Theater of Hidden Science 3000 would like this! Check out the hysterical location at the end and also has neurological problems and editing and the effects they do to try and show how the behavior is also adequate. He also plays the image of Hollywood pictures in this. Also Zadora as a screenwriter? It's true. Also you can hardly talk, let's write! It is also completely and completely beaten in this dumb work. But who cares? The real star is the Annas of warm and fresh in its small part in the view of this cat! Rock on Glory!
