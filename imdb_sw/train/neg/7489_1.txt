American movies about war and Nazi can not be good. They cannot avoid being ignorant and follow the agenda. All nuts are bad, mad, very arrogant, and Americans are moderated but they are capable and intelligent with men. Come, leave this bullshit. The protagonist says something like "for this experiment, we have to do a violent war crime". Is America a nation of peace with its world # 1 $ 420 billion "budget protection" (# 2 China and $ 51b only)? What? Only used in this without ... ROI? Why does it show America as a peaceful nation when it isn't? I love the film and the agenda - it gives us the art of hell and try to persuade us to believe something. Hollywood should put a label on movies, as well as record companies have "parental advice label". We should have the advice of "bullshit", "propaganda advice" or label "correct political advice" on some movies. This is one of them.
