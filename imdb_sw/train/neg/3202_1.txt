If you have ever heard these three words sent to you ... "Joe Don Baker", fear ... <br /> <br /> The Last Judge is a low-budget movie action based on the sheriff in Texas city named Geronimo ( known as Heronimo). He is a bad, lightly, improper attitude that is about hunting criminals in Malta who killed his girlfriend in Texas. Her boyfriend really decreases twice in the movie. Very bad editing. Joe Don Baker (Geronimo) lives in prison for 4 or 5 times in this film, making the plot go anywhere. Plus, he hits everyone as he in the west west. I think no one has told him it is the 20th century. The woman's lawyer deserves to show her around Malta (who looks like Elaine from Seinfeld) and she is the only one who can hold redneck. He should be insane! <br /> <br /> The dirt in the bar is the most entertaining characters in this film. Their dance is shown in the film and I have become a bond with uncomfortable women. In fact, at least it was better to look at Geronimo trying to calm his way out of something. The end is done and somewhat predictable, and I was glad it finally passed. You can't forget the last line of Joe Don Baker from the film. It is very difficult to imagine how she was in three movies of the Bond ... very much! Otherwise, if you retire, then look at this at MST3K sometimes. Also, I have heard his worst movie (among many), "Mitchell" MST3K version is released on DVD and Rhino. I can't wait to see it!
