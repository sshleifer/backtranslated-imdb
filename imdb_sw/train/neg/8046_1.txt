No? I didn't think so! So, in all that you need to do is to stay away, far away from the "You Want to Know the Secret", as it is only after the umpteenth meaningless after "Scream" slasher for absolutely no value of redemption. The plan is very ridiculous; The characters have to, the ear of the throat is not over and the whole thing is just boring! If you can get out of the name already, this film is dominated by "Still I know what you did during the summer", as events are happening in the same situation as the motivation of the killers is the same ignorant. Why anyone who wants to steal ideas from Junk as "IKWYDLS" is a complete secret to me, however. Of course the film can be dependent on the rack of the value of Jennifer Love Hewitt, where the girls in this junk are, away from the brain, also very interesting. One year after the death of her boyfriend, Beth Morgan, her new boyfriend of prostitution and four other university students are going to Florida to use Spring Break holidays in a convent. The murderer did not move every year, but now follows the issue of Florida and began to beat while leaving the titular message as some sort of business card. Certainly you do not need to be an expert on fear so that you can quickly see the face behind the ignorant mask and the concerns of the authors to put you in the wrong way is disgraceful. Since the plot is thin, many films are padding insignificant, including small squares on the power of the ineffective Floridian police and the 'strange' inspector of the FBI who seems to have a personal mark of staying. The killings are not done by the disappearance of the screen (no time filtering is happening?), None of the free T & A free and you are not better to get me started on the quality of the conversation. Pain through the trick like this lets you realize that the good spirit of the 80 slasher has gone good.
