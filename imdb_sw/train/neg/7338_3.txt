I have been watching this film in anticipation of finding a beautiful and interesting story yet the story line was not quite suitable. Playing for participants was not much better. <br /> <br /> Of course Shahrukh Khan was still not enough to make this film "reliable" and interesting. I have read that this film was the basis of Flaubert's novel "Madame Bovary" yet for me I did not see it resembling the views of Hindi. We generally buy a film for dreams and have a good time, not waste our time and change our bad condition. I can only understand how it can get that "higher" vote and an average of 6.8 / 10. <br /> So it's kind of movie you should run & ignore because there is nothing to know in it! You will only waste your time unless you like the "dark movie" and "fantastic and useless story".
