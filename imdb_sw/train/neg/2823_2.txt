Well, TiVo wrote this because of Angelina Jolie. It had 2.5 stars. It seemed promising. Declined steadily faster. There is a lot of competition, even from Angelina. She is 20 years old and plays 16 years old. There are three characters that should be Italian. Everyone else is Italian-America. The original Italian word was good, I thought. The boy's leadership is good, my wife says. Everyone else in this movie is a woman of Italian oil. Even people. I should know that when Dick Van Patten was healed as a randy doctor, that was a bad sign. Two couples evict their children around the same as the Italian Delivery. My wife did not allow you to go away. Hope she did not take makeup, clothes or decorative tips. It was a sick and emerging combination of hideous and garish. It was hidegarishous. > <br If this movie shows on your TV, make yourself a permit and sheep your head through TV screens instead. You will be glad you did. The only movie I saw was worse than this was "Hamburger: The Movie". Or maybe "Friend Death".
