I read the comments of Chris_m_grant from the United States. He wrote: "The wonderful Documentary of 1924. This 20th century's modern geography of Iraq was strong." I would like to thank Chris and the people who are interested in Iran's Ambassadors, the Zagros Mountains and landscapes and have watched the Grass film, the national war for life. These stories you saw in the film have endured for centuries and will continue as long as life stays. I am from this region of Iran myself. I am a Bastari. Chris, I am sad to be upset but Bakhtiari region of Zardkuh is Iran not Iraq as you said in your opinion. Iran and Iraq are two different countries and different. Take Irani to Irankian is almost take US to Mexican. Thank you, Thank you
