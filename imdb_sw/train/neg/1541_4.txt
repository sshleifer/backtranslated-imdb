I did not like this film strongly and left during the area where the loyalist group was shot by the UK. The film condemns the NI people because of their own problems. It says that the 25-year war was a matter of interruption and nothing to do with the British distribution of Ireland and its history is NI created by Britain in 1921 regardless of Ireland's wishes. The characters are shown as ignorant fools, though I despise the faithful helpers who fought because - maintaining their fake privileges over the Catholic community. It is a fact known that the UK Intelligence was collaborating with the faithful during the war, which undoubtedly put the Catholics with destruction and mislead the republic. The values ​​of the nineties about 'machismo', masculinity etc. are transposed to 1970s Belfast and are shown as an exclusive part of Ireland's 'psyche' which leads to violence. A stupid song from a woman in the club - ancient Ireland's greenfields ..blah..blah .. - is given an example of an example, that is, poor young fighters for impossible reasons. It bothers, normal, cheap and bad. O'Sullivan has made a personal statement about the crisis that needs a great political analysis.
