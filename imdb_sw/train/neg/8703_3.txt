Type of Primal (1996, Dir. Jonathan Winfrey) The army army team should now think quickly, if they want to prevent the disappearance of human species, rather than the organism. <br /> <br /> You are looking at the cover and you get your first movie views. That's very good. Acting is only acceptable from a few characters. Myths are poor, and all the basic films of the army and aquatic try to kill dinosaurs. The film came three years after 'Jurassic Park'. Instead, this film appears 13 years before 'Jurassic Park'. The dinosaurs clothes have been done well, and I mean dress. There are obviously people dressed, and this film does not attempt to hide this. The area where the dinosaur flows under the belt is designed by way, which looks like a man runs that creature. This is one good thing, that comes from this film. Short period of time. For only 1 hour and 15 minutes, it does not lose your life a lot, but still try to avoid it completely. It is like Friday night. - Brian Currie \ t
