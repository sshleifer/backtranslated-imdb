This movie is one of the worst of the year. The main characters do not have chemistry and acting is awesome. Paul Rudd is the only one with any talent, and only one that is not worth it. I've never been looking at Desparte Traders, so I don't know how Eva Longoria is on the show, but in this movie she was awesome. It's like he doesn't know anything about acting. All of his character resembles all the films, and can not pull that b **** and still be entertaining. And another girl, Lake Bell, shows a little feeling and it's like you're looking at memory cards like she reads them. <br /> <br /> Like this information, it's a cookie string. It goes from point A to B without a little surprise. More more can be used by Kate as a spirit. The plan should be more around him and what he does as a spirit. VERDICT OF DAY: It is not worth checking.
