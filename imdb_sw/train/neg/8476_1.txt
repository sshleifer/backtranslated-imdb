This movie was a bad excuse for ... movie. First of all, making can be better; Katelyn the main character did not see anything like his mother TV. <br /> <br /> also, the plot was pathedi. it was a very cliche and predictable. The latter was very disappointing and cheesy. (but that's all I will say about it). <br /> <br /> nail in the bag, though, was the scene when Katelyn (jordan hinson) had to cry, but the girl could not cry on the command! there was no tears around his face, just a strange sobs. he is not a very powerful actor. she gave a little fake laughter similar to that of hilary duff on the lizzie Maguire (sp?). That's when the movie came out is not good, just plain bad. it really looks like he was doing. <br /> <br /> In short: this movie was so bad! It was a kind of combination of every movie of the finger from the 1990s that every ill-patient - just worse! <br /> <br /> I gave 'F', because it was just so hard to get through (b / t / w, I was a child when I saw). However, you can love it if you are 9 or less. ;)
