Tromaville High has been the damage to the damage of dirt thanks to the result of the release of a nearby nuclear fuel accident. Unrestricted chaos caused by incredible violence and bad behavior. Instead of being terrified, it is really aiming that, the filming of films and filmmakers refuses the revelation that allows the rule to rule without rule. Craft was a list of targets for Troma for this sleazefest gory. A decent community is punks and aerie face color paint and wacky dress. German teacher who becomes a member, through "poisoning poison" has streaks down one side of his face which actually gave me creeps.The poison poison, which wrote ANNOYING punks towards the end, is still cool, <br /> <br /> Type The film's connoisseurs of the film will accept it wholeheartedly.
