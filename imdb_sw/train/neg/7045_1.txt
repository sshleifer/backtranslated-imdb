This should be worse, and I mean the worst movie biker ever made! And that says a lot because the line of stinkers is tall and smells! Now at least we know what happened to ginger after being saved from Gilligan Island! Looking for fear Tina Louise (maybe she was scared someone would see this mess!) It was a strangled and bounced attacker of a very high-level motorcycle in the film history. But, worried fans! Batman, I mean Adam West as a city doctor of tanks comes to rescue! Pow! Crush! Dial! Holy Toledo Batman! <br /> <br /> What are the only good points of this "bomb" are beautiful women, some of the anti-laughable events, and Tina Louise still "sexy" still!
