to be honest, I did not look at all the "mourning" of nature, but those events I saw clearly said that the first talk was a great movie. so great, that seven horrible sequels had to be made. began to "mourn II: Your sister is a Werewolf". I got this film on VHS from my uncle one time when he was giving a bunch of old movies that he bought when Atari was new. I just watched it last night, and it wasn't actually a BAD, it was just wonderful. I mean, anything with Sybil Danning going on the three-way and two of his waswolf animals were out of place and totally disrupted (but kinda hot), Christopher lee on killing dead karen as that is a vampire, etc. really, this film was like a kind The dirt of Dracula and the Lost Children ... except the waswolves, because everything Christopher Lee (who played Dracula himself) was talking about waswolves pretty much ripped from every movie vampire (stock within the heart, onion, the night creature should die at NIGHT, and the ruler of waswolves lives TRANSYLVANIA. not much for acting, but worse from Annie McEnroe. I swear, at some time in the film I found myself rooted in the swing out, because the usual throat had said something. However, the plot is very good and clich√©d, therefore there is no real point to tell you, you can read only about Wikipedia. By the way, the thing that makes me praise about this movie is the fact that it is the only film between all seven sequels associated with any previous way (without counting Howling IV (1988), which was a natural remake, or in other words, a basic guide of the same novel). so don't see this movie. there is no real fear, waswolves very difficult, and a special fx of terrible. 3/10
