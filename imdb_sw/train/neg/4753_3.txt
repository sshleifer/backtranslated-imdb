Director F.W. Murnau wisely was captured and in the middle of a silent film he knew very well to cover this life story of a natural island in South Sea. The document style works well for the first half of the film. The theme is beautiful, and the everyday life of the villagers is interesting. The film loses its speed, though, when it begins to focus more on the story of two lost lovers. The story of the story is not found to be interesting, despite the well being addressed by Murnau. Get the best movie awards, though the prize should be of the best environment. You can not get a DP credit to get a shot at a very good location.
