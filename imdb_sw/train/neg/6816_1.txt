I should say that there is nothing wrong with the low budget films, so it's not my problem with it. My problem is that I felt like I was watching my neighboring movie neighborhood. IMO everything about it just seemed like a boy wrote a quick story, took a camera, and started shooting. I understand how this is difficult to work efficiently, but when I pay the film rent, I expect to feel like I am looking at some kind of professional movie made. <br /> <br /> John Schneider has a great resume, it's a good actor, and it was good in this film. Other people in it were not. I understand I must be happy, and it is easy to use friends, and relatives as a cast, but it does not make it tempting. It seemed like a beaten way, he was trying to give more pictures to look at, but when writing, conspiracy, and acting were there to start, the style of style is not necessary, and it is crowded. <br /> <br /> Also on the technical level, it had digital residues everywhere. In the first place of all these good cars, when they were slowing the prayer, they seemed to grow and return just a bit. The problem is not in my viewing devices, (Benq PE-8700 84 "diagonal) but somewhere in production. I've never seen such a kind of artifact in a professional film before." Then there was a voice. they did not make any sound, which could be the same unless it looked like a song in this film. It seemed like built on a microphone on the camera.
