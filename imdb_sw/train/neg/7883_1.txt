The fraudulent coverage, the title and the smallest printing capabilities of the Application was disrespectful in this film. It started very well and dragged me. I really liked it. Between 1/3 and 3/4 of that, the film began to give us things that were not placed and did not know you. My first thought was, "This is not written by someone who knows how to tell stories." I finished again watching the parts of the film, thinking I had lost something. When I reached the end of 1/5 of the film, it was BORING, ANNOYING, THUMPING DIALOG which was RELIGION had no intelligence, did not say anything, and had a pain of listening; I have tasted the voice and I did it quickly to the end. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time with this flick. <br /> <br /> Beware of DVDs called Whitlow Films and Level Level. And I am a Catholic who works.
