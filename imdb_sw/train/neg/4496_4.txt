This film is a festes-fest of the worst acting and put put together with tacky lines and plot plot. But it's very fun to watch. Everything about it is hilarious.The primary family is a group of scientists from the future to go back when they catch their evil worker who is determined to destroy them all. They meet him in 1146. The 'futuristic' laboratory from 2033 is the eight-year-old fashion room with a futuristic flashing capsule and a time-like sandstone. Employees provide their line for non-enthusiastic aplomb, which is not hard to understand by considering that the lines usually tend to be as "I double checked everything twice!" He looked twice about everything? Look at it four times? Not only, but it gives you the whole premise of the movie in the first five minutes, and will continue the speed of the hot speed until they hit the middle part. When Roger Corman lost money. And he had to stop traveling for a while and so different sets. The middle set is a combination of everything from the 10th century until the 16th century. I think the sequence of the sequence was not in the budget, because all boys wear the selected shirts as weapons. The events of the fight are interesting, and men throw themselves on the swords of the cards and stop and die in death blows and nary blow cast.It looks really bad, but I enjoy every time I look. The line alone is enough to have you fit and everything else it combines together to create a wonderful film of B which, if you are well versed in corny flicks, I'd like to see it. And once you have, read the review in the Unknown Film. I love to hear citing all the wonderful bits, true in the movie.
