Being a fan of Elvis, I can understand how this proyect can be done. Is it far beyond Elvis's movie all the time, no matter how much, not many mistakes about the King. Come, the Elvis tomb in the public park? To mention the idea of ​​guilt in 1958? ... and these are just two examples. Other people in the effort are trying to do better, Mike Starr is funny (especially as the actors). If you want to see the ultra cheap, insane but the most amazing film related to Elvis, I recommend "Bubba Ho-Tep" instead of this mess.
