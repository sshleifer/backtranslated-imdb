Hi, Everyone, If you saw "Singing In The Rain," you remember the Gene Kelly area playing in the rain. You also remember Donald O'Connor's dance number, "Make 'em laugh". If you have seen the “Royal Wedding,” you will remember Fred Astaire playing on the ceiling. If you have seen the "Jailhouse Rock," you will remember the number of songs of the selected song by King himself. <br /> <br /> That's what's missing here. There may be blockbuster dance numbers in this presentation. Chuck McGowan was closer to "I Can Do That." The fact that you have talented people in the move to move together does not make a great film of dance. Richard Attenborough was blaming the failure. He explained the camera to action and thought it would be a good thing. <br /> <br /> Seeking people for inquiry for part in Broadway production is not entertainment. Michael Douglas will be as badly cast if he was in Western or comedy. He is right when he is in Michael Douglas's film where we see him shouting to someone we like to scream. It doesn't work here. Mission was good but by Michael, of course. A good film could be made even with songs that were in parallel production, but one should think about how to make it. Sometimes they do one of these I hope they call me first. Tom Willett
