Yes, you have changed it. Another movie where twins are similarly changing areas. I think now that the twins of Olsen when they are older should try and do under a predictable plot and under the run again to 'Full House'. If you plan to see this film, don't do it. See 'Parent's Trap' instead. It is more entertaining.
