Evil Evil is a fantastic flick flick which unfortunately no good. The beginning of the film seems promising but in general it is a disaster. Talks are very bad but not as close as bad as acting.The acting is brutal and uncomfortable. The perpetrators are angry. For some killings it is innovative but it took too long to reach them. The kind of spoof with the characters of the worried look, the martial karate as a fight, and the area where one finds its intestines out of its sscrack. Clich√©d even with slasher levels and is as solid as but on the left on the counter for 5 days. Birth is not bad however fails in the main task. Look at the Chainsaw massacre of Texas, Before the Daylight, or Do Not See Evil for a real slasher.
