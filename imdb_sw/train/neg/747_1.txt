Finally I thought someone would do justice to classic H.G. Wells, not another version set in the wrong location or time, but directly according to the book. Yes, it really follows the book very closely, and that's unique with this confusion. <br /> <br /> This is 180 Min (yes 3 hours) for a long time, only about 150 pages. If Timothy Hines had the courage to come here and say "if you can do better ..." I would say "yes, I can" and I've never used a video camera or have any kind of school or play in my life. I paid good money to get this British trick from the United States, don't make the same mistake as me.
