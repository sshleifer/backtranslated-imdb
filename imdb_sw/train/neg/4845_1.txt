There is no value for art in this movie to qualify for any award. Yes, it is not good for the audience as well. Surprisingly, one of the awards is for movies but for false, camera movements are shocking to say a bit. Each chapter, you hear you get a "perfect picture", such as someone "stimulates your view" from all sides. The story is awesome. Well, I will be honest, I could not tolerate the entire film. The most interesting part was when I saw the soldiers intervening in their camps with one of the soldiers when he had been drinking. These events and many others remind you of a lot of Steven Seagal. Take my advice, don't keep away from this piece.
