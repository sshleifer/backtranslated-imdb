Richard Tyler is a little boy who fears everything. He does not like to climb his bike or climb on his house tree because he knows what kind of accidents can happen to him. So one day he runs his bike and because it is near the rain, he decides to wait in the library even to stop the rain. There the whole story is done. He has experience of all kinds of workers and ultimately not more afraid. But the whole story is strange and even good actors like Macaulay Culkin could not make the story better than it was.
