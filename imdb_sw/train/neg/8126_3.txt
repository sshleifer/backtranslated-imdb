I didn't think this was so horrible as some people do. It takes as one of those awesome movies that you can waste time in the middle of the night when you can't sleep, though it's certainly not better than that. It is true that acting is not great - I thought Marianne McAndrew as Cathy Beck, for example, came as if she wasn't quite enthusiastic - but the main problem is that a number of conspiracies did not mean much to me. The Becks are on a journey described by John (Stewart Moss) as part of the work and part of the morning were not (now it's romantic!) The work part has something to do with the caves of visiting, which itself looks amazing (how to be part of the tour group through the cave is related to the work of anyone? The humanitarian mixture (though finally seen him in shapes he looks much more like a person of some sort) and killing a spree start. Here is another problem. The first murder is a nurse at the hospital. At first, everyone thinks his death was an accident. The second is a little girl, who is described as having her throat broken. Sheriff (Michael Pataki) then tells us that her death was the same as a nurse (meaning the throat was given out? - \ t How can one think that it was an accident? And what is the sheriff? He seems not to be chaotic to the hotel area of ​​Cathy when he gets a swig of liquor and then almost wants him, then after everything appears to come back to normal. It has been left to the end that has remained almost everything that has not been resolved, as well as one of the most offensive songs I have heard in the movie. Even with all of this, there was something here that protected him. Sometimes fresh chees can get you for an hour and a half. Already bad, yes - but it's not as bad as other people say.
