This movie includes glass. logo and bad performance by David Muir as Dr Hackenstein. The original and final documents show with many actors and "special effects" that this is a small movie budget. There is nothing in this film that you can not find in another mad scientist, fear / comedy, or low budget movies. Not specified for an external location of an external or bad movie site. This movie is just here. Anne Ramsey and Phillis Diller have no exciting things as well. If you crave as I was and I can get this, you will see the fact of one summary of the line.
