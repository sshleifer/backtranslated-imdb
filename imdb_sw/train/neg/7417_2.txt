This film is bad - talks, stories, actors and executives - everything! - it's hard to think that we will see the worst movie this year or in the following years. "Brother of Love" (imposed Australia among the Italian immigrants) does nothing but deep on Italian culture to give, and spells that even Italy from Italy and saying ENGLISH in the film. The message of the film - the bad people should marry innocent people, good people should marry good people - it is a real concern. Giovanni Ribisi is very good in the film as 'Suburbia' or 'Lost in Translation', but here his statement of pseudo and Italy is difficult to bear. See this film for your own risk. Ducks like garbage can!
