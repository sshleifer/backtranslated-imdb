Remembering the dirt of the "dirty" movie is the same as digging into your chest and chest spoon. Maybe "Home alone 2: Lost New York" (1992) was a little on the predictable side, but this pathetic excuse for the film is just one of the most bids of business that I've ever heard. A boy fights with spies while he is at home alone in a Chicago suburb with chicken? Fraudsters! Why should this film be made? I am the kind of person who believes that horrible movies are not dirty time, but instead of learning experience. However, this is really a waste of time. It should be avoided at all costs.
