The first Bo Derek film was not seen for eight years? and it was to stay! John Derek was a potential actor but, as a director, he is near Ed Wood's erotic movies? not that this is quite clear, considering that Bo (dark brown hair) was only 16 years old when the film was done! John also wrote and photographed; The final result shows a beautiful picture of the Greek island being directed by details? but plans are appropriate to talk angry! The behavior played by male leader Peter Hooten was raised by Bo's family: they grew up as brothers and sisters but, now in their youth, couples discover that they are faced with another person (but, as I said, do not expect any fireworks sex!). However, the worst thing about this is the fact that all the port characters lose all through the film which is not only silly in their own but irritating in their deficit? Hooten wants to turn the rural fishing community into a modern sea resort and continues to expect the cruise liner to appear in view (which, in fact, makes it in finale); Derek is even nuttier ?? he desires the fortune of a great fortune bathroom! For the record, the couple married to the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Also participating in non-events is the mayor of the female city and lothario photographer who wants to make an example of Bo (and who, usually, makes the anger of Hooten envious). From time to time, because there is no good quality, we have been treated even in the exhibition from the Hollywood Hollywood Experts in an open movie house that the whole city gathers (between the names shown by THE ENEMY PUBLIC [1931])! At the end of the day, the Naivete boon was almost unacceptable, not enough to end the great films of the film by amateurishness.
