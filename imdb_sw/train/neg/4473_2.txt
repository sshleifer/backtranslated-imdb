Dane tries hard and is very aggressive and shouting to him and going to things, pouring water on himself and blowing the floor. To the extent. Desire down, put yourself together and make us laugh. I did not fully understand his comparison with stars and rock stars. Just because there is a point or something? He said that every player wants to be a rock star. I'm sure Rodney Dangerfield was actually in it when he was alive. He had a good joke as King of the Burger King where people are shouting at the car. I also loved the joke of the Reese of Pieces. If Dane did not act with the mind then he could be funnier and I could give this advanced rating, up if maybe eight.
