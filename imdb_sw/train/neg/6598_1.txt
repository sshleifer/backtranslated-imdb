This "film" is a shadow. No, wait - an abomination. No, of course - this is undoubtedly the film of the WORST completely done in conjunction with partner characters created by the introduction and other actors. <br /> <br /> I thought "Inspector Clouseau" and Alan Arkin (!) instead of Peter Sellers was ridiculous and silly, but even the courage to "restore" Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are athletic and grubbing money. Laurel and Mr. Hardy have died, respectively, since 1957 and 1965. Why would anyone begin to think that the correct L&H updates would be in the persona of Bronson Pinchot and Gailard Sartain is more than me. I looked forward to expecting to be afraid and embarrassed and certainly I did not desire. Everyone involved in this sad, moral, disgrace should be black from everything and everything related to Hollywood and film displays. AVOID MOVIE RIGHT IN ALL VITES - You have been intended.
