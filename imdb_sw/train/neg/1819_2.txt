I wanted this film for one reason - Al Adamson. He is among the evil directors of all time - there up with Ed Wood, Jr. and Ray Dennis Steckler and the pastor of evil. However, I was tad disappointed because although the film was bad, it has never reached the awfulness levels of its old schlocky movies. For this reason, this film was not very interesting to watch fans of bad films. Now I was worried about watching this film, as the title "Dirty Children" makes the film look like a photographic picture. The film - something I can't go through the IMD. However, this film seemed to be this sometimes - especially the first 10 minutes. But, you can say that the script got a lot of changes, as many movies do not have any hold and the end of the movie there is a conspiracy that comes from no one that is cruel and certainly not sexy! The result of all of these is a general mix. <br /> <br /> Sadly, there are not many suitable places. For example, like a porn video, it shows a bit of amazement and it is unclear why they would put a 71-year-old boy in some cases of love. Indeed, for 71-year-old Mr. Livingston was very good - but he was still an old man and no one would like to see him getting a little nymphet! Then, when the last 20 minutes are very violent, as Livingston became Rambo's boyfriend! Talk about weird and improper. <br /> <br /> Overall, there is little to suggest this sad movie. Not enough or enough to keep up with the film can be sad even with a title like "Naughty Stewardesses".
