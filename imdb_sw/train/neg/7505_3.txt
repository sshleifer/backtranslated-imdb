This film has long been seen to be a little over Berkowitz and its impact on NYC, but more about the caricatures painting of a certain Italian-American group, known as "Guidos". The problem is that "Guidelines" is not acceptable, regardless of what kind of story or put in them. They already live caricatures, so Lee adds them only, instead of showing them. <br /> The person has a caricature done themselves, do not have a home and say, "Let's, let's make ears and nose even big!" That's what Lee has done in this film. The most popular characters in the film are two (Adrian Brody and Jennifer Esposito) who want to avoid "Guido" lives. Keep away from the unpopular stories of characters, especially John Leguizamo, and you get a good film to sleep with. Especially considering is a lot of time to run. Another strike against him: For someone who claims to be a fan of Yankees, and has grown up in New York, Spike Lee should know how to translate Phil Rizzuto, which is spelled out in a closed credit.
