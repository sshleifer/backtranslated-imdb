I am not a big fan of the Taiwan film production as opposed to Korea, Hongkong or even China. The quality of the bright act was not found in them as shown in this film. I don't think it's difficult-please-please viewers like me, in fact, a fan of indie movies. However this film shows a weak plot and slow speed. I found myself lost in the middle and where the plot was going. Acting is certainly not good. Rainie's work is small as he 'over-act', trying to be perky and cute. Although I must admit it is a pleasure to look at. Isabella Leong on the other hand has a more suitable role as a mixture, sadness, sadness, and very saved behavior. In general I see this movie is desperate.
