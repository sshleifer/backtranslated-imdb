Return to Cabini and Lake only .... was missing. It should have a very low budget because a large amount of movie should be shown by a standard video camera. Therefore, within the same area - you will have the camera film shots with a simple video camera shots. It makes it a wonderful mix! I think they should find a certain way to make a "home video" effect of the kind! I think it's best to see that if you have seen the original CBTL because then you can compare and see the difference. But if you haven't seen the original CBTLâ€¦ you'll never see if you see this first! It looks also too cheesy and prevents you even considering one original.
