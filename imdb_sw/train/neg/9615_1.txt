It seems obvious from these changes that he did not have. Not only the one who gave the plot behind, he built himself! The things he chose to leave were so amazing that I was glad to leave some of the most important parts of the novel. The plan was uncomfortable, irrelevant and you would like to say a little. I don't want to say anything that means-few about actors, but can't do it! Dickens are difficult, of course, but this is sad! Micawber was nothing more than the nineteenth century Kramer, and little said about Betsy Trotwood better! If you want to see the actual Copperfield, check out the 1999 good condition of the BBC. As for the author of the screenplay, I think he read Notes Cliff!
