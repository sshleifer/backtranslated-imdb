"What happens when you give a homeless person $ 100,000?" As if by asking that question somewhat morally of what will eventually happen. The creators of "Reversal Fortune" are trying to find their personal tips when hiding their antics as some sort of social responsibility attempt. They take Ted, a homeless person in Pasadena, and give him $ 100,000 to see if he will overthrow his life. Then, with the best guidance and advice, they allow him to continue his way of happiness. <br /> <br /> What! What are they trying to say? "Money can not give you happiness?" "Homeless residents because they deserve it?" Or about what, "Raise a man - it's more fun to watch him fall from a great height." They took someone without something to lose, gave him something to lose, and then looked at him to throw all down. That should be recreation? This dress is sown with sharp music and strong camera shots, but eventually it has a high point of the video fall of the car - just this time they made a car accident and asked, "What happens when you stop the sign?"
