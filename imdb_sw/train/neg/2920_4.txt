Wow! I am surprised to know that it is a small world and that we are all connected. It was lost for 88 minutes. John Dunne put it very well in one sentence. "No one is an island." Acting was not bad. The children gave all they had but sometimes the thread was thin I couldn't follow it with a special "hero" in the film that remained in jail after being tortured by a meter. I don't know. I just don't know. Oh well.
