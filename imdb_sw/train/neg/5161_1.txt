My life is about saving animals. I do a volunteer work with a cat rescue agency. I am a vine because I can't kill an animal even to sustain my life. I can't even kill the spider, I put it out. The place where children throw stones on the plane to death, and soon to participate in the adoption of other children, made me sick and hated me ever since. It only assures me that humans are interested in their need for acceptance. Finally - parental parents take a short time - it does not redeem the symptoms of animal cruelty. Why does anyone want their child to see this film?
