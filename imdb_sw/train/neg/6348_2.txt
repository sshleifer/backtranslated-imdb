The feeling of feeling totally. These materials are lightweight, not proportional, do not recommend, and many of the cast did not even do in Allen's original films. And for that you hear the wish Do Ferrell do Woody Allen imitation make me hate the second rate (though very strange) Ferrell even more. It seems that 70-year-old Allen would have to work at a time when the clock began in the new century. I tried to participate in the film, but it was impossible; My snyapses could not fire slowly. So, instead of stopping and killing daylight at the best place, I woke up, leaving my wife and daughter in the theater, and I came out of the car where I had a very good book to read again (the big tune of George Bailey 30 years ago,) The Germans. ") That day was very good after all, thanks to Woody.
