Consider the dark version of one of those children as "Power Rangers" and you have this film since 1990, "Robot Jox". Modern where you are fighting with big robots, two men enter the field and everyone who leaves the success of their country. Robots are great and it looks like the most beautiful versions of those from it displayed especially because they don't have color and so when this movie is not good, it's not all bad to watch. There is as I remember the two battles of a robot in this one, which is approaching wrong with the last showdown. There is a way of losing the way that the traitor is exposed, but eventually the plot is not something that is happening to you for any amount of time after the photos have been made. The struggle itself looks like tiny on rampage, but it's still very fun to watch. This film could also produce several films and similar plot and similar robots and competitions. It is therefore important to look at once, but maybe not more than that.
