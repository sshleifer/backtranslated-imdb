The family looking for past road attractions to be included in the book of the coffee table is found in the history of a planned ban by one who had eyes. When their family car declines during departure, they are forced to stay in a camp near a fishing site that was a prison site for several decades before. <br /> There have been many films in the 'terrifying ethnic group, from the dear Freaks' of Tod Browning (1932) to Alex Winter's 'Freaked' hilarious (1993). Those are both common (or soon have 'Freaked'). 'Side Sho,' however, will never be. And if it reaches a normal situation. . . well, it will be a clear sign of the sad state of our kind. From a bad opening song to a 17-year-old daughter who is more obvious than her natural mother, this film did not go so much. Writing was small, but not very bad. . . just boring. The direction was poor, and the most common side effects were terrible and wonderful. Acting was bad and giving us worse. Anyone who believes the age of these young age camps should not contact the boy for a long, long time. It was far from the gore and enough because of the lack of any quality. . . and when there was violence, it was not quite good. And, I can't forget to mention the end-time events that were, in all honesty, some of the worst I ever had, ever seen on the film. In general, this is a very simple and forgotten film which deserves to be left alone under the dollar dollar. <br /> <br /> Final document: 2.5 / 10.
