This 30-minute paper Bu単uel conducted at the beginning of the 1930s on one of the poorest regions of Spain is in my opinion, one of its most weak films. First, let's admit that 70 years later, Spain is richer than it was then (and when I say this, I fully believe that wealth can bring its own problems, like selfishness and humanity, though all in all wealth is far better than poverty here). And if poverty fell in Spain it was not the same as the kind of socialism that Bu単uel was proposed, but for Western communism in Western Europe. But one of the most amazing things about the movie is this: in one place, the storyteller at school, children are taught the value of Pi. Teach lessons for the poor, fear! Bu単uel's lack of attention is too high here, not realizing that it is the acquisition of the latest knowledge and technology that will help the poor win their situation. What does he recommend? What are children being taught in school? Does Bu単uel not know that it is a lack of modern technology that has made them poor in comparison with other people?
