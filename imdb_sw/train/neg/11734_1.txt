Not suitable. I can't even write a mind about the movie. I cut the entire movie. It shouldn't be funny. Matt Farnsworth does not know what he does. His story is written, apparently, without the knowledge of Iowa's culture and meth trouble. I know Farnsworth is from Iowa, which makes his movie even more troubling me. Why do two main characters have permits? It doesn't have any meaning. Acting was more beautiful and sometimes hard to see. Extreme violence and sex were full of films. I think that violence and sex are supposed to make movies, but it reached as odd and offensive. The end of the movie is so bad that all I could do was laugh and look enough credit for unbelief. When I came out of the playground everyone who was leaving was laughing with me. The end of the film was meant to remove tears, but it was quite the opposite. Do not waste your time on this awesome film, unless you want to see the inexperienced, sappy, overacted, clich√©d drivel.
