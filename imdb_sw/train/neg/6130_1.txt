In the 1980s, Kurt Thomas was something of a hero in the United States. Unfortunately, men in his place get the roles of the film that are only available for consideration. I do not know what Thomas was paid to make this film, but I would have to pay a huge amount of money to agree to make my fool in the motion picture. The film is definitely coming from "Enter the dragon," as many military images. Instead of the actual military art, they include a strange new military art, described correctly by one critic as "cross between Kung Fu and breaking the play." Gymnast (Thomas, of course) is employed to save a woman from an impenetrable fortress, but every room has money that Thomas needs to beat the assistant baddies. Of course, he struggles with the way to go to the lead, and of course they have to fight with the concept, and the end that will wonder only those who have never seen a film of marshal. There is a touch of the kind of nostalgic likes, especially the hair of Thomas's hair and many of the male stars. But the only reason to watch this film is if you hate against Kurt Thomas, who now wants to never put a foot on the film.
