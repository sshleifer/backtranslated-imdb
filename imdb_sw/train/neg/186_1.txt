I did not know whether I was laughing or right for this history of the history of Canada, especially the abolition of the police history planned in Yukon. I will leave Pierre Berton, said historian, born and raised in Dawson City Yukon, and the author of a reliable history of running for Klondike, Klondike: The Last Great Gold Rush, 1896-1899 to express my anger with this incredible movie: The US minister of the unplanned, defeated by six armed heroes, continued in the Far country, another story about cowboy from the west of the United States - Wyoming at this time - driving his cow a cow in the land of gold. The picture is a contempt of geographical roles, but the actual incongruity is the main concept in which the plot turns? that there was only one policeman planted in all Canada's Yukon during the gold rush and that he could not cope with the rebellion. When James Stewart and Walter Brennan reach the Yukon border with their animals, the traditional sand is empty. "Where are the fighters?" On Pelly River. The person responds, has a real hard work, has a 12,000 square mile, sometimes he can't get home for two or three months at a time. "The historical fact is that the Yukon District during the gold rush was the closest thing to the British North American police situation. The Western Mountain Police was in the area with a large number before the Klondike strike. They collected customs duty, often on mourning for new visitors, made false rules on the wind on the river navigation, and sent people if they did not have enough equipment, or if they could only look bad In Canada's true style, they set ethical rules for the community. In Dawson The Law of the Lord's Day was considered, it was a mistake to be punished for fines on Sunday, and young women emerged were arrested for what the police were fighting with The genre called "providing dangerous performance in the theater," generally not just play it gradually on tights in the top performances . , the gun was unpredictable. One very bad man from Tombstone who tried to grab a weapon on his own hip was armed with a small army, who had just run away from the saloon for a violent crime talk. The bad man left as a lamb but he resisted when the police, on discovering that he had taken a gun told him to get. "Nobody has taken a gun away from me," said the US. "Well, I take it", the winner said gently and did it, without further criticism. Many registers were taken to Dawson that they were bought by the police for a small amount of dollars and bought as gifts to keep ahead. In 1898, the great year of being beaten, is there not a big crime? let's just kill? in Dawson. Unlike Skagway on the American side, which was a lawless city run by Soapy Smith, a man of Denver's faith, it was strange. But in the Far Country Dawson looks like a society without any law, which characterizes Soapy Smith from Skagway ?? is called Gannon in the picture? can control easily. (In real life, one of Smith's men who tried to cross the border had all the equipment taken and beaten regularly by the planted police force). <br /> <br /> {only in the movie Mountie says} "Yes I am the law." I represent the law in the Yukon District. About fifty thousand square miles. "<br /> <br />" So why don't you have more? "<br /> <br />" Because this was a desert. We did not expect to pour it with thousands. Now that you're here, we'll protect you. ”<br /> <br />“ When? "<br /> <br />" There will be a post created in Dawson in early May. "<br /> <br />" What will happen between now and May? Will you be here to keep the command? "<br /> <br />" Time section. "<br /> <br />" What! what is all the time? "<br /> <br />" Choose a good person. he in. Will he work as a marshal? "What do you think?" The movie Mountie leaves and does not appear again in the picture. Its awesome view that the city of the city of America, full of corrugated stars, swearing by a group of people living under British authority? they usually want to make Jimmy Stewart marshal, he is the same place. But Stewart plays the role of Loner who looks at the First Number and so someone else is chosen to get a shot. And he does. Others are getting shot. and the conclusion of the denial that he must complete all the bullets and his own bullets. The pieces of figs and he and shock, Gannon, bursts at each other at the peak of western destruction. The knowledge of the northern pass of Canada, the story passes the good faith. /> <br /> ?? from Canada's Hollywood, and Pierre Berton, 1975.
