I wholeheartedly agree with other viewers of this bad film. The only reason I had no rate 1 was bad because of the beautiful talent of Carmen Miranda. The beginning and the end are the best parents because of singing and gift gifts. <br /> <br /> The problem is with the whole picture. Alice Faye comes quite far. Don Ameche has a great voice to sing but with bad writing materials, he comes very far. <br /> <br /> The program is very complicated here and Ameche will take two parts like a song with someone of dance and baron not happy married with Faye. It seems that by playing a song with someone of dance, Ameche's marriage gets a second change to rule. Some of the silent deception about the baron have to erase the business and be far apart enable them to play both. <br /> <br /> S.Z. Sakal is given a little to do here and so his comedic gifts are not given a chance to shine. Ditto for J. Carrol Naishi who really looks worried in his role. <br /> <br /> This is a chica chica boom film boom.
