This has a very bad performance from Robert Duval who looks like William Buckley in the entire film. His work of melodramatic acting takes away from any serious interest. I don't know if this was a volunteer place to steal or unknown but it is the only thing I can remember from a realistic film. This image should be displayed in every class of an example of what it does not do. Thank God, Duvall went on with good and positive things and stood trying to try the effect of cultures. He is an actor of good behavior but that's about it. Klaus is very good. His performance has been sent and seen.
