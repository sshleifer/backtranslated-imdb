This is a film that is bad every way thought. We really want to know what happened 12 years from the last film, and it works at a certain level. But new characters are not just interesting. Baby Melody is very awesome! Alas, when the logic that humans can not live under the eternal water is maintained, the other basic physical logic is ignored. It's cool if you don't have a cool weather climate if you're in Arctic. I do not know why many views here come back to Jafar the worst rates, I thought this was even worse.
