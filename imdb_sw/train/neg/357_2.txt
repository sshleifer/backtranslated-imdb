JUST CAUSE displays Sean Connery as a law professor of Harvard, Kate Capshaw (works yet?) As his wife (young age difference) and Lawrence Fishburne as southern colored racist (!) And Ed Harris in the top revolution the south of the south south killer. <br /> <br /> Win for fraud, but the movie has a great feeling ** and listeners. (Do not read if you ever expect to watch this film or to watch this film because of the vendors) First of all, I have felt reducing my eyes on regular Liberal discrimination: all fighters are grateful for this black frame without evidence. The offender, witnesses and even the lawyer of the defendant cooperates with him (he is charged with rape and the murder of a little girl) because he is black. Connery is a law of Harvard who gives kindness to talking about injustice against whites and against the death penalty death. He approaches the mistress of the accused to defend and reopen the case. Connery is a stone stone (yawn ...) and a small town leaders and a good boys club IL but they see that the case against Blair, the prosecutor, now on the death line, all they were made. The great proof was his confession that was cast from him. The beat was supervised by black soldiers (!) Who even played the Russian roulette to confess from him. Connery knows that another prisoner on the line of death made such a massacre and after a few volatile volatile and very offensive, Hannibal Lecter-like Ed Harris, finds where Harris hid the weapon of murder. <br /> <br /> Receiving the case with Blair is open. <br /> <br /> I think ... film up ... <br /> <br /> Then suddenly! It changes that Blair is psychologically psychologically and that he used "white crime" to join Connery. He thought the story with Ed Harris to return to Blair to commit a few killings to Harris. Now Blair has been reopened, because of Connery's PC code! Last 30 minutes. is an amazing act of action that has been hit on a legal ceremony, Connery and Fishburne are fighting with a common killer in the leather house of alligator on the stilts (yes, you read it right) in eternity. It was a wonderful one. So the whole system is corrupt and effective, all fighters are just bully and abusers of Abu Graib, but criminals are real psychologically and deserve to refuse. <br /> <br /> Really sad every level! The system is completely corrupted by the white PC cases that have also been challenged. <br /> <br /> Two pieces below. Connery definitely had to make a mortgage payment or something.
