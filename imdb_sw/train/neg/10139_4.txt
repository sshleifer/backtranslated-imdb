You give them Steven Seagal: whatever his mistakes may be, he has a good taste for women. If you take a Seagal movie, there is one or more beautiful women in it. And usually, they do not work as just eye eye; involved in action and fighting, shooting gun, killing with knives, etc. "Flight of Fury" offers the duo of Ciera Payton (who has a very very face, with luscious lips to match Angelina Jolie's) and Katie Jones, and finds time to engage them in the match two with a little lesbian player! And if it looks like I'm spending too much time talking about them, it's because all the movie, though they can be approved, is so bad that it's hard to find something else to talk about. Surprisingly, the most vulnerable feature perhaps Seagal himself, who looks like he can't even be worried trying to pretend to care. This is a military character, there is very little war in it, and it is not recommended in his role (an attempt by a military fighter, "the best in the world", of course) very well, which can describe his closest sleep.
