I do not know who writes these interesting comments for this film but I believe it is STKINKS. I have seen many films of fear and flicks of slasher and this is LAME is just 80min long and you believe I am all I could take. Plot is terrible, act is worse. And no development even. David Cocteau's movies are better than this. PINDA from JIGSAW. I expected to dislike this act, which can be automatically forgiven on video movies, if the plot is good. <br /> <br /> This was not guilty, too little Gore, <br /> <br /> and was thrown in fact unpleasant. <br /> <br /> I watched this with three other friends / people that I hope are still talking to me! They wanted me to do the window. I don't believe anyone can be worth it / review this review through this review.
