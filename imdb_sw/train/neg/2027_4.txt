Unlike other current endemol games of the United States (Making or Not Working with 1 against 100), walking in this show in a way is very slow for what is happening on the screen. 0% 100 can get away from slow because games can change speed - or last - at any time. There is a risk involved in each stage the player takes, the award is different, and it is difficult for players to leave a large amount of money. Usually used properly. <br /> <br /> Show Me Money, on the other hand, it's very slow. When the question is revealed and it is obvious that the player knows the correct answer, you can ensure that nothing exciting will happen in the next few minutes. It will be very helpful to show this show to show the correct answer FIRST, and then become a player to choose a dancer, instead of Shat losing time talking about what will happen if the player gets the right answer when we all know it's the same. Dancing of random is a filling which actually feels like filling. Much time loses when it is impossible to happen ... and the fact that players cannot choose to leave the game of early securities that there will be a lot of time to get lost. <br /> <br /> Oh, and I don't mind looking at Shat shake his thong groove, especially after I eat dinner. <br /> <br /> I am a game of fan show life, but even I had a lot of trouble staying at this hour. It requires great changes or early retirement.
