With one respect, it is like 'the Wizard of Oz,' with Paris in black-and-white and the Color River. But it is considered on personal love, demolition and ethical values, while in fact it is on designer clothes, Riveria shots, lots of expensive cars, and music and dance dances that show Vincente Minnelli for one day its distant. It seems, but it is a wonderful example of plot, dark and written material in a different way. (Is this an example of 'Mr. Ripley who is talented? Does anyone feel the relationship between Jean Seberg and Matt Damon?)
