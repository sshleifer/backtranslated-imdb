I will not buy kung fu movies for conspiracy. I give them for the fighting events. A bad plan can be forgiven for better fighting events, but not another way around. The story was good, but it moved very slowly to my taste. There were 3 or 4 combat incidents caused by the fight, for just a few minutes. The last fighting was long, but at the time I was so tired that I did not remember.
