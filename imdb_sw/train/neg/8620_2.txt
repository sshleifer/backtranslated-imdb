I wasn't sure if Andy Sidaris could repeat his achievements and hit the movies "Malibu Express." For his film Fit's murder has shown that Sidaris is a film manufacturer and not just a lead director. A lesson written by Sidaris, which was undoubtedly taught by the Academy College, is a great screens involving many unknown changes. The main characters included work for a sex radio station known as KSXY. Wisely, KSXY is actually a secret headquarters. In "Fitting Kill" they face their long term Nemesis Kane, who tries to steal one of the most valuable Russian diamonds. The well-written screenplay is not all, the best act and cast helps to ensure this film as a classic cult. Installed by critics and box office, this film will be appreciated in the coming years. Now you suffer the same as Orange Clockwork and Driver Driver did, but in the future unquestionably unnoticed. I have been disappointed that there is no worrying cycle that has seen the business film Andy Sidaris. Clothing, special effects, all help to praise this new piece of film. It can do well to ignore the 3 failure rate on this film and go out and find yourself. My personal rating is 10/10. The drawings are as thick as the Bustbuster Escape, and a good step or similar to the cinematic end of the Action Step. Andy, keep up the good work.
