At first glance it gives the impression that it will look for pollution, and it has a time when it goes to that direction. However, the basic concept of the story is more powerful than it can be expected, and it is an honorable effort to highlight color issues in World War II. Casting faced with lost, and Glynn Turman, Richard Pryor and Billy Dee Williams are being abused. Stephen Boyd, however, returns just a short time to form his bushy mustache in the overindulgent star. <br /> <br /> The low-budget budget leads to a difference in production standards. The area is large, effects and action is weak. Imagine if "Save Ryan's self" had half of the hippo killed in the same way as Vin Diesel's Caparzo was (except we could see a shot because the emotions can not handle), then Hanks, Damon and Burns around in jeep and beat five Germans at the top . However, the symptoms, as well as the warriors of the heroes do not care for their achievements because they are black, and the Boyd citizen of the Boyd being done by this, is compelling, as is the case with Turman's behavior to write in the expected application as The soldiers were allowed to fight instead of digging latri. In short, "Black Brigade / Carter" is not exactly the same. But it is a failure to honor, not a bad joke. It can be adjusted as a very good film, and, as it stands, it's an interesting quest.
