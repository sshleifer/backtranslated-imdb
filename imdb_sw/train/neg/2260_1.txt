O dear, Jerry can be an unwanted king of talk but the movie is the whole game of the whole ball, and he is out of his league. The script of this film is poor must seem reliable and sad to see the characters as unknown as Michael Dudikoff (step 80 B'movie king), Michael Jai White (Last seen in Sci Fi flop 'Spawn') with William MacNamara Save Games (who is involved in just a half funny situation in the whole film!) Leaves this down for jobs. If you are a Jerry fan then stick on his TV show if this is a total waste of an hour and a half. Having finished this way I was able to get the last half of the 5-hour Rocky TV on TV, which looks like a hub of the movies to compare, I think it says more than enough! <br /> <br />
