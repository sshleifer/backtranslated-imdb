..IYO HII! Very cool power, certainly on the bat. <br /> <br /> It has the first place, gotta credit when you got credit. It has a strong and consistent lesson for the subject of the spirit but here are the things that bother you: Every time the ghosts were visible, which I liked the way; how it was done, how it looked ... the only thing was the spirit relationship. Because of what happened in the first place you would think that their power would be different. Things were a bit slow in the middle I heard, and the crocodile / spider area was just not good. But then the end is very good! Indeed, 'Grudge' basically told the same story with a hit but no samurai and that's what I liked about this film in comparison. <br /> <br /> Please, someone with an angry style causes this film. <Br /> <br /> Fans of the 'Rage of Silent' would like this film.
