It's still hard to understand that movies are as bad as this can be done on Hollywood. Acting with the story is only patistic and the trend is bad. I don't see anything behind garbage except that the director did not have any good to do. I took ten minutes to realize that I had lost thirty precious pies. I have filled it with shame that I would lose more time in my life. I bet that movie was made under the day. I don't know what type falls. Please, avoid this film at all costs, just do anything, even your pig's head against the walls but don't go for this film.
