"Die Sieger" was highly recommended to be one of the most effective movies in Germany. I watched it last night and I must admit, that I've been very disappointed. If that should be a "last hope" for the entertainment and challenges of the practical acts of German, then there is not much left. "Die Sieger" tries to be sexy, strong and angry but not that kind. The perpetrators are timber and discrimination and whenever they do an unexpected (which does not happen very often) act against their nature. That makes it difficult - for me almost impossible - to follow or even identify them. <br /> <br /> Above all I think the film is very bad cast. There is no one character that I believe. Perhaps the chief officer in the SWAT unit - but that's up to it. Those people who are trying to look like or do as special units, like elite warriors - do not believe. Not for the second. <br /> <br /> Stories are not bad after all. But I think it's told wrong. You can't know someone bad at all - for example. And after the "dark" show down Karl Simon (a good man) asks his opponent already dead "why ... what for?" I asked the same question, knowing, that Dominik Graf did not have an answer. <br /> <br /> I sincerely hope - no - I believe that Germany can do well, even with practical movies.
