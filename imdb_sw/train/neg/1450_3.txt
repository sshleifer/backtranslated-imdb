If anyone wants to know Hitler, read WWI's history is not WWII history. Find out what happened during the war, how soldiers had to live near dead death at all times. As many soldiers were on the run, from what they saw during WWI, when they called it "shellshocked" now it calls it a trouble after the trouble. If you learn the true WWI fears, you will begin to understand Hitler. You will understand how man can be destroyed by death, not only because of their evil but because it is the only way they can also cope with their fears. This movie unfortunately lacks that, as many others do. Read other books on the subject and you should watch the movie "ways of glory", the only beautiful WWI movie made. You will see the frustration of the soldiers in the movie, meaning no help, and the total annihilation of human life, like anything other than shooters. That is what this film is missing, it is very important to direct Germany. The lost war, where millions and millions of Germans lost their lives, because there is no truth. Then comes the economic collapse completely, following the war. That is why they cause damage. The disappearance of family members and the great poverty will always lead to a gradual recovery. Unfortunately this movie did not discover these reasons, and it just took another piece of throwing throw into the pile. In fact there is no real value, there are false movies based on false characters who can give you a better idea of ​​Hitler than this. They beat Hitler's name on this so that it could sell more.
