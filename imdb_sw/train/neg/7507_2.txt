This film is bad news and I am very surprised by the great amount of talent that would have been seen in a piece of junk like this. I think there were a few few who were beaten on Blvd's Hollywood. as a result of this fiasco. What exactly you find is that it would be good. The star appeals of directors and the issue was enough food to attract interest and ticket sales, but this is a flop. The line of many stories goes from bad to the foam and the end of the picture, and it sounds like a mouse in a maze looking at a piece of cheese that turns to decay. What a pastor can reach is to take revenge on any Italian who can beat him when he is a child or insulting him, as the movie makes numbers on maintaining an old Italian shortage and destruction. Like any movie Spike Lee there are some of the triggering claims and magical cameras. He has the gift to grab your psyche and take you to his vision if it is for an unforgettable event. But the question remains ... you can endure another 2 hours of cutting the head and looking at the time you are looking for and waiting for the end that should be somewhere.
