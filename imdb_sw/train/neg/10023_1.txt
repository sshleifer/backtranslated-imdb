Shame on the film Yash Raj and Aditya Chopra who seem to have lost their minds for many years and provided enough fares of the piece in this piece of movie frogs that do not contain You Tube. I used to find my teeth in the whole flick to start with the schizophrenic direction, the line of conspiracy that had not been so obvious and in the last area I felt embarrassed that my country and its producers of crorepati films can "eliminate" "crores" on such ignorance. Apply to the actors by taking this job and even commenting on it as part of the work they can own. Saif Ali Khan-totally disappointed in your choice of film. Kareen shows enough skin for pregnancy and Akshay comes as a pastor. Anil back another interesting to pubescent in English. His staff was recommended in their acting and for the wonderful movies scattered in the last 15 minutes, it was enough to beat a blood vessel. Do not lose any brain cells, energy or money to see this - Go / Lights AMU-and Konkana Sensharma instead - a good piece of free film that has come from India.Simple, poignant and fantastic story story that will touch everyone with intelligent actors and gave me the hope that all of them do not lose in the Indian cinema.
