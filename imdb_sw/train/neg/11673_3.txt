1 looked at 5/17/2002 - 3 out of 10 (Dir-Ewald Andre Dupont): The worst case of Titanic disaster is the first version of this news event. The resignation of the tragedy is not bad, but the celebration around it is sometimes unhealthy, it does not work with the way-and soap-like soap. The story is very similar to the recent winning Oscar except that we are shown how the workers tried to hide the real disasters that took place until almost late. Good for political purposes only to get to feel why James Cameron competed against (of course?) In his entertainment.
