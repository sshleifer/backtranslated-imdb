This film tries to be hard. if you are going to make a horrible film, at least give them a reason to believe the viewer. You're waiting and waiting for the movie you are looking for good but not good. instead he tries to be the last and not to reveal anything. What was the point of film? where is it really going? and most importantly what hell is going on. . . <br /> <br /> Why were they there and how does it connect to anything? The only other fear of sci-fi. I like fake reviews on IMDb and say how great it is for news related news and hitting the movie (or that or people have a minimum scope). not worth your 2hrs completely. I did not say the film is better than volatile, but at least it gave you ideas and why things happened and has the final result. this is not appropriate and looks just with tons of padding to make everything feel scary. This film is almost as much as the guest calls. blind God too. The biggest point, if you are scared, make sure to consider and explain to the viewer going on, so they have a hook on your story. because if there is no reason or trust then no hold anything and it can not be awesome. there is no respect for staff or staff because they did a good job. it's just poor text.
