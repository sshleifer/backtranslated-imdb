What do you expect when no script starts, and therefore nothing that the director can work with. Hayek and Farrell, and Donaldson and Kirkin are good actors, have nothing to say or anything to respond to. Even the earthquake was very poor. And I don't know how the film follows in the novel, but two of them have a Jewish girl outdoors to show that Arturo has a good heart, but some concerns don't have anything. And even provides Camilla out in the desert, instead of bringing L.A. by burying a Catholic where he could bring his flowers once in a while. Pathetic. And put L.A. was ridiculously graphically created. Any good thing? The window of his house seemed real, curtains, sound, wind. And Donaldson is always great. It has been since the Few of the Body or Night of the Living, whatever it was.
