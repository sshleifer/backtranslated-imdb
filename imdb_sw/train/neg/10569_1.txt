I tried to watch this film in a military camp during the overseas message, and let me tell you, you will look at anything under these circumstances. Not this part of sh * t. The first five minutes set the tone and the quality of the film-red film, the lost of the blue-blue conspiracy and the status and distorted behavior. It gets worse after that. This film does not have one saving saving, and it's still not so bad that it would make it easy to watch. It's just awesome. I have seen so many movies in my life and I am not one of those who know snobby-critics, I mean I will enjoy many movies somehow even if they're bad. This ... man ... <br /> <br /> Step _well_ clear of this, my friend.
