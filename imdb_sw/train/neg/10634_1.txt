Author / Director Bart Sibrel launches his work here next to the film films that he says had been sent to lies by NASA. He says it shows travelers who make a video on their travels to the moon using the camera method. Land specialists were under the world wanting all the time, and land editors created these raw images in just a few seconds of the finished film. Unfortunately the Sibrel study is so misleading that it does not recognize his "backstage" picture is actually taken significantly from the 30-minute television live (also on reel) which was seen by millions, not hidden away from NASA vaults as he means. And we should ask ourselves why Sibrel puts his details of the decision on the voice of astronauts in the picture, because hearing them wonderfully in their own words clearly states that scientists were trying the camera, not photography. <br /> <br> Ultimately, anyone can see raw images for themselves without buying a hacked-up version of Sibrel. (He shows you more of the Zapruder film than JFK than his "gun".) Sibrel thinks he is the only one who has seen it. What is more revealing is the parts of the green pictures that Sibrel chose to use, such as those who clearly demonstrate the far-off country with a window frames and so on, destroying its claims that mattes and transparency were placed on airplane windows to create The deception of a distant country. Like many films of this kind, Sibrel depends on transport, misunderstanding, misleading definition, and selective quotations to drive the viewer to accept the conclusion that there is no real documentation.
