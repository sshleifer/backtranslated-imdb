This film reminds me of many anti-drug traits of 50 and 60 years due to the fact that it was made by people who have never had social evil that warn us about. Tom Hanks and his friends are "playing the role", but no dice, a lot of candles, and then locked out in a bad montage depicting the hanks the fall of a woman in the group. quite funny but not accurate. I wonder how many poor children were destroyed by D & D, and they were told that the use of their ideas was a destructive road. If the film is based after a special school, the worst acting (although Hanks shows its talent) and the connection of the relationship, and no one seems to have any fun. It seems these films have a psychological perspective on young people who start the road to life, which is worse, it seems, and requires you to lose less and do things for everyone. Despite my 2 votes, this is worth watching from its unique, awesome movie, which I personally find quite funny.
