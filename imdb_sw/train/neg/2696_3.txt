I know that John Singleton is a good man of coz made Boyz N Hood, how did he write and guide this? It is like a bad trial of "going to university for the first time" a teenager soap, a debate of the moral values ​​and the obstacles and inappropriate violence that is being played to make a business proposal, I think. Who could guessed the victim of the date of the rapture could throw sausage for seafood? The lost anger would be organized by the Neo-Nazis group (and it would be full of black space with the Jew - just for laughing!) Even Laurence Fishburne's creepy history of Professor Professor was angry with me and I love the guy, it's like everyone involved with this film has lost a conspiracy . Except Busta Rhymes, of course. Great big.
