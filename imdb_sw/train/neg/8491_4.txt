In spite of the initial touch, as a “normal set” which provides a background to Victorian's interaction with Ada Lovelace and its circle, this film decreases and ultimately becomes a disappointment. The new player Francesca Faridany seems to have a talent, but has lost as Emmy, a character in the center of the film has been reduced to nothing more than looking at a track looking for Lady Ada telling a biographical description. 'Take Ada' takes briefly when Lady Ada (Tilda Swinton) appears; The camera stays on its face, its form, and even makes it appear to be rotating or temporarily invisible, emerging from the events of Emmy Emmy's “rendering”. The direct biopic of Ada Lovelace would have been useful, but this film unfortunately makes sense of the life of Mrs Ada, and of a modern computer scientist (with a strong boyfriend) ).
