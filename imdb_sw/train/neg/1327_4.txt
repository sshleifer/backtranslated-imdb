This awesome film collects all the Asian exhibitions you can think of in one hideous bag. To break the money, Japanese businessmen cleverly send goofy but the patronage Pat Patita will save the secret of factories in Detroit. Here he meets under the heel Jay Leno, who immediately refers to the victim of the murder as Jap and calls Morita Tojo. It all goes down from there.
