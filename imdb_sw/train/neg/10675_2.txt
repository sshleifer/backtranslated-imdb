You know that when the name of the star is incorrectly listed in the opening funding, you will not enter the best time (read credit "Cuba Gooding, J.R."). Some good drive expel, shoot 'em up, blow' em up action if all you want is a step, because the connection with the plot is tenuous better, and quite impossible. The catalyst of the characters, especially what is Gooding in the end, is worse then it is impossible, they do not diminish when they have no hope. All I can think is that Andy Cheng must be a very good boy to find many good actors in this bad project (can't have anything on all, can?).
