One of the former observers wrote that there seems to be no foundation in the middle of Love Story; one loved it or liked it. But there seems to be a huge distribution of views at 1 to 10 levels. For me, this film was rated 4. There are pictures and beautiful places, and Ray Milland returns to good work as the father of Oliver. But the movie did not compel a particular task to describe his story, and the story was not the only one to prove many opinions, at least, not to me. I can be a bit of snob, but I tend to avoid movies and Ryan O'Neal - still haven't seen Barry Lyndon - because many of them, but not all, have been destroyed by me for his existence. The only shortage is What Up, Doc? McGraw and O'Neal tend to touch their line, instead of making them. <br /> <br /> This movie is known for the beginning of one good work: it was the first movie of Tommy Lee Jones.
