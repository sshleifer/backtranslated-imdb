What's a lovely movie. <br /> <br /> We will not give a lot of time to comment about it. I will still try to return two hours I lost. <br /> <br /> I just want to leave with - Shaq does not have BUSINESS to be an actor or singer. He is completely without talent in both discounts. It is a disgrace that most talented people lose on social movies and karaoke bars when Shaq uses his name as a basketball player for not being sent to the movies and cutting the CD. The greatest defeat for this movie was a non-enthusiastic talent which is Shaq.
