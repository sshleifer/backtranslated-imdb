Raymond Burr as a prosecutor found in the murder of his best friend (Dick Foran) because of his love for his friend's wife (Angela Lansbury). This was a whole year before starting to make Perry Mason, so the movie could have a special interest for his fans if it was the inspiration of his throw. <br /> <br /> Nothing else here is interesting though. Lansbury is always good, but his behavior here is one direction and the intentions of his crime in secret are quite obvious. There is an interesting performance by Lamont Johnson as a painter who also likes and "fatale women", but the character of Burr is straightforward straight. It is incredible to see actor as Burr performs romantic events with Lansbury, and his abolition is not the same as his character here as much as in many movies I have seen. There is no secret in fact, and all doubts should be close to the title of the film and the way that Burr's behavior introduces Lansbury's character to involve himself (double risk prevents again being tested for earlier, perhaps). He does so with the so-called recorder that he does not know when he enters the room I think. Just a few moments of fun that you don't feel and really something has been done on TV.
