I liked to believe in this film after the only kind of common comedy this country recognizes is a slapstick and stereotypes. <br /> <br /> Of course, it went quite another way - let's be cool and edgy - and out on the other side with a bit of display to it. I beta one small seed went to nuts for this. I know SL made. <br /> <br /> No main characters have comedic chops to remove it. Even Danny K had a good time. I am really bad. Every time they started a little character I kept thinking, "Darn, this person must be a leader!" Independent does not mean that the camera function needs to be bad. Black and white did nothing for this film - in fact the flat talks have hurt this more by bringing boredom to a strong aid. Black and white also did not crisp. Composition was awesome. Music use was awesome. Amazingly I was looking at Little Miss Sunshine after this film and the structure on it was very good - maybe that's why the shortage of this movie is locked out to my mind. I think Corne (who was funnier than it leads before even saying anything) was talking to this film and not David - see and you will understand. I bet bet guys who prepare Oppikoppi were worried. Someone would think nothing happens right there. I got a feeling that could be hit on someone else's garden. I know ordinary boys who have a lot of funnier, raunchier and beauty talks than any of these "comics". Those who blew and last were the same. <br /> <br /> I think comedy SA will continue to stay in a long stone stone. Workers good work.
