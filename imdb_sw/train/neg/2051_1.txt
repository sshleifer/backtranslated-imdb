If there was no fault and acting etc etc. to write to that part is far from this series of series or no phantom. It was a loss of 42 minutes to see a woman of the martian woman. You know that in the middle of the 6th series no matter what happens is not really going on and it certainly brings something to a series of narratives unless you meet martian hunters again and lose 30 minutes to do so is for another case of bad writing in opogovilleville soap opera. I have been very interested in displaying but especially because of 3 or positive events every year but who has ever been in the used text or used for soap is required to be cans. This was one of the worst. For the first 4 minutes you know that what is going on is an option and whatever happens is a dream based on Clark's clarity caused by the behavior of the phantom area and when he will wake up to win and blah blah blah so the writers do not necessarily create a villain that will continue the line of any story this week. May has also added another villain to die in the last part of the young man who was present and has made a jump again or come back and tell Clark forgot his glasses to appear as close as in this period and call it a day.
