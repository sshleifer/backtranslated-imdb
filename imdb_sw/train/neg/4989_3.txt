Les Visiteurs, the first movie about the time travelers of the time was real. I love Jean Reno as an actor, but there was more. There was an unexpected prospect, a funny and unmistakable course, which might remind you of the little of Louis de Funes. Now this sequel has the same characters, the same actors in a large and equal place during travel. The program is slightly exchanged, since the current characters should be temporary migrants. So they jump up and down in history, without paying attention to the fact that it continues to get absurd as you advance in the movie. Duke, Jean Reno, tries to put something together with his play, but his behavior has been removed, so there is nothing he can do to save the film. It is now a slave of charity / assistant, he is very careful. The movie is just about it and have its clumsy / annoying / stupid or whatever you had to be. The truth is; This behavior tries to produce laughter from the audience, but not succeeded. It's like someone who tells you a bad soup, you know already, but he insists telling jokes to the end, adding details, making your pain long. <br /> <br /> If you liked Les Visiteurs, don't lose your taste in your mouth and pocket. If you didn't like Les Visiteurs, you can't imagine a good look. If you liked this follower ... well, I think you still need to see more movies.
