Acting is good, women are good, and men are good, so if you are looking for a well-supported porn, this film is for you. Otherwise, you waste your time. Inspiration of the main characters, especially the eponymous leadership, is often hidden. He could only tell the truth - the truth shown on the film, not necessarily historical facts - and his girlfriend would have been kept in prison for the rape he did not. What? Was he protecting his father, who left half of the forced, as it was, when he opposed the ugly hatred? He was defending himself, and his sudden reputation of anxiety when only his art seemed to be a matter? During the trial, this very powerful woman returns to the fungus before us. On the contrary, his girlfriend, who starts as a jerk of narcissistic, becomes a hero of self-experiment. At least its motivation is clear: he offers himself for love. Usually, since no action must go without punishment, we are told that he has not seen him again.
