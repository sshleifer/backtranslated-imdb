If you have ever seen a film by Brian Avenet-Bradley and compared to the problems that you find on IMDb, you know that many comments and votes are being made. SEE ME: you will be bored! Production team members write their own comments (sometimes they accept it). But that's not enough: Also click on "no" at any time any negative comments on the film. That is why negative critics are always placed behind those involved. <br /> <br /> Movie itself is bad, bad, bad: bad act, bad lighting, bad script, bad end. Believe now! If not, you will believe me later! Brian Avenet-Bradley can be a good business person. Otherwise it cannot explain that it gets people who still fund its movies. (OK, it's cheap, but nevertheless.) But as a creative person, he is a complete failure.
