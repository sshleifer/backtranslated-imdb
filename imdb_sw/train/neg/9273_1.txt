The first question of mind after looking at this waste is on earth who gave those writers the right to use the name Omen on this film? It's a shambolic, embarrassing, horrible exemption to the franchise of Omen. When the film begins to support the music it looks like it is straightened from the Cartoon of Bugs Bunny and from that time the film becomes worse! I don't know who wrote the script but i bet got E - them when they took again to show their teacher! It is hard after a while to tell him if this is a comedy because what is happening is amazing and so is true for the original Omen who asks for faith. Acting is laughable, especially from Faye Grant woman who led. he keeps connecting the faces of pride or hard to find vinegar? It's hard to tell. The worst part I have ever had is unfortunate to witness. 1 out of 10.
