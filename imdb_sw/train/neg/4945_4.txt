Indeed, this is not a true blockbuster, nor does it matter that position. "Dieter" is the first name of a famous German musician, who is loved or hated for its kind of action and that exactly exactly why this film is about. It depends on the biography "Dieter Bohlen" wrote a few years ago but it does not mean to be correct on that. The movie is filled with some of the content of romantic hate (at least at the US level) which is either interesting (not for other characters) of course or a silent-dependent type of humor or you are "Bohlen" -Fan or not . Say technically there are many refuses. Speaking to me I see this movie being movie-ok.
