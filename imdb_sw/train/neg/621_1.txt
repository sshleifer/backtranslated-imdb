Holy @ #% & this movie was still warm and juicy from the squad made by. I tried to look at this piece of waste but I found it easy to freeze my chairs and slug behind the Lysol shooter on the clean floor than to endure more than half of the crap on my screen. I put this down under anything I watched on a film or TV, and that says something. I was witnessing a cow on the farm. I watched a bunch of run for an hour and a half, who knows ... it may have moved to something or something. That was the best time spent on this. Acting was not there, the plot was elsewhere except this film. I think I saw a refusal to appear earlier where the farm had managed to escape and was going back to the old truck towards Portland in the hope of being Steven King Shi77er. Please tell me the director gets the most needed medicine. It is very clear he needs a heavy medicine and I would like in front of the money needed to turn it into a lobotomy. Bah ... I can't give this complete review of the punch it needs because there is no painful thing can be done right in the word that is set up alone. Let me just say that if you are looking for a flick of time and you will see Chilton on the rack, visit your car, start the engine, then delete all your profiles directly into the fan until you can't feel your bones again. Make sure you have your wallet in hand and because you want to lose any money. You can also have the opportunity to destroy it yourself. On the way, I watched this after my "friend" sent his girlfriend over so I could see. He appeared to come, and had it too. What's wrong is that he had to look at this $% & @ something TWICE! I heard their marriage now and gets to visit their balls once a month. I hope it was because of this film.
