The main theme in this movie seems to be mixed, as a connection, environment, environment and social status all causes the same place: confusion. Even Harvey Keitel seems to have come out of his element, and they do not have an improper interpretation of his, the direction and power. To do worse, his name is 'Che', and we are just told (directly, by the author) well in the film that he is not 'that' Che, the only person named Che. Family relationships are still unknown until the end of the film, and once defined, the family is divided - a young generation to go to America. So clich√©. Other reviews discuss how the movie shows the impact of the revolution on the boy's family; however the political position of the director is even worse, and we do not know who is really responsible for the blood. So they lost their property (acquired by gambling benefits) - why? Refusing to take a political position, when making a film about the Cuban revolution, is an unusual and fearful choice. Not to mention the movie was in English! Why do these Cubans speak English? Not surprisingly, they did not receive a film permit in Cuba. And if the family life is very important to watch here, it would be good if we could find out who it is - we 'brought' to them all at the beginning - a way down to make open relationships in the film! The acting was deep, tall, and unreliable, the time was around. The 'special' effects that were seen were mixed and combining. References to American films - a black character as a Greek chorus - strictly freeous, intellectual ostentatious, and constantly out of place. I just looked at the whole movie because I was waiting for transparency, or explaining it all. Never happened.
