Being a fan of silent movies, I expected to see this photo for the first time. I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> As described, the film appears to be long, long, commercial for Maxwell cars. Maybe if the tracking area was about half of the length, I might be enjoying more films. But it was too old. And when I realize that it is actually stretched often in the film, without reducing the fun of the viewer, what was it and the Mexican fake? I mean, they drive a car through the mountains, a car that has a lot of time moving about one kilometer per hour, but they can't do it?
