Watching Tenants has been an interesting experience for me. It is the first film I have seen where I have been running for the stage (non) - and usually I can look at anything from the actors of the actors of Serbo-Croat indie and find it interesting. <br /> <br /> Passengers are worried and lazy. One of the major problems of the script is that there is a real-life dialogue, apart from the pieces of the set where the characters 'join' in a very good environment (to do this work, the film needs to feel more concepts, which did not do). This leads to a lack of real development of behavior; everyone looks two-dimensional. The worst for this is the behavior of Bill Spear, aka Snoop Dogg. I saw her irreverent and irresponsible behavior. At one time, I even left the film because I was very angry with the provision of violence, violence and instinct behavior, lack of any other layer of stability away from that of the "top" switch (which is identified later ) and I so longed to have some features of redemption. However, one reason for this jar can be during the nebula of the film (which you think 70 years, feels and looks more than earlier). If it is locked more securely in 70 years, its behavior may seem to be more understandable. <br /> <br /> Film lamp was also stable. All the way through, the experimental voice tries to give a certain impression, the condition of the jazz inserted which has never come, because because it is set properly. <br /> <br /> Tenants, to me, is an unreliable film. It does not show true people or suggest any interesting way of thinking about color, identity or the life of the author, whether white or black. Surprisingly, I came with the feeling that this project needed David Lynch; His observation and look and feel you could lift all actors and script in a very strange thing.
