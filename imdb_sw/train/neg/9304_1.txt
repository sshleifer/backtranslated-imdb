I have seen many stupid movies in my life, a lot, but this of course is quite bad! I often love dancing movies, if it's some entertainment, but I can't even think of one good thing about this movie. I love the "youth sorcerer" for Heaven. But S.I.C.K. it has a horrible act, the blind music of the blind in all things, and even the sex scenes are being pursued! I would like to compare the lameness of this movie with the loved of "Twin Dragons", "Puppet Master vs Demonic Toys" or even "Brady Sequel very much". Although, this is very bad then any of it. I beg you, don't waste your time. Believe me, 2 hours you will never come back.
