Being a fan of Billy Bob Thornton, and his diversity of knowledge, I saw this movie listed, and I was surprised I had never heard of it. I walked more than usual during both the period was published in 2000, and when you got to the cinema more than 2-1 / 2 years later (the first passage is the first clue was not good and productive ). Swayze can't act with apples, but Thornton has more potential for the difference between them. And Charlize Theron is a person who would be pleased to see, even if it showed him to look at the color. <br /> <br /> Have a sense, I evaluated the production details of this site. It made $ 600 for each weekend of its opening, and over $ 400 each, after the month of his month running at the end of 2002. The total amount was $ 261K, which I would like to have a staff hotel and food for week location. The story is very good, and even the use of the most common Reno area is as light as the rest is. It is something like several SNL Bits are connected together, no one too much, and the overall presentation is worse. However, the cost of this production was a lot - even if all worked under their usual fees - so one thing that made that opus difficult to endure was the quality of the movie and now Billy Bob (although understood laconic) The amount here, compared to his normal work. <br /> <br /> Think about a superb superb, a completely different spelling he showed in "Sling Blade," "Bandits" and "Bad Santa," and you know he realized this s under the standard, long before the audience had the opportunity to prove this. One star for it, even here, and one because the production was better than, say, the size of "Lifetime" spinning.
