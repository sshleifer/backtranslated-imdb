This film is bad. Screenplay is bad, it's a mediocre script, and even sex scenes are free. The excitement and preference of the original film does not exist. This film was shot in the shade, shade and monochromatic style (of "World War"), which is so desperate after the beauty of the original film. The brooding behavior of Greg Morrise shows a direct expression on the film. Loss and turn of a natural plot is sadly missing here; The few who exist are only romantic. The only view is the performance of Sharon Stone as Catherine Tramell, honestly went on in this line, but it is not enough to make other limitations. The only situation in which "Institute of Basic 3" should be made will be like Michael Douglas agrees to join and cast.
