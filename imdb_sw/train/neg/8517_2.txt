The main secret of Veronica Mars is not the one that he had to deal with the screen. Instead, the secret is why this long-lasting desire is still on the air. This week showed the nadir of Veronica Mars: has put 146 out of 146 shows in the big 6 (soon to be Big 5). Yes, you read the same. Veronica Mars was hit by every WB's current-defunct show and every show on UPN. It was hit by all the exhibitions on Fox and in fact for all exhibitions on ABC, CBS and NBC. Now, the hip hypesters will say: but this was to run again. But everything on the TV that week was very good to run again! It fills the ideas of why CW would choose this desire for verification if one of the few shows that it has been saved from UPN. Something is going on behind the events. Dear friends and partners. <br /> <br /> Sorry to be so proud, but what are the other details? The "Veronica line" has been defined now that you have had two years of identification and did not. It is probably the influence of Joel Silver and connecting, but in fact, I have lost why anyone can use their facilities on a bad display which no audience is watching. <br /> <br /> Great secret with a very good start of CW.
