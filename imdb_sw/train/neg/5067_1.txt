It's very simple. Friends are the comedy of the most basic humor to young and young adults, with an unusual sense of humor. It is also very clear that towards the end, they tried very much to make the last 10th season, so they could say they beat the season of Seinfeld's 9th. amazing and beautiful text, friends had (and I'm being generous here) for the 5 or 6 season of Accurate and then summer season 4. the behavior that was not so good started with, then it became worse when you saw it. I find it difficult to understand why people measure this much. In fact it is bad.
