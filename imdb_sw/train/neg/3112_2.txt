I would like to start by saying I will try not to put many destroyers in this. I usually enjoy Robin Williams movies, however, this gem was not one of them. It was done as a thriller of suspenseful. The night listener was nothing but. Be clear that there were 6 people on the opening day of games, 2 went out, for good reason. The movie was in my opinion wrongly written and directed. Acting was good but no nothing to work with. The movie is about a journalist who reads a good book with a dead child. However * enter the spooky here * no one can prove there are children. So Williams goes to Wisconsin to try and find the author, however all he finds is the headache and excuse from the guardian of the boys. There it is, that's all. You're waiting around an hour and a half with the movie approaching. It was a lot of fun and such a visit to the dental office. The secrets of homosexuality, or overtones had nothing to do with the story, and the movie had little dirt but it seemed to be healed there for quite a reason and not meaning. In the end I could not write a good review on this film because it had nothing, it was appealing as looking at a dry color. I paid 2 because the reason why it was worth was good and was not led by Uwe Boll.
