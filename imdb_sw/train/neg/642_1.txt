First of all, if you're a fan of comic, well, you will be very disappointed I am sure! Minimum budget! Largo is supposed to be Serbian in the comic, now suddenly becomes the disciples, pfff! The poultry producers, gave the spice and stuck to the comic (By the way, in the film, his father speaks Serbian and speaks to the faithful ... Lol). The N.Y winning building. Winch becomes a common size-small yacht in H.K. A good view of Largo is a non-Tzigan / Turkish person who looks at him. Freddy attempt to cool 'scarface' becomes fat, out of shape, sad, average boy. Simon, a good friend of Largo, is never there! She gave him pepper! Largo doesn't lose us completely, but only snake snakes ... The whole story is confused and looks like an independent television film. The directors and manufacturers of French, if you have no money, ability or technology to deal with comic accuracy, please stick to a particular romance beaten in Paris. Very bad movies, something good I just rented, don't have a count on looking at the shape (if any!).
