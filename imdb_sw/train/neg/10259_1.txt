I saw this movie in the theater when I was a child and always remember as my first experience and cut off the bad movie and good business. Business was good, but I found later that it had any explosion or 'special effects' in the entire movie (about 4) and even some that were not in the film. There was some kind of plot related to visitors but visitors have never been shown in the movie even if I remember. It was obvious the case of a man doing a buck off with a cheap film planned for people scandal. I think my world of crime has been completed that day, when I discovered there are bad people out there doing bad movies.
