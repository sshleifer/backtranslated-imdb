Twenty years ago, a five-year-old boy Michael Hawthorne witnessed his father killing his mother with copper on the bare road and suicide later. In the present days, Michael (Gordon Currie) invites his girlfriend Peg (Stacy Grant) and his best friends Chris (Myc Agnew), Jennifer (Emmanuelle Vaugier), Lisa Ann (Kelly Benson), Ned (Brendon Beiser), Mitch Maldive ( Phillip Rhys and Trish (Rachel Hayward) using Halloween in the country with his grandfather and grandfather in their field. She asks her friends to wear a dress that will represent their deepest fears, and with her Indian Crow (Byron Great Moon), they would make an ancient Indian ceremony with a wooden dummy covered by Morty (Jon Fedele) that would remove their fears forever. Michael's great fear is to be a common killer like his father, but something goes wrong with Morty returns to be his father, killing his friends. <br /> <br /> "Fear: Resurrection" is a desperate and sad movie that uses a fascinating concept of overcoming the fears of each friend before they grow up, but in a full screenplay of clich√©s. There are some widespread displays, such as Mrs Betsy Palmer; others very weak, but generally acting is good. Unfortunately there is no explanation why dummy brings live; more, despite being around close friends, the group doesn't feel pain or sadness when each of them dies. The lowest of fifty minutes would have been built to create the best conditions. At the end of the term, Michael shows the charm that his father had intended that I have not seen the story. I don't know if the previous reference was converted to a DVD released in Brazil and for a period of 87 minutes. Special effects are very wise for the B. B. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Fear 2: Uma Noite de Halloween" ("Fear 2: One Night of Halloween")
