Please do not like me but I must be honest, watching this film, I was so happy, <br /> <br /> It's Movie and Swimming Songs and Skull! <br /> <br /> Unwanted Songs !!! Mehbooba ... The Great Shock for Holi's First .... well .. it was ok! due to every traditional Movie had one! Chad Raha alive Nasha Anything ... Very Foolish Song Song Jee Le ... Strike Song Song Playboy Foolish ... <br /> <br /> Apart from Songs. Modern was right That was the Adaptation of Ram Gopal Verma's Own ... If you think like that you would like this film <br /> <br /> Well this film alone depends on the viewer and on his judgment if he thinks this movie is a total Copy. / he could beat his head in the cinema or if he thinks of directors himself to see he would deserve to watch this movie. I looked at both ways I would like to acknowledge and hurt Ram Gopal for the disaster that he had done. Amitabh Bachchan As Babban / Gabbar (Amitabh in His Movie Production) Writer Original / Original (Bobby Deol Can Be Better) Prashant Raj As Raj / Jai (Abhishek meant this role in spite of a special appearance of the song Mehbooba) Sushmita Sen As Radha / Durga (Jaya Bachchan was Right Tabu had the right for this role) Nisha Kothari As Ghungroo / Basanti (I think Es Ha Deol would be a great) Mohanlal As Narishma / Thakur (Mohanlal Is very good ... Oops Sorry hehehehe, He was right I couldn't think about anyone) <br /> <br /> Movie could be even FAIRED a Lttle if Cast was right <br /> <br /> The movie wasn't exciting, the film was right, Only by looking at <br /> <br /> Overall Know-how! Scripting ... 5/10 Important in Movie, it would be better, Easy on Ear on playing in PC and IPod Cast ... 10/10 <br /> <br /> <br />
