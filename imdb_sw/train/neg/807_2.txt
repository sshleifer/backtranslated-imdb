I did not expect too much from this television film. You set the bar down than you would like to midget the midget for any TBS image from Antonio Sabato Jr. However, it has been devastated, even failed to become a bad film. Every area was rote, like someone who rejected and photographed from several movies and television shows related to big business conspiracy on the script, defending back and said, "My work has been done". It is all the same, all that is predictable, and, even worse, executives are obliged to consider it, (even when conspiracy development is disturbed). <br /> <br /> What! See "X-Files" if you have a paranoia status. They handle well. Also, let anyone know that staying through a "Dangerous Error" is just that.
