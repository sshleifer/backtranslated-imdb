Eddie Murphy's "Delirious" is completely and bad, completely, crass and lude completely. That's the only way to describe a horrible piece, a sting blow. Eddie Murphy goes to the value of shock rather than laughing to try and win his following. He may have a frequent frequency, but especially loses a conspiracy with profanity and joke jokes. <br /> <br /> Forget it! Unless you happen to enjoy the bad style of Eddie. I don't think I will bother with "Eddie Murphy Raw". I love so much Eddie in the script button of the film. Saturday, January 17, 1998 - Video
