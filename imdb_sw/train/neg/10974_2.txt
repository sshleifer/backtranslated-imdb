I am Ireland and I have been living in Denmark for a short time so I expected to go home last week so I could see Entry. And I will go to the record saying: </> <br /> THIS TIME. It's not too bad something like "The Best Person in Ireland" but it is definitely not standing there with other Irish films such as Submission, I went Low or Michael Collins. Some locations of the film are quite realistic, such as Colm Meaneys of American style. But the film itself is completely beaten. From around the camera to the regular entry, zoom-out tries to give a film to look like it was an animation festival. But not so. This is Lock Lock, Stock and Two Barbels Barrels and should be beaten like this. It should have a smooth movement from one shot to the next. The film seems appropriate and thrown together. <br /> <br /> Exhibitions are the same, due to bad script. My friend said to me as it was to follow Colin Farrell near Dublin for a week. He gives an honorary exhibition as the Dirtbag of Dublin, but there is no way to compare it with his exhibition in the Minority, Tigerland or Phone Booth. The best performance was from Dierdre O'Kane who plays a middle-aged woman who has been dumped by her husband's bank manager for a young woman. I think he should leave and stop his god and focus more on his acting. All in all, it does not have any way to live according to the expectations set by the Irish media or deserve to be even considered to be one of the best Irish films ever. I look forward to a decline of comments from this opinion because many people I have told you said it was good. But before answering, ask yourself: Will you think so much of this film if it is installed in the UK or America?
