This scenario is about a victim of a female rapist / comic book from New York who decides to stop away from all of the big city's evils and move to the dirt, run a small town where it finds refuge in a single trailer around the 12th and anywhere. People of cities are mentally ill, but it is also by inviting mad people in its trailer. Surprise is the fact that he has the ability to do something quite right to put himself in a dangerous situation after a dangerous situation. DB Sweeney's performance was the best secondary school. She is one of the small kinda-cute actors with sweet grin. Unfortunately the work has not been of type and the nature of the mother has been similar in tow. For the previous advertiser said that acting was "so real", well agree. The truth was not alive. The two main characters really are concerned, weak and unable to make mature, healthy decisions. In short, this film takes like no other, leasing to laugh. The real crime scene? The most violent woods in the trailer - enough to make ME do murder. And finally, he is an artist / writer, so he could not afford a double trailer with something else Chevy Chevette yellow-sun for the love of God!
