This movie has beautiful surroundings. Unfortunately it has no plot. To have a plot there must be a crisis. This movie did not have. It took two hours to draw a beautifule area and failed to put any activity in it. Photo attempts are artistic but cannot pay attention to the basics of telling stories. If you like the picture of Montana and flying fishing you will find some value in this film does not expect stories. No one.
