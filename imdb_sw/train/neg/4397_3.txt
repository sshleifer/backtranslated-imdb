One of my friends friends gave me this match, and also very difficult! It carries the appearance of the children's game, but you should learn how to make tons of complicated steps that need to combine and turn your hands into all kinds of unfamiliar spaces, and you should look for non-endless levels for 100 details, to improve ' 'your! You should also find these hidden jigsaw puzzle pieces, which require you to do the impossible job to get them! AND I am on three steps !!!!! Maybe if you don't have no life can stay at home all the time you can get comfortably out of this, but otherwise keep! AND DOES NOT WORK FOR KIDS - YOU WANT TO WORK IN HOUR!
