The sun was not shining, it was too rainy to play, so I walked on the film, cool, cool, when it rained. <br /> <br /> "Pati in Hat" was a flick name, and when it passed, my stomach had become ill. Mike Myers played Cat, his humor was disabled, and children do not need to see this, the smell was not bad. <br /> The film was like drinking milk, from a strong cow, so it's fun fun, but film artists didn't know how. <br /> <br /> This video is briefly angry. Acting was bad, the plot was very closed, and humor was very surprising. <br /> <br /> Start with Conrad and Sally, the breaker of the rule and sheriff of the future. Their mother should go to work, gets Mrs. Kwan to be a child. It is possible that the only part of the film in the movie is when Mrs. Kwan looks at the court room in Taiwan, 'La C-SPAN. She recently slept, and here comes Cat. <br /> <br /> Movies begin to break out without control. Cat came to try to let the kids have fun. He has Thing 1 and Thing 2, who suddenly begins to destroy the house. It reduces TV Infomercial, and fragments of its crash tail off. And Cat sits on Carmen Miranda, it's not funny. It is possible that his hiding is just like a hippie activist. And there is a fish who tries to warn children about Kaka. Too bad did not warn us this film was just as much fun like sour milk, or to tail your tail. <br /> <br>> Soon your children are out looking for a family dog, who has the key to the string in her kola. If the string is not recently closed, their home will be home to the Cat world. Here gets a little more interesting, but not enough to save the film. <br /> <br /> Acting, in general, is awesome. Mike Meyers brings his brand of Austin's deception of Humor to the Cat, saying things like "You are hooking up" and assuming yourself as a woman for all his life after entering the pieces while being like a pinata. Spencer Breslin is as good as Conrad's trouble, and Dakota Fanning is as good as Sally, though alone is not enough to save this awesome dissection of Aortic waiting to kill John Ritter (accidentally waiting to happen). Alec Baldwin and the lawyer Lawrence Quinn are disgusting, tempting the mother of the mother, who plays with Kelly Preston. And Sean Hayes is Mr. Humberfloob, the mother of the mother, and also the sound of the fish. The last three are also bland. Overall, if I was a parent I would not take my children who are in a potty humor, because there is a lot and more. Save your $ 7.00 and see something else. As at the end of Dr. Dr Seuss once said, <br /> <br /> It is a pleasure to enjoy, But you know how. True, Universal, stand up! Theodore has already turned into his grave. <br /> <br /> As my mother always says, "Curiousity killed Cat" .- Cat in Hat * out of *****
