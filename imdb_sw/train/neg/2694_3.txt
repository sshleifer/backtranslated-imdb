Warning: It has violated. If the movie starts and the sex area then it's a bad movie. (see example 300). This proves Lemma above. The second part makes the turning point for all stages. The fact that we know the end makes the movie happen. Further, other plots have been revealed as the story comes back and forth. And this made more confusion. To cover the lack of waiting for that reason, we learn more and more about how inequalities are. And yes, they have lots of display. Andy (P.Hohffman), for example, is an addict of drugs, more?, He is cheating his wife, more?, He plans to steal his father, more?, His wife is cheating with his brother, more? he does I feel his victory for the death of his mother, more?, he is a common killer, more? etc. etc. is not enough space to write here ... I wonder how she can have a high job. And why did his wife not leave him? On the other hand I enjoy a lot of Hoffman's performances. Even here PSH takes what was left out of my $ 7 spent for this ignorance. Why feeling? Because it does not mean, why should I take care of the despondent characters? Another broken lemma is that the film should have a tender attitude (at least good). It is also a lot of emotions, for example we should take care of the widow's suffering without knowing anything about parents before the crime.
