Although the book was not quite accurate and the reality it described was still meant by Japan. I find it hard to believe that anyone involved in the film had ever been a Japanese if he did not feel Japanese for a bit. Almost everything about it was terrible. I will admit that ordinary actors were good but they could not improve the saving space. Before the film started I was surprised that there were only ten people in the movie on Friday night after the movie opened in Japan. For 30 minutes I was surprised and sat. I stayed so I would have the right to refuse it. The whole movie reduced my inquiry and prohibited laughing from unbelief from my Japanese partner. Everybody I saw walking out of the movie was seen as a mixture and ambition on their faces. <br /> <br /> For the creators of this film, you give me two hours.
