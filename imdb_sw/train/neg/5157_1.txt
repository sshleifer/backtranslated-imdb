I despised this film when I was 6 or 7 years old as I was a big fan of Robin Williams and nothing he could do was bad. To this. This full garbage has attacked Robin for a long time. I have recently relieved with its wonderful but great part in the days of the father but then he continued to create another mistake, Bicenntinial Man I think was called but the point is. Robin should get the best job at the moment and now he returns to make a slide that happened to this 'classic'.
