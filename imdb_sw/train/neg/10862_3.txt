I looked like 8 or 9 movies of Herzog and none of them had any effect on me. I looked at several documents about him. It is indeed a smart person, with a great understanding of film and passion to make them, but this makes it a good director. Certainly no! Full protection of talent. Can make a good document because of the features mentioned earlier, but the film and actors? never! He / she can't lead or write. His performances are full of bad conditions, and many situations / discussions in his movies are infants and badly done that he cannot hide behind the word "art" in any sense. No. Do not mention the infinite direction and beauty, so it is like amateur-like. Say that he wants to lead such as and write such a crap that's false. <br /> <br /> As the area when Scheitz gets arrested and Storszek hides behind the shop. Who says? He / she is a pastor; he knows what the scholars and fake critics want. He knows what he needs to put in the script so you can watch and not lose. Listen to the direction of the script and the web. Just look at Julio Medem. If Herzog can make a film like Medem can, then I can look at his old movies and try to find talent in them.
