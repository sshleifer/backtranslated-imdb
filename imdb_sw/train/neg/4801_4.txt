I liked to love this film. It has a good prison environment, conspiracy theory, bloody zombies, touch-touch for 80s and it is an attempt by an actor John Saxon, who also has a bad (you think) bad man. It reminds me of some of the people (Italian) who are scared of horror. But the direction is very timber and no time of night / awesome there. Just goes on and on, and then (in logic) has an end. Waiting more and more permanent pictures and its fate if the tribe of worship would have been closed.
