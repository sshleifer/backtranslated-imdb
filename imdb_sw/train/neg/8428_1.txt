Despite a wonderful and high review, this is a bad movie. Sadly, that l feel responsible to warn you how bad. The video is installed in the last period of Raj, during the Indian war for independence. What follows in the ignorance plan fills me with unbelief. The characters are doing and how they do just do not influence me that characters exist at the time. For example, does a Hindu little girl from a village home from the village village have a relationship with her married Englishman, knowing well that the discovery of it will probably mean social crime and shame if not the death penalty? It is impossible, but still perhaps. However, does the Hindu's house, in the conservative Indian society of the time, continue as half of Britney Spears's nakedness in the heat, goes out into the outdoor sex during the day in a clear view where they can be discovered at any time? That's not just an impossible blood, that's a plot of a lost plan. These videos have been linked to a bad act, expelled me from the movie for an hour on the film, so I did not watch the second half of the film. One can only hope the end is more intelligent than what I saw in the first half.
