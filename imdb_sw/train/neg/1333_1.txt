I was shocked by this film. I had read some of the other reviews here and I had great expectations. I anticipated the drama and positive development of character. But that never happens in the film. Daniel-Day Lewis is a good actor, but it's not good if other recipients here will believe us. I touch it repeated the same set of 4 or 5 movements in the movie. I would like to rate its 6 out of 10. <br /> Make: 6 out of 10 is 5 out of 10. 70. on the film. Best movies out than this ...
