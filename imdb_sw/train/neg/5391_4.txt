I hate the end of the world movies. They show what the Hollywood people think about the rest of the world, and they think that we are a group of idiots of sadistic (or at least that look at the sadistic idiots touched by things are somehow entertainment). I have been L.A. often, I have a family that works in the show business, and I just want to say that these are the last people * we should look for a real look. Some disaster videos at least draw a clever picture: Men's Men, Monkezi 12, but usually the message is "only people will do anything to live, both dark and sad and worthless, we have to see ourselves" The idea of ​​a story that examines us to give us a system of social order and measure people with a face of fear, and I believe some people will do if this film is shown, but the sad idiots aside, I certainly doubt the community could erase everyone themselves, that's just insulting .
