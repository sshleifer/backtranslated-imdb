This is probably the best awesome movie made since Ed Wood's death. I can't destroy the end, because I don't know exactly what happened. I'll try the best for me, though. There are some types of lesbian vampires, but they continue to plug the bodies, so any character can or may be a character that you should think is, or may be a lesbian vampire. Confusion sound? It's not as mixed as you can think, since no characters makes any sense start. No plot, no development of character, and random people are shown, say a few lines, then disappear, never heard again. There are also zombies, which are * probably * enemies of vampires, but there is also a kind of dream-in-the-dream in a psychiatric hospital, so maybe nothing this happened, and it's all hallucination of the main character. <br /> <br /> Side? The two leading girls take their shirts briefly. The only side effects are intellectual-minded (I have loved a very fast, unusual). Everyone has a Christian sense of deception, which increases the overall level of hilarity. <br /> <br /> These price rental values. We laughed we cried.
