The Dead of the Living Dead and all these movies are guided to look like they encountered together and displayed this with their friends who have one talented afternoon when they were bored (lines are completely unrehearsed and does not know). I find that 95% and 90% of video movies at home are better than this film (although the similarity between them gives them a comparison). "Hey lets see if anyone is dumb enough to buy our movies!" We expect no one who did not. I apologize to those involved in the flic as these comments are complicated but I am dope who studied your fake reviews and purchased the movie.
