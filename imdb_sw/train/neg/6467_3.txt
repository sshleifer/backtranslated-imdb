I still can't believe this film. They have a lot of distrust in him, that it is hard to believe anyone wants to do it. <br /> <br /> The story is a dragon, but in the sense of being funny, but more like no story at all. What? You can combine comedy slapstick with trains theft, movie prison, city conspiracy, sex jokes and FBI agent? You can't. Besides the horror that points to the most visible thing is the actors. I watched this film and thought: 'Is this Marlon Brando really? No, it can't. (5 minutes later) Is this Charlie Sheen? Wow, Maybe Brando is true. (5 minutes later) You can't be Donald Sutherland. (5 minutes later) No, not Mira Sorvino. This movie is very bad for all. (At the end). No, no, no, this can't be absolutely Martin Sheen !!! Not for 10 seconds of the movie. Then it was up with me down with my nerves. SO many good, oscar-winning, usually actors influence in stupid, dumb, bad movie. I rarely wanted to know how much they came to do in this. They could not earn a lot of money. <br /> <br /> It is just an unreliable movie of silly idiotic. 3/4
