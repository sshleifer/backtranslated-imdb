If not "Oh So Gourgous," Natassia Malthe, this B - movie would not be worth one part of my Tivo disk space! In the lowest rent, the warehouse of the rear store was considered a port portable? "Keep People!" It is the basic principle in the actual film making! The night is a port of charge of the day and night (night and day at the space station?) Warehouse! People Please! The only thing I would like this film for, is a wardrobe dept. to continue, put Natassia in those tight chapters to open the dress! Even women who saw this bomb had to be aware of the costumes that they actually spent some time entering, every day of photography! Sci-fi channel would be better off displaying SpaceBalls! At least there would be real humor in looking at something that is impossible. <br /> <br /> P.S. Michael Ironside, please Fire Fire Your Agent ASAP! You are very good for the actor, even associated with this level of texting.
