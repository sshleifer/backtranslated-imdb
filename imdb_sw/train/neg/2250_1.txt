Rock Star John Norman Howard (Kris Kristofferson) returns to the singer singer Esther Hoffman (Barbra Streisand) in the song of a once-off star. Esther's star comes from John's departure, from drugs and alcohol. After two hours, John does anything that is damaged-simplified-red-160-MPH-up-on-desert-road. The best thing about this film is music, especially song, "Evergreen." Barbra Streisand sings well, but you can't pick him up as high-and-come stars, when he * already * is a star. The first time she appears, singing in the bar behind the ice, she looks like a solid star that strikes at night, not like a struggling person who tries to launch her singing career. He is very brave, also a professional. His apartment looks like a page from "Apartment to Live," is not a hole-in-wall where the real singer struggles to live. Kris Kristofferson works independently, out of - \ t control the role of the rock star as ... well, as a singer who tries to be an actor but they do not have many talents. The direction is slow, the story is slow and insufficient. But the worst thing about this film is not the act, or the blindness of the blind, or the slow story. It's hair! After looking at the 70 hair of Christ and Streisand bad for 2 hours, your eyes hurt.
