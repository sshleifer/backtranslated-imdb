Between 1937 and 1939, the twentieth century Fox made a ton of the film of Mr. Moto. However, toward the end of the series, it was obvious that the label was "hit shark", to say. These words show that the television show has passed its head and the executives with the payment decided to strengthen the show by changing basically formula. For example, with "Brady Bunch" they created the 'Cousin Oliver' pain and for "Family Relationships" formed a small child who grew up six years in just one season! For hot films, they could fly shark by introducing comic aid because they thought that these mental films are needed again. In the previous film, Warren Hymer played a terrible wrestler. And, in this film character of Archibald Featherstone looks. Feathers can be one of the most exciting examples of comic aid ever, if you continued to send someone (preferably Fire) would only kill him to tie! Although he should work with the famous Yard Yard, he shows all the senses and the acumen of the turnip damaged by the brain. From time to time, its events were modern and not needed and Peter Lorre looked just as bitter as he stood there and watched this "buffoon" this "act". It is so bad that it actually destroys the truth that can be one of the best Fire films because of its clever plot. <br /> <br /> For the plot, the Queen of Sheba's title is discovered in the opening area. Fire, now more than international police than the romantic character he originally, is on the side of protecting valuable products from stolen. By losing power, several thieves try to steal the crown independently. Overall, the film appears but it is also a complete proof that the Fire series should be finished here. For WWII is approaching, films could not last long, however, if the Japanese attitude toward compassion did not want to be accepted in the United States or in other countries.
