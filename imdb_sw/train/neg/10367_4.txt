This movie was well written, not working and unpredictable. It was very low budget and I can understand why it has never been released and go directly to the video. It was not even the fun of the camp, it was just a complete disaster and I would get 1-1 / 2 hours back! The color was rough with a plot that has very large holes in it can drive a mac through them. <br /> <br /> The plot itself had a bride to do things that she did not have the physical ability to do - it's stretch! Skip this movie and look for something better in a kind of fear. Just almost any movie comes to mind that is better than this. <br /> Try this!
