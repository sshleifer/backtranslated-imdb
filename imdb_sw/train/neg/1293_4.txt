I am probably one of the few viewers who did not recommend this film. Think of a strange appearance as all the work of Ang Lee (each chapter still seems to deserve to be published), I was desperate for the film's emerging film. It was too long. The story is set in the era of the Muslim War in Missouri, and it is about a young man (Roedel) who joins Bushwackers, a form of Confederate activists who makes geurilla a fight against Jayhawkers, their allies. He and his close friend, Jack Bull Chiles played with Skeet Ulrich, joining the group after the father of Chile shot-empty and his house burns, perhaps with Jayhawkers. The story follows the adventures of raedel and Chiles and their interactions with other victims of war, including a former slave who fights with Bushwhackers (Daniel Holt played by Jeffery Wright), and a widow of war played by Jewel. It was seen that when every film gave a story to an interesting point, it would turn out to another small place and leave unprotected items. For example, the excitement of the Roedel group caused by the former Holt slave to participate in the reason for the group is briefly demonstrated through the crisis on the legitimacy and protocol, and then dropped to the future in the movie. Villian little / abuser Bushwhacker hates Roedel and is very leading to violence against him, but, we don't know why. Some characters have never seen; I think that's because the movie incorporates many of them as well as taking a large amount of history. <br /> <br /> Historical information was better. I liked to look at houses, furniture, clothes, etc., and I think the lead participants did a good job of making people people, even though they had failed a bit of conversation. Unless you like to enjoy history or it's a great fan of Ang Lee, however, go through this.
