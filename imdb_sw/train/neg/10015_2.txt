The spirit of Dragstrip Hollow is an example of the 1950s in the film of shock. It is not a fear or a fiction movie of science. Plot involves a group of young people who are about to run out of their club's "hot stick" because they can't afford tax. Once you run out, they decide to try the old Haunted house. The only grace to save for the film is that the "spirit" (Paul Blaisdell in the shape of the Creature He) turns out to be the work of the movie movie played by Blaisdell.
