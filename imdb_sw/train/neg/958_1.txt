What? How was this blockbuster? Brother God I do not know where to start this film is very welcome. The movie was predictable & there was no origin. The only thing I can praise is the acting of certain characters. The movie was very bright, they should do something with lights, for example. and make the environment more black. Making up some dead characters made this film look like a flick of fear of 1970. This is 2006! People are not afraid and some people are wearing heavy. Many of the scenarios of fear are being taken from other movie or terrifying movies in Asia. Total disconnect! That is why I don't look at the movies. The only reason many people "screamed" when watching this film is because of similarity. How often do we have to create events from Gonga and make it instead of a girl from the TV, now comes from the second window? It does not matter how you put it, EVERY RIP. If you want a good movie, look at the awesome 50s listed on this site.
