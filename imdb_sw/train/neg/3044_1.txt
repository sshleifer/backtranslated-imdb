This is a kind of fantastic movie, given that Santa Claus lives on a cloud in the outer space and fights against Satan and his witches ... but still has fun. <br /> <br /> It really laughs. even if all were sincerely interested, yet. This movie is not good, but I can say I enjoyed watching it. I would like to recommend this movie on "Santa Claus Winning Martians", "Santa Claus" and Dudley Moore and John Lithgow, or "Santa Clause" by Tim Allen.
