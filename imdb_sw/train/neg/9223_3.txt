From the capitol of nepotol to the world comes another junk flick into a fancy wrapper. "CQ" describes the mess, confused of the story which is a little more than a bunch of silly caricatures, a child, and a direct person Davies runs around trying to flick sci-fi flick. I can't imagine any reason anyone would like to spend time with this ridiculous attempt to make a film. (D)
