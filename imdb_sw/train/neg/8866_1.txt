In theory, 'The Director's opinion' should work. Rob Bryden is a talented player who plays Peter DeLane, former television director describing his experience behind the camera. Among the programs that he claims to have worked are 'Bonanza', 'Flambards', 'Duchess Of Duke Street', and 'The Bounder'. His opinion is not a few knowledge, because of his tendency to walk away. <br /> <br /> But in practice, it failed to fail. It is a joke-show, and joke is not particularly good. These documents are not available at all, and Bryden fails to influence as an old man. Whenever you are hit by anything you like to say, which is like every five seconds, it gives you a laughing screaming. Instead of being charged with DeLane, you want to beat him. If older adults fear you as hilarious, then this is for you. It does not help to be a showcase that was, except for 'Mr & Mrs' and 'Crossroads', instead. For jokes to work, they needed to be afraid like 'Charlie's Angel', 'OTT', 'Telly Addicts', 'Neighbors', and 'New Marketing'. The show tanked big time, so thanks we have avoided the fear of future versions. Is it not surprising if the 'Director's opinion' was one day itself of the spoof?
