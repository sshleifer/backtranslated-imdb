There are a lot of comments already published saying exactly how I felt about this film so that the disease might not be brighter. "Grinch" I thought it was strange - Jim Carrey is a skilled player, physically and also a brave actor (in my opinion). Mike Myers on the other hand finds him laughing for being angry. I was so much loved in his "Waynes World" and "So I married Ax" a day - but I never had an Austin Authority and "Cat In The Hat" is finished. This film was awesome - gags were bad! is not recommended for children not only for adult content but in fact some of them were dated they don't have amused anyone for 50 years! The plan was tense, aggressive, aggressive! It is a shame because children were so few as "Mama". They might have chosen a better villain than Alec Baldwin - but he could remove it if it wasn't for my baders, and turn it on the Cat's point. Does it mean - made myers even view on the script? Was it written one? Some pastors seemed to have one - but Cat seemed just to be winging it! <br /> <br /> On the other hand I would like to mention that sets and props were amazing !!! But unfortunately they can't save this film. <br /> <br /> Weight Dr Seuss - someone was a professional! Do you despise his reputation by changing his work in a lazy, aggressive way! 1/10
