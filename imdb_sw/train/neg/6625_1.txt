this is the first time I write a comment on the film on IMD. but I had to write for this. its 3-hour period of unprecedented suffering. from the beginning u get the idea that the movie is bad. Acting is awesome. I am a great fan of Ajay devgan (loved in bhagat singh) but she is the worst in this movie. amitabh seems to have worked hard for this, but somehow the fear does not exist. prashant raj is a non-actor. and the part of the movie is nisha kothari. I have no clue why the director took him to this film. The back color is repeat. somehow I heard that the rumor tried to repeat the wonder, color color, back color, camera alarm, but it didn't work. SEE NOT SEE IT
