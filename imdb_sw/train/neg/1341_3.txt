Following the success of Gilligan's film Gilligan Island, several television films were made in the 1980s of reunification from classic performances. Most of these movies are missing out on the boat to restore the humor that showed the exclusive displays. REVENGE OF MUNSTERS is among the most ambitious because it goes to the comedy of Laurel and Hardy which was not in the previous series. Yvonne De Carlo, an amazing and important comedienne for the series, is completely lost - has a little time here in this 90-minute movie than he did in any 30 minutes. And since the roles of "Eddie" and "Marilyn" in this film are not more to come, what made them less and less? By rewriting, they could use Butch Patrick and Pat Priest. Although I saw some of the Munsters' spiritual family was a good touch, I did not enjoy Sid Caesar as a hammy scientist especially because there is so much and not enough for the unused Munsters (a very strange thing in 1981, the former Caesar's comedy in comedy) , Imogene Coca, was also thrown against the main part of the film's reunion film. Another incredible phenomenon at the beginning of the film is the Munster family represented as net data in the area of ​​fear of fear. Why would they be there should be "normal" (if it is wonderful) the American family, not the famous monsters? This is the ultimate Munsters project involved in the original responsibility in their roles, there was a great revival of the series in the late 1980s and a completely new movie with the 1990 TV movie that was DeCarlo, Lewis, Priest, and Patrick in the roles. to come to the family food.
