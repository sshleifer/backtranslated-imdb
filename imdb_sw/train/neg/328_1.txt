I am a great fan of Adam Sandler, and one day I was looking at the Cast & Crew selection on one of his DVDs and I saw 'Going' and decided to go with the lease. So I went with a few of my friends and I used it. We put it and we were surprised to see Adam Sandler who had no wages yet, as if he was 12 years old when this movie came out. I could not even look at the 30 minutes of this trick, I did not laugh, shout, or even excited to this film, in fact only when I screamed when I saw how this movie was bad. I couldn't believe how she tried to make the audience laugh in this film ... and didn't work right away. Although I see a bad bell of the camera and hear the disgusting script I discovered why I had never heard of this film, ... because it takes more than anything it had to drink before. This movie, in my opinion, was the movie of WORVER EVER made, .... EVER!
