I rarely commented on the film but I have read other comments and I can't believe that there are people who appreciate this cellulodi waste. I know there are some people who have their own agenda but they remove it from reputation; they did not work, be beaten and the story felt like the director was doing it while continuing. I don't want to focus on the sex aspect of the film that includes small children as filmmakers clearly wanted what they wanted and what their audience would like. All I can say is a bad film, the content is poor and offensive, production is amateurish and I'm glad they couldn't make a film like this today
