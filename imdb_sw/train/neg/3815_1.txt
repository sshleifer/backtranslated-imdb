Acting is bad ham, all the jokes are high and the target audience is very clear young children, thinking they have less than IQ average. I realize that it was meant for children, but also Malcom among them, still still cast into the humor of adults and situations. We should expect from the show show by Bob Saget, the only girl there is no one who is less than the ball that has hit someone's feathers, perhaps why he is standing to attend the Funniest American Videos. <br /> <br /> Parents, do not let your children look at this show unless you want to save money at college. Show your children stupid and become pregnant.
