Try to catch something like a knife like a SENTINEL will be very difficult. Problems are many. The result is terrible and carrying holes of the plot. Michael Douglas's stars as Pete Garrison, a secret Service agent who "took one" to Reagan during his life trial. Years later we find the Pete with the Whitehouse family, especially as the First Lady's protector (Kim Basinger, L.A.TIP). Problems arise when we see the close participation of Pete and First Lady, and a sudden threat against the President himself (David Rasche, UNITED 93). When Pete failed the test of polygraph, he was chosen as a broken agent by investigator David Breckinridge (Kiefer Sutherland, 24 series of television). If the presidential murder program opens, Pete finds himself. His assistant alone is the First Lady, and he is hesitant to tell anyone about their interests to the other person (therefore Pete failed to polygraph in the first place). But Pete is innocent? Or is he trying to buy time until he can kill the President? If he is innocent, how can he help prevent an attempted murder while driving from the Secret Service? The one, big, big and big problem with this film is that there is no right behind the threat of the president. What? Isn't that the film should be near? One would think so! But the listeners never know why the killer (s) want to kill Prez. Hmm. Someone forgot to put it on the script somewhere? And what about David Breckinridge's new partner (Kiefer), Jill Marin (Eva Longoria, CARLITA's route)? It seems that he had been placed in a strict film like $$ - candy. What purpose did he have? What? Did anything but look good in a secure pants and blouse cutting down? There are too many problems with the basis of Sentinel that are delicious. The step is very simple hit by "What ...?" The sure answers can be mentioned by those unfortunate enough to watch the film.
