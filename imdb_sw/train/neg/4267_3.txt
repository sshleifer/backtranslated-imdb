I saw this film at the Rotterdam Festival, as much as possible for all other voters. The director was present and seemed to have worked hard and committed to the project, which I think is describing the highest reception and marking it. It is similar to the length of the Aussie children's favorite aspect of the "Twist Twist" but it takes very seriously to have that aspect of redemption. The film itself is perhaps worth seeing if you are trying to make a world tour of the United States, because I can't think of another film of Fiji but generally it was normal, not working (with amateur casting) and prey for low thought. The story of the story appeared that the inhabitants of this island would try and discover each other, but as long as there was a good white governor, all problems could be solved (by leaving the island).
