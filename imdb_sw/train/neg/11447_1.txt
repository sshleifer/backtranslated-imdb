Maybe maybe the worst movies I saw; I was ready to walk after the first ten minutes. The only people laugh at the theater were tweeners. Don't make a mistake, I like stupid, stupid movies like the next gal, but the whole premise, writing and laughing. It seemed to me that they were going "Napoleon Dynamite" to feel - a wonderful and random scenes that would lead to a cult view. Instead, it ended the forced, normal and weird situation. The only light that was Isla Fisher and I just felt so bad that he (and Sissy Spacek) had registered for this terrible thing. <Br /> <br /> Thank you gosh.
