Just as I can, I really believe that this film is a waste of time. I did not see that others made a 'warm, humid' film. I saw it boring, and music corrupted by the film. The story was thin, the characters were removed, and the direction of the operators. Fooey. <br /> <br /> Now I will write more about this movie, so I'll make a 10th line down. Surely no more to say and brevity is important, but IMD has a minimum, so here goes. A young child who gets talent seeks, wants time and aging, a delightful consultant despite a homophobia cartoon. To give birth, a straightforward counselor returns to drink a lot and teaches very little. conflict happens. When I think this is a spoiler, I have added a warning if someone feels too much information is many. Normally, I have just seen a stimulating and engaging film. Losing my time. I honestly do not understand what seems to be, especially on this site, about the quality of this film. I think it's important to avoid. But, as Dennis Miller said, "Maybe I'm wrong."
