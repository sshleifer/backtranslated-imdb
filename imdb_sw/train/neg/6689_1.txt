I can only assume that other viewers of this "film" are owners of shares in the production company, since this was likely the worst movies I saw in the last five years. From the opening of the opening of the Master laughing without consideration for no apparent reason, it was clear that executives in this film will be considered "B-Level." Both my wife and I had a great feeling before starting this film, and we were expecting for a real funny popcorn movie. We knew that we didn't hire Kane of Citizen, and we didn't expect to see the amazing movie ever. However, after 40 minutes of tackling the worst waste that I have never seen, we close rather than lose another minute of our lives. <br /> <br /> As a "comedy" without laughing, a bad acting, a thin plot and an angry character is your thing, then this film is for you. In fact, Troll 2 is better - at least I laughed at the sex scene of popcorn. I can't legalize a new review of this photo because I have lost nearly one hour trying to get one dragon.
