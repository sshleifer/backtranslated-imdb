The show had great episodes, this is not one of them. It's not a horrible period, it's hard to follow "The man who was dead." This time is about a couple who have just married Peggy (Ammanda Plummer) and Charles (Stephen Shellen). In the first five minutes you know that Charles was married only Peggy for his money. They all go on their honeycomb and their car diminishes on the dirt road and they should run into an old house to stop. Charles soon finds the family of Peggy's family ... In my opinion you should watch this period, but do not use the same feelings as all the sessions in the first season.
