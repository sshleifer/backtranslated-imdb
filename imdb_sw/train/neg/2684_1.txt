I've got a bad movie for Americans who lost someone in towers, for the people of America in general. To pretend to be proud of the horrible reality that happened years ago, each director takes the opportunity to erase the old truth (which does not relate to the terrorist attacks), or to accuse the American political character, or compare the different political conditions as they themselves have the country to have something to do or cooperate with the violence of September 11. Desperation over them.
