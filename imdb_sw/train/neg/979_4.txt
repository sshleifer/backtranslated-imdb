Anyone who has a far-reaching interest in false science must start on the basis. Everyone says the war of STAR and STRE TREK is the best fiction movies of science fiction, which is the same but the truth is the movie and this movie, SOYLENT GREEN, is the best choice than the same series. SOYLENT is probably the scientific secret lies. It remains one of the largest films, but still forgotten but the impact of its environment becomes more than a reality and every day that passes. Charlton Heston overdramatizes its position, it still works. Edward G. Robinson, in his last role, does more than that in SOYLENT GREEN than any other person and his last events are touching. It is Manhattan in 2022, the world is so full of food that it is unsurpassed luck (a small jar of strawberry jam receives $ 150). The director general of Soylent has been killed by the detective police Thorn is on trial. The green secret of green is not hidden if you are doing research on the movie. SOYLENT is enjoyable to watch, but the whole screen is a dragon. It is as cheap as both production. Screenplay and games on artists made the film, but they were still quite hilarious. Everyone seems to be moron and no one knows the rules, especially the Thorn River who just loves to walt into people's rooms, stray around the attack and steal whatever he wants. Characteristic behavior puts your thoughts on the film, but you still realize that SOYLENT GREEN tries. A piece of fun if you have time, but don't expect anything more.
