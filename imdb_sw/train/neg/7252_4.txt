RELATIONSHIP is one of the self-reliant products, made by open visitors, but does not have all the common mistakes that drain most of these films. It has a definite story, it has enough acting, photography is very good, the hero and the evil are all the terrible people, and the back music does not go beyond. This is a DVD New Release, so people will be looking here to see if it's worth. I don't know where all 10 come from, because there is no way this film is good â€” even if you are the mother of the film. The last film we saw on the playground was a walk to Warner's book J K Rawlings very popular and excellent, Order of the Phoenix. By comparing the damage to PHOENIX, imagine that PHOENIX (as done by Warners) had no story, certainly no acting was allowed by the director, the picture was bad, and the sound of the sound of the sounding sound was a mess. I measured Phoenix "1" because the rate does not burn down. GETTING is 4 times better - on both sides. <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity, make use of space. Remember, this is not "Decoy 3 - Shootout" or no meaning. It's original. If your expectations do not exceed the "10" trademarks here, you can only enjoy the film on its own terms.
