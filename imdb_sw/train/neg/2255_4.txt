Was this film stupid? Yes. What? This comprehensive film? Don't. Characteristics? Don't. Plot continues? Don't. This was just a movie on show-fictionalized Springer show. It shows how many people will go to get their mugs on TV. Molly Hagan did a good job as a mother of Jaime Pressly. Jaime is .... well ... KUSA!

Some more people-analyzing movies (case-in-point: Star Trek freaks). I only watch movies for entertainment; not showing that the girl wearing a different shirt in a different area (read "little Goofs" on Connie's shirt. Is it possible to be better?
