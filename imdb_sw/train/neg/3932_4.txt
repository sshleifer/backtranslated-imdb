This powerful small movie is really one of the best of Renny Harlin. The story is the most common things, but the sky is really making it live; In fact, the story of the soul is almost after. True fear comes out of the prison itself, and Renny H. has no more information to show us how bad the situation is that the old gray spark, leaking, spilled (with modern supervisor, too!) Viggo Mortensen is the best as usual The leading role, supported by other real right prisoners (no good boys in this cast.) Happy fans should watch this out.
