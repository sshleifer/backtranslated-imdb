This movie should not be made. <br /> <br /> It is a shame of the budget. <br /> <br /> Please employ convincing executives, and make a good film. A very narrow path, and a non-inclusive lines. Welcome to the hilarious, and that's a shame for the movie's action .... <br /> <br /> Certainly not worth checking. <br /> <br /> They continue to restore the same "shots" of the Stealth flight away. You have seen that, and that wasn't worth repeating 3 or 4 times. It is time for Steven Seagal to retire from film decisions. His movies are having trouble all the time. The Light of the Light, and the standing, was already bad, but this film is worse.
