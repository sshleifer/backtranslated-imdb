Summary pretty sum sums all over. This is not close to good as original. With the script written by Stallone and James Cameron (at the same time also wrote visitors). Much of the work was written by Cameron and political issues written by Stallone. <br /> <br /> Sly was in a much more physical condition as she was doing this with Rocky 4 and looking for a beautiful or decorated shape with eyeballs on steroids, depending on your own view or opinion. Rambo begins in prison and is visited by Colonel Trautman who asks him to go to a special message that can get the President's apology. He finally agrees and goes to a camp camp driven by Charles Napier with a suit in Washington trying to get away from the former anti-Rambo forces. <br /> <br /> The message is to know if there are any existing POWs still alive in the camps in Vietnam. Rambo was selected as the camp he was looking for was somewhere he had been a prisoner himself. He is told it's not a rescue job and a photograph to take a special photo. After a bad attempt on a flight from a plane loses its unit more, it meets its contacts (who turns to becoming a good woman) and travels down the river with pirates on camp. He sees there are still prisoners and saves one. During the 3th flight from half of the Vietnamese Army in their river boat they are betrayed by the pirates but Rambo kills them all and they are forced to move on foot after their boats were hit by the Rambo near the board. Rambo is thrown back and abandoned as Napier commands to remember the rescue helicopter. It is clear if Trautman returns to the base to cheat that no survivors are expected to be found. Steven Berkoff returns as the Colonel Spetznatz Russian and Rambo are tortured and ultimately run just followed by more Vietnamese soldiers and Spetznatz. To kill most of them, Rambo finally steals the chopper and saves many prisoners back to its base. <br /> <br /> He rejects the need to kill Napier by giving him but destroying the Ops Center. <br /> The weakest and final weakest as Rambo goes away in the sun as a free person.
