I saw this by accident one summer morning. It was playing at the HBO family center. At first I was attracted to, and what I thought was a Disney animation. But, after a few minutes, I found myself searching in the village, so I could find 'INFO BUTTON', to find out what the world was on my TV. I have nothing against Harvey F., I love him in many of his films, but one thing he is not, is a sound artist. Certainly he has one more unique voice of Hollywood, but it only works as a part of the great bag to see. Connecting her voice to a cute buck made a little hard look. For others who have been beaten, they are not evicted. I think working on this film did not attract realistic voice on the talent out there. So, the poor voice talent, powerful animation ... who was watching this film? Gay gay? I don't. What? There are such barriers to the role of young and new homosexuals, that we have to turn to ducks that are wearing? Good story, and as a title, this film I found hard to love, such as bad duckling.
