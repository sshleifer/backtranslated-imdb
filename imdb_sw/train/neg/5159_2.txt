Watching this film is like eating a feast of something but meringue. Previously it seems to be good but eventually provides NO satisfaction - no. <br /> <br /> The program is a clash of soil about the toy factory and the power of evil. So, how can that for this basic plot with Robin Williams that the movie still turns too much? It is because the picture looks completely and nothing - like the terrible picture of Pope Popeye did at the beginning of his film career. The film should be costly but perhaps it didn't have enough money left on recruiting a graduate school graduate. <br /> <br /> The movie is one unwanted joke going on and continuing. I am not sure why it was done in the first place - certainly not done to offer any kind of entertainment.
