I cannot trust the man who led the trick with Dracula 2000. Dracula 2000 was creative, clean, and well written, if it was not appropriate to work. <br /> <br /> This bunch can't even claim that. It begins with Dracula's failure at the end of Dracula 2000. Then ignores the story later to explain what happened next. Briefly following this story can make it a good kind of good, but Craven chose to go to its old movie style, without having a good tie but the main village name. Even the actress Dracula play was different (from dark hair Dracula 2000 to blonde here). Avoid this movie if you respect your taste on the film.
