I've never heard of Larry Fessenden before but considering this effort by writing and leading, he should put his day to work as an actor. Like many others here, I don't know how to replicate this film, it was not awesome or spooky so it can not be called horror, the plot was thin thin can not be drama, no suspects so it can't be exciting, it's just a bad film that you should just see if you're a fan of witch witch Blair. The people who loved this film used words, such as "controversy" and concern and cunning but they were reading in something that was not there. As a witch of Blair, people feared because people thought they should be afraid and bought into a guff that was terrible. This movie started well with the family "meeting" for locals after hitting the pig. It seemed to be a modern-day liberation but then for 45 minutes, (more than half of the film), nothing happened, a family hit about their holiday homes which was very good and dandy but not a bit of entertainment. It was obvious that the locals will be involved in a certain point but Essendon does not know how to create forgiveness in the movie. Finally, when something happens, it is unclear how the father was beaten, how he dies, (the nurse said that his liver was only taken away), and all the time the spirit of the wendant appears under a visible shooter with a very bad way with 3-grade special effects. The film is called Wendigo but no attempt is made to explain it in any way clearly, the film ends all the trembling and leaves you with no worries, I would like to be removed for 15 minutes but I wanted to see if this film could separate itself. It was not.
