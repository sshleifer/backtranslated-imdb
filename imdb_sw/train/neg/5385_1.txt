I don't know where to start. Sent is full of people who have never done anything before or since. Debralee Scott is listed on the cover boxes, but does not appear on the film. Writing is very bad, even for college movies. It is a very low budget, and one place in the house of evil with very good editing. Anime is very good for college movies - a young man with feelings, nerd, old man, tough man, boy and mustard girl beautiful, little village village, etc.. A well-known teacher is about what you expect ... middle old tough old man put a guy who gets sidetracked easily. <br /> <br /> If you don't see college Open, open from this. It's very bad, even not funny.
