Turkish Cinema has a big problem. Directors do not like international movies. They are local and folkloric, but they want to be international. This brings the result of kitsch like this film. The movie has a joke that is translated into Spanish from Turkish and has no meaning for non-Turkish audiences. Even for Turkish audiences after 10 years. They act like a pu. Cuba's new home, but nothing about Cuba. So Cuba is considered a banana plant. <br /> <br /> Money waste, waste of time.
