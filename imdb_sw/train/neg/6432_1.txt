The head says all. "Gunner Joe" was a label released to Senator that depended on the public ignorance of World War II. Guns behind the guns that would prevent the guns from shooting at the plane of the airplane by preventing guns from the fire when it reached the tail. When the Senator was working down one day, he managed to beat a bird's tail. He could not do that if the gun was well aligned. The armed officer involved and acknowledged, to the public, before the camera, that he had a role - had made a mistake, not a Senator. The fact that the film has not emphasized the fact, it shows how one-side is. This film was created to do the same thing, destroying the character of a tough man. The best plan was special for PBS made by him. He was working hard, intelligent, arrogant politician who overcame extraordinary losses to raise it to an extraordinary height. He made some mistakes, serious mistakes, but the tail shot from the plane was not one of them. The popularity of this film is due to the fact that the public loves a simple story, one = side story, so that they don't think.
