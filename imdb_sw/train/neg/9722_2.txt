I didn't like this film .... especially because of the main characters! They are all young, selfish, and locals. They hurt everyone around them to play their silent game. The effects of seeing were good but what is good if there are no characters that link or a line of interesting story. Do I think being happy when these two psychologically active people lose their love for each other? After watching this film I thought "This should be a smash # 1 from France?" ........ <br /> <br /> * spoiler * <br /> <br /> About the last: RIDDANCE Good! They all deserve each other! <br /> <br />
