Three journalists tried to try a deal with Jane Stanton Hitchcock's novel, but this television film has been injected with too many melodrama and does not know when to stop. A tough artist Meg Tilly suddenly finds himself employed by Ellen Burstyn, a rich, who wants a mural to build on his unused rubber walls. After learning about the last collection held there - the daughter of Ellen's daughter coming out - Tilly decides on her artistic landscape, never allowed the daughter to die in secret before the work did not begin, nor did she and the deceased have a similarity to compete ! Two powerful traders are offering their services with a strange yarn that does not accept close observations, which cannot be matched by a woman in emotional power. The role of Burstyn is being beaten at the camp, while Tilly is making a dream-eyed schedule. Only one late in the film (morning after the mural is completed) is charged with feeling, anger and betrayal. Others are piffle.
