I must say this movie is Mork and Mindy going away, when I look I got sores, I even got a little rain. When the Korean boy had a spider in his neck he began to beat the people I was like oh my Asian boss smells and sucks the dog to eat all the time. Any way back on Chuck's track had a certain horrible performance and was not aware of the normal human mind of the robot. Other people could compare it to his earlier days when he was the analyzer of the car wash and believed in the holy spirit and the old spirit of Christmas. This movie is very bad to put my newborn baby in a box and leave it in the box of Mr. Norris. He can raise my child not to let him go to the world where he thinks chuck Norris is a karate expert. Ill saw him hick as it is in real life for all his life.
