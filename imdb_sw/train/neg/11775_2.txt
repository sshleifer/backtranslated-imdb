Watch "Kroko" I would like to leave movies for the first time in my life. I will not recommend you to watch this film: the main characters of the main - absolutely no development k.m. The typical Kroko model of the German problem is still a typical example of no good participation in spite of many opportunities to do so. Employees who have not been rehabilitated, a non-turning conspiracy. I think the movie tried the environmental observation but failed: the camera proved powerful rather than motivating. Images were low-down, gray and dark - I deliberately but the elements do not add to the impressive community feelings. The story had some potential though, it could have a beautiful story.
