I have been a strong assistant of Hal Hartley since I saw his shortcut to the “Goal of the Saved” at secondary school, and yet he was still unmoored with the very "Henry Fool". But this after 10 years later is not just necessary, it's a shame. <br /> <br /> After you start easily and quickly, "Fay Grim" is becoming a pseudo-intellectualism, a decrease in weight, and ultimately not recommended - and needed - nihilism. And that's just a plot. Most of the new faces are as frivolous and bad-developed as a movie: one of the last flat characteristics ends up half while we use and proud Henry Fool himself, and it's his only place that was discussed on the film! Jeff Goldblum Agent Fulbright, it seems, is the only characteristic of a bright (punctually separated by Hartley as well). So, then, he is left? ** SPOILER ** He died through a car bomb, easily makes this film more urgent than Hartley to date, and all tones are in the film that is already completely wrong from the word. <br /> <br /> As for other new characters, Angus James, Ned Fool (or is it bad?), not to mention Fay yourself ... well, I can't destroy their documents, if the movie has a good job of that all on its own (while not binding itself with another godawful canted horn, which gives an impressive impression that Hartley is moving back from Auteur to a crappy film student) which is not good-recommended enough to attract in its state. Instead, his own soul breaks down the usual hipster protest for his director in a "real world", wrong and more important than needed but not bad or means coming close to having nothing to say. In doing so, Hartley is looking at the sh * t all over my memory of these people and the wonderful world he created earlier. I have never been very sad at the movies, and I count "Leave Las Vegas," which at least grow new characters we used to love before destroying them, rather than immediately ignore the already loved characters.
