For movies like this you know you will find a common joke about ghosts. Eva as a spirit is pretty funny. And other actors are also doing a good job. It is the direction and story that does not exist. That would have been ignored if the joke worked better. The only problem is that there is no joke. Indeed I laughed several times. In addition to the chat parrot did not have a maximum of creativity that appears in the film. I blame the director without using the premise for full potential. Eva certainly has a comedic knowledge to show more but did not have the opportunity to do it. In general this movie suits for Sunday afternoon. Other than that can be completely stuck.
