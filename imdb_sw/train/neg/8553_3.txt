This is really a very bad film. Worship is not the same as those Collins made later. However, my great excitement about the film is that it is unacceptable and in fact for a long time. The whole concept of an old SAS member to join the terrorists without some reason can not convince them very much and you can not help to ask why a group of highly organized terrorists (who later have no clueless) falls to it. The film begins with a very powerful area but then protects for a long time building on a great finale. In general, I think Who enjoys success can be interesting of 45 minutes of Experts but the story does not carry the feature film. Although it has succeeded at the time the film introduced the collins' work that in eight years made the cheap and amazing film of soldiers or army. Sir, because he is a very good actor but at the end of the day Martin Shaw chose his responsibilities carefully and has a job that is still successful.
