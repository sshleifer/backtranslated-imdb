Can any movie be naive more than this? you can't believe a piece of this script. and his ssooooo predicts that you can tell him a plot and last from the first 10 minutes. The actress looks like he wants to be Barbie (but it does not, the doll has the skills to do more) <br /> <br /> The ease that the character passes and remains at the music school makes the phantom of the opera novel looks like historical biography. I have never commented on the weight of the characters but one good film feature is the performance of Madsen that can bring life to melo-like behavior of one direction. <br /> <br /> The movie is so happy that it connects your teeth. I can imagine girls aged 13 who Britney-careers cry out "O, give us rest! If we want fairy tales there is always Brother Grimm book hidden somewhere on the floor". I gave 2 instead of just one to Virginia Madsen.
