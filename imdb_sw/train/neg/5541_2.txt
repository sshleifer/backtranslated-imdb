From the time the cinema of the cinema created the skills and a boy named George A. Romero, the word "zombie" gets directly associated with the images of fear caused by blood and the pursuit of immaterial action. It is safe to say that "the dead of the dead of the dead" created a zombie movie as we know it now. However, in the early years of the movie, the solid dead bodies were also used only slowly, near low psychological practices. Jacques Tourneur "I walked with Zombie" is a perfect example and so is "White Zombie", with Bela Lugosi. This "Zombies Rebellion" may be another example but unfortunately it fails on the entire line and easily one of the most severe movies I have seen. Acting awesome, the worst screenplay written with a complete lack of atmosphere and tension! The film takes 65 minutes but the first half of the total loss loses on the love-story fraud and destroys monologues. The Cambodian story of Angkor's story would certainly lead to a compelling story but every one we have seen is local shots. The leading guides (Dorothy Stone, a blonde book with a head of the head and a bad nose) excited me very much and I have continued to trust the fury of the wrath without a sudden occurrence in the place of eating. Unlucky again? If you are able to try yourself for 60 minutes of soporific, you will be awarded a good finale. Still, this is very little to give this film a good rating, then alone suggestions. Avoid! This is the kind of movie you should see only if you've seen everything else.
