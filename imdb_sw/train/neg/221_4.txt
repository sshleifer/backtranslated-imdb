I was gifted with this film as it was with a very good premise, the friendship of the three women was hit by someone who loved and a little person. <br /> <br /> Wondering. <br /> <br /> NOT! I'm quick to add. All these women are given in strict caricature, not very supportive and engaging in planning and bringing down. <br /> <br /> Anna Chancellor and Imelda Staunton could not do wrong in my book before seeing this, but here they are given a bad script and told to facilitate action between slapstick and screwball, which does not work properly when all women are known professionals in the city very small. And for intelligent Women use a whole bunch of time to mourn the lack of men / sex / lust in their lives. I heard a lot more that would have been made from a good script and more of a tension, a small lesbian plot did not go there and those women smoking / drinking (all 3 in forty years) were very real - even in a child - screw baby, gimme smoking! Right. <br /> <br /> As I said, the shame of the desired. 4 out of 10.
