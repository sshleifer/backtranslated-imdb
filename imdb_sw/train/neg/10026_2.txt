I was hoping for the film, for it had a beautiful star and it was the return of Akshay and Saif. Well, I had been watching this film because it was done by the man who wrote the story of Dhoom franchise because I hated Dhoom 2; but as Dhoom 2 compared to Tashan, I would say Dhoom 2 is very real. When I saw the original features, I felt good because it was installed in a good way. Well, the first place itself pis * destroyed me away. Then, the biggest drawback of the movie is the order of action. My friends and I were laughing our guts away and looking at these fight fights. It was like Akshay against 30 bandits and all the bandits even got machine guns! Phew ... you should see this understanding how bad sequence of action is. Something else about the movie is a very fantastic story. It reminds me of some of the early 80 movies. Well, the only thing the movie is worth is Kareena, who appeared to be very hot in this. And so, I give 2 equals between 10. / / <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> </ Well, you can look at this with some laughing on the scenes of fighting and awesome. That is all.
