During the most embarrassing film in this film is when Brady Corbet says 'Going up', near the end of the film. I usually died. I still don't know why screens are on the line there. Was it necessary to create romance? Because it was about to make me sick. <br /> <br /> All documents were very bad. <br /> <br /> I have never loved the original Thunderbirds, but the movie of Thunderbirds might be able to do so. This movie does not. If it did not have a great credit card for Thunderbirds, it would have been automatically locked on the TV, or on the cans after the production. Maybe even before. When I say, the best thing about the movie is when credit goes up and they play Busted 'Thunderbirds' song they are going. I can't believe I have lost 7 dollars to look at this through paying for each.
