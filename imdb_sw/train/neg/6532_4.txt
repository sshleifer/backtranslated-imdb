The movie begins with people in the world to realize that their Mars rocket was not lost but it had dropped out of space next to the planet. When you are removed, one of the patients is sick, one is alive and the other two do not. What happened to them is told through a flashback with a member who lived. At Mars time, these workers seemed to be attacked by any of the most powerful forces. Typically, when sets were very good, monsters were among the silliest I saw on the film. Further, in an extraordinary test of authenticity, the production of a process called "Cinemagic". Unfortunately, this amazing discovery only made the cheapest film when they were on the surface of Mars and the size of the redness made with my eyes blood - it was so bad! In spite of all the cheese, the film had an interesting plot and also good news about space travel. For lovers of genre, it's good to see. For others, you can find anything instead of blaming - see yourself and the decision. When at present rates this is not a very good film film, compared to the films made at the time, very well. PS - When you watch the film, pay attention to Dr Tremayne. He looks like a photo of the ban on Dr Quest from the "Jonny Quest" cartoon! Plus, he looks and makes a lot like him, too.
