As a child, my friends and I all believe that Gymkata was a severe, blood-stricken movie. I don't know who started what rumors. It may be born out of the age of 10-year-olds who were not allowed to see it for one reason or another. Years after Gymkata was released, it became a permanent night of the cable, and for the result, I was able to do for the lost time. I must have seen scenes from this bad excuse for more than a dozen films, and I can always see it from 1-2 seconds of screen time. However, far from connecting to the power of gymnastics and martial arts, bad dubbing, hard talk, and very bad story stories, the film has some things going for it. With all the worst about the visible film, the sound is really entertainment. Never had a punch or a kick derived from very little power and a huge amount! The kung-fu cans of the cans are empty, but the low and low music is low, and around 5 minutes of slow motion is true. Expulsion through the city of concern, the thirsty inhabitants of the blood are not as fast as irritating, and there are bad and extra wigs that all look at the camera and wave to lose this little fun train. Could it be dominated by a cult-rated standard? Where is MST3K when we need it?
