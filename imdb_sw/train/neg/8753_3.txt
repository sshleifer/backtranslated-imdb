This kind of film reminds me of Mary-Kate's film and Ashley-only worse. The rich sister just kind of something I think even though more Alysons actress, in this movie Amanda Michalka was the same sometimes but Alysons acting stunk. I think after high school music they needed to come up with somethihng best and this certainly wasn't. The story line is not great and I think they should find two other people playing Taylor and Courtney. I'm not a big fan of Alyson Michalka and this film did not make me like him better. I think they should be sick to sing and just watch this movie if you have nothing better to do (which sadly I didn't have)
