I just recently discovered that the story of Madeleine L'Engle was changed to TV and Disney movies and ordered the DVD. The book was my favorite when I was a child and read it several times. Although some child actors are unlike the characters described in the novel, the Murry family is thrown well, and good (if it is very good) Meg middle and Charles Wallace who pretends to be a child without a child persuade them. The first half of the hour promises enough, doing a good job in establishing relationships between leading and setting characters. Incidentally as soon as non-human characters seem to be changing, the children who leave the world all things fall apart. Alfre Woodward is very young looking and regal also as Mrs. Whatsit (think Miriam Margolis or Joan Plowright rather) and Kate Nelligan face is so mask as with inexpressive, should be visited Faye Dunaway plastic surgery in recent years. For some reason they make Mrs. Which look like Glinda from the Wizard of Oz when she should be the same as the evil wizard Western Witches. <br /> At the end what this less worst is the awesome special effects and the inspiration of art. I understand that this is a TV movie, but CGI looks like something that can be done 15 years earlier. The natural body of Mrs. is a disaster like Chewbacca as a suit for Aunt's Beast, who in a novel is a beautiful, elegant creature than a Big Foot as shown here. I would like to keep on going, almost every artistic trail is a tragedy, perhaps because there was no big budget enough to do this right, but also because the design work doesn't mind and good judgment. This would really require the extraordinary importance of Spielberg to bring its original films. It is embarrassing for the current popularity to fix a series of fantasy of fantasy children no one thinks to fix A Wrinkle in Time and is a sequels for a big screen, and give a worthy scope.
