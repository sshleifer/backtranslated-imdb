I was a great fan of Women of Lynda Carter-Wonder so when Sci-Fi Channel fired this film, I had to see it. I was very disappointed. He does not wear the right dress [he must have refused or ordered a major change] and the plot runs like James Bond poor man. Nothing has ever made the success of the comic book ie the power of superhuman or one purpose. I don't even think Cathy is anything interesting. I can't waste your time on this.
