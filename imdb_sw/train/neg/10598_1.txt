this is a piece of s - t !! this seems to be worse than it happened to t.v. movie. and I shutter imagine that the good was even concieved with the results ... The war is prettier than this. jean claude van shy has done again and wondered why his work is now. no script, no story and no time you should be lost on this. i mean that. 1 out of 10 is very high, a very high way. Goldberg should be a jackhammer for this. van shame is not an actor.
