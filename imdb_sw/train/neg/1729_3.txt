... and how they grew out of your mind! Monster's Crater Lake is one of the old BAD films from 70 years performed by the characters no any logo, a script of disgrace, an alarming trend, and the desire to have no fear of the horror "fear" with light comedy. This scenario creates a paleontologist specialist who finds the dinosaur's aquarium under the Lake Crater ... a meteor falls from the sky, and the dinosaur of aquatic species begins to be terrifying and eating the inhabitants of the island of Crater. The whole issue was considered by our domestic Sheriff. Many parts of the film - while not showing the blood dams left behind what we think should have been the food of the animal - is used to follow the antic bumbling of two guys called Arnie and Mitch who run to rent a place. They try to be bad, that we get the lines like, check the trademark, Mitch saying to Arnie "You've said bad bait, written B-A-T-E." Laughter was a few here. We then see them laying together and consider the trunk of the tree to be a dinosaur. Laurel and Hardy look! Dinosaur looks fake, but movies are fun in a bad way. And at least, the lake is beautiful.
