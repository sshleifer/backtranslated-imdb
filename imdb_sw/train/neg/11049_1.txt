If Mr Cranky has tested this, I would like to be tempted to just copy his comments and put it here. But if he does not, I will need to supply myself. The only thing that gives this film 1 instead of 0 is that Malcolm McDowall's acting is best. Even then he can't save this film from disaster. The director must be very disappointed when he worked for this because it is just a collection of events that were thrown down with very little promotions - reminding 70 bad movies. The original script was. Nigeria. This ship's computer is a child placed on a jar of glasses and wired in one of the employees via USB 12 or something. The company would be called the Prostate Organization as the entertainment value of this movie resembles the same name. <br /> <br /> I really can't find one place that I could say is well made and make any real impression in the movie environment. I just watched it to the end if I had a touch of the flu and this movie reminded that there were people out there who were worse than me - Malcolm McDowall exactly. I will not hold this if he is a good actor and every good actor has the right to one bad movie in their work and this is a doosie. So, unless this is the only movie your shop employs or you are a male and you are a doctor does not carry out the prostate screening this week and somehow you feel this is a bad thing then give it this very straight away of course if you are interested in the community, buy a copy to help Malcolm and then use it as a drinking coaster.
