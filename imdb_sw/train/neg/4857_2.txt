I liked ZB1. True, I did. I have no problem with the lowest budget movies, and I have enjoyed the best movies and values ​​than ZB3 (if you can think of something like this.) See 'wiseguys against zombies,' if you're interested in). In fact, I prefer low budget budgets, because I believe that Hollywood directors do not understand what zombies are. ' But ZB3 was very bad. It had decreased. I don't want to bother to be polite in my opposition. I want 90 minutes back, etc. unless it took only ~ 80 minutes, because the way through I insert it into 1.4X quickly. Well, here is the opposition. <br /> <br> 1. The pacing was TERRIBLE. Everyone spoke in monologues. Even when a man had one line, the function of the camera and editing and the installation of a F group of bombs in each sentence produced by PENDA as a diagram. At first I was excited about the 90-minute race compared to 70 minutes of ZB1, but there were a few 'events' in ZB3. They all speak. <br /> <br /> 2. The effects of the year became stupider. Just a glop drawn near the stomachs of people. <br /> <br /> 3. Despite the epic exhibition, he had no plot. And these exhibitions are epic! I can't destroy it, if you're going to look at it. (Do not look at it.) But then, it is a group of characters with rounds and around for 80 minutes or a few, if you choose.
