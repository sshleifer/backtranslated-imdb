The so-called Italian cult of cinema and the nonsensical head of boot (if anything, Satan's scope is not so much for conspiracy!), This diversion of Gothic Horror and Giallo (a strong dose of Erotica) only forms the flat roofs inside? really resembles a handle that is very bad! Here, we find a common group of people (an ordinary group) that was beaten on the island (which was invited by the Count? Because he was interested in the woman who led, the husband's necklace for his lost wife)! The characters are very good performances: middle-aged but an attacking hero (played by Giacomo Rossi-Stuart and his family history bears more than his part of the tragedy of violence), a heroine colleague, a sluttish colleague (remembering Mae West and emerging much more!), a thin but volunteer manager (ever was inspired by everyone for his non-human character!), skilled girls, a wonderful garden (ubiquitous Luciano Pigozzi who, at once, gets into that stage, if you know what I mean, a jealous homeman (the name Femi Benussi however, why it is worth, this is a joint piece), a religious fan of a pastor, an attractive bedroom, etc. When the film does not mean it is unknown, dubbing furious, sluggish, good production (with events showing a bright sea released from a black and white film!) and the fact that murder occurs within the last hour is not appropriate you don't. Besides, the mark of Marcello Giombini, although itself itself, comes as a contemporary modern state; which he said, revelation confirms one surprising (considering there is really no shortage of suspects here).
