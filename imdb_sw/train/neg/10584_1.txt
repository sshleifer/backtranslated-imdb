The only quality of the release of this film was that it was very bad to be comedic. Everyone in this film looks like the porn industry comes out. I have seen well working in a small budget picture. Although I had to hire a certain type of sex after this normal area: Jim: Look at your ass Nick: You look at your (together): I'll never let you go! <br /> <br /> The first step of the first step shows how bad production is, but it's a real kind of funny: good people have weapons of transformer! In one area, all have HK MP5 small-machine fake machines. Next situation, AK-47 replicas! And then, above all, they make certain weapons swapping between scenes and a couple M-16s! I think they had a budget deficit for guns, not enough to move around between good and evil people. The fight against the smallest fights and lies as all hell. Remove the pin / spoon from the grenade to self-flare. You can not fire the shoulder launched a missile of any type while climbing into a helicopter. The weapon you give to them should never stop again. When the gun is out of the shot, throwing off is still a fool. Unless you have no idea to reload again. Great slow trucks to drive around the first gear makes for awkward action events. I really didn't believe the movies like these are being fed. This film would have a curve on nitrous oxide or perhaps a drunk.
