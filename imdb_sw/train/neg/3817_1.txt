Great. This is one of the most stupid family shows of all time. <br /> <br /> Plot- Family without mother and 3 "father" brings 3 little girls in San Francisco, California. <br /> <br /> Character - Good player Danny, cartoon love Joey, hair obsessed Jesse, damaged brat Michelle, DJ stupid, and Stephanie almost unusual. The creators of this show need to hate the characters, don't you? Therefore, I don't think anyone should watch this show. I only laughed for a short time in the whole race of the show, and I think that instead of killing the injection, all criminals should be forced to watch this show, suffering more than anything else. <br /> <br /> 1.5 / 10 or: D
