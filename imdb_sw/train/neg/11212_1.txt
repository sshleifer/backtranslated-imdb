The foundation of this film was decent, but with a small query, it was just bland and inappropriate. SPOILERS film does not work because of death, it was an accident, so although it was a murder it was not like a boy planned to do so. Also through certain changes there is a secret revealed that the kind of events makes events as fair to a degree. There is no feeling in this film. The first 20 minutes or so is this woman just calls her sister, and hears her message. It was lighter and horrible. <br /> <br /> By striking a certain color, and better doing it would be very good.
