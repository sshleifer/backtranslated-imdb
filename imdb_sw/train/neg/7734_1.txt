This film is the worst movie I saw. The story line is weak - I couldn't even follow. Acting is a high school. The sound path is irritating. A humorous attempt is not. Editing is awesome. Loans are slow - I would be ashamed that my name is associated with this film waste. Don't waste your time even thinking about this experiment.
