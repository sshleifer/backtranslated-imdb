There was something here and the female leadership with this perfect life she always wanted after the worst life possible, beginning as a baby's defender and fighting with Eric Roberts. But its history makes it impossible for him to trust Dean Cain and this completely destroys his end. It seems strange, but I would like to replace Dean Cain was at the end and the choice he made. She cannot hurt her because she loves her and she is the mother of her child (I think it is time to show that it is her child and not her brother), but at the same time she cannot forgive her for everything she did, sleeping with her brother (which shows love and responsibility she saw it was pretty much one way and then became part of his death. With this excellent hands would be the best movie, but for something that I was caught on the night's cable, it's not bad.
