I would like to give this movie zero between ten. Before going to this movie after leaving, I came to IMDb to see a comment. Commenting on the movie is predictable and fun with awesome conversations. I've never been to the opinion of other people, so I've lost seven dollars for this movie to decorate. It was one of the WORST movies that I have ever seen. The person who wrote the script should push away. Since time-consuming movies have sappy images? I swear, I wonder there was no time at any of the HUG ^ - ^ group. I think I threw it. One time. And that's because I'm out, thinking about my research paper in English. Clich√©d, a bird / cat comes out of anything when you think something will happen. <br /> <br /> And the characters were STUPID. My friend and I almost laughed when the bell went out and the main character said, "I need to get my mother shawl !!!" You. Idiot. Call shawl! Security is just a few steps, but no, my mother's shawl (which is not compared to the dress in the way) is more important than my health and safety. And above all, they take him back to his house, knowing that the murderer knew where he lived. God. <br /> <br /> My friend and I also predicted the movie of ENTIRE. And not only, I bet he is hiding under the bed, when. It was, "He stole bellhop clothes and laughed outside the hotel" and "It's a detective coming down the road, not a killer!" time. Movies should never be this possible. Disney movies are unpredictable yet. <br /> <br /> I'm going to complete my rant now by saying, this was a bad movie. I am happy to go to see it on the show so I don't want to buy for $ 15.00 and then love it. It was very bad. It would be better if only one thing could happen. If, after being shot by a detective, the murderer would fall down one position and shot. The arm of the arm, falling and beating the girl down. O, how good that would have been. Do not waste your time or money. Go see the GOOD movie.
