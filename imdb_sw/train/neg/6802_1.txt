Words cannot describe how bad this film is. I can't describe it by just writing. You also see yourself to get the courage of how a horrible film can be true. It's not that I recommend you do it. There are many clich√©s, errors (and other bad things you can think of) here that will make you cry. To start with the first technology, there is a LOT of errors on the flight. I won't put the list here, but just mention the color of the bird. They could not even show a bird in the color of a false bird, but instead used 747 painted in the original Boeing. Very bad. The plan is ignorant and has been done many times before, just very, better. There are many times of ignorance here that I've lost counting in advance. Also, I was the worst side of the people at all times in the movies, because good people were very stupid. "Executive Decision" should of course be you a choice on this, even "Turbulence" -Movies are the best. In fact, every other movie in the world is better than this.
