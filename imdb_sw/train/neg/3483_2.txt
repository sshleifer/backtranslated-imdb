Christmas live (2004) Ben Affleck, James Gandolfini, Christina Applegate, Catherine O 'Hara, Josh Zuckerman, Bill Macy, Jennifer Morrison, Udo Kier, D: Mike Mitchell. When he was betrayed by his girlfriend, yuppie does not want to leave alone on Christmas and so he decides to return to the young man's home, putting a family of unemployed now living there and reminding them that his family. The worst and single-dimensional performance with Affleck, who actually performs with a flashy smile, makes his character as far as not caused by mentality, but Gandolfini and O 'Hara rests some life in this mess. Even for the farce, its deficiency is dwarfed, not so much from the area to the place, and its message of emotion is like soil like Affleck grin. 91 minutes, rated PG-13. * Â½
