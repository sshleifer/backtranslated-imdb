Tom listened to one of the announcements when the old radio, something of children from the 1950s to today will watch TV. However, they did not have a television when this cartoon was made so that people could have entertainment - from comedies to music for scary stories - from radio. Tom sticks in his boots to listen to some stories about "phantom." In fact he does everything that the composer says, such as "the hair stands up, the cold of the basket blows down his back, his heart blows to his throat," etc.. Jerry, at the same time, watches Tom and laughing his butt away from his fear - the cat antics. <br /> <br /> We then get a taste of what we see for many years after this 194 cartoon that Jerry drives Tom for another reason except sadistic. If the cat asks trouble, it is the same thing, but when it focuses on its own business with Jerry it is physically (and in this case, mentally) to use it, I have a hard time with a "small" spirit. These original efforts of T&M were also the longest minutes of the following. Sometimes one minute it makes a difference. It did here if this was shortened. It can be cut for five minutes without missing anything because the sketches continued for too long. That's typical for Tom and Jerry. Usually, they are very fast-paced.
