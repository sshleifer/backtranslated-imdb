I understand what this film tried to show. How older people are often neglected and treated like depression, which means to lose their self-esteem and if their lives are not enough. I don't have a problem with this message, but I just feel that it could be put in a way that is not so painful. I enjoy a good film art but when the movie becomes self-conscious (as in this case) the result is often sad. Including the shots of man to insert a slow suit that will take 5 minutes to try to make sure but only end up annoying viewers. <br /> <br /> Female characters are very weak and you end up just wanting to tell them to pull together. This is a movie you feel you should enjoy or weigh too much and it really has its features but I was so surprised to look at it forever to recommend it to someone else. It may have a more detailed message than other Roger Michell movies (for example: 'Notting Hill') but at least it was a movie that you can enjoy watching.
