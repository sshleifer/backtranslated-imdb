This is one of the worst films Clark Gable made. PARNELL just was more obvious. It is only a very painful clichéd and conversation is very good that it is neither Gable nor Jean Harlow should be proud of doing. <br /> <br /> Gable is a heel that his illegal activity causes his girl to go to 'slammer (as a gangster spokesman)? He hopes that he will do the right thing but only stops there - unknown to any of them, the woman, to be "in the way of the family". Finally, the rogue returns to do the right thing and somehow closes this all through the fun! They seemed to have forgotten about Gable requiring to take a rap and spend several years in a spoon. Leonard Maltin says "star is much better here". To what extent? Better in producing unexpected bottles? Gimme break! PS - After saying this, my wife thinks Leonard Maltin will find me and cut my butt. Hmmm. However, despite my opinion, I think Mr. Maltin is the best follower and man on earth (I hope he persuaded him) <br /> <br /> UPDATE - 2/2/08. Because I didn't like this film for the first time (especially at the end of ignorance), I decided to look at it again. After all, sometimes I watch the film again I love it more and realize that I was very hard. Although this has been a case with several films in recent months, I still did not like this film - even a second time. Most of them were not because of the first half of the film. In the first half, Harlow's attitude was of a mysterious stupidity but at least it was reliable. But when he was in prison, they were all clichés until the last state of ignorance marriage occurred. The bottom line is that this sequence is a disgrace of the rhino - it is not quite worth it and it is similar to turning the movie into the story of the wacky story instead of the love story about two losses. I stand up with my previous review (despite all the "NOTHING") and think that apart from PARNELL and the possibility of voting in the UK, it could be just the worst film of Gable.
