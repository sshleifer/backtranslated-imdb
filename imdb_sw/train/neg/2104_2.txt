I bought this video for $ 1 Walmart's daughter. I think I earn more! In the 1940s, Bela Lugosi made a lengthy 3-piece film for a small studio (in this case, Monogram - who made many Bowry Boys' films. While most of the films of these films did not close the level of their final awfulness films were found (Ed Wood "classic" such as Mrs Bibi and Layout 9 From Outdoors), it is still a poor film and should be avoided by all but many fans die. <br /> <br /> I am an old junkie movie, so I gave this attempt. Besides, these small films were very good - not just this. Lugosi is, what else, a mad scientist who wants to put his best wife and cruelly living through serum he says from young girls. They did not explain why it should be the bride or why it should be women or even the disease that his wife had - so you can see that the plot has never been lost. Anyway, a very sad female writer (Lois Lane without Jimmy Olsen or Superman) wants to get under this apparent murder which bodies had been beaten! So, he follows the signs of the way to Lugosi's door. Lugosi's house has been completed with his proposed wife, female assistant and two wonderful men who are of the helper (the most sexually immoral sex). Usually the journalist loses a lot of time in the film - visible narcolepsy and good detective journalism goes by hand! Finally, all maniacs die - especially from their own hands and all is well. In conclusion, the author and the doctor who just met to decide to marry. And, usually, the dumb's camera is broken when this happens. If you haven't seen, there's a lot of films in this film. Or, perhaps because it was just a small and beautiful film they just slept!
