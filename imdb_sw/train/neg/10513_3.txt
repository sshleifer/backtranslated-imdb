This movie was losing an hour and a half of my time. I have always loved cheap monster movies, but this film was desperate. The main advantage is the lack of describing creation. When they went into the house and looked for someone who could have a lease explained to them. We don't say anything about them instead of killing their parents, and unless I lost something that didn't say how they could escape either ... Not to mention the fact that it does not give a clue or reason why the only survivor sits and essentially gives them the creation after their experience of near death. It would seem that he would have a chance to leave after the "cross event".
