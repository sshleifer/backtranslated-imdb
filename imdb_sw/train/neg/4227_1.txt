I'm sad that I actually sat down with this look. I love independent movies, horror movies, and the whole thing of zombie in general. But when you add, you have crossed the line that you shouldn't cross. I hope people in this movie had a good time to do it, then at least it was not a general waste. You can never know to look at it though. Script? Unatania. To work? I think even the trees was making it. Movie theater? Well, there must be a camera there. Period. I don't think there are any real plans involved in the creation of this film. The temporary damage that I will not add for more comments.
