Nicholas Walker is Paul, the city of Reverand married to Martha (Ally Sheedy), but it is also an ordinary mtanizer and decides to make her own death run by her current status, Veronica (Dara Tomanovich). However to do this, he gets amnesia (so the name of the film). Sally Kirkland is also supported as an old coat of things that gives good reverand trees in the shades of "Pain". It is sad to see a good cast like this. Not very little John Savage in an amazing role as a personal follower. In a film known as 'black comedy', one needs to come up with the elements of the film. Although this brings the old into spades, sadly does not have any end. Additionally you cannot emphasize with any characters and as such, they have no interest at all for them. Technically not all the bad movie together just to forget too much. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Dara Tomanovich gets topless; Sally Kirkland also shows a certain skin / <br /> My bridge: C-<br /> <br /> Where I saw it: Show Show
