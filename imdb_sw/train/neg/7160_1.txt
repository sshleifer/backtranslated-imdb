Well - when the appearance of Jason Miller cameo (looking even more than he did in Exorcist IV) is the top step of the picture, what do you have? <br /> <br /> It is a small country, a little rock n 'roll: mix two alcohol and money that sends their child anywhere and mummy-dried-rejected (you thought that someone out yet - entered into the shell?) on the apartment, Christopher Walken and bad work of paint, and a little girl who might have been an interesting character if they could provoke him. I understand - kind of - that they return to visit his brothers. After that .... <br /> <br /> Problem: There are several interesting obstacles to what I must think is her mother being killed in car bombs (I think). This is not connected to anything. Problem: What do we need for a grandmother for? Now, the bride can be interesting. Talks Gaelic, or Celtic, or something. Maybe you can do something. The best they can do is that they have tobacco habits. That's all. <br /> <br /> Problem: They beat the real character as a husband. Is he being beaten (he will sell his wife to the devil? Maybe he can expect a bag of faith that he can take care of) or he is being beaten against a kind (after all, he has a good haircut and beautiful clothes)? He drinks, he says. He is not a bad person. It's not good. But it is impossible. Why didn't they do anything with him? <br /> <br /> No problem: old boy shows. The man throws us. She returns to defeat the husband. (It gets ridiculous, but at least that character has an incentive.) <br /> NOW - he is an alcoholic, he is an alcoholic; he could only marry her for his money. Bride is bound in the bedroom. The blind uncle takes our heroine on the floor to show him the witch of the witch (do you follow this?) Who can live. In fact, you know he will come to life, music increases. The little girl lives at home, takes tea to the grandmother (opens the door to do so) and gives granny and cigarettes. From time to time, granny comes out. But nothing happens. The husband and wife lose a child in the house, then loses the bedroom. Uncle gets his throat on the floor. The leading woman has a bloody nose. The man drinks. They both drink. In the face of all these things, the fatal truth described in the first high-it-omigod sound - abortion when the woman who was leading was twelve years old. <br /> <br /> Despite all these awesome links, no one could find stories on the screen. There is no bridge between the situation, no exceptions from the slightest discomfort and the worst fear, only the slow prize that is not available anywhere; The man, of course, cares about - and had places to go with the same thing - the innocent child in the payment of alcoholics, a mistress who can be imprisoned because he is a monster, but no, his worst mistake is smoking. She has beautiful hair, beautiful makeup. <br /> <br /> In short, there is no plot. Just a little violence (predictable) in the dark library, and the rain falls in, and the sound of the voice is inside us. You need more than a few with Christopher Walken to make a film. The values ​​of production were good. Oh. Beauty landscape, beautiful wardrobe. The camera, at least, knew what he had done. <br /> <br /> I bought it. Poor me.
