I thought I saw this film, twice in fact. Then I read other reviews, and they were not exactly the same. The three young men and young girls, two girls and a young man, go to this town to learn a great sight to see. I still feel confident that this is the film I saw, despite the difference in the audit. So I reiterate my opinion: If you like a regular 'B' movie, as I did, then Go back to Boggy Creek is your film! If it puts you in bedtime, and appears on your favorite movie, or just hang up with friends. Boggy Creek, a mute button, and you have a happy night of efficiency. See! What? Stories are true? I think we can only know, with a cast-not-stellar. Are there any side effects of the material during the film? What? Our blonde, male, little hero has chest hair? Will the unique advanced-technology technology be the last film? You will need to check to learn for yourself.
