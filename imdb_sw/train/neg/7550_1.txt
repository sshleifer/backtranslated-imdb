Okay, so I am an original fan of Wicker Man and I don't like British films reserved by Americans, why did I put myself in the most painful movie experience? I'm not a fan of Nicolas Cage and I had some kind of madness maybe? The movie was awesome! Slightly beginning with the accident / fire was not important to the film all the time and the female soldiers knew where Edward was going, so little at the end with two girls visiting the continent, well it would not happen if anything would be monitored. The back of the wicker man was not really investigated - and I think that the US set did not really support all the pagan themes. This film was slow and had no atmosphere or insist. I must say that the best bit was the same last, while Nicolas Cage goes on fire! I am in need of despair to see again the nature now, in order to purify my soul. I can't really emphasize how awesome this film is, please don't see if you are: <br /> <br /> A) Re-dislike the UK's B) It is a native fan C) Hate Nicolas Cage
