An awesome film that should be free. It needed some dependency on something. <br /> <br /> This sad film deals with cooperation between Irish people. They were trying to imitate a good film "Crash?" If so, this film hit it completely. There is so much going on here that has reached the top of a little brat around and throwing stones into buses and cars that cause obvious. <br /> <br /> Movies are also chappy to work. One woman has lost her husband after 14 years and another when her younger sister was broken and the main character. This causes the old sister to be the cause of bitterness and walking around the clothes that they should not believe. The older sister is also wondering but soon finds love. <br /> <br /> Then, we have 3 victims who buy masks to steal the bank. Obviously, theft goes awry but it doesn't seem to have any penalties for those who appear. Perhaps, the penalty should be on the authors of failing to create a film of cooperation.
