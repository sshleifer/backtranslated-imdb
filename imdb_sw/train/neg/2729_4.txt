Actor Ruth Rumi's real life of philanthropic signals help welcome the soldiers to come from and stop for the War of Korea at the base of the air around San Francisco fly-start this all the Warner Bros all salute for patriotism and song. Most celebrants make the appearance of visitors when love-loving love goes on between the budding stars and the hippopotamus and a little green (Ron Hagerthy, who looks like he should give newspapers from his bike). It seems that Kaporali has convinced the actor thinks he is going to war when he is actually part of aircraft crew, flying and from Honolulu (you would think he would be happy that he keeps harming, but instead acts like many women's child in 1950 movies. Doris's day is around the first thirty or so, and his distinctive laughter and tracking numbers are more beautiful. Roman is also here, with a beautiful color, while James Cagney enjoys on his screen persona and Gordon MacRae sings in his beautiful baritone. Jane Wyman sings, too, at the seat of the hospital seat following the lead on the day of Doris, causing a person to be embarrassed, "Are they gone out of the set?" For a non-biased audience, a fascinating flashback at another time and place. However, low production and tax issues and sufficient technology provides a "Starlift" strictly second of biller. * 1/2 from ****
