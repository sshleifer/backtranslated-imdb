Many deaths occur in the wild. You don't need to be a rocket scientist thinking that out! But does it require a view of the original document? What? Includes this interesting and terrible death? Do we really need to see an old elephant elephant decorated with a pound of hunger? Or, cheetah grab the castle and throat slowly, not down! I thought this would be a friendly movie of the original film! And / or Why, why don't you have the courage to show the worst violence in film trailers? What? The film partners were afraid to lose money? Then, naturally, the comic aid aid we see is a wonderful-flight-flight bird making a tradition of reproduction and a sense of despair and stupidity to humanity. It was surreal! It is as if the artists believed that they were talking only in the first and second-class farmers' home trips! Wow! From the moronic sense in the heartbeat! If there are future natural designers who are waiting on the wings to read the screening of this film, why not take into account: The missing animals; bearing; lay eggs; shower; sleep; cleaning each other; collaboration; play; emotional exhibition rather than fear and anger; abnormal behavior, like excessive mouth; migration; problem-solving skills; culture (yes, many species of animals have what people call culture); communication skills; reproductive health, healing ability, etc. In other words, you stop focusing on violence or loss of beauty, and why not be better - and focus on happiness and inspiration, instead?
