Go once and rent this movie. It will be on the bottom shelf at your local video store and will be covered with dust. No one will touch it for years. It can even be a $ special .50! It's worth ten bucks, I swear! Buy! There are not too many films that can compare to this - the cellulodi version of the goo that creates less garbage after a few years. Yes, I gave '1,' but it is very useful. 1-10 ranges are not created by such things in mind.
