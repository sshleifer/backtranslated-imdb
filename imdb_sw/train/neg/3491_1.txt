It seems, people who wrote behind the box did not worry to look at this so-called "movie." They described "misleading folly and violation." I did not see "preference". I instead saw the worst quest in negotiations in the required movie of kung fu. I did not see "violence." At least, I didn't see anything that could stop my unbelief on what could hurt someone who has "skin" - but here I probably reveal "too much". Additionally, as many filmmakers and many (which include kung fu film regularly), I can say freely that this piece of cellulodi is unknown. Whatever you choose to do, I will continue to be left / right. I was not blinded by choreography.
