This movie is AWFUL. I did not laugh at the film that was not surprising for a long time. Leno should be stuck to the mother and night of the night. Cars in the film were cool, but the movie itself is a movie that has never seen me. is pathetic, acting is awesome, and the plot could be written at age 4. you don't get bad, jay leno is hilarious, but not in this movie!
