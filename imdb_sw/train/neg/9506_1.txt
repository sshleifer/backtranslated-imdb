Ah yes, a series of VS, MVC2 to be an obstacle. It has been said earlier, this is what you get when half of the crew slept on the job, unfortunately the half game game did. Don't make a mistake, this is fun, but tired of shinging bonds. As a summary of the plot, AHAHAHAAAAA ... No plot. Beat that person to the end and win! Well, who is playing this independently?
