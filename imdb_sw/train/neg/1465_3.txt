Well first I would add that I am a certain amount of historian so what I look at in a film that depends on historical events is that it actually depends on historical facts. But this is not the case here. Sure the movie is entertaining and all but the fact that it is not quite a realistic truth is more than angry. Hitler had no resistance to the church during his youth, even working for the Jews before the world war. It was so during the same world war and after that he created his views on the Jews. Bringing it to this film is also correct, Hitler as a child did not have a little bit brat. He had a more common or less growth. Nothing is known about his lost brothers and other important pieces that add to the puzzle which is Hitler. Robert Carlyle is a good but not good actor like Hitler. Hitler was not possible and stable as the picture here. Under his younger years he was a compassionate man who "used" people through his will. His unselfish character and the fury of wrath began during the war. <br /> <br /> I'd like to see a film about Hitler's life that depends on the real historical facts and not the charges. What I hate when people point to the finger of blame for example Hitler and others and tell the wrong stories just paint their pictures as a clean evil. It is better to tell the story in such a way that everyone can learn what it is! Those behind this film should do research before doing this. Because it looks like they didn't even know what happened. Hitler did not shoot even in a revolutionary march in Munch, his shoulder was broken out of his hole. <br /> <br /> It gives you more to see a better document than to see this.
