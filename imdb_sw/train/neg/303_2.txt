It is impossible to focus on this movie correctly. Not that I have not tried, mind- but I sit down, and I come to VHS-age, and I look at the opening ... and suddenly I'm five years old again connecting my own Care Care and watching movie with open eyes and enthusiastic heart . I can see, effectively, that this film is a mix of BIZARRE of newborn babies and children with no power of evil who have a thin story and an impressive animation. But my five-year-old goes, "Yay! Care Bears!" every time I think about it. So - I would just like (carefully, worriedly) suggest this film to those who saw it during their early teens and can force power over the momentum of watching it (like me) Or Gen-X / Y- The lovably cynical ers who deliberately seek for evil / strange purposes (the community in which this movie is real). For those who are looking for a compelling movie or a good family entertainment: You may want to keep looking.
