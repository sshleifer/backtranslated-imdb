It explains that many of the best reviews for the film on all IMD come from people who have just reviewed one film on all of their IMD work and that you have played, the film is "Parasomnia". I have been constantly criticizing the good IMDb review why it turns out to be nothing but a good film as fraudulent markets, but it seems to be clear in this case. That's not to say Parasomnia is bad, but it is very good to be a good or good film that was likely to be. On the other side, you have a great baddie in Patrick Kilpatrick who is doing a leading cause of risk and evil. There are good tips in the dream process, in fact if the film has decided to explore that the terrain may be the best thing. The real concept of abnormal hypnosis is also great. Although I understand the suspension of unbelief is important for immersion in any good story, it is a symbol of good news that succeeds to allow it to do so. If you find yourself becoming angry about what you see is not an example or just a silence, then the story is losing you and that's what it has found me with this film. Other observers are mentioned here and do not want to enter the spoiler area, but I will say to introduce the last time there was concern and despair, not to mention the mental age of behavior that should only have a few years of experience. All in all, there is a germ of a great idea here for incorrect damage, but sadly this film fails to realize in anything special.
