I saw this film earlier on the Video CD. <br /> <br /> I will first say good points. <br /> <br /> movie, for the first time, at least tries to seem to be not pleasing, if not showing one character as black and the other is white. Both partners are friends and live very well in the country and the economy is not overdue at the same time. Their families get together and have parties and make their favorite games, shoot the Rifle shot, as the partners are not competitors. But, after 1 minute the plot goes to the fork in the road. The audience is expected to believe that for unknown reasons these friends should be lovers. That is why unknown Bosnia is now on the way to conflict. Indeed, the script adds to the television pictures that the characters seem to be looking at English news programs, but clips started in 1993 and 1992 when the war started. <br /> <br /> History, 1990 elections, people who caused the war are not described. The movie tries to be blamed by Karadzic, who was the candidate for the President and the leader of the Bosnia's 2th largest (SDP). According to the Constitution of Bosnia, the SDP had presidency in 1992, but there were a few in January. The Islamic Democratic Democratic Party took general control and made a referendum in March where it announced a law in Bosnia and declared Seti. The IDAP history begins with Islamic Muslim Alija Izetbegovic, man because of the absence of "STtH". She was a student of Nazism at WW2. He even wrote himself "Mein Kampf" where he said: "In fact it is impossible to have any peace or cooperation between" Islamic religion "and non-Islamic and political". <br /> <In 1990 he lost the IDAP choice for "pro-Yugoslavia in a large quantity" Ficret Abdic, the Egyptian Islamic, who worked with Christian Israel during the Civil War, and who treated his followers as a brother . Abdic was prevented by the power of Izetbegovic, who lost the election but he used the power seat. The events from the top are not broken from the film, but are the real events that cause war. <br /> <br /> There were problems with props as well. Serb soldiers in the movie were wearing Soviet WW2 helmets, which they did not use. Also one soldier was doing W-1944 W-2 W44 rifle, which was used by the USSR or Yugoslavia. The Director and Writers of the Documents had a chance, but they chose to rewrite history.
