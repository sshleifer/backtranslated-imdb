I have a piece of advice for people who have made this film too, if you make a film like this you certainly have f / x to strengthen it. Also do not provide a group of executives of the playlist in it. Another thing, just about all of us have seen Jurassic Park, so don't give it correctly. All in this movie is all cooked, f / x facing, takes shape, unusual story. Let's look over acting for only a second, Carradine player who worked in 1984 when he did "Revenge of Nerds" (which was actually a great comedy). He is not a list of z, he can act. He should just say no to this package of s. He should do what Mark Hamill did after the "Return to Jedi" and go quietly until night. He made his mark as "Nerd" and that should be so. I understand that she has bills to pay, but that is not appropriate for this package. What? I called this film yet? OK. I wanted to be sure. If I have a little hateful voice, I apologize. When I had only two hours of my life I could use something like producing a color, and I feel. I will close the description. Thank you for your time.
