In spite of his mistakes, I enjoyed the "Burns Burns", John Carpenter's Season One Season in the Masters of Horror series. Yes, the story was seen as a cheap cross between MADA and 8MM, but it was still very good for budget and time constraints. For "Pro-Life", however, the low budget and time constraints definitely show more than anything else. There is a strong guide as always from the disabled yet there is a quality of writing and the full production itself that you feel was made in a general and complete rush. Script is not always known, incomprehensible messages, and stories are full of holes of traps when you look back. Maybe he had Karemala again wrote a script, it could be a valuable part. Rather, it is a mess that only the hardest of the artisans are having a little more fun. Of course, the bad Carpenter has ever done. 2/10
