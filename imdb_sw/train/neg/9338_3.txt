Pam Grier's stars like Coffy. She is a nurse who wants to take revenge, for drug traffickers who told her sister with a bad heroine. As a 70s kind of relax, you can expect to see bad guys get their answers only. There were many marks of these films made during the 70 years, and they were disrespectful to all the black and white audience. This is mainly due to racial hatred in these films, and humiliating characters, failures. Especially female characters. <br /> <br /> Other common threads between Coffy, and other films of its kind, include brutal violence, corrupt cops, car expulsion, bulk shortage of weakness, and women-crazed gorgeous women. Do not mention ghettos cities filled with people who sell drugs, pimps, mobsters, and criminal offense. Pam Grier, was an unknown king of the 70 heroes of rest. He was good, with hard-like nails, and stop-dying good. Like in other films, Pam dances other characters, in Coffy. In fact, Pam is a charismatic on the screen, that these types of films are unknown, without him as the main character. <br /> <br /> If you like Pam Grier, you're better to see his other films, like Foxy Brown, or maybe Friday Foster. These films have less than enough, than Coffy does. Pam's behavior in Coffy, destroys herself very much to get bad people. Pam's characters in his other films, do not sit down to take revenge, as Coffy did. <br /> <br /> I'd like to say, just see Coffy, if you can't see any other film of Pam Grier. Otherwise, Coffy is a waste of time. Pam's gift alone as an actress, makes watching Coffy bear.
