The movie that tries to be more beautiful than its developers can produce. The movie unfolds and returns through the "surprise" of the village among the desperate attempt of listeners thinking, offcourse puncturing "plot" and steamy events they thought would help. john belushi is involved in this pseudo and intellectual experiment and only sleep goes through the movie. The same applies to other "executives". The plot is silly and tacky. whih in ishi is not such a crime, but in the end, the biggest problem of conspiracy finds tiresome and very boring. <br /> <br /> however, the movie can generate interest in the middle. in all worth watching lazy realistic day of boring, but don't worry if you lose this. <br /> <br /> instead of cripples 4!
