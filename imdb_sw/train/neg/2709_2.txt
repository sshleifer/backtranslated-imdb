The only way to get anything out of this film is to reach it as a comedy. See it with that light, it gives. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a great movie, look elsewhere. This film is not quite comprehensive and provides a little more than a focus of direct and indirect search of "issues" without any understanding. <br /> <br /> Make a film about the elements and then make each one character in your film picture. is a very poor strategy - especially when the same characters break their hackneyed hammers into predictable, improper ways. <br /> <br /> Busta Rhymes and Ice Cube makes the film almost look, and Michael Rappaport returns for good performance, but the script is very bad and the definition of society is so angry, it's hard to find anything to redeem.
