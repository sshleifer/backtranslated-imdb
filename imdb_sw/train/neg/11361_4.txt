It's good surreal what these flies can do ... eh well ... this is a cartoon, so anything can happen inside. At first I must tell you that I love animation movies. Unfortunately this year's repertoire is very weak. This cartoon is nothing but a list of errors: <br /> <br /> 1) I quoted the label line. It suggests that this film has serious 3D effects. Well, I didn't see anything, at least not something that I have never seen before. <br /> 2) "Flies" in this film are not seen as real roots. At least they could make them black. But cyan jumps, to weight? With big heads and small holes? <br /> 3) Stories. I think it is written for children aged 6 years. I could speak in two words which are more than simplified. Extreme love. For example: "They are American files after all!" Oh, give me a break.
