This film is not only well written and dominated but it's just amazing. A good novel is very bad in this film. Many changes have been made to the storyline, perhaps to improve the time. But the result is just mixing. Acting can not win the script which removes the interests of the characters for their behavior. In addition, the conversion in English does not work when everyone speaks to Esteban predator as ESVeban. Horror. Please Please read a good novel, in Spanish if possible. Don't see this FILD. It will destroy you which can be a wonderful experience.
