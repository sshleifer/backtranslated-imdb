The only frightening thing about this movie is the idea that anyone making it can do good. <br /> <br /> From beginning to end "Fairy Tooth" was just too bad. It seemed like a movie made by the miserable children that were confused, and the wizard of the "Wizard of Oz" and the joy of kiddies ended with the bad effects of being affected by swearing. <br /> <br /> Half of the cast seems completely not needed unless you easily be there to get killed somehow. Two sisters, Cherise aura and Mrs. McDonald are not so much in the film - they could get them into the main plot for interesting stories but it is impossible to have trouble. People watching the film know the characters when they are in the blood area but come, at least TRY and have a little conspiracy to them. Stories are generally weak and unusual behavior from characters who make all the wish to be eaten by witches. Add a weak and vulnerable group together (children are particularly wood) and the movie ends complete failure. If only MST3K would go to this one ...
