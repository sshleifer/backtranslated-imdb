This movie just grows. Although directors say it is part of the culture, it is still very serious, for the first leadership. The topic itself is very interesting and I accept the worst acting due to the fact, that all are amateurs and never acted before, but the worst thing about this film is the most effective conversation and skill and lead. No time at any movie. I felt like the directors lost so much to the film (it's their first element), that they really did not ask themselves, what story they want to say. I met Ben (one of the directors) on several occasions and he is good and intelligent, but that doesn't make him a director. I think, that the "American History of X" is full of clichés, but somehow it can send a story. "Oi!" It is full of clichés, it does not say anything new or caused by (it is a sad thing about this film) is far from any OI! -Reality. If you want to see great but big German movies, see Michael Haneke's films, Christoph Schlingensief, Oskar Roehler, Hans Weingartner or Oliver Hirschbiegel: <br /> <br /> Benny Video Video Will You Be Received by May of Letzter Film Experimental Das Weisse Rauschen Muxmäuschenstill ... <br /> <br /> *** among ten, because of the topic and photography
