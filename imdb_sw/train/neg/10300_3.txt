I am a fan of art movies, but sadly I must give this film a shadow of volunteer. It slows down to develop an unfinished plot on the basis of the promised premise, experience is, we'll say, try. Even after a bad movie I feel that I am learning something, or enjoying something, but there was nothing to understand. The premise did not attract, but the movie begins and ends there. The act was the same, although the characters were very interested. For the main character with the aim of this amazing goal, he is very strong. It's compassionate. I often enjoy movies that have not been, but the lack of formula should not be confused with zero content.
