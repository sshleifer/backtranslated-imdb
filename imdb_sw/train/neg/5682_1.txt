This film is amazing without ignorance. I love awesome movies, but this is the worst I saw. I am a big fan of the year, but many deaths in this film are not shown. It just shows us the bodies already, and only the death displays that actually show in this movie is awesome. Graphics look so obvious fake. The characters are also bad. There is no real feeling from any of them. Not just wasting my time looking at this piece of movie, but I had to deal with realistic pictures of animals that were hit at the beginning. If I could measure this -10, I would. F * ck this movie. It goes. Don't look at it.
