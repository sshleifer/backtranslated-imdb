Alfred Hitchcok is not my famous director in any way but imagine what he could do with this! The program has great potential to insist. John Garfield is like almost always the best and Raymond Massey emerges against the kind. Nancy Coleman is not a very attractive but very supportive woman and has great potential. It begins to spread well earlier. There are many conflicts. And the important issue is misleading by its slight, at the end, than the story of love. It is fun to enjoy Garfield, Massey, and character artists. But it's not very good.
