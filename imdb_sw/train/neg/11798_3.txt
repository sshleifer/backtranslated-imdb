I watched Phat Beach for cable for a while and I kind of enjoyed it. This oil is a good quality, as it looks good. Other characters are just different types of young people and young people. I would like to watch these low-budget films that take some time because they are as close as a document of perspectives and fads of the year. Phat Beach is also interesting because low-budget children in this movie are home girls. Most low-budget films have the quality of "babe", and you can tell the babies in this film were local models and JC Penneys underwear. Some of them had many cellulite standing from their bikinis that was amazing to look at how "young" did wild on what was most used, the highest-mileage skank. There were also cups. That's the charm of these low budget movies. You will see a lot of doggies, and some real cups! I looked at some of them on IMD and seven years later Phat Beach is just their loan. Very bad. It would be interesting if someone ever made "Where they are now" book on all the cups that have been seen in the history of the movie and then they did not come back. What happened? There is probably one or two young people almost every movie who seem to have a lot of going to them and even years later after seeing a movie again on TV you wonder "what happened to X?" However, this film closes, but it has a momentous time.
