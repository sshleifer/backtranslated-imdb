This movie was an unusual experience of watching. Modern is clear according to play. Now I assure you that everything in this movie is doing very well in the play but with the cinema it doesn't feel very good to look. The movie is also a 'stagey' way and did not even worry to change some of the conversations to make it more suitable for the movie. Instead what is presented now is almost a new reflection of the play, with the top-top characters and the discussion set. Because of all this story of the story does not work and the movie becomes a perfect experience of birth-and obsolete. <br /> <br /> It takes time to realize that this is a comedy you're looking for. At first you think of his game, and the quirky characters in it but if the film goes on, you will see that the movie is more than a passion, which serves more with a kind of comedy, rather than a kind of drama. <br /> <br /> Anime and dialogue are things that make this film high and high that is often not recognized. Indeed, executives are the best; Peter O'Toole and Susannah York, among others but did not stop the movie at a 'enough look'. This story feels completely broken. Basicaly story is about something and especially focuses on the characters of a brother / sister played by Peter O'Toole and Susannah York. But exactly what is the story? Movie feels as useless and obsolete that has very little to offer. As I said earlier; I am sure this story is beautiful and interesting to look at the action but if the movie is not suitable and doesn't work out. <br /> <br /> The editor is very bad and times and becomes even laughable bad in a certain order. More was anticipated from director J. Lee Thompson, who has clearly made the movie better than this failure, action-play translated to screen, project. It is not worth your time. <br /> <br /> 4/10
