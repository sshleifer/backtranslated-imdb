1 looked 12/7/2002 - 3 out of 10 (Dir-Steve Purcell): Typical Mary Kate & Ashley more farees more kisses. It seems to me that girls are getting very tired of these things and it will be interesting to them if they decide to split and go the way. During this period of adventures they are prisoners in Rome for a "fashion" manufacturer who puts them right into the e-mail room to learn what works so hard is about (I think.). In addition to the usual painting and boys there is nothing except the state of Rome up to Â¾ the way to the film when it is finally revealed why they are expelled, then re-employed, then dismissed, then employed again. This is evident from people who do not understand the world of communion and shows in their interpretation. Maybe the real world will be their next adventure (if there is one.). Even my children were not found to keep this 'awesome adventure' in believing. Let's see maybe they only have a few years to legal adults. We will see what happens at that time.
