There is no real plot of this, just a series of short skit makes some old joke. I hit once or twice at the beginning, very much in my anger. But even for just 73 minutes, this film is welcomed in a very long time and it becomes stabilized and stimulating (for some weakness is deposited here and there to promote wake up). It is still as bad as this film is (and that's pretty putrid), it's a comedic gem compared to anything of anything and Aaron Seltzer & Jason Friedberg (Festival, epic movie, encounter with Spartans). interesting in a sad way. The eye of candy: twelve pairs, 3 bushes, ass 3 <br /> <br /> My bridge: D trailer for this film; and tractors to "More than in the Library", "Fisherman of Kufa", "Farmer", "Watching", "Power Play", "Sole Survivor", & "Wacky Taxi"
