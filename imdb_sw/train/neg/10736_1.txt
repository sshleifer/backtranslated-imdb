The movie starts completely with an exciting scene, three people are drinking and making a small discussion in the bar. They all make up stories of anger. As the film continues, it shows that the most angry story is true. However, more than that the film is not very suitable except for the bar area and the location of the main secret is revealed. This revelation occurs for half a time during the movie and false, not the amount left. Some of the time-managers are looking at a village that was left in the Russian village that is full of sympathetic and attractive women. Of course, these are surprising and horrible images, but loving them go for a very long time, offering any development or development character. I have seen this movie as another example of shade or lazy writing, where instead of trying to make a fascinating story, the creators of films consider the interesting pictures and through a series of unrelated stories (cases in action - the story of the meat trader) leave for the viewer know the worst situation and the end. On the face has the appearance of art, but in this case is nothing more than a lack of talent.
