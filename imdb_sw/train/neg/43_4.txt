This bad video was originally banned in the UK, and allowed in November last without a reduction. <br /> <br /> Plays Playboy Playmate of October 1979, Ursula Buchfellner. The opening opens and returns between Buchfellner and pictures of the foggy jungle. I don't know what that purpose was. It would be better to consider the location of the bathtub. Laura (Buchfellner) has been taken to remain in the jungle for compensation. Peter (Al Cliver - The Over, Zombie) is sent to seek and compensate. Of course, one of the artists (Antonio de Cabo) can pass the time effectively, sometimes (Werner Pochath) screams without looking. <br /> <br /> The compensation arrangement goes to hell, and Laura runs in the jungle. What? Peter will save her before eating? Oh, yes, there is an animal in this jungle. Why do you think it was a bad video! Muriel Montossé is found by Peter and his partner (Antonio Mayans - Angel of Death) on a kidnapper boat. Montossé is very worried. Peter leaves them and may be alone to look for Laura, who is now taken. They go through sex, and do not see the danger approaching. Hitting, anyone? Fighting between Peter and the evil devil (Burt Altman). Blood, decrease, cuts, lots of face, extraordinary width and the cannibal priest (Aline Mess), and line, "They stir up his heart," which is hilarious if you see the film.
