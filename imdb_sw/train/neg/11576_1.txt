See it at the great UCSB festival and there was * shocked * that won the gold gold prize. Not only me, considering the audience got mixed mixture to a piece. I thought there were many more better there, but then I learned that the judges were very rooted within the theory of film and other art crap. Although movies and edits are just short in the head, the story story is no more than a piece of your average pupils. It seems like "bad" pupils' films are needed to include one of these groups: sex, personal struggle, and frequent suicide - Nick and Kate are working and include all three. Please, be more original! Oh, and it may be my opinion of a stranger, but someone from montecito looks a little fake. Is there anything else?
