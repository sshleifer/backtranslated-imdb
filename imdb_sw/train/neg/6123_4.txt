When I was a young man watching this film for the first time, I thought it was one of the best movies made. Of course, the reason is Bo Derek and its various states to cancel in this film. However, now that I am an old man, I can honestly say this film is bad. Mind, Bo Derek is quite good, and he and the husband's director John Derek make sure you see him a lot. But when you take this feature out of the film, it becomes one very big journey. And Tarzan, well, he is all nerves if you think he should be, but when he sees Jane (ie Bo, of course) for the first time, he doesn't know what to think. This despite the fact that Bo is wearing a see-rain shirt, and her chest is shown. Tarzan would be the only young person in the world who would have that problem. If you are looking for a film on slobber on a clean naked body, then this can fill the ticket. If you are looking for a thoughtful, entertaining and valuable film, go somewhere else ... almost anywhere else!
