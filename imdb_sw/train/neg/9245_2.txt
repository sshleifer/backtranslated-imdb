This video guide was in 1995. It worked well! Matthew Perry and Jennifer Aniston have a great chemistry when they talk about what the Genesis button is doing. I am waiting for Microsoft to implement a full version of the full version and deleted events, Bill Gates's description, how the Windows 95 compares with Windows XP, and more! <br /> <br /> Total: 10/10 (Have you won at least the Golden Globe)
