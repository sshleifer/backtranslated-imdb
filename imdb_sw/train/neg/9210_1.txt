I would definitely forget about this film so far. This is the worst and worst test of hobby which I have ever seen. The message seemed to be: "Do not young people use their ideas, they can take games seriously, go mad and hurt people." I can only assume that non-thinkers of this piece thought that D&D style games are a form of bad worship or copper worship.
