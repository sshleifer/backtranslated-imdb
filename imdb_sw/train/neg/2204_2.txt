I love the pope. And mutants. And explosions. Theoretically, with these criteria in mind, HAMMERHEAD: Shark Frenzy must be the best movie ever. It is not. This creature looks like a village man from Power Rangers, and has almost equal to the rubber movement. This may be the same as the creators did not boast in its structure as they appear. That is to say, for a guy in a large ball suit in the flick of a point / scifi / fear that can benefit from certain secrets, shark gets a lot of time screens. In fact, they usually have problems with the wrong. I think you should think that it's so horrible even that this camera is losing. <br /> <br /> The camera goes to someone about being killed, the camera goes to the shark. The camera returns to someone about being killed, just now they are shouting and no hand. And so on. <br /> <br /> Break the cost is bad, acting is poor, and special effects are small, but writing is worse. Things happen so randomly that many people can be eaten, or something that can explode. Because I NEED YOU, people who made this movie really came in with more explosion = better ideas. People hit cars and there is a great explosion. They hit a helicopter, there is a great explosion. Barrels, rocks, trees, WHITE, all evaporate, so that the shark disappears disappears even at the end. Speaking of which, I don't care how a man is mad, I find it hard to believe that anyone who tries to make a half-shark half-shark sex with a woman to make babies shakaki is a good idea. That is, UNLESS that man is a mad scientist in this film. The worst thing is, the movie is random (and sometimes, boring) that even its evil cannot hold a long-term person's interest. It may be good for MST3K with your friends, but previously, if you are faced with this bad boy, make yourself a permit and change the channel.
