This is a kind of movie that wants to be good but it takes. First thing, hell is what punk is trying to do with school? I think children don't seem to recognize the influence of the situation. Deker guy tells the girl that she is under her role when asking why she wants to return to them but after that she gives a gun to the wheel chair and wants to go alone to fix the phone line. Where is the responsibility there? I understand poor actors should pay their food but why not just give them money that takes to make a movie of such stupidity or give that money with love. And no one of them knows how to purpose. Punch guy blows in no restaurant anywhere like mad. They all want to look professional but all exploits. Another thing I do not believe that there are no emergency problems in school children are trying several doors but all are closed. What happens if there is a fire and protection of the dead? It is unlawful that it does not receive emergency evacuation at school. However there is much more to say but it will be too long. I lost a lot of my life to look at the trophies.
