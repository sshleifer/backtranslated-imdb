It is so hard for me why Godard is taken seriously - and one Plus One is a good example of his ignorance as a film manufacturer and "intelligent". It is hard to accept that God really believed that Marxist and Maoist kant. Anyone with half of the brain can work on the bankruptcy of these forms and how many people have destroyed them and they continue to destroy even if the pastor was making his films to help them. As a filmmaker, ask yourself: Would you have a bad voice to read modern voices of concern to your audience, and then, when you can't think of anything else to do, the other voice sounds in the first voice, which had lost its audience after first 100 words in any case? Brilliant, Jean-Luc! For Godard insist on making a film with Stones Rolling: of course made; not you? It was the only guarantee of getting the impurities in the first place: a noisy sculptor and a noisy political noise. The book book of the book was not even worthy of the fringe theater, and it was the hatred of the mind of even the little children used to play in it - as it might seem easily. Voting for permitting friendly critics to assert that all this inexperienced trick was satire in the most common films of the film is not more than getting out to give those who feel God's poverty of understanding and pride for his listeners. It is interesting that a friend of God, Truffaut, and Nuit Americain, made the best film on film making forever, and Godard made the worst with Le Mepris! Unfortunately, Godard did not choose the Stones' track of mercy with the devil. It just happened to be a song that was working when the 'film' began to shoot at the Studios of the Olympic Barns.
