There are 2 good things that can say about "Fantasies" (all of which was mentioned by the former auditor as well): The beauty of Bo Derek, the beauty of poetry. She has shots in this movie where she offers even Catherine Zeta-Jones to run her money, and that's really a compliment. His creativity is short and reasonable, but just looking at his face is enough. B) Exotic Greek island, with its sunshine and clear blue water. Additionally, no story, talk is evil and sometimes without funny funny ("touched you where you are a woman!"), And the character of Peter Hooten is slimy jerk. Bo plays the naivete of his character, but again when you have to work with this bad conversation is the right to blame executives (the fact that he continued to say the word "conscience" in almost every sentence is a great anger). Oh, and although the film is placed on the Greek island, no Greek word was heard - it seems everyone there, from children to adults, speaks English at all times. (*)
