This is just a forbidden story with Edwin Torres. This movie does not follow the story of the book. And, there is a very uneven and original movie that you need to ask yourself if the screens of the screen had seen the first movie. <br /> <br /> Al Pacino (originally and still Carlito best) is released in the original prison. Here, Carlito retires with his wife in paradise. What happened Gail from Lorain, Ohio? In this phase, he is not spoken, and Carlito takes away and may marry another girl. <br /> <br /> Also, where is Kleinfeld? I think he was in the first book. <br /> <br /> I also like how Mr. Guzman has a completely different character in this film. She was Pachanga back in the days of Pacino. Now, he is Nacho Reyes, a killer from Cuba. I remember that Nacho Reyes had a greater role in the book. It has been time since I read the book, but where did Sean Comb's behavior come from? Also, I think this movie proves on the tension of color in Harlem which Torres wrote about. And, this group did not get the treatment they did in the book. They have also been deleted in this film. But, for the hard Punchant Avenue group is close for the second movie. The book told a good story. This film may have described the good news. This is just a great desire. Read the book. It's the best use of your time.
