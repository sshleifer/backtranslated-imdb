The last number is a quick and angry knockoff, without any features of redemption. It does not need to be supported and lost with many surprises, but it needs something! This is similar to a porn movie, where stories and discussions include 60 seconds at the beginning and the same time at the end. Unless this is worse, because you do not value your money. Failure of the mind, the failure of the race, and the bad waste of very good cars, which finds almost negative points to be proved in this film. Indeed, he is a fire, but who is struggling on a female screen? I feel like a director sitting there with a hat full of dialogue and conspiracy, and combining the 8th ball every time they beat the events. There is no bad person who community or knows anything about it without watching this film and enjoying the running events.
