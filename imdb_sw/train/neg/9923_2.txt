When I write this review in 2008, we are united in the remake culture.

Any nonprofit version of Bobpimpett's surreal Catholic 'Porky in Wackyland', 'Do-Do' urine takes a natural natural life by hitting all the colors on the original footage and adding some of the best identified by Friz Freleng. Freleng was the best director for the fight against Clampett's source material, although in fact no director can expect to come near Clampett-led attacker. In fact, then, 'Dough for Do-Do' is not just something more than a classic with an amazing new title set. For fans of cartoon as myself, similar to the colorization of 'Casablanca'.
