Take "Rambo," a mixture in some "Miami Vice," make a budget about 80 percent, and you have something that a few ten-year-olds can bring with them if they have a big house with enough access to "Penthouse." Cop with the former McBain Command (Busey, and the name as McBain, you know he is angry as they come) are recruited to get a US supertank that stolen & hidden in Mexico. Sent by the tanks of Sgt. Minister O'Rourke (Jones) & McBain's former love Devon (Fluegel), officer of the command & now meat for lost terrorists / spies / drugs, who have no sense of merit, blah, blah, blah. For the film action and unprotected sex, there is a practical disease and not very sex. The laughing laughter is that McBain is shot all the time & keeps, throwing as a gift. It seems that the authors did not see "Seven Sabau" ("The man for us is the one who gave him the same face"), and he did not think to give McBain even a pretense. Even for the executive budget, the production values ​​are poor, and shots off during negotiations with very small movements. The main puri, tank, is silly enough for Ed Wood production. Fluegel, who may be a blonde Julia Roberts (had a greater role in "Crime Story" than Julia!) She should go from a fearful fear of voting and return to instant information. Jones, who has been in many amazing movies, pretty much hit down here. Both he and Busey were perhaps out with the simple money and a couple of laughs. Look at a good character actor, the future of Danny Trejo ("Temperature," "Once in Mexico") in a dangerous, dangerous area. Even better with the pleasure of guilt, "Bulletproof" is still a strong blow to play when you leave your home but want people to think there is someone at home.
