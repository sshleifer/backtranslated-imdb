This is one of the movies you see in a video store that you should find because it looks just too bad. And in fact, we can't take much of it. There was a very fast pace. But we met a place where Robert Englund cheats the female protagonist (his name somehow reduces my mind at this time). SEARCH. I have never been looking at one place from the film often (I take forty or more). And I never laughed at my life. See, Englund has this thing to show his waist. I came to see the film a few months ago, but I can't stop laughing. However, the incident is the montage of shots - Englund taking the lingerie of the girl, Englund riding the naked horse, and a strange woman carrying the head of the snake. This is a perfect idea. You need to see it yourself.
