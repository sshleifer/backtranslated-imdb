This is a very bad movie and lose two hours of your life. At the same time it is bland and angry, with dirt and lots and lots of violence. However, dirt is not exciting, and violence is repeated again and tampers. Also, the plot is flimsy better, the characters are real and not planted, and acting are some of the worst I have seen. I have heard that this film should be interesting, but not. I did not laugh at once when I looked at it, nor did I even smile. The creators of this film tried to combine the movie's comedy and movie action, and they failed for all errors. Some of the worst films are incredible because they are bad, but this is not one of them.
