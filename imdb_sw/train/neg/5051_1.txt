I am accused and hated by people who claim that this film is very accurate about Vietnam, and it never did. This movie is on the top of all Vietnam wars as Rodney King beating is really about all police officers. Yes, bad things make (and what happened), but generally people there are like you and me. They have values, they do not kill the machine, not all do drugs. Evil was a discrimination in Vietnam, not a rule. They became more common than "hype" could lead you to faith. Oliver Stone has a knack for making movies showing Vietnam as a brutality of bloodshed, but it is based on the truth as Star Wars. If you believe honestly Vietnam's behavior, make yourself a permit and learn the truth. The fact: Viet Cong and NVA did worse on South Vietnam than all US soldiers in the US Army Army. Fact: The soldiers in World War II made the enemy worse than the Vietnam soldiers did, and they were accepted when they got home. Good Americans who served the country in Vietnam deserve our respect; although the war was fought negatively because of the political stance, no one could ask more from our soldiers, and it is a great freedom to assume that this kind of "true truth" is a way that the truth was.
