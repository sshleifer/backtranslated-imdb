This is one film below. It has no real plot. We have never been attracted to motivation, except the property. The characters are some of the worst actors who ever put on the film. The threat seems to be unusual, but then managed by these three great men. Why do they do what they do; to be afraid of other members of the group? I don't know. There is a mist from the mist machine around the hall and everyone looks scared. What? Does something? I don't know. There are weaknesses for its own sake. I always wonder to see this in this old film. Things are put down in this regard today. However, people move around like chicken, ready for copper. They have no plan; no resources; nothing. There are approximately five films in the film. Who are these people and "are" there is a spirit or demon. What happened to other people? I encourage anyone to tell me this with any confidence. What a mess.
