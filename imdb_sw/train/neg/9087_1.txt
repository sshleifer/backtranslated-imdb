Wacana is honorable for boo but the audience at the Toronto film festival dropped an excitement to the theater that they would weigh this 0 or 1 film on their ballot papers. The premise is that a modern filmmaker describes the 17th century story about the love of pastors and pastors put in the past when Druids were spiritual leaders. Working in the third period is a great opportunity to introduce a solution that includes both uniform and non-standard clothes and spiritual services that include very bad poems. Lovers are divided and envious of the principles of operating ethics that the cross-crossing conditions and conditions occur. The film can be a hammer like Monty Python, which is also closely related, but Rohmer's efforts are very flat. The audience laughed with a joke of eyes but otherwise shouted loudly. The end comes all in the rush and is really bad. This is a small film and waste your film time.
