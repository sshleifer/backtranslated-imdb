My wife and I have all thought this water-of-TV-TV-TV (BBC) of Manhattan Murder Mystery ... which itself is good, but not good. The story has little tension between character or chemistry, and not a lot of conspiracy. Allen's behavior is a kind of walk around the mouth, and Hugh Jackman and Scarlett Johannsson don't have much more to do. It's very good, I must say. The role of Ian McShane is the visibility of coming. The first thing happened to me is "I wonder how much the BBC had to pay Woody Allen to evict from Manhatttan?" They must have a financial need, and they need their appeal to extend their audience more than the two-star market. I give you this 4 star star instead of 3 because it is a low-pitch noise. If you want anything to have when you discover or choose your team's collection, this will work. I can't pay to rent again.
