I would cast pretty much however the story of the kind opened rather slow. Danny Glover is doing a good job to make you wonder if he is a bad person. Meanwhile, other characters are only part of the story. Dennis Quaid did not have a great chance in the story if he could have it. I thought the first situation was a little over the worst compared to how the story was revealed. I would like to watch it again though. I scored 5 (want me to get 5.5 rate)
