I will put this short, because I know I don't need to say a lot. "Alive" is a fantastic small film that attracts some, but I've got to be awesome bland from the very beginning. The film did not make too little of the characters to have fun and the story sometimes became so strong that I had completely lost interest. As I said, I know others liked it, but I've got Kitamura "Alive" to be nothing but - a disabling, boring event has been hidden as flick-provoking sci-fi flick. I felt like I was young in watching this film, based on its impressive inspiration and exciting insurance coverage. <br /> <br /> My comment? Accepting for the most fun of the most exciting of "Versus" or its 2004 attack "Godzilla: Final War". Do not lose a good movie to think of someone, but certainly it was not. There was a nary time that I was worried about the same event being done in this very sermon, a heavy-movie chat. <br /> <br /> If you want to talk about something ... talk about boring.
