This so-called prequel is a remake made poorly for the best version of Class Risk. Plots are the same as most of the script. I liked the book, and I loved the first movie, but I won't go to the third movie. The useless flag among the two main characters in the prequel was quite predictable and odd, and ... I can just emphasize how bad the movie was. If you don't want to take my word for it, just look, and you'll see what I said. If you have read a review that says 'If you love first, you will love the second' reason only because it is why it is so! Although the plot is not very good. They took many verses from the first movie, Its hard to tell what film you are looking at.
