Battlestar Gallactica was so great because it had a sharp writing, looking good, excellent actors, and interesting stories ... AND yes, they had men and women of fire riding around and outside the uniform. It is only idle. Writing laziness. Employees are smoking cigarettes. The external process that damages the feeling of being elsewhere (yes, that's the Ford Focus backward). Vote and lots of youth. WOMEN to consider women's nakedness (but in the past. I am sure you will be cut in a row) with a view of the men's sign in the towel. No characters only except Polly Walker listened to me completely. At an hour and a half, I was still wondering when it would be over. <br /> So what exactly should be repeated? False science? It's very light on that. Actors? Apart from the beautiful turn of Polly Walker, there is no very interesting thing done here. There is not even any "fire" in the cast, except for Esau, although for the least has already become old, since he has more than 25. <br /> I loved BSG. I was worried when I heard about Caprica, and unfortunately, I think I'm right. I predict run for a very short time as a series unless they strengthen their pencil more on SciFi and get a job doing it more than OC on another planet.
