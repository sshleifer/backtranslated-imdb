The features that I provide BOOM are just because of the beautiful pictures of Sardinia and Rome. Otherwise, this is for the severe penalty of ELIZABETH TAYLOR (its phase phase), and RICHARD BURTON (its phase of miscast). Tennessee Williams wrote "Milk Training Does Not Stop Here" and should be very interested in this play - but it seems, he was alone. Taylor was reportedly disliked and Burton needed money. However, it is similar to the bean hill and Taylor after strengthening and deleting it in its amazing way, the smokers' staff and the exchange of the worst conversation of the child and not less than NOEL COWARD who appears to be a guest from another film when it finally appears. It is therefore a camp that among Taylor's fans seems to be "must see" something of something. But if you can go through this without drinking from your hand, you are going ahead of me. Unfortunately, this is a film that shows the end of Taylor being taken seriously as a film actor, even after winning two Oscars. For Burton, it was similar to the disaster and critics called it BOMB. Judge yourself if you say it.
