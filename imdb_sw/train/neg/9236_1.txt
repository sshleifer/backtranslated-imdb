I am among the millions who feel like the fans of Cary Grant, but I can't think of one reason to recommend this movie. Many fans will agree that Katharine Hepburn was good at expelling and contracting Cary Grant in Bringing a Child. wonderful, but I thought that it was a very simple explanation. The Franchot tone walked this way as if it was hungover. The impact of the epidemic is one thing. This film is a catastrophic catastrophe. This is not recommended for 10 views and I do not know why that is a requirement. <br /> <br /> Unless you want to torture someone, do this in width.
