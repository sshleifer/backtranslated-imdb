Unless the person is looking at me, I don't really know what this film is approaching. It looks like a picture with a message but it's far from it. This movie describes the untrue story of the New York journalist and about its problems. And, that's basically all. When the agent plays with Pacino, one must think that it must be something important. But it takes no hard thinking to know how useless and lighter this movie is. For one of the best artists in the world, Al Pacino, this is the second movie of the year (another is "Simone") which deserves the name "more stimulating and meaningless" year. So, what's going on, Al?
