Considering the original version of 'The Haunting' film is in my top ten films' I came to this situation with horror. be shy. nature was scary to me as a child for one reason! you see anything Robert Wise used the camera-work creativity and good lighting to generate fear and this is why the task. like Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta Jones to do something different. This film should look just like the model of the butchery studio!
