Neko Vigalondo is very popular in Spain. He is a kind of bad showman who can make you feel ill ... It is very embarrassing. She had made ads on TV, and I remember one that Nacho was looking for Paul Mc Carney near Madrid (business was about CD Carney collection). This small movie is like Nacho's business: bad news, bad conversion, and bad displays. I can't believe that this is a fun film like this was in The Kodak Theater. Poor Oscar ... And he could make this film because of his wife, the producer of this 7:35, a very beautiful woman connected with the business men of the Spanish TV.
