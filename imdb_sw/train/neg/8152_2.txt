"Do not drink Water" is an unpredictable film. It depends on Broadway's 1966 play by Woody Allen. It's star Jackie Gleason, the wisdom of comic behind "Honeymooners". Director, Howard Morris, has appeared in several comedies of Mel Brooks (Life of Stinks, High Anxiety, Movie Movie) and has made a mark in animation (the characters he has shown include Gopher from "Pooh", Jughead (Archie) and Beetle Bailey) caused? I think the problem is that the premise is played very carefully to work effectively. Allen's original play was the language-for-cheek, that's why it worked for Broadway and the Allen remake of 1994. Screenplay and R.S. Allen and Harvey Bullock hits premature deaths and makes many changes from the original play. Make Gleason's wife's air in this version when she was a woman with a head in nature is just one example of why this doesn't work. <br /> <br /> Acting is not very good. Gleason does a good job with the material, but can't save this. Gleason was a comic specialist, but also good performers as shown in "The Hustler" and "Soldier in the Rain". His design would work here, but the lousy script doesn't even give him a chance. Very bad. Estelle Parsons's Airhead's wife will expel the nuts after 20 minutes. See how it will take for you want to resist. This is also a shame because he is also a good actor, with two unique performances in "Bonnie and Clyde" and "Rachel, Rachel" None of the other actors are doing very well. Woody Allen hated this film so much that he cut the film in 1994 and himself and Julie Kavner (Marge Simpson) in heads. They can call all the right details and the film itself is a comic jewel. Finally on the video after many battles on the right. Get out and get the version. All of the 1969 nature is good to evict unwanted visitors who are increasingly inviting. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * out of 4 stars
