In fact, this looks like a good idea. Steve Martin, Goldie Hawn, and John Cleese in Neil Simon's comedy. Where can you go? See the movie, and you'll see. <br /> <br /> Indeed, Martin, the guide, has been sent. He is not making a great slapstick known for, from the movies as "The Jerk", but instead has a variety of characteristics that does not work. Hawn, without anyone playing, is awesome. Cleese is the only member even unpleasant. <br /> <br /> To remove it, the plot is very good. I can't say how much can be changed, but the characters seem to have little bit of common sense. They call information through New York, they don't do anything right, and unfortunately, there is nothing interesting. Not just a whole premise is impossible, it seems to give a message that people who do not live in New York are not very bright, the theme is repeated on all films. <br /> <br /> In the summary, instead of seeing this, go to the previous "Uninstall" again.
