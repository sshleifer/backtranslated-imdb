Four years after making his first and snoozer text of "Welcome To L.A", Alan Rudolph shows us what he wanted from Hollywood to become one of the boys. "Roadie" is a boy-perfect fracas with brawls of barroom, harpyes, horny, Car Carney in wheelchair wheel ... and Meat on the wheel. Meat (play Travis W. Redfish!) In fact there is a delightful presence on the screens, and perhaps in a small role (in the best film) can be humorous, but the Zalman King script is full of redneck humor and no help Food the meat is being examined and ethical. Alice Cooper, Roy Orbison, Hank Williams, Jr., and Blondie all seem - and all feel embarrassed. In fact they should, "Roadie" is one bad journey. NO STARS from ****
