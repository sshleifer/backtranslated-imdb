We brought this film as a shock to a friend, and it could be our worst soup. Film is impossible to appear, and acting is bad. The worst of the child who has been used by Hasslehoff to improperly perform. The plan is embarrassing and with the points we were going through we were wondering what hell is going on. It tries to be bad in places but it is delicious. It is very bad
