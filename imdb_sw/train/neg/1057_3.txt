Sorry, I had great hope for this movie. Unfortunately, it was too long, thin and very weak to hold my thoughts. When I discovered the whole movie was really just about an old man dedicating his dream, I felt desperate. Certainly it would be a tool to bring us into something greater, the most appropriate thing. Therefore, do not buy a large drink or you will be able to run into the rest room. My children did not enjoy either. Ah well.
