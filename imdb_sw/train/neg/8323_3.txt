From the beginning this film had a few errors. The main character played by Hayden Christensen is a small legacy who has inherited the wealth and power of his father, and struggles to fill his father's shoes and cut the mother of the strings (and co-co-executive) very well. He also has a problem of having a heart condition and waiting in a song that is a registered organ donor. There are also small backdrops that your first instinct is to ignore more important later, like his friendship with his surgeon (Terrence Howard) and his girlfriend and middle girl (Jessica Alba). Feet of an unfamiliar story, but not bad enough to destroy the movie. Certainly "you vey!" when it was the name of Lena Olin's character. A struggling woman named Lilith ... trick! <br /> <br /> Surveillance displays were not considered entirely. I appreciated that, people who find scenes of scary surgery can not. Fear of being awake during anesthesia was done well at first. You are looking forward to such pain as Christensen screams in through the chest and chest. When shouting from the trailers then comes where when he is one of the few unlucky eyes while anesthesia, it is also lucky to be helping him learn that his surgery team is planning to kill him. The biggest losses, however, are highly predictable and send a movie in a conspiracy with its small signals that existed but he, like us, missed the original. There are two more twist at the end involving his relationship with his mother. One is a surprising sign with Olin, which comes as a surprising due to poor writing. The other is a mystery about the family's time that was very visible and useless. The original drama of anesthesia understanding is lost in an incorrect text game. There is one last attempt to bring back that falls flat, taking the whole movie with it.
