Honey, I refused the children's franchise was a great deal and not to mention the most popular. I loved honey, leaving the children when I was young. It was the original story and it was an exciting plot! The sets were very awesome and they were seen as having enjoyed each other's company. Now Honey, I beat the child was so stupid, so I think they want to come back to the story that everyone loved. Basically, Adam is much older now and the mother is going to leave her husband and their children. But when Wayne's favorite thing is threatened with garbage, he wants to cut it down and put it, but he and his brother come in. But when they return after forgetting to give some medicine to their child, they are found in the machine too, leaving children at home alone! <br /> <br /> The program is silly, but as I said, it was only a family film that I think others can get a kick. Original honey, I have left the Children is the best, I think everyone can agree. The third thing was not bad, I would recommend this at least on Honey, I hit the Kid's movie, it was at least a little fun. <br /> <br /> 4/10
