If there was a film that deserves a lot of fat is a spoon. I love zombie movies and even worse it is usually something that does them but not dangerous. In fact I started to feel angry to watch this film because it is very poor, I can't believe people involved with it, of course, think this is acceptable. <br /> <br /> No plot and not plot is cut off by scenes of sadism and spanking. People do not take, act or in any way resemble human beings. The whole movie is also stacked in two adorned rooms that are identical to the place they should be. Anything is unnecessary mess, never going anywhere and when the zombies finally turn around they look at the litter and they don't have much. <br /> <br /> I could make a movie better than this, so Can I? you and so can someone who has never seen a movie before. It's sad and of course the worst movie all the time. Indeed, the worst movie of all time. You know in a way that only positive comments offer this 10/10 and encourage you to buy a DVD. I can't think anyone who is unwilling to think this really is a good film, it's awesome. <br /> 0/10 and that's generous.
