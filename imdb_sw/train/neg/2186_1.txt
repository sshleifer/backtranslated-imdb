... but it will make you wonder if we had the first chance! This film is very bad as any fear of today's horror. One goes around with half women, trying to determine who will kill so that he can give her a new partner. One part involves a person around and around on a set of three minutes, wearing everything that should be better than 10 liters of blood. The film also tries to create a sense of what the husband does to his partner is right and contrary to nature, but movies are not suitable for the audience to damage any feeling of shock or anger. With the dark and no destruction, this movie can not even get its head straight - the forehead says "the brain that will not die," but the last attributes are written as "headless."
