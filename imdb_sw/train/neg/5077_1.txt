It was shown on the currently deleted post from another IMDb user that anyone who can see "Medusa Touch" should warn about the location that remembers on 11 September 2001, terrorist attacks in NYC. But I hope anyone who reads this will investigate this warning. Despite attracting the player (producer Elliott Kastner who gave "Harper" and "Long", the producer of the producer Arnon Milchan gave an Oscar partner named "LA Confidential" and the image writer John Briley won Oscar for "Gandhi") and international cast, I got "Touch Medusa" to be a heavy, emotional burden. It was hard-directed, unsupported and used. It tried to reflect on the type of 70 television telekinetic. The movie fails for many numbers. Please see "Carrie" and underrated "Fury" (both directed by Brian DePalma). They were two entertaining and exciting exhibitions related to the same issue.
