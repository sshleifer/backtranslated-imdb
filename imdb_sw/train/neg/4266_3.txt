Certainly NOMAD has some of the best horse-riding screens, swordplay, and photo-location displays that you will be able to see, but this is not what makes the film good. It helps but the story focuses on these things. And that's where Nomad walks. The story has been hit, giving the meaning that it has been cured just to make the movie "cool" which "looks" good. Not to mention that most of the main characters do not come from the scene in which this story is performed (and it is obviously obvious by names like Lee and Hernandez). If filmmakers like to introduce us to culture such as Jugars and Kazaks, they are used more effectively by administrators / supervisors who look at the parts. Fighting, prophecy, brotherly love and respect, loving interest that separates our "heroes", all of them are touched but in a very limited time and screen time many viewers will beat them for a series of The second war, the location of the second stage, or the beautiful beauty of the landscape. It is important to say that there were major changes to Nomad during his publication, especially the director and cinema movies. Ivan Passer (director) was appointed by Sergei Bodrov, and Ueli Steiger (graphic) was changed by Dan Laustsen. In one respect, Laustsen seems to have a better eye since his vision of the country made a final cut that we see here. Certainly good. However, changing over to Bodrov as a director may not be a wise choice. From what I see here, the focus is on war and not people, which I think comes from the eyes of Bodrov and not the Passer. True cruelty. The most embarrassing feature is that this could be a very fantastic film, with all the actions and styles. Unfortunately, over-ups apparently decided that the action was what was needed and taking the cheap way (mentally) <br /> <br /> Although I can't give this film a good rating, it's worth looking only for the exciting work of movies. But that's all.
