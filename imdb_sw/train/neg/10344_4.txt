We saw this film running at TCM hours. Several problems with films were clear from what I saw. Firstly, adults were not age when children did for 10 years. Several films had problems to continue and for some reason the actors who played the younger son appeared as old when 10 years passed. The text I saw was not 20 minutes or so, at least a great gap and black screens were visible. It's very bad, because although the script left something desirable, Bergman & Russell all did well in the film in their roles. It's a great chunk is not there, but what is here is seen. I just loved that all was wrong. The script does not mean a bit of the character of Bergman when it is sent when young children but then returned to take care of them when they are adults? Some time lines are not worth meaning. There is a stock market risk similar to 1929 but children are fighting in World War 1. All actors and people in this film are good. I wonder what was in the 20 gap of the film I couldn't see if it wasn't there.
