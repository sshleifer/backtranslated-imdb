I saw this movie during his time, when having a child out of marriage not only destroyed your life, but put your child as a bastard. In these days of 'mother' who might seem to be too far away, but it was very real. And I'm not mad about laughing at someone he likes, either. Of these two problems I had trouble finding this amazing film. At that time I didn't know who led or the wonderful qualities he had. I knew who Betty Hutton was, and she made us worried because she was very independent. I loved "Bringing a Child", but I see this film just shy. I'm sure a punch in some church work perhaps was spiked, but I was the one I needed to drink after looking again. The idea a girl would need to drink to 'get married' and get pregnant just added to trouble. The whole city can turn you under these conditions, so the result of this movie is a wonderful part. Of course, hit me, I don't like "It's a Wonderful Life" either.
