Earlier today I have argued on why so many people complain about modern films that I have met with curious information: "The development of behavior in new movies is still not good or interesting as it was." According to the film (s) involved, this can be attributed to several factors, sometimes the generic effects of generic and waste derived from Hollywood as a world war, but in a high-top case, an uncomfortable bid of social definition and the prohibition of imposing The "art" back on the movies, is the movies like Dogs that have the blame. <br /> <br /> I tend to be very patient with movies, regardless of whether it is light or meaningless I get them (from good, as long as Andrei Rublev and Dogville, for those I have found to be painful to stay for Alpha Dog and Wild Wild West). I close this movie off 45 minutes, which is 30 minutes more than I should be. I had no intention of any characters and found nothing more than a thin curtain of pessimism. In an attempt to say something about social dregs, this film also comes to be self-defense, use, and use very wisely. In fact, I have seen many movies that distract from one subject, but there is the best film out there about people who are in trouble, happy, Gummo, Kids, Salo, Storytelling, Irreversible) which actually contains deep depth of emotion and personality. Dogs were not destroyed for the eighth generation to the community, and they chose to ignore any true understanding of how people are true, and instead of choosing to be an unpleasant, irregular attempt in the work of "art." This is not an attribute of an unknown or clever inquiry in social concepts, it is just awesome and there is nothing deserving of attention.
