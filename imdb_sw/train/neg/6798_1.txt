This is the worst movie I saw. Everyone involved is worthy of shame. Everybody. Ice-T is sad, the discussion is so bad, and hockey is not describing the performances of each actor in this film. The program declines significantly from the Executive Decision, but compared to the Air Rage, the Executive Decision is the Academy Awards. I have never been discouraged when watching the film. Rage of the air should be burned and its ashes closed in the vault never see the light of the day again. Anyone who has said he must go and wash the badness of the movie off bad from them. The best part of this film is likely to come out of the end, while credit is enclosed. This was a very bad movie I saw. Ice-T should be connected to the Law and Procedure, and other people in this film should retire early or commit suicide. In any case, it should never try again on the film.
