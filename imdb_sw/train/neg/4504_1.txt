Slow, exciting, and one! Give a good and clich√©d talk, a bad story, and a good direction from Mr Marshal! Common and predictable stories of the most popular forms of adultery from Asia, have no heart, new knowledge, and depth. The leading character appears out of place because of its little contact lenses and pony. Lexicon used by geishas seems to be forced and very little modern for their little exposure in the way of education. The story continues and continues for hours trying to convince this little girl, who has a flat, who hit the flat of Asia is the last Geisha, in fact they say in the film "She is intended to be a story" I say a hard case! The movie is just boring, it's nice to look, has a very short time more interesting if you can get it by going out to cigarettes. Basically, if you believe the messenger believes the message, and this girl doesn't fill the shoe! Borin, boring, ruka!
