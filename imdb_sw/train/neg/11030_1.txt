I recently watched this film at the 30'Th Gothenburg Film Festival, and being honest it was on the worst films I've ever had unfortunately checking. Do not make a mistake, there are bad films and bad entertainment (e.g. "Manos? Hands of fate") and then there is a bad bad film. (This falls in the last category). Style was not strange, and not in a good way. It felt like a camera had deliberately separated everything out of the direction (except a free shooting shot). The executives were as bad as soap operators but not as bad as porn actors, and gave the impression that every line came to be a surprise to them. The only aspect of redemption was to look for a wounded killer, looking at Jason Vorhees session from "Friday 13'Th". Plot was very poor, and his end was bad. I would just recommend this movie to anyone who needs an example of how awesome film should not be seen as, or maybe sleep.
