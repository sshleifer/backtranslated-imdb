Okay, so I just saw the movie, though it happened last year ... I thought that it was usually a good movie, except for the story, which was stupid and horrible ... First and foremost, we don't know anything about creation, why it seemed, wtf what are they doing in the world, and in fact, they have been in the world before we were or did not just come from space? Second, the role of the butcher to maintain the order is simply created ... In fact, underground to the lowest center can be what? There were only such creatures, so I think instead of killing innocent people free, they could only plant tactical bombs, or maybe clear and Nuke would work. I know it looks funny and it is, but I don't see the killing of people as mandatory ... Third, Leon does like Superman jumping on the train and fighting Vinnie Jones, who was a great and big way in stature. Then again, when he meets the operator he does nothing and works as a wimp, looking at all the detestable. I mean, the midwife had a good support (lol), but if Leon was a hero he could go on the road ... I mean he risked his life first, then it doesn't matter when he has to have it. He would die like a hero but he lives like a slick ... this may be a case, but not after showing the very braveness earlier on ... Then, anything ... come! This was a city with a highway, I cried for the possibility of having other boys except that a woman, other police stations, this was really a kind of silly ... All in all, great act with Vinnie Jones, an interesting idea because back which is not actually built entirely ... By the way, what sign up on chest chest? Vinnie Jones can not do for others ...
