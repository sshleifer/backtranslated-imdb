I can't for my life explain what the popularity of the television show of children, power rangers are over. I have never understood why children who had no views liked this show for the first time, since the characters seem so idiotic and they don't care about anything. Clothing looks at the smell, like many colored spandex that people tend to go to the gym. <br /> <br /> What exactly is the purpose of this show anyways, but for children to learn how to fight and solve their problems? Is it on cuts on bad hair, and clothes on this show however? Do not say this show still plays on cable television, so that only money to teach children how to fight when they disagree on a particular problem. It is the best entertainment for children today, hoping they are not like gullible as children of the 1990s who were watching this show. Oh, and what is related to the hormone hormone homologue between red and green rangers?
