I have seen the already amazing stories, but these buildings are so incredible that they are so close to ignorance. A rich young man and a young man is growing heart after his marriage, and somehow preaches his own surgery and his conspiracy to kill him. Even if there is a medical definition for such a thing that happens later is a mix of dialogue between ... say ... soul? ... perhaps a real life where a dedicated mother will do everything to save her son's life. There is no shadow of stress or exciting, just a combination of a rough and simple plot and a series of interactions that can never happen in life. This does not mean that the film is not of the best quality - in fact the job-time director Joby Harold is doing a good job in leading a good team of actors that includes Hayden Christensen in his first role after losing his Anakin Skywalker dress, Jessica Alba with knowledge and skill. The greatest of Lena Olin. They would all deserve the best story.
