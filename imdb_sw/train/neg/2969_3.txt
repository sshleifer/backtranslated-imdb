Stories are very reliable and powerful. The technical part of the movie is quite good. Even to lead it. The main problem is with castings, which turned out that the movie has almost another local and constant clich√© with a significant lack of impact and a greater lack of feeling. In addition to the small role of the father, Rafael (very played by Asian Dayan), all other participants were unfortunate not better. The role of the old blind girl, played by Taly Sharon, was clean but without power as a leading position. Therefore, the data he did was to be gentle and low. There was a time and times that seem more like practice then a real movie. But after all it is a good step to start from making great improvements in the future.
