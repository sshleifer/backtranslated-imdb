This is a terrible thing. Ben Affleck's character is self-confident and confident - punch-in-the-nose fratboy sadistic. And he is a romantic HERO! His cartoonish character does not change from beginning to end, but his money finally allows him to buy happiness. If I was a Helper, I would like to weigh more faith, but I'm not a Helper. <br /> <br /> We capitalists like a little magic Christmas regularly. This is not magic. I don't know what it is. It's very bad. And it's a bad waste of talent. O'Hara has been made me laugh hysterically since the late 70s. Gandolfini. Set. All these people were used. If Ben was out of equation, these people might have a better dream.
