I knew that this film would not be wonderful, but I thought I would give you a chance. I am a fan of Luke Wilson so I thought it was capable. Unfortunately, much of the film discussion was very fiction and beauty. I think Aquafresh gave money for the production of the film because they were concentrating some ideas. There is a shot where the Aquafresh sign comes to you that you can't help but see. Maybe they should be aiming to write and do more than we can stop Aquafresh products in movies without people angry. The movie had its time, but I'm glad I didn't spend $ 9.50 to see in the playground.
