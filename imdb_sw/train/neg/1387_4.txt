It is difficult to believe the "action" full film of Jet Li could be bad, but this was a garbage transcendant. The program is an amalgam of the rest of Hong Kong. Military work is special effects and no human talent. It is a comic story of a comic book about a group of super-human soldiers who will be killed because they are not sure, one of their numbers (Li) stops an unsuspecting army and builds life as a library the pacifist. Saved murderers raise up the Austin quality of the world to take over the world, and Li offers his new life to save the world. The version I saw was well-known, and that would strengthen the enthusiasm of a thin-thin plot and a book of comic-book 25 cent special effects. But suspect even the Ninja-Turtle-looking children 8 years would have found this young and hollow.
