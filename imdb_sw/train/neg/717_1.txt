It meant to be parody on LOTR-Trilogy. But this was one of the most horrible movies I have ever seen. Bad work, bad screenplay, everything wrong. THIS IS MY CHILDREN VISION. I have no second doubts that there are people who would like this feeling of "humor", but there have been more excellent parodies on movies from qualified directors like Mel Brooks or Zucker Brothers. I work in the cinema and the DVD Store and the success of this movie was the same in both places: In the film it was good (but no bigger) achievement during the first two weeks, then, when the inspection of those who did not see very good, the movie dropped very fast. In DVD sales it was good for a while but nobody asked again. In the last decade, two of the worst movies I have seen is Thing Ring and Torque. I can't decide who was the worst, but I'm glad that there are very good movies so I don't need to think too much about this question.
