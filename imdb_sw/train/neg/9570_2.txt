For the first time for years, I have seen the need to enter the IMD today today to isolate this film by writing a review, because it was under such consideration. The plan seemed amazing when I was reading it, I expected surprisingly small secrets, clakingrophobic phantom hunting. Unfortunately, they all find a lot of water and a love story, which breathes love and so many emerges with dentist-ignorant "no-says-things-like-this-exception-negative-movies" -dialogs that are sad only. <br /> <br /> Here is a quick run down to the worst offenses of this movie piece: <br /> <br /> - Script depends largely on the interaction with the useless and unnecessary ignorance of the main characters that is just laughable. No, in fact, is irritating. And lazy <br /> <br /> - Related to it: Cheap thrills. Long-term "time" time. <br /> <br /> - Main characters. In fact, it seems that the scribe has never had a real human experience in real life, but instead has acquired all his skills from bad movies. Therefore, its characters are boring, clich√©s second generation does not die. They are a plot of plot, owners of a place without a little personality. They are "male and female in breaking-up who love to love". Never seen one before except for 100,000 movies and is no longer available or enjoyable. Consider the fare of blandest two-dimensional Hollywood and you have found. There is no one character in this film which is far away, charming, or interesting. Unconditional resolution, which is very common and requires only one nudge to fall, although the word "resolution" can be ill here, because the movie is a water mix that does not make it anywhere. In time, however, you don't care anymore. The third part of the film I made quickly, because it could not focus on. Well, that's right. Anything that frees this film has, it all gets buried under a failure. Don't look at this turd.
