My name Name of Humility depends on the part that takes over one page in the 10-page Blaise novel called Night of the Morningstar. It describes an event in which the Hairdresser (17 in the book, mid 20 years in the film) emphasizes his leadership in the war on the casino. If this has been installed before the real adventures of Blaise on his reliable side Willi Garvin is not on the film. That is one of the major problems as the relationship between Blaise and Garvin is always one of the most interesting things of the novel and the long-running player. Another problem is that the film is very strange because it is only one small part that was hit on the screen. Composing is the same but Alexandra Staden can not persuade as a heroine and actually very old for the role of playing gently. I see the feeling that this film was a quick and dirty solution if not losing the rights of the Blaise franchise.
