After the famous "The Andy Griffith Show" TV show, Don Knotts gave the film a bold attempt for a series of interesting comedy series of comic buttons. Unfortunately, "Astronaut Mbaya", which was hit with cheap (as it was many Knotts movies), is worse than the rest of her. Don plays schnook a small town who gets accepted for the Astronaut Training Camp ... but not as a candidate for space travel - they want him as their new editor! Some may say the weak satire has used the new compensation of Americans for a new era of technology, but the flick is really just an excuse to hold up restless children. It goes with a good start, and places to keep well and nostalgic, but it becomes more spirit and idiotic. * from ****
