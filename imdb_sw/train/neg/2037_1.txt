If I could give zero, I'd like to change my mind and give-10 instead. Modernly frightening without a plot of film, it does not mean what happens. BORING ONLY PLAIN. Please don't waste your money on this. Please! This movie would have done well if it showed the real story of the killer of the zodiac, but nopes, I didn't feel anything unless we look at it. Are you interested and renting some classic movies instead, it is better to watch the movies you saw as 3-4 times better than watching this trick! I don't understand why people even bother to make those movies when they know it won't do it. The Zodiac killer should be called 'Boriac killer' rather !!!
