This movie feels so EMPTY. EVERY location in the movie a large number of actors on the screen is like 10. Because everything that is in front of a blue screen never has never had extra and a movie just feels amazing. <br /> <br /> ACTING was not recommended! It is very clear this was in front of the blue screen because all action events can see actor / actor wondering around half running when they should be running for their lives. Spoilers: You will also find yourself playing your head watching the movie. At one time on the Captain's home base they have 100 birds on a plane. They have warned about the attack ... Why do they do? no. All the birds can be beaten and the man who fought back is the Captain of the Sky. At the end of the movie you see hundreds of plains removing eventually ... but what are they doing? No ... the film is over ...
