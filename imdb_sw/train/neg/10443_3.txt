I saw a preliminary investigation of this film in New York and I, along with my friends and all the audience, were very disappointed. The movie was not so bad it was good; was alive as the lives of the victims of snakes. Samual L. Jackson appeared surprised by many ways and the effects of snakes were lame. It reminds me of one of the filFi cheesy movies, except the fun of this movie was not funny or even camping. It all seemed worn, flat, and more formula. I am afraid to say that I really think Anaconda was more happy. It is easy to understand that SOAP recognizes that it is a piece of s * and it plays with it, but what the film is not able to set up is a script that is guilty of any charge. It is the worst kind of movie worms: it is not recommended.
