I bought a DVD version of this movie on my wife's recommendations that she liked on the TV that she saw on television. But the DVD version was a tragedy. The lights were bad for the missing events and they were all exciting. On one occasion Adele sleeps, and once we are cut off from another location - to come in the middle of the sentence - where it's next night. People like Grace Poole and Mason have never been brought, leaving someone to ask if they could do for a few minutes during the film. We've seen the DVD we saw was released by Platinum Disc Corp and even at 6.32 $ it was a gyp. <br /> <br /> Beware of what kind of movie you buy! We are sending this back.
