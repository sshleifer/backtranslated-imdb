Michael Callan has a photographer who looks, however, to be seen as a “capture” perfect for any woman around him; What? can this be anything to do with the fact that he also co-produced film? He is a "hero" who is very difficult to feel and so, so the movie is in trouble since the beginning. However, problems cannot end. It has a TV production code (see the soil head or something, close to the end), and the last cheats in a way that I can't open, if anyone wants to see the movie (very impossible). Let's just say that the killer knows more than we were informed to know he knows. (* 1/2)
