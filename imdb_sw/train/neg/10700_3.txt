The film is about Mr. Christopher Strong (MP - Parliamentary MP - played by Colin Clive) and his character with Amelia Earhart's character played by Katherine Hepburn. Until they met, he was a very devout man but when he met an unusual but interesting Hepburn, "he could not help himself" and fell in love. You can tell them, because they look so far away from the position and speak firmly about how their unconditional love is painful. In fact, this is a very dated film and impossible to watch. Part of the problem is that in the days before the Code, filthy films were common. Further, even if you agree to this subject of a moral defendant, the full sappiness of the conversation makes sounds like a 19th-century novel of romance ... and is so bad for it. Stick and hard to love the characters (after all, Clive's wife is a beautiful woman and did not make anyone harm) makes this a waste of time. About the only interesting feature of this film is Hepburn's costume wear in the early area where wearing mothi's clothes! You need to see it to believe - and it looks like one of the Bugaloos (unknown, but it suits to clarify).
