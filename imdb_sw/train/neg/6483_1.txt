It was not good. The characters had no development and the personality was from the memory I had in the previous film which was different from 'new' behavior (or lack thereof). I thought that the opening area was a dream and Ariel for a strange reason. It was bad. It just reminded me of all the disappointed characters at the Disney-everyone center who is involved in the story flying from the point up to shy exhibitions without any connection. <br /> <br /> The despair section was awesome-not-interesting songs, not surprising. In the original Ariel it had an amazing and powerful voice and all the songs are interesting and fun. You remember them and want to sing them. But the songs in this movie were not created for at least; it is as they speak in the voice of the singing-sound of the sound-weak, desperate. Sinawa and want-sing-their-feeling that ever get from the Disney film. It is like nobody who wanted to make this film, so they did not make an effort. . . This movie would require a new line of stories, new and interesting new songs and passion without an experiment "look! Look! I'm very angry!" The ideas of this Disney generation. : '(
