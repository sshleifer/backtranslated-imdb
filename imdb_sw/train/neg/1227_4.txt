Although most people here are not watching this movie, it must warn you. It doesn't have any logic. I think Basinger is doing a good job in doing it, but you can't do a thriller if there is a lack of authenticity. <br /> <br /> This area shows a beautiful picture for you of the film: when Basinger is followed by the killers of murder he chooses to stay and look at the picture he gets from his pocket. Photos are from her daughter and reads "we love you mother". Who does something like that? What is it? And I believe when I say that it's not almost as stupid as other movie events. Someone said that this is a "secret gem". Well, I must not admit it very much, this film has remained hidden because. And it's not a gem. Oh, and please, I don't try to even start commenting on the box of the red tool. It hurts my brain: D Usually a lack of logic is not cheap, but this movie is essentially done as much as possible because of lack of logic. But, I'm still giving it 4 because though it's bad in a sense of logic, it has a certain sense that has made me look at the end. <br /> <br /> So if you choose to watch this, you know you have warned.
