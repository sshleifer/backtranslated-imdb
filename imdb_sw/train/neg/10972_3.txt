This was not Trainspotting or Guy Ritchie film. It was a great wannabee. It wanted to be a mix, shock-laughter, film life of the city, but it's more than a wound camera, aggressive. It is much easier to copy something else, than to create real stories with real characters. From the beginning, I had little worry about the characters or what they were involved. They were always fighting, fighting, or crying. Only, he had no substance for what they did. The dialogue between the characters means that the hip, discloses, instead comes out, and one place after another is predictable. I know there are spectators out there who loved this movie, so I could be wrong.
