How sad there is no option to mark less than 1. I watched this piece of impression and I can't believe what I looked at. Each part of the film was bad. Music, acting, guide, story, everything, just everything. In fact I found myself laughing in a lot of films. I especially love the little where our hero is through the hospital in the direction of slow motion, and knocks the clipboard out of hand nurses, because, ............. well. Just because. Product placement? On the cross (cross?) Anywhere. If you are a Christian influence and easily satisfied, you might like this film. If you act like this film, you need more truth.
