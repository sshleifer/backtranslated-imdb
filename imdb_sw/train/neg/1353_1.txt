What is it? is a mish-mash of the most incredible motifs (snail, Shirley Temple, swastikas, and the most colorful color of color, among others) not made with any kind of story or plot or character development. One thing touched me as an example of "self-reliance", and not just a mere cast-down decision. It feels the worst journey of acid, more than any use of drugs that may have Hunter S. Thompson or William S. Burroughs. The only movie I can compare is Eraserhead (my second favorite film of my favorite), which was for the purpose of suppressing more, but what did I get? The full waste of my time. It is one thing to give me the inner work of someone else's mind - even someone else was transformed into understanding - but it's just another thing to give us a wonderful picture of me for fraud.
