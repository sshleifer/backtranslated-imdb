I expected the release of films such as any Broadway fan to play. I waited and read a review for months about the award winning show. I mean the power of Eddie Murphy, Jamie Foxx, Beyonce Knowles, Danny Glover ... The movie could not be less than 4 out of 4, right? WRONG! I was disappointed with the finished product. The film was not comparable to the promotional ideas presented by the preservation awards were Eddie Murphy, Anika Noni Rose and Jennifer Hudson. The performance of Eddie Murphy's James Brownesque opens the movie when you beat. A lot of performance and performance of Jennifer Hudson encourages you every time a screen. His performance "And I tell you" is the only time I heard that the hype was worthy. You breathed as he asked him not a good person to let him continue in the group and in his life. Many viewers have said, he stole the film from the most skilled actors and deserves all the accolades he gets for this performance. Anika Noni Rose was also a great presence with loud and talented comedic talents. Jamie Foxx and Beyonce Knowles, on the other hand, went through their exhibitions. Foxx's film's film was seen to be a prelude to its amazing "Ray" and Beyonce Knowles was in an extended picture of photography or photography photographs, with moving his way through the movie. His performance was not strong enough to make you aware of his behavior at any time on the film. <br /> <br /> The movie was also hyped, 30 minutes and 1 song (solo of Beyonce "heart" from Jamie Foxx) very long.
