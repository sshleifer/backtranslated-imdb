Waldemar Daninsky (Paul Naschy) goes to Tibet and is hit by a tea, which causes it to be a net. He was killed after he attacked his wife and girlfriend, and was later resurrected by a female scientist, Dr. Ilona Ermann, who uses her in an experimental control. After Daninsky finds underground storage with extraordinary doctoral studies failed. After hearing the death of Naschy from his colleague Jon Kitley, I emerged through my collection of the best looking movie. In my race, I found that it is not just one copy (three) of the "Fury Wolfman". The film is the quality of the video without doubt, the sound known for good style, movies is a kind of style of slapstick sometimes. And American donations have two cases of love removed. In fact, without a photocopy, without a copy, I did not get the best movie in all its glory. This film claims to be the fourth in a long series about Waswolf Count Waldemar Daninsky. I think this is true, but you can't know this from the film itself. This plan is often confused, and there is no guarantee that this is good. If you read a compound summary on Wikipedia and compare it with what is printed on the box, you will see that I am not alone in my confusion. Perhaps the shortcomings of the film can be forgiven if understanding the productivity of the productivity has gone through. Over the years, it was released only in 1973, due to the problems involved in finding a distributor. And Naschy said in his book that the director, Zabalza, was an inexperienced alcoholic, and that he hated working with him. Those who are not lightweight, and I do not know what Zabalza had to say on his own behalf. What you need to happen is a non-American version, with a good mix of videos and videos, and love events are being thrown away. for a wide audience at the level of quality that they deserve.
