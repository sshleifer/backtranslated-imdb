When I was in front of the TV watching this movie, I thought, "Oh, what Alfred Hitchcock, or even Brian DePalma, could do with this!" Chances are, you too. It takes intrigueing. The British parker who lived in Los Angeles (Collin Firth) is having a beautiful, young female girl (Lisa Zane) who met him in the garden a while ago. Then, one day he burst. Police cannot find any documents that he has ever existed, and Firth does his own search. So far, it's very good. If he is about to stop, he turns to his womanizing friend (Billy Zane), and fails at his old life in LA's underground drug abuse, nightclubs, and film ametuer, and then with his history of instinct. At that time, Firth's life is in danger, and the film falls off. No characters from the back of Lisa Zane are far interesting. The film continues slowly, and there is a very small step. There is a subplot about the lack of financial medicine, but it's just a throwaway. No chases, no guide to cliffhanging, and there is no emphasis. Just fine pieces and a lot to talk to stimulating characters. One important thing to understand, Lisa Zane and Billy Zane are brothers and sisters, but never seen in the scene together. At the end of the movie, you panda's wondering what might be trying to stay awake.
