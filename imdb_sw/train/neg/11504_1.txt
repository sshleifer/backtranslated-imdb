AKA: Monday in the Sun / City <br /> I don't know what I looked at. Three men walk gently and drink, begging for everything and everyone in their way. This should be a drama, but what it is, it is completely lost to the film, without one quality of redemption. I have read reviews that show the exhibitions here as "amazing," "good," and "hero." <br /> <br /> All in all? This was not a movie. Walking and losing everyone but the audience. I have looked at this three times, and I can't see my life to see what someone sees in this waste. Nothing big here, nothing. Plays. <br /> <br /> Reduces ZERO / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fienda :.
