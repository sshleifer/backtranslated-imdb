I found the movie just recently, though it happened in 2001. I expected to see a movie of entertainment, but I would tell you, Princess Blade is nothing compared to Azumi. "The king" is not much debate, as you can see ... He reminded me of Jean Claude Van Damme, who just looked to explain his story, then struck an opponent from opponents. During the entire movie, I waited to hear at least to confess on what he liked, why he was fighting, who loved and believed. I waited for free. Crappy Film. Crappy talks. Don't look unless you want to get out of your mind! It is so bad, that I finally wondered how I could stand up for 1 and half an hour. Almost. I offer 4/10.
