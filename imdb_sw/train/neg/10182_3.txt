Okay, just to read the head you would think it would be a good movie. Well, at least I did. It started well, but it was terrible after the first half. * Farmer * <br /> <br /> Describes a story about a mother who is very interested in her daughter being a cheerleader that she will go to any length to find what she wants. The only problem is that his girlfriend's girlfriend is a girl in the way. She always succeeds in competitions, so to put her mother more towards "finishing" her. After talking to "hitman", the mother decides that the girl needs less cuts. So actions are taken but eventually they fall. <br /> <br /> Posted by bad and the movie comes very long and nothing happens. Don't waste your time looking at this. <br /> <br />
