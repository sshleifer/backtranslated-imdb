"Strike" is 82 minutes long. This audit is 82 words long. The three New York Lotharios, which are not visible, "unhappy", end up begging the woman, playing with Amanda Peet, with a bad result. That applies to stories and films. Too sophomoric to be rough, flaccid and ignorant, "Written" combines the philosophy of shock jock Tom Lykis and Penthouse letter fantasies. Although professional skills are dated, split, not well written, meaning, and clear. People don't do this like this. People don't talk like this. True.
