I had a desire to reflect this film because it is difficult to find, so when I was shot on Ebay I played more than $ 10 and bought it, now I understand why it's normal! This film is very bad, so the budget is very enormous and hopeless that the last credit, which shows all the scenes of cutting where they emerge their lines, is definitely the film. The film is about psychic (Pettyjohn, for one obvious reason, its top location) who uses its authority and pilot machine to pull items from another direction in this fact. When he is in a certain type of box as something that does not force the army to take us back to the truck with one soldier to protect it, and gee, you know what? SURPRISE! A child wearing a foam-powder monster comes out, immediately kills the soldier with his face, then runs to the nearest city. But instead of sending half of the ward arms to get it and protect the public who are involved then they release Pettyjohn and Ray to find themselves, but no matter what, this film drives its loyalty long before. This faces a lot of voting 1 and I just because of laughing unintentionally, someone needs to warn the manufacturers of the "Secrets of Science Theater 3000" if they don't know about it already! 2 out of 10, in fact, really true!
