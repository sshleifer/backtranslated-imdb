I can't imagine out of Al Pacino. I look at him in the godfather, Scarface, Carlito's Way, and I think I'm looking at one of the thirty-year-old actors. Then I see Him in Two for Finance, All Sunday provided by the Revolution, and I wonder what a person thinks. I refused on the Revolution a few nights ago, and I think I'll invest two of the following hours on this. Here's a flash information: You want to find prisoners talking? They enable you to view this from time to time ... they will agree with anything. I will not return the plot since there is no conspiracy, but it takes place during the American Revolution and Pacino has no educational animals that do not want to participate, but eventually does. When they have no money, no education and clothes like a caveman, Natasha Kinski very warmly loves to love because there is no reason, because they have only two minutes of discussion together. Indeed, as "Al Smith" got the star in this film, instead of "Al Pacino", it would have destroyed their work. The script was awesome, but the performance of Pacino guarantees and the definitive accent fake made it worse. Donald Sutherland's role was amazing. I can't tell the truth. Natasha Kinski is the main character, but it has 5 lines in the film. In fact, no one is talking too much on this film. One of the most funny clusters in the film is how Al Pacino and Kinski have with this unusual knack to run everyone on the battlefield. Its as the whole north is Starbucks. "Hey, I've loved to see you again here, on another battlefield 100 miles away ... look at a few months". I need to give this one star and IMDb, since there is nothing here for a negative mark.
