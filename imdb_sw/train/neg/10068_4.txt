The compassionate pastor of the Indian ethnic group is severely condemned in rape and murder of the leader of the leader, leading to enmity and abuse. <br /> <br /> This crackpot feature is fun to watch, though it is impossible to defend on any artistic level. The awesome apparel and the fact that all Indians are clear white, makes this look more like a cartoon action action than a great production that media pretend to be. In short, a lot of fraud (the real reason for this look) is good. Everything else is not. There are definitely good examples of both types. The most interesting is that Ramrodder was filmed by the famous Spahn Movie Ranch and not one, but two members of the Manson family, Catherine Share and Bobby Beausoleil, who are probably already in the killing at the time when you get screens soda-stained the Theater Pussycat!
