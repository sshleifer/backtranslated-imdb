One must be playing too much when they do this film. First, it is quite difficult that this film was made in 1993. Fashions and music compel that this is over 80. I think it's that this is sitting on a long shelf before some crazed distributer picked it and released to the world disbelieving. <br /> <br /> There is a plot. Type. A wonderful uncle meets a beard with a beard who tells him that if he thinks while singing his favorite song he will be able to turn to anyone he chooses. At this point I feel it must say that the only favorite song is London Bridge Falling. Why is this his favorite song? Because he is idiot. We are just minutes in the film and already the film has reached a high level of folly. It gets even stupider. <br /> <br /> Fool is a nose picker. I can only assume this if there are two events in the film where he appears taking his nose. That burns the head. She decides to change the girl so that she can be around other girls. I will kill you. That's more or less it. <br /> <br /> Acting is awesome everywhere. Each performance in this film seeks. In fact, I would like to say now that acting is the rate of romantic movie. It is true that it is terrible. The nose picker looks to the audience as a caller of the nose. The characters in the movies see him as the girl has been singing London Bridge Is Falling Down. Man, I feel like idiot even writing this. However, it is a wonderful type to see people aged weirdo hanging out with school girls. And not in a good way. There is even the spread of cases where the nose pick is at school and the girls and the song plays up. It is very likely the worst song ever written. I can't even describe it. You will know when you hear it. And you will agree with me. <br /> <br /> There are some cases of abuse, certainly. And there is Benny Hill style track sequence involving transsexual. There is even a little ever of a conversation, which may or may not be removed from Shakespeare or John Milton, where the caller says to a prostitute, 'I have money if you have gash'. Interestingly, I'm sure you will agree. <br /> <br /> Say desolate.
