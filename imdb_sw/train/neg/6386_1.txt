I liked to make this film, but it was impossible. Acting was ultra hammy, the plot was angry, and the speed was SLOW, sooo slowwwwww. All the time in the theater I wanted the movie to be completed. Twenty circles on the film and I pray for the last. Certainly some performances were good, but those of kimon, I mean really! And for films about magical instruments there actually did not have much music to talk about. Music was sad, and you liked it. There were many voices of sound as well as those that were sad. Especially this film has managed to carry me, and it takes me at the same time. I am happy about it. I need to go to see "Tideland" and wash this bad taste from my mouth.
