Doris's Day does not allow the bad script to throw him. Even in extreme cases, the Day provides 100% and comes out regardless. This comedy, perhaps led by the real life of New York City black-out in 1965 but actually adapted from the French game of late-Claude Magnier, offers little Doris to do but destroy her beautiful and beautiful pictures, and the second half , being sedated (which is exciting because of Spin's Day gives the state). There are some funny lines here, but the material of the material has been visible from the play ... and instead of mentioning other exciting events in the Big Apple, we are faced in the suburbs. Doris stars (Patrick O'Neal, Robert Morse, and Terry-Thomas) do not do well, not the hair that they are wearing. Still, it's not terrible, it has a few great features, and for Daytime is a must-see. ** from ****
