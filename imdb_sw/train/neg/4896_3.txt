I'll start with what I liked. I like those songs, everything about them was beautiful, dress, music, lyrics (as long as the translation was good :)), choreography, everything I liked the crab area and cooking area. <br /> <br /> But that's about it. <br /> <br /> I get it, a movie of art, blablabla, but very much. Very quiet (it was interesting for an hour, but two hours of hearing and exciting stimulation, in fact ...), envious (no movie should be boring, no matter how big it would be!), Many pictures of pornography (I find the truth, I find that they were playing porn movies there, but in fact, in fact, it is very true) I really think, that movies should be a look and this is certainly not available in any way. <br /> <br /> 3 stars for songs.
