I lost this film just to see Amber Benson, though after reading the box I thought it looked like good news ..... however the first problem was that it had no story ... or indeed there was a story but it didn't mean anything. The second problem did not exist for these participants ... that's what I found that all went to school together, but within the first 3 minutes of the film it found that they had nothing else in common and did not like everyone ... why they kept getting together. Flaw number 3 ... the director though a long suspension and severe camera shots were similar to doubt (especially with the impressionable music). It was painful to look at a bright actor like Amber Benson when he was trying to bring back to lifeâ€¦ my only hope is the money he made here was put in place to produce his own film.
