I can't believe that in the original 34 comments, no one said that this film is a clear release of Born yesterday. The man is employed to bring a blonde blush for the gangster needs. Pull the gun and blonde fall in love and live happily every time. Gangster is left in the panda. But yesterday's birth was mental health but this is very fluff. The technicolor transfer on DVD hurts. Natalie Kalmus would have been around her grave. See paper sheets. Recognize him? But, it is historically interesting to see the roots of Rock 'n Roll. Also interesting is the introduction of Ewell to CinemaScope, a new format at that time.
