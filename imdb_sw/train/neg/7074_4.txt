My God movie this is very awesome. I am a great fan of Gina Gershon, I lost this film I expected a romantic game, with the good performance of Gershon. Gershon is as good as always, but he is not a good performer for this role, he is very good for Servedzija Rade. Love between Gershon and Serbedzija characters also does not know. And I hate Serbedzija's character (winner of the winner), he is not charming at any time in the movie. Dr. Lauren Graham (Gershon) got my knowledge. Perhaps Sean Connery, Robert DeNiro or Harrison Ford would do better on this role, but they don't have Europe-ish think I think. Any way, I was very aggressive with movies. If you are looking for a good Gina Gershon film, see locked, its best film so far. If you are looking for a romantic film about a young woman and an old man, try some of Harrison Ford movies or Sean Connery. Gina Gershon is very low, and deserves better than this, I would like to make the best choice in the future.
