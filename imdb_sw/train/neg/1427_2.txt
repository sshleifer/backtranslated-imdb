The British soil series set the "magic" dialogue from the "average" people in the mouths of "cute" fanciful creatures at least had an advantage for non-UK viewers to appear droll and a rarefied culture odor you could not find the American TV. One has made the mistake of opening it on US television. A kind of a sad American version of the Brit-com cover COUPLING one month on NBC when the basic script is "translating" from English to English to English, which was seen as a droll and cultured (and only a few of BIT) in England , comes in COMFORTS CREATURE, US version, such as patience and tablets. There is no way of conspiracy, no characters and after one and a half-time events (the last three were seen), there is no reason to suffer through more. The only positive thing that can be mentioned on a new summer series and a short series of sympathy was that the soil is at least professionally done and come as a set-up for one of the worst show in CBS schedule, The New Adventures of Old Christine (or "how to be a mother HORRIBLE - or a person - in one subject that is impossible, a lesson of delivery"), children who wanted to sit up during their sleep happily went to bed instead of sitting on this show, and adults could wait until 9:00 when "Two and Half Men" (pleasurable pleasures) and "How I used Your Mom" ​​(real quality writing) comes.
