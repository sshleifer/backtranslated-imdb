Dubbing / translation in this film is very bad and offers exclusive entertainment in this beautiful flick and derivative zombie. I did not laugh at them in my life as I have seen Zombi 3 (and I have seen very serious dubbing in my life, I believe). Hardly, filmmakers can change this film and open it as a comedy and make millions of dollars. It's just amazing. But ... If you fall your bed lays you on a dubbing on the movie of the Fulci zombie is not your cup of tea, then PINDA THIS ALL IN ALL.
