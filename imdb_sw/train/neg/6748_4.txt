Let me say I follow him to follow this video by looking at Saw and after Bleed, Saw seemed like a flick at all a great fear at any time though I thought it was just good good. Bleed is very bad. The best part is to see the female feminine. Gore is looking very fake and made. It has its most beautiful but very interesting parts and I did not want to sit to see the end of the horror. If I could, I would like to ban these actors and artists, the only reason that Debbie Rochon (Maddy) has been in more than one hundred videos and I have seen two other members of the same picture or worse. They should not be allowed to continue this spirit.
