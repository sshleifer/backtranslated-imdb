believe it or not, this movie is worse than the number three. It decreases, acting is worse, and the story is very weak. In it it's not good to say about this movie. .ii is very slow 90 minutes. in fact, in fact. put it in, hopefully it would be better. number three, this film is not related to the first two is the same name.anyway, more I can give the best quality: without warning 2/10
