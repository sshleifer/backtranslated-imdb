Great big. Acting great. The story line is unpredictable for the first half <br /> hour or more. I was wanting to know what was going to happen to each of these uncertainty, and how their normal life-style could be interrupted. But when the authors removed the glue begin to connect the players, <br /> <br /> misused a super glue and bring the movie to stand <br /> <br /> for the last two hours. I continued to think it would be better, but it is worth it. Don't believe the review. This is a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Think about it - Tom Cruise did bad - why? Gorgeous <br /> <br /> The hunky bartender wearing braces - why? I know it was related to <br /> <br /> the plot, but without them, at least one would be one of the most attractive player.
