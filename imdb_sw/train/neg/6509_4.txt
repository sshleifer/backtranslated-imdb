Sean Bean is beautiful, such as photographs, places and clothing. However, the plot is a problem, with a flat conclusion. The program has been changed from the Cornwell novel, and not the best. Unfortunately, this adventure is reading better than watching. Sharpe was beaten here, contrary to his literary transformation, who seems to be more intelligent and decisive despite his fears in his new role as an elevated officer from the ranks. I was very excited about the new area that Sharpe faces a "true" officer, and after resting fast and blowing, he pushes a surprised officer and fear back. It sets the tone for its future experiment as a command officer. <br /> <br /> Rating: "4" of "10."
