I usually love horrible movies, but unfortunately this is from one master of the pounds in my friends hand. We sat to watch, ready to panic and end up spraying wherever we were very laughing. The concept is not bad, but why they decided the number ten in the series will be lucky I don't know. The worst thing about the movie is the actors. The function of the camera was poor, the specific effect was not really as good as the hospitality, but generally the story could not connect to any level because the participants were effective as a small nose elm. They were more wooden measurements, especially a foppish actor who was 15 years old too far taken seriously as any kind of government agency. He seemed more like a public school boy. There was a sex scene that was so exciting that he seemed to be blossoming with apples as a busty woman climbed over him and later his latest clothes were additive, but I remembered that it was not supposed to be comedy. I'm very busy with my brain to find something positive to say about this movie away from the flash of regular breast, but there's just not. Let's hope nine is the number of luck and they don't do the other, I don't know my number can get it.
