As a great fan of the first BSG season and standing alone makes a BSG tag I was hoping that this release would return to the franchise for its former glory days. Usually I have no problem with false science that dominates most of the negotiations as opposed to the visual bonanza of special effects. If the script is strong and some of the original ideas made by good actors can create a comprehensive film with less CGI funds. This prequel does not have one of the above requirements to go for it. The reality of the world created by the terrorist youth was unstable and impossible. This location is only set to increase the restriction rate. It is not that young people do not like true mosh holes filled with sex and violence & music of heavy drums. His part about these young people has a deep sense of mind and cause or a political and religious motive like creating such a modern software or suicide bombing that competes with me. These children are obviously not from this planet. The movie has out as a soap opera and just 10 minutes ago to be a little interesting. The area with Eric Stolz will give his cyborg his nerve skills through improved firmware improvement was amusing if not entertaining. But this old concept was well-expressed and most trusted in the first, "Frankenstein" and Boris Karloff. Caprica jumps off its interesting idea from an old Hollywood film. No surprise there! In general this movie was bland & common and cheap looking, using CGI recycled of Caprica from BSG. I am sure I will be looking at this space detection when it starts on the Sci-Fi facility. Except for course I happen to have a terrible suffering of sleep while this show will definitely be a cure. Zzzzzzzz
