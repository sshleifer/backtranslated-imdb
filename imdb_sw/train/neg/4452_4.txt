Let's say I just forced my suspension under Spiderman than I did to the Afrikaners. That is to say, I have little trouble believing Toby McGuire can be connected to buildings than I do Elija Wood throwing down to the hardest in Manchester. I can't enter a special, since I don't want to write a spoiler, but the idea of ​​adults, professionals, British men who enter close to death loses every weekend, well ... funny. And this film is not. Fighting, the idea of ​​fighting, is taken very much. The influence of pugilism, a respect for which the issue is offensive, because it cannot solve or solve the crisis. It seems that as a plot, with large holes to drive the Guiness drive through, it has been hit with the head of the "fish out of water" so that the audience can look into the eyes of the stars as he learns how to be someone ie. hitting other kids to fight football football with improper items and then run as fast as possible. The characters are cartoonish, especially Americans in Harvard. Promotional character and story line is telegraphed to the viewer in the picture. Unfortunately, the absence of film does not reach its length to the end, which at that time you have spent almost two hours of your life never returning. Pick up the "Soccer Factory" or "Fighting Club" instead of this corny, and dud. It does not waste time with empty melodrama, the old fatigue "Yankee at King Aurthur Court," or the right examples of coming to the age of five years. They are clean, dark, and fun; The brutality method should be.
