Disney goes at once very often as anyone who has seen the original LITTLE MERMAID will hear it completely. Celebrating the birth of their daughter Melody, Ariel and Eric plan to send him to King Triton. The ceremony has been hurled by the sister of Ursula, Morgana who plans to use Melody as a defense tool to secure the trident of the king. Stopping the attack, Ariel and Eric builds a wall around the sea while Melody grows wondering why he can't go there. It is a horrible thing that describes this directly on the video. LITTLE MERMAID 2 gives you the feeling that everything you see seems to have dropped directly into other Disney movies. I think Disney can only recommend! Do not tell that the penguin and walrus did not remind you of another duo from King LION! <br /> <br /> Sometimes the desperation includes a rematch between Sebastien and Louie, a royal chef. They very much less to play! The time between Morgana and everyone seemed to be another desire. We will not give anything, but in 75 minutes, everything seemed too big and could handle. Experiment with Disney, LITTLE MERMAID 2 is the best left to lease and laugh. Then you can prepare for the rest of the Disney rest will go to swallow you later.
