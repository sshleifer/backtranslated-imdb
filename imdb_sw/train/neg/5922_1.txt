My mother places this film as a common threat to anyone who loves the film she hears. Everything about it shines. <br /> <br /> So it's a real classic. Who gave 10/10? Have you watched the wrong film and voted for this accident? Everyone involved in the film making process should be forced to look at the small part of this film. It should be a stain of humiliation on all the films that hold sacred and respected as a wave of cinema.
