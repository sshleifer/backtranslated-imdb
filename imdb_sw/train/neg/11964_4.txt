Billy Crystal wrote, co-produced by the stars in this very safe and very interesting game about the father and the children, the worries of adults, and growing old. Billy has a heart surgeon who has a heart attack (ha ha) that causes his father to be a guest (Alan King), a movie-extra who makes himself a big star. Script is a small Neil Simon non-emotional and one of galore, flat, inexpressive guide manual and Henry Winkler (stuck in sitcom mode), and family-crisis ready. Crystal and King tries best, but the King has more and more enthusiasm on the top. JoBeth Williams has one of her unappreciative responsibilities, but she can bring her an innate class, down-home to a girl's prideful attitude. It's comedy, I think, but one that includes tears ... for shame. ** from ****
