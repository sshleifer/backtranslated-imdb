I just saw this film on DVD last night, and I decided to look at this morning review. It seems that "I, Robot" has emphasized an important community to watch here on the IMD (and has increased with many insults and calls, too). I see this amazing, as this film is not big (or even beautiful), but it's also bad (or even worse). What this film is true, is ... sad. It insists that American American film filters should lose quickly, clich√©d re-heats, and praise them as new amazing works. This film as a "return" is written everywhere, from a line of conspiracy (an amazing mix of asimov and modern-day) for Smith's behavior (smart-mouthed cynic with titanium back), with special effects ( borrowed from the Matrix and a few others. <br /> <br /> "I, Robot" is, sadly, the possibility of full films for the viewers of today: a high-quality, insipidly snappy dialog, and lots and lots of Smith is mediocre, but we knew already that (it seems to be an unsuccessful attempt of Hollywood to create Bruce Willis black). The story has many holes in it, of all sizes, but I don't think most people proposed by this film intend to realize. Today's rates, but B-movie very compared to real owners.
