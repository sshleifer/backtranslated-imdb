Good effort, I think, but eventually it's poor. Before seeing this film, I felt "Bartleby, The Scrivener" could not be closed. After seeing it, I'm still doing it. Unfortunately, I think only those who have read the stories will understand what is going on, and will be disappointed in the unwanted revision of the film (updating from 1850 to 1970, leaving New York to London). Even the best talent of Paul Scofield can not save what seems to me as a good sense but the wrong efforts of Melville's metaphysical classic film.
