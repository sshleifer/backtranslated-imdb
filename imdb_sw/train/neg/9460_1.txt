This film helped me! When I think of Cat in the hat. Im thinking cat in books of hats. You know, one from a few years back where parents read the babies. Well, I though this movie will be a lot like that! But much to me was not like books! Installed is more like young film players. In one place the cat talks to the fever camp (hoe) talking to him as his hat (agin of adult humor). The name of his car I was however was a little bit for the children's movie. The bottom of the rating you will find: the sharp humor and others comprising twice. I think this briefly means an adult humor. I would like to come back to this movie! wal-mart said they would not do because the movie was opened. If you think about this purchase I recommend that maybe the pre-purchase lease.
