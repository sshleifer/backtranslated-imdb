I watched Written on Wind Winds, Lauren Becall, Robert Stack & Dorothy Malone- Robert Stack was awesome - just terrible blood - he was supposed to be a charming bird-instead came as jerk from the word to go-conspiracy. stupid and increased with 3 "romantic" leads did not have chemistry.

Douglas director Sirk loses a whole way through a conversation that he felt that forced by the final result was lost 99 minutes. He had comeo and actress played the leader on Get Smart
