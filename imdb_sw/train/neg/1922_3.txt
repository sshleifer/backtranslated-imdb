About the child: Why don't a big brother think he might be hungry for a bottle or some food or change of diaper? He should be crying without stopping after hours. Of course stupid to take a child from a safe place when he did not need. <br /> And why was that way clear when someone wanted to run somewhere? Did he have trees that had fallen down the road and prevented them? I can't imagine the fighters on the road road without following anyone who has declined, especially when they said it was dangerous to go there. It is said, it was good to have movie children can look safe, to change.
