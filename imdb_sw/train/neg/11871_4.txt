Gregory Peck's work was excellent, if one could expect, and the movie was very interesting even when you played directly on spiritual “time”. But, all the film that was closed and hard to watch, for me however. I tried to do it, but it had to hurry up thirty minutes ago or so. I feel I have lost a few good hours. If it was not for Gregory Peck, I could not have fifteen minutes. 4/10.
