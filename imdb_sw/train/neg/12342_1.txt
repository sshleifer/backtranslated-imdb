Anyone who knows my opinion on the Internet Movie will know that I can be a bastard of a regular grumpy. There are many films that I don't like, for some reason, I have felt the need to explore. However, if anyone out there is eager to know the name of the worst movie I saw, do not see more than Transylvania 6-5000. Without question, this takes the name of all time. 1 bad film. I can't believe that I actually did it from the beginning of this clunker to the end! It is clear what it takes to catch Young Frankenstein's taste of Mel Brooks, but where the film was to take over the horror of the movie, this is an unforgettable experimental attempt on embarrassing devices . Jeff Goldblum and Ed Begley Jr feel embarrassed to be here as a pair of journalists in the modern days of Transylvania (perhaps they realized earlier that they were lost in this dud). During their research, they come against all the great leaders from the former panicists, such as vampires, waswolves and mummies. Anyone who can download this film to its end can request that the phase be guided through their heart to eliminate them from the pain of weight. It points to the nadir of work for everyone involved and proves that when the comedy fails in a great way, it brings to the worst entertainment.
