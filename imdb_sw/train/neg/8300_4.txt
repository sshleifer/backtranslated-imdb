This is the title of the unique name for "Christmas Story," which was originally with "The Story of Summer." Ralphie tells his family's adventures during the summer when they were moved to a small town of tanks between anywhere. Hilarity, unfortunately, does not. It was originally worked because of its nature of disobedience and loyalty - everyone can involve it. This is just ignorant and not quite funny. Movie Charles Grodin's last - not surprising! It is one of its poorest responsibilities. I felt sorry for him. Mary Steenburgen has been given a little to do, the formulaic of everything, and you need to wonder why you even failed. <br /> <br /> And I say, come - the competition around? Unfortunately, it is the best part of the film ...
