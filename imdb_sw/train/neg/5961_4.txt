It was close to the slasher next to 88 so it was during the cheesy harvest of those old movies. The brain has been done well, the script reminded Videodrome but through more cheesy as described earlier. Acting can go that way. But it is a harm that makes you play, what is called Brain is actually Turkey and blood has never been shown. The opening of the opening is what makes this film look good, the conversation has been done well and it reminds me of a dream on Elm Street, remember the live phone .... Some of the way you look at this, waiting for what is happening next. It seems to all who run out because there is no one in it and if he said the blood is none but there is dirt for the offenders. I've seen movies worse than this, but only they would have made bloodier ...
