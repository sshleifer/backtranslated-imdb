Being a film graduate I would like to think that I have seen various films, good and bad, but I will have to say that 'summer rain' is the worst movie I saw! I chose the film in the hope that it would be a beautiful classic UK like 'Secret and False' or 'Lockstock' but oh no this was so bad that our flat lovers and I ended up laughing and cringing in ridiculous acting with cheesy script (reminded me 'bad displays' in school production. The main characters Michelle and Gary began to mock us from the beginning. 'Michelle' the main character who lives with her two friends has a kind of face that you can't get tired of being beaten by Gary was wet (continued to break with tears every 5 minutes) that at the end of the film I really didn't give a damn about each of them. All I could imagine was 'I paid Â£ 3 for this bunch'. I have never written a review before but after watching this film helped me to warn people of this disaster. So please try at all costs. Thank you for reading.
