Black candles are rather a mess of clay from one director who brought us "Vampyres" and later, "Rest in pieces", among others. I only see what I saw. At any rate, we have a couple who love love and then somewhere around the pins installed on the voodoo doll and then steals, and someone looks. I don't know if it was good for any of them, then. Coming soon to the sister of the person has come to the house to investigate and hear the love of love, or something for that result, and indeed everyone except she is in something, which is becoming a worship of the devil. It is very difficult to say who it is during the film and it is not appropriate to be confused sometimes. In order to destroy objects, however, there is a mammal of an animal (I HOPE is the same) and a black goat, certainly good for people. Ugh. Sometimes you agree "Rosemary Child", to remove the child, because the host gives each woman the tea of ​​plants and parts of this crop of Satan's crops as well, for that reason. However, plants are not the only thing that shows this film. Finally it seems to be back again, and many viewers can find themselves wondering where they have been during the middle part. It is not known, not very good, and I think it all depends on what you like to see in the film, and it didn't have much here that made me anything more than me. 3 out of 10.
