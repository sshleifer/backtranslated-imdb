What a terrible text and act. No personality. What, you can't make a good movie with one character? Hmm, was held in Castaway and private conversation. <br /> So this child goes to see her father. A child, Jason, takes a plane and tests has a heart attack and dies in the middle of a plane. So the child falls into the lake and continues to live. Then he runs around, living in the desert until he recovers. That time he fights with a double bear. The first time he fights with him in the lake. The second time he makes a spear out of a branch with a spear loaded. Two shots of artificial blood came out of the breast chest reminded Monty Python of the "Holy Grail". The child decides to cut porcupine and predictable results. Gag.
