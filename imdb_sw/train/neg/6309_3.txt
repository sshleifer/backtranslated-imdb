This movie had good intentions and good news to work with. The director and filmmaker of this movie were shocked and formed a delightful, stirring film that made me feel like I returned to Mr. Hartford's class of Social Studies class - 67.> The man wants to take this story and make a real movie from him - the story is suited. Every time the area was capable, we were all left with a few clich√©s, with black color and white footage which perhaps have received from the Channel History to show the action. Assault. <br /> <br /> Ossie Davis was just a bright light in this red fest. Another job was very strong - it resembles a good movie and anyone who played with Captain put a minimum of line delivery. However, if you agree to accept many errors in this movie and are not worried or uncomfortable, but want to learn about USS Mason, it's worth checking.
