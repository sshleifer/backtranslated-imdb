Words cannot describe how this film is bad. I thought Zandalee was bad, but at least that she had good shots and occasionally beautiful head stroking time here and there to stop you from nodding away. This is just laughable! Bad script, poor direction, bad act and you know what? I can't imagine one thing to suggest about it rather than the fact that it's not too long. If you want a 100-minute entertainment, put it to the dentist and do the work of the root canal - you are more attractive with the best value of money (assume you need!). Unfortunately, I need to write 10 lines of text to complete this audit - HOW TO KNOW MOVIE. GIVING!
