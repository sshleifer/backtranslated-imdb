A horrible story (Amis in the worst), a nonsense and self-'moral' method, the apparent shocks and a bad act makes this film (like "Aluminum Rumini") include everything caused by the great revival of the film UK. Humor is the best, and the simplicity of the set-up whole (including some kind of "group of Internet terrorists" - ooh, how modern) really begins to thank. The last summary - a semi-baking attempt to be 'edgy' which is not suitable for any favor. However, it's always a pleasure to see Katy Carmichael on the screen ... <br /> <br />
