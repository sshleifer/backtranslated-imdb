Sorry. One can say so. This is true / was a red movie. It is perhaps necessary, but it decreases even though. I almost cried out when I looked at it. Acting is a very good, story-based and predictable, marked and functional cameras and non-functional. It is one of those movies that are not allowed to hate (because it is about people with disabilities) but they hate it almost every person who does it. It's amazing that critics have been very sympathetic to this movie. I also think they are not allowed to have a goal. This was done to win the prize - which I remember was appropriate. But it was not interesting nor entertainment. I haven't seen playing so can't compare.
