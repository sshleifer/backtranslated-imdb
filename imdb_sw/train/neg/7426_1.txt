I couldn't believe it. I had to rub my eyes a few times. Was it true? Yes, there was Billy Dee Williams, Jeff Conaway, Maxwell Caulfield and Tracy Scoggins - they all had some sort of talent but here they were all in what essentially adds to the flick of Cinemax skin. Embark on board! It looks like, "Alien" is trying to be unique, with a computer virus / alien / harpy / anything else you want to call Ariel (Scoggins) into this center's top station. The latest technology on the spaceship center where four men are allowed to live outside the fantasies as the system is more visible by their captain (Williams). Perhaps, but here everything is just seen as part of the "Red Shoe Diaries". Williams out of everything right and left classes, and it looks like he would like to do anything else, any other. Ah, things people do for money .... <br /> <br /> FX is good static, maybe even under what you could expect at the lowest price of this video. Unfortunately, even the female ignorance is less than you expect. SEXUAL INNUENDO is a real star here and, of course, gets all the best visuals. If you like a film that all says and no mind, see "Visitor User". Of course, you may not have to look beyond Cinemax at 2 or 3 am. <br /> <br /> No star, nor even the power of this star can look. <br /> <br /> Leave this lost in space.
