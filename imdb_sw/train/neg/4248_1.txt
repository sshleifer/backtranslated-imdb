This movie was free, lazy, and worried written everywhere. If you are going to make films about vampires that have been done thousands of times, then be better to do a good job of damn. I will be the first to say that this film did not cut it. Some of the awesome / horrible movies cannot fail to break the mold "letting them do something forbidden and left for fun because all stories are just lies". This, sadly, was no different, and like all the scary movies, once you cross down the road there is no return. <br /> <br /> And the end? Do the heroes do the same work regularly in the cinema, but then they are confined to this time and cannot work at the end? The latter was to fight the weather and spelled part 3 which I never looked at. Movie terrible.
