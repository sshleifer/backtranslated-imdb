Steven has done what you've hit the bottom. It is best since Steven's last shadow of the film directed by the director who made this waste. The shadow man was good this was very bad not bad even not funny Steven is difficult in the movies and he feels like he is in appearance to come and when he's in the film he is half the time at any time. For a good step let's just say the wizard of oz had a step more than this litter no action in the film and when it finally reached it boring the worst bullets shot so called action action. Seagal can not kill anyone different from its films where one-person army is under 1 and 2 injuries and wounds from. The conspiracy is confused with many holes of conspiracy that do not make scenes sometimes. run for the best fury to be good what embarrassed took about 5 pounds on this garbage 0 out of ten good luck next time
