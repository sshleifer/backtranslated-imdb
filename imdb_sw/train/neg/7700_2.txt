I saw the movie last night here at home, but I thought it was quite a long time. Secondly, what I saw in the film was also out of the text even though it was in what I thought it would be a comedy film as before. Things are not exciting in the film: a partner has hit his girlfriend, beaten. The movie was a very long way - talk about wanting to go to sleep and wondering when it would end when you wake up and still play! Some of the things in the meeting were too many to catch - as a singing woman - I felt like I was about to watch the show of spiritual song here! come Perry, you can do well then this!
