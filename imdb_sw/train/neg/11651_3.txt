Given that this film was put together under a year could describe its shortage (81 minutes - including the last credit, so 76 minutes of real film). But what he cannot explain is his lack of humor that the original film had. <br /> <br /> Gags is fast and sometimes not funny. The real parts of the Nike basketball spots are the best of Nike basketball, the image of James Woods of Max Van Sydow's character, and the fragments and fragments of the film. Much listening was taken by the Angel of Charlie, who like the Scary and Matrix Movie removes the scene, basically restored the area without great humor. Today's youth may not be able to relate to the spoof fingers of the most common 70-size films such as Exorcist and perhaps "80" Poltergeist, et. al. <br /> <br /> Expects a Movie of Horror 3 will take time to put together, and make the most enjoyable spoofs. <br /> <br /> One thing, this film has more than the last promises of the actress Anna Faris (whom I will accept seemed to be a fierce fire in the sequel). Only with its ability to manufacture and act, I offer this film "3" from "10".
