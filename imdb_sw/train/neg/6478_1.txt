I will say again: this film was completely crippled. Children will love it, sure, but adults ... worries. Anything was a natural rehash, which is expected, for they very much felt the whole concept in the first movie, but still, they had to restore the entire movie completely? I mean, everything is done again from the Little Mermaid. The worst part is the Morgana "sister of Ursula" who seems without anywhere and threatens Melody, which is ridiculous since Triton is with her third magic. Why did Triton have nothing about it? Because the plot did not need to do anything. I could continue, but I can't. The whole thing is an innocent attempt to cut more money from the Little Mermaid, and it was obviously thrown together without any thought, because they knew it could sell. It is generally a bad waste of time.
