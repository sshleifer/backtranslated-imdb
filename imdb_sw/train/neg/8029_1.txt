My friend bought this (very cheap) and decided to give me a birthday. I thought I would never look at it because I knew it was a joke and a DVD cover seemed worried, but then my friends and I got very tired and looked at it. from beginning to end! I know it's complete but it's really a masterpiece. it's hard to describe. you should see it, it is a true lesson about what people can when they believe they are creative and intelligent and really not. "Acting" is underground (you can see a "woman leading" laugh at another time, she is definitely worse). The "story" is a misleading slip and actually everything in this film is facing. please, pay special attention to "sheriff". The guy is an adult and so does not quite reason to participate in this. he is too bad. whatever made it had a hilarious time. look out, haha
