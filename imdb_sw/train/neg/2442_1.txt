I don't know why I keep doing that myself! I continue to defend the Dutch and Belgian movies and claim that they should get more credit and space ... and then around you head and junk like this! A comprehensive service is a terrible production and perhaps the worst thing that has been done in the Netherlands. It is a Dutch attempt to create our highly franchise, to be clear according to the classic American slasher classics as Friday 13th and Halloween. Producers and authors liked this, but they fell very low. Detailed care was a disgrace for everyone involved and therefore true worship will open here. It is impossible to secure the original copy of this and is shown only on specific events, such as "Distaste Night". For 5 minutes, the Intensive Career tries to tell the story and even create a video ... then it turns on the shade film and the lower brain slash 'n struesome - still highly hilarious and cheaper - makes the effects. The whole casting act is disgusting, although there are several titles that are respected. The leading male role is played by Koen Wauters ... This person can also be a popular and loved artist in Belgium. She is a beloved singer, hosting television shows and photographs of many young girls. He never mentioned this thing he cared in, though. Like everyone else in the Netherlands, she tries to involve herself.
