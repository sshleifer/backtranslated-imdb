Entering this thing I was expecting anything real, but after this devastated destruction on me, I am very happy to think about the problem. It's hard to imagine what filmmakers (HA!) This was a good movie. The story, and I use the world freely, is not based and makes any sense. There are only stupid things that happen easily. Acting, if it can be called acting is awesome I've got to hit the batter in the toy advertising! I know it's a tiny low-budget video-bin, but yet it's not as they tried. After having conveyed these ideas, I feel very sleepy and still # yawws # do, I'll go to sleep. WARNING: Do not put it off, horizontal, or do no longer look at CHILLERS. ONLY SIDE VERSES NEED TO FIND ALL THINGS AND ALL METAL.
