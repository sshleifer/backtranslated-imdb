I don't know why, but because of some patients, I think since I've been on the Binge's Disney Binge, I have decided to continue to see the 10th Dalmations. The first movie which was a remake of star Disney cartoon classic Glenn Close as Cruella De Vil, seemed like a hit but it was just a bomb. I think the reason these movies do not work is because the 101 Dalmations, the original, was the cartoon, only the best work and was more appealing to children and adults. This was not an interesting thing because it is the adults riding around trying to act like cartoons instead of real real people, I understand they are trying to prove they are attracting children, but they look down on how these actors are doing in the film. And the story of the Dalmations of 102 is not very good. Cruella De Vil has been in prison for some time, but things are changed when it is shown that he now loves animals and is a good man. But his reputation has now been destroyed as a puppy-napper, but he buys a human dog and it is suddenly loved by everyone and looks like he has changed. But when he sees the Dalmatians of the pilot officer, he goes to heaven and begins to see ads, and he removes it. He returns to take revenge on the babies and still decides to find the same dalmation coat he always wants. Glenn Close is an awesome actor, very tested, but he takes Cruella De Vil, he is good, but let's say, this movie made the villain just more fun of silly nut cases. Also, as newborns were, it works more for animation, it seems to be stupid, but not just believe without cartoon and life they have in a mix. I will not strongly recommend 102 Dalmations, but if you agree that the first film was a waste of time, this is the same thing. <br /> <br /> 2/10
