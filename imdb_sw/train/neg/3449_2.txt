With compassion, there is no video of this western wannabe being a car stay for Big Frank when his work was full. The story of weasel who lives on the reputation of his superior gunman and who gets out of town and bad people just return to his city meeting and the new courage found must be written by the back of the room. All in all, this shows stinks. Stories are exciting, the worst pregnancy and so naive that can damage your mind. I must be completed from another consultant who found it "... underrated ..." Critics glorified him at that time and deserved it. You will need to do it on the last show, if you are experiencing a delay and fall asleep. But, if you can stay that way, you have more courage than most of my films.
