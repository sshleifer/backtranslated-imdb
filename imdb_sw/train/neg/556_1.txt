In my book "Basic instinct" was the perfect film. It had the best work on the part of the Stone, Douglas and all actors to help with a very small role. It had a beautiful picture, music and script of noir forever. They all add up to a film that is as good as it will get! This way is quite the opposite, it can not be worse, acting wrong with the crippled script, as well as inept completely direction, this is very serious, provoking, angry. The only thing that continues to embrace is to wait for the second time which is the original original copy. These books are badly laughing and I am laughing too much for myself, because it was like looking at the brightness of the brightness. The only thing that is good in this horrible mess is the lesson of Jerry Goldsmith's logo of BI1. Michael Caton-Jones and a half-wit were involved with the script even included "No smoking in this room" in the interview area and that sends his attorney (who is now a lawyer) away! Sorry, I have seen this bad movie that shouldn't be done! It makes the original damage, it is very bad. The only value of redemption is to realize that cosmetic surgery (and I am sure Mrs. Stone given the best money for the surgeon can buy) can do a good job but can not restore the original perfection. And what is involved with the human body is used for film making, too. There must be a law: You can't be good for the perfect film!
