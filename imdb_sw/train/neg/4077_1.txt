What do you get when you have a bad act, bad advice, a very long time, bad lighting, bad editing, and bad effects? You get Jessica: Story of the Spirit It seems to shoot her on betacam, which is good, but the lights should applaud this medium. In this case it is not recommended. There are a few CU where the face of a person is completely shaded. One particular area is the area of ​​psychologists. It's a joke if you ask me. Some of the events were so long that they could be cut by half ... but I think then they wouldn't have a film at the height of the feature. The main character is a large flat. She is the leader of the leader, so she should have certain aspects of the "hero" to her character, but it does not. He screams and is afraid of the whole film. I could continue, but I don't want to waste my time. Although the lights were bad, I must say that they had good camera movements. Bad lights did not congratulate you. The DVD cover is good, and it is the end. Just awesome.
