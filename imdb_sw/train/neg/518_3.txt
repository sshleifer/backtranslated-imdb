Bela Lugosi is not unusual in this wonderful part of the 12th part, leading as Frank Chandler / Chandu Mchawi, enjoying his position as a representative of White Magic power pushing against those of Black, while demonstrating sharp fighting skills, effectively to sing the little king of Egypt, and cut the lean and lost figure in the yachting cage, completed with a hat hat. Of course, a good plot makes the Chandler / Chandu in the ongoing series of fighters described the recovery of its pastor, Princess Nadji (Maria Alba) and others from the cult statues of the Ubasti, which has Nadji's blood to revive the ancient king who had been freed from the secret island of Lemuria. Director Ray Taylor, the former hand at these sporting stations set up fast moving events, but frequent events and photographs, a good deal that is available at the Skull Island of the previous year starting with King KONG, and the port area from the Son KONG, reduces the initial stage for less than 60 minutes from a long series of over half and a half hours, and if it appears at the same time, it fails to many viewers, except exceptions.
