I love John Saxon in whatever he goes. One time he takes a camera even though he is leading a film that should have the name of the name "Please see this Movie called Zombie Death House". The $ 1,000 bond guarantee is the best way for Fred Olen Ray to make you spend 14 dollars on published published by a great story of 70 cheese. Ray is the foremost in RetroMedia. Ray by way makes Charles Band look more than a stucco ceiling on Ford Falcon. Just very bad now, both- and boring instead. It is good that Ray reminds the past and sometimes it is a public domain like the other video video videos but in the case of Zombie Death House- (the word "Zombie" has added to increase ownership and interest for part FOR The only way to do this for TRIPE is to open IT on the DOLLAR market for a COLLECTOR video and SAXON fans !!! If you want to see a real Saxon, take a Black Christmas, Fantasy on Elm Street or The Glove.
