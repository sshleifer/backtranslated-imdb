It seems just amazing that someone read this script, and think, "This is amazing! I mean, it's so hilarious it should just be done!" Who was this man? Is he the person responsible for this? Are they the ones who give me my time, more than the director / author? This video is increasingly possible in many ways. No one has been a good conversation, and not one good character. And the story ... <br /> <br /> I would like the movie 2 worse, the Hogan Hulk's "No Hold Barred" for this very much. It seems almost Shakespearen to compare. The last is set out for a few minutes of entry, and is still less than 80 minutes. The departure includes members who are casting off the 'hilarious' mistakes they have made, and things that happened on the 'comedy' set. Enjoy seeing someone laughing in some way, and connecting to this 'film'. Nothing in this film is funny. Nothing. Just going on, and on. It is true that he is blind. I love films that are very bad are good. This is very bad ... something, but I don't know what, and I never know it will ever look. Amanda's Peet does not really absorb, and in fact it is only half a good thing about this wannabe film. But, that means little. Avoid at all costs.
