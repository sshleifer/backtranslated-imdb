This is really the worst movie I saw. Forever. Period. In fact I paid Â£ 3.50 to look at this crash of this movie. It is so incredible, unthinkable to work, a bad script, often unknown and too many that do not seem to be important to the general film (like when Heath Ledger's priest was clung to the wall and spirit ... what was it in the situation? on the postcard please ...) / I need to get a medal for joining this film at all times of flight. I would like to take a sharp kick to the groin than to sit through this film again. <br /> <br /> This should be healed under IMDb 100. I hope my lots of 1/10 will help in that way.
