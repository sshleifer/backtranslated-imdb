*** Comments are tricky *** I was thinking on this show as a TV show when they started an exciting music under ALL SCENE, while Don Epps was describing the amount of bullets for each case, while Diane Farr was clearly pregnant (but we did not know) and when Colby was a ***** g TRIPLE agent. But now, in this night, David has been beaten by the work of paranoid, the work of a nut who is a wise, wise, in the elevator and .... YOU DON'T KNOW. A knowledgeable, knowledgeable person who has been 1 through the door many times and has experience in hand-to-hand combat, DO NOT USE THE NUT OF THE NUT. Not when speaking a nut, he looks away, takes off his head, closes his eyes; even when it looks on the fiber optic wire wriggling around the ceiling as a stripper for pole for 20 seconds. <br /> <br /> Then the area came to let me know that if I enjoy learning from chubby, campaign but charming Charles Epps and sexy sidekick / love Amita's interest, on Friday night will be better spent otherwise involved. Don gives David "a word of distress" which is the principle of "S ** t is almost going down"; David is ready, kills lighting, stopping the elevator, amazing seed work and ...... <br /> <br /> David cannot delete / kill / log in to write JOB. A bad person takes with BOTH GUNS, David ends SHOT. <br /> <br /> I've done. Hope NUMB3RS is fun.
