The eyes of Werewolf (1999) is a very bad movie. The cluster was very good but the overall implementation was terrible. I wanted filmmakers to take their time with this project rather than rush into production. Some of the blind blind people get new eyes, the worst thing is that they are the old umbrella. Bad things begin to happen with a dude as he turns into a cheesy look. What? Can he get treatment before his fianc√©e is learning? What? Who is the little one who helps out and what is the male girl? If you want to know, see the Eyes of Werewolf! It is not a bad idea for the film. I just liked the filmmakers would use a lot of time before production before deciding to hit the movie.
