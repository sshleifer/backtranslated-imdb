This is one of the worst movies I have seen for a long time. Not only the story, but acting it is a terrible worst. The discussion seems like someone reading the news. This is counted as a comedy / drama / romance, not that! It's a little step, that's it. There is really no comedy and totally drama. When you go to a movie to see this I feel. I would like to recommend it completely. Pretty anything else that you choose to look will be better. This is the very movie of crime / crime. The events of the action spilled, and part of the story of the crime were very predictable. If you are not interested in good news, or good acting. And you just want to watch the 'foreign' film for a foreign appeal. Then this can be for you.
