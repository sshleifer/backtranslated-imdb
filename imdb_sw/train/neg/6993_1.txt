What's a bad movie. I can't believe I have lost a hundred hundred of my life watching this renewal. Please tell me why Ving Rhames and Mehki Pfifer are listed on this film? Mehki Pfifer is good at E.R and Ving Rhames maybe didn't know what she was doing. I feel so much for them. Music history must say it is not appropriate ATLLLL and the story and it's amazing how you can find these directors who can't totally live in a good and horizontal film. I hope that in the future there will be no director like this terrible, he would destroy the same film. This film should not be done first. Advice for everyone who has seen, please tell me I'm sure because I can't be the only observer who hasn't enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> BOOOOOO !!!!!!!! -10 out of 10.
