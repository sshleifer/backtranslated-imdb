A bad way (although it's good for B's movies), it's good to fight quickly, more than 5 out of 10. In the television version, he shares a short time near Jeff Speakman, even a kiss in the garden. However, in the normal version (video), most of its events are cut off and do not talk at all. This bothers me because it not only takes the female perspective (though it seems) to the film, it also makes the last shot seem to be bad. This film would have been better if they kept their exhibitions, because in these cases at least they have a personality, one that prohibits every Speakman says.
