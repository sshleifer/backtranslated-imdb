I don't know what this film is, in fact. It's like a school art school project. They never say why the world is dark, but it's always dark except for seconds per day. There is a long time, destroying the shots of all insects without cause. What a few discussion on the film is like the world and the nonsensical as a picture. The black woman enters the main character of the main character. Somehow she becomes pregnant one night, then she is shot in the head. The main character takes the body until it becomes cocoon after a white naked woman appears. I have never been beaten off and how the film can be ugly and useless. In fact, I would like someone to look at so they can tell me what they think is about. But I did not desire this level of hell for anyone else.
