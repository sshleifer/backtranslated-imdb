Please, even if you are in a worse situation, avoid this view. I don't think anything was the same as this film. On the recommendation of a friend I watched this and I revealed it in fact 1h and 48 min of my life under the closet. A bad job, a cynical attitude, a story of weakness and pathetic action - and when you combine this together you get "Two Effects". Even a bit of expectations have not been reached. I think I've learned one thing - Never look at Van Damme's action. They are losing for some time!
