This was the fear of hell when I was a young man. Now I find it more exciting than horrible, but for some of the best moments of being uncomfortable and for the kind of evil that I love. And, come to think, the plot is rather a disgusting fact ... but dealt with some kind of taste. If there is a problem with this film, it is that there are huge boundaries where there is nothing exciting or interesting that happens. Also, the end goes forever, making the peak of the seemingly silly looks over time and Barbara Bach screaming and screaming. "Monster", after disclosure, is not very unfortunate. A particular view of the movie is also working against it, making it as a television movie more than something done for movies. But it is an example of non-made films today and I encourage fans of fear to look at and feel a bit of nostalgic ...
