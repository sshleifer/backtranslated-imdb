I sit down to watch this film with my friends and very low expectations. My expectations were not so close and enough. I honestly could not explain what kind of film this was from looking at it, and if it was a comedy, humor was completely missing. The plan was absent and acting was bad. Friends and I were able to watch about 30 to 40 minutes of this film before removing it and requesting to quickly store the video store to return. I do not recommend this movie to anyone unless you are looking for deliberate films. I honestly do not know how this film lasted more than a day in the exhibition and more than I can understand why anyone would like to watch it, considering not only the name of the lust but also the lack of popular artists / popular characters in it. This review is not a joke and I honestly think this could be the worst movie ever made. It is really the worst movie I ever had.
