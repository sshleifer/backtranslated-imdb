They often say that Tobe Hooper just hit the fortune with his awesome 1974 grisly 'The Texas Chain Saw' film and every time I see another Hooper film - the view is only enhanced. It seems that Hooper wanted to make his own version of films such as Scanners and Firestarter in 1990 and so we end up with the Fire of Fire; A positive film with a much more heavy load borrowed from other films. Put it all together and get a terrible, boring film that most people would lose! The film leads the audience to believe that it may be half of honor at the beginning and an amazing story behind which focuses on some experiments made to two young people in five years. Couples have a child and soon after that they are dying to death due to experiments. For several years the child is now an adult named Sam; but usually he is not an ordinary person and soon finds that he has the ability to set fire to love. <br /> <br /> The movie stars Brad Dourif, who must be like a good cast of cast given to his success and play for children two years ago; but in fact it was an unconditional decision if the central performance was terrible; and was not supported by horrible displays. The turgid trends and the red script are also unfamiliar with most of the films of the grace and the lack of pleasure continue with special effects, which are not quite available and nothing in the films that come out; all done several years earlier. The program is very slow and about an hour before the note, and I didn't care yet. Soon it becomes clear which the direction of the film will come in and all of it drowns under a permanent type that you could expect. The final struggle is a great ambition and nothing is explained during the film. It is not that any revelation would be so appealing. In general, this is a trash film and another reason why Tobe Hooper is a long way to become a great director of fear. See again Firestarter instead.
