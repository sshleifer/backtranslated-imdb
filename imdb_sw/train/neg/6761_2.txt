Let's be honest. As a school film project, carried out without budget and "real" actors, this is an interesting interesting film. As an extract from the DVD to an innocent viewer, it is a very non-profit product. If I were changing the stations and I happened to catch this film by accident, it would probably catch my eye and alert for a while. As a person who bought this DVD under the impression that I would like to find good brands of movies, namely the film, I feel very much. It's playing for videotaped television, something along the line of serials of 60 years, but without some charm. In addition to the man who led Mr Redfield (who is also the director), other actors seem to be leaving the campus (very little indeed in fact), or members of the household's director, who are seen in front of the camera without help from not just a bed bed , but also the make-renewal artist or the bonnet (bonnet on the permanent bangs or the top hat on the mullet is a very long way from creating 1840s). It is all the bullets using an undetectable camera on a small label, sometimes using blue screens for external backgrounds. Synthesizer generated by an unsupported "scenario" scenario is shouting to the audience more than once. The film tries to “be like a dream”, where it is actually just connecting without the infection of those shots that made it edit (and believe me, rates were not very much to start with). There is an interesting conversation every time and now, but in general it is very favorable to the production of two pieces through more than one and no flashes of genius from the director or any of the staff members. That is how the "art" films tried to look at 80 years. Mr Redfield is doing a very good job as an actor rather than a director.
