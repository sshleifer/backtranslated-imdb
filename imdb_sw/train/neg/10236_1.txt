Very good. Now, before the movie is playing on their string, let me explain. As I enjoyed, this is just one of the worst films I have seen and it is actually the worst film I have seen on the movie (extraordinary claim, if I remember seeing Daredevil on the big screen). Two directions (Daniel Gillies and Elisha Cuthbert) were feeling better and worse when they were worse. Of course, they were not helped by a script which had deep emotional like Daphne & Celeste one with a character that was almost as enticing as an OJ defense. The plan (advocating a little time) was thin and absent with 'gore' events, while of course the brutal, they were trivial and laughably formulaic. It is a plan that surrounds the example of the twenty-something (Cuthbert) who has been taken, closed and tortured for various visceral, psychological and physical suffering. The events of torture feel like isolated pieces and the emphasis was placed on surprises rather than torture the audience. While there is so much truth, the best of the drawings from this film, its redeeming elements are very bad that make the bad film. I've never heard more audiences in the movie. Within twenty minutes, the whole movie was in stitches and remained that way around. For my part I came out with laughing and laughing, I was angry with the film that had grown so carefully with the horrible films of the film. In any way you look at, this is really the success of the movie and the wannabes program of future recipes describing how to make the film. <br /> <br /> P.S. I stopped mentioning that I was able to enter the film free of chargeâ€¦ so I can laugh at it. I was still tempted to ask my money back ... in fact it was bad.
