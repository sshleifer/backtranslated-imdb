This film was based on real truth? I'm not real hope! We see what appears to have many armed soldiers empty large quantities of guns for 2 boys who just got a torso of weapons. That's a good idea; The aim of the weapon! ... apologize to me, but how about their big heads of oil cannot be held or their feet to cry loudly. Or was there invisible invisible tanks? were they from Crypton? Have I lost something here? <br /> <br /> This movie started enough but after 20 minutes of bullet-out takes the side of the boringlane. The style of the document does not work for me, but that's something that one finds a few or not. Unspecified things that make it difficult to see through 'end. <br /> <br>> 3/10 for good editing.
