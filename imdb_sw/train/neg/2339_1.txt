This interesting film looks more like a mix of music videos on MTV than the real film. There is no real story and if the film goes you ask yourself: "What will happen?"; but nothing happens. Stories near Eric Cloeck, a troubled writer, is the only thing. Some people seem to have nothing similar: then why connect them in the film. For music you can make the movie worse. When I open the pipe and the water comes out with Bach music then many people would like to watch it but this is not the film. The director should learn how to write a script for a movie of 100 minutes or more before starting to lead the film.
