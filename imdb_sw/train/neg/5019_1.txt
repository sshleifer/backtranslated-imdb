This film was a waste of time, even rented on a DVD. If the camera cameras get faster than this, we can also pay twenty buche to follow, get a popcorn, and check the spin of the dryer. Jet Li is better than this. One can only hope that he will not make any deals soon to make another film like One. <br /> <br /> If there is one film you should avoid, this is "One".
