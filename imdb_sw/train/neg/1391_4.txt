Before this was made for TV movies started, I had a low expectations. That is because it was done after the last period of the series revealed and many sources of the series have gone. No President Sheridan, Delenn, Lennier, Londo, Vir, G'kar or Lyta. If you remember, for the second part of the series, periodically except Zack, Vir and Captain Lockley left B-5 forever. Now for this film they brought back to Garibaldi (who was not in the last B-5 film) to join Zack and Captain and Doctor makes a short and useless appearance. But because much of it has come from the old chemistry, this film has already been severely disabled. The movie is about Hunter Soul (Martin Sheen) who is led by Babylon 5 in search of a spirit-filled world that has been stolen from a mysterious reserve and archaeologist (Ian McShane). Many things that come out of the jumbo-joke occur but are actually all that was proud and useless. Yes, yes, the center was close to the fire but it was saved by all, but I really felt like it was a case of "that there has made it - and doing it better in the past". The secondary plot, given more for comic aid, was more interesting, if the entrepreneur has put in place humanitarian and those who were ordered did not know what to do and when they tried to put pressure on them, they were beaten by the case. This was strong, but it was a little laughter - something that the other dreary was not. <br /> By the way, Sheen did a good job of playing Hunter - with his wild eyes and wonderful delivery. However, many times in the same period fell out of character. This would have been proved and corrected. So the final judgment is only this for a total of B-5-nuts (as myself). Some see it could be thought that the series was burned - which is a great injustice. This is a good example of the show without knowing when to stop.
