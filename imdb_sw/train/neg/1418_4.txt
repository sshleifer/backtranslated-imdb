I don't know why this trend has ever endured in the movie business! This movie (short) is great (say limited)! It is a group of children aged 5-7 who wear diapers and big bobby pins, they act as adults (and also very!). However, it is interesting because it is a good example of how "good old days" might not be good after all! (Thank GOD we have laws against this type of equipment now!) This is one short from "Shirley Temple Festival"
