This seemed to be a good film, I thought it was a good movie, and in all the film I had hoped it would be a good time to use, and yes, I must admit that the talent of working on Dimple Kapadia and Deepti Islands are really recommended, but with The best bid this movie is not suitable for presenting a meaningful message, which appears it seems to be what Somnath Sen tries to do. The last step comes in a short time and the end seemed unpleasant after all that happens; A little like real life in that respect but different movies and real life reaches 2 hours and end you should leave the audience satisfied, if that really was the intention of the director. This is decreasing in such a way and that is the most discouraging. Another feature that involves me is the national stereo record of American characters - all of them seem to have been covered out of one block. It seems to me that many American actors in English English movies depend on how ordinary Indians know Americans to be like and it is clear that no efforts have been made to bring any deep meaning or difficulty to any American in the movie. <Br /> <br /> These two elements put together the story of despair.
