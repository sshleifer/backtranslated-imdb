This film was a great disappointment. <br /> <br /> I take the opposite view of critics. This is not the material that does not reach the level of practitioners; here the executives (Bette Davis and James Cagney) do not only have the level of equipment. Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert were everything big like Davis and Cagney, and checked how It Happened One night turned out - it's all the time of the classic. With such stories, Davis proves that they have no talent for comedy (the good thing for him that this is on the comedy alone he tried!) Davis' one-performance performance adds petulance, but no nuances of acting Colbert in One Night. Cagney, who was a good actor, looks just to balance and cost her, Davis. The script provides lines and spelling, but the delivery seems to be better than the player than comedy. <br /> <br /> The part of the problem is the sound of the voice, which, like the delivery of Davis and Cagney, seems more suited to the average actor than comedy. Jack Carson, who played such roles in all his work, has managed to handle the same material. In the normal role of assisting Eugene Palette provides decent performance. For a little different role as an ancient western relic, Harry Davenport, is very good. But in one of his poor performances, William Frawley is very aggressive. Regular references to his behavior to fighters are a bad attempt in irony. I love every one of these singers, and it is a shame that, as they do not have access to chemistry and no better results than Mrs. C.O.D.
