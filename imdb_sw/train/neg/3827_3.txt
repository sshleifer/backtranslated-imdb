It seems, derived from nature, odd and Western. The two most famous stars (Charlton Heston and James Coburn) both offer exhibitions which are far from the best, and indeed; both have high roles and characteristics of character specifically mentioned and discussion. Heston is a sheriff who "loved the world as it was before" and Coburn is a defendant who "gives him something that he has bound and paid his debt". Additionally, Heston is so old that he has trouble riding a horse and Coburn is mean and hard but not as a bloodthirsty killer as some of the minor criminals. Apparently, film artists could not come up with one original idea of ​​how to make this film known. (* 1/2)
