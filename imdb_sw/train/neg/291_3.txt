The Broad-Broadway show of Sandra Bernhard's show of one woman is violence. Sandra eliminates rest and superstars actions, but her feeling of feeling is just interesting, and very appropriate. His fans will say he is honest, and that can be true. But it is also interesting, with modern non-modern, face-to-face that is not suitable for films in this type. They don't want to do well - and certainly not out of making friends - and that's always going to lead many people a bad way. But even if you meet half of it, its material here is too low. Filmmaker Nicolas Roeg has been an executive producer and, although not directed by him, the film has its own signature, signed everywhere. Bernhard wrote a celebration with director John Boskovich; Their whole touch was to have all of Sandra's local listeners wanting to get out of it - they feel the most realistic viewers will share. * 1/2 from ****
