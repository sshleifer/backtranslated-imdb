Dr Mordrid is afraid. I will not recommend any adult or child to see this unless they are already murderers. There is a lot of dirt in this film hurt and yes. Speaking with eyes, there are eyes in heaven, against the rise of stars. Only Satan can think of such a bad thing. I lost every copy I could from the local video stores and beat them with a pounds of 5 pounds. The movie should remain locked in the basement behind the 4th dimensions and all the other horrible animals of Hell. Yes where this movie is of. I advise you if you want a certain scandal of the scandal, go and rent All Dogs Go to Heaven, or Angels In Outfield. These movies should see. If you want to sin and love bad movies, you need to see Dr Mordrid.
