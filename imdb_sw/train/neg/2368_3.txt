Well this is stupid, they say they are not making another film of dreams, that this is "last" one ... And what are they doing? They continue to do the other, not the second (part7) was the BAD, but why they beat us. However this film did not know what-so so ever, it was very bad, the characters were very common, Freddy was another joker, which is very stupid for such a good series. The plot is very bad, and this is even worse than part 2 and 5. I've never got a movie, its stupid story in 3-d, useless! Id says. I hated this film so much I still wrote all the parts that I did not like was the whole film. were different, voted long. How can they go away? Did they not see they made serious mistakes in 2 and 5 pieces? Still do they? All of its money, Do not see this SAD IN NIGHTMARE SERIES. <br /> <br /> NIGHTMARE IN THE ELM STREET SIX (6) 3 out of 10. <br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF THE MOVIE: It was likely to have plot. <br /> <br /> BAD TRAINING FILIA: Awesome Work / Lack of Deaths / Too funny to be classified as a very frightening / controversial.
