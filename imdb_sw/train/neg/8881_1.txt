The character of the character is a little complicated, as it is the first time the person of the actors has appeared on the screen. Unfortunately, one of the best actors, Jean Simmons (played many roles on television, as in Star Trek TNG and At Night Night), dies quickly and afterwards his job may lose. <br /> <br /> The lead role is Mr Ballard, as shown by Cliff Robertson. Cliff is forced to carry this film in his body language for a long time. It does not work badly, but it is very difficult to ask for an actor to seize a non-timing sea where characters use their time to talk and do not work. Robertson's most memorable role may be Ben Parker in the last 3 Spider Man movies (around Tobey Maguire). <br /> <br /> The plan is predictable. The man kills his rich wife in his money. after that the wife appears to come back again and hate the husband to expel the madman until he jumps from the top window (fearing his wife's deadly specter) the day he predicts death. The second player Mr Ballard employs a lot like the English Hamill logo. Uncanny really! The only thing that has stood is a refusal to talk. Many minutes pass quietly, no one says, and a few actions. It is a shame people of MST3K caught this movie. It may be better, if not just predictable, and more dialogue, or short scenes of 'desolation.' I continued to expect the red eyes of G'Mork to appear from the shadows and declare that it works for "something" that stays in this film.
