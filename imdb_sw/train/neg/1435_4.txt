This film was made in Saskatchewan and Manitoba Park and returned to the world again with a little "Wild Western Canada" was left. Archie when he started writing his stories on paper; The thought of that day was to separate the desert and change the First People's Nation. <br /> <br /> The film puts forward and asks a question; Why can an educated, knowledgeable English teacher be India? Archie, as a dream of a young English boy about being something but knowing the full meaning of that dream is unique and worthless - no matter what it is. It seems like the story of a popular puppet is not. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, I saw Archie being my pictures of "Indian Cigar store" very tall and not realistic at all - very well working for Mr. Brosnan. He also showed the wild Indian in the dance area for tourism. His perfection and truth did not reach him until he met and married his wife, Annie. Annie drove Archie in a way that would bring him to the front of the English world, not like himself but Gray Owl - the Canadian Native of the desert zone. This is the new Archie to be a safe image. <br /> <br /> Mr. Brosnan's translation as well as all Directors are well done. I looked at the document on Gray Owl and I think this is a great movie's great screen to add to my collection. Spoiler - I thought that the last events with Archie to meet with the Chief's Chiefs were a very good time in the film. The most beautiful island of Canada's lake with real places "Gray Owl". <br /> <br />
