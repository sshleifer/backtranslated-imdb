I watched this film. It is a good family movie; however, as the editor of Michael Landon Jr. did a good job of editing, the film would be better. Many events from context. I hope there is another movie from the series, both are very good. But, if another is done, I ask them to take better care in the edit. This story was everywhere and did not seem to have a center. Which is unfortunate because other series of movies were good. I enjoy the story of Willie and Missy; they are very good examples. Further, the romantic side of the audience always enjoys a beautiful story of love.
