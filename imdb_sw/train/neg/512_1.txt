It happens to me that some of the films that have been blocked during the movie history were very real and very good film. I would like to say that instead of banning the success, the films should focus on the films that are so bad that it is a threat to your IQ and your hygiene. If they had to do it one of the first films to quickly hide it undoubtedly to be "Stroker Ace". This film is bad and 'A' capital. It is a very bad film Burt Reynolds who has ever had a star in .... quite completely for someone with "Cannonball Run II", "Cop with half" and "Rent-A-Cop" on its CV! <br /> A thin-thin story gives us a successful car racer Stroker Ace (Reynolds), someone who loves fast cars and fast women. He is caught in a humiliating contract with a misleading player Clyde Torkle (Ned Beatty). The contract makes him do a humiliating development work with a new fast food chain, such as wearing a big chicken. From the mixture is Lugs (Jim Nabors), pal's pal wice, and Pembrook Feeney (Loni Anderson), bimbo and brain slightly more than pea who is wooed with ace. <br /> <br /> Hal Needham, director of this waste waste, was formerly stuntman and made many films that depended on his expertise in interesting stunts and people's car. Some of these films were the same, like "Hooper" and "Unlimited Stunts", but with "Stroker Ace" he reached the active nadir. The characters are so ignorant that they feel compassion for the operators they play. Anderson is primarily responsible for the origins that make you shave your teeth by despair. Humor is weak and inferior to everywhere, and stunts and series of race is unremarkable. Even out-takes during the closed credit (which can be found in all the cooperation of Reynolds-Needham) usually does not want, which gives the impression that maybe the film was not very happy to do. "Ace of Stroker" is a stinker of magnificent magnitude.
