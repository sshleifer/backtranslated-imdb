In 1967, mine workers found the remains of an ancient lost civilization called Aban who believe there is a world of light and darkness. When they opened the gate between this world for the past ten thousand years, something worse than before the gate is closed. Twenty-two years ago, the Paranormal Research Bureau of 713 was led by Professor Lionel Hudgens (Matthew Walker), who conducted an experiment with orphans. In modern times, one of these children is the sole observer of Edward Carnby (Christian Slater), who has found only a part of Aban in South America, and is driven by a capable man. When a good friend of the dog's house falls in the middle of the night, he explains that the demons are returning to the earth. With the help of the scholar of Aline Cedrac (Tara Reid) and the leader of the Office 713, Cmdr. Richard Burke (Stephen Dorff), and his squad, are fighting against evil creatures. Besides having a good casting, led by Christian Slater, Tara Reid and Stephen Dorff, "the only in Darkness" does not work and is a complete mess, without the development of characters or conspiracy. The reason can be explained by the "brilliant" interview of director Uwe Boll in the DVD's, where he says that "video videos are best sellers of young generation that are not led by books". In addition, his listeners wanted to be people between the ages of twelve and twenty-five. Sorry, but I find two orders not honoring young generations. I have a daughter and a son, and I know many of their friends and they are not the same kind of stupid discrimination the director says. Additionally, IMD provides the best statistics to show that Mr. Uwe Boll is completely wrong. My vote is three. Title: (Brazil): "alone in the dark?" O Despertar do Mal "(" alone in the darkness "to wake up evil")
