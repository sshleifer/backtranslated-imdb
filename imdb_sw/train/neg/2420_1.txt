I often say only on movies that I like, marking "everyone for its own taste," but here I want to make discrimination. The premise of this movie, which somehow seems to be lost in shuffle, is that two adults involved personally have the right to go to Las Vegas, drink, marry, and cause unpleasant suffering on their children. Even allowing cultural destruction, they do not have the courage or the sense of responsibility to wake up the next morning and delete what they did. After all, "love" is very important, isn't it? Hell and everyone else. If things or "work at the end" is not true; in fact it is not meant. The fact is that disrespect for others, especially if they are young, and especially in a position of dependence, is made light and therefore enhanced by this film. There are many instances of innocence that "parents" do not work that would bring the social workers' army over their heads.
