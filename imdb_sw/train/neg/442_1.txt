This game was done by Sega. Made by Sega I did not expect much, but I also didn't expect this junk either. At the beginning the camera leads work against you in this game. Motorcycle is your way around. Motorcycle is a very bad place in the game. At any time you run away from something that you hold there and travel. You can never stop the bike or fall for it. The protagonist cannot talk even though he has the right voice. The graphics are awesome. You are climbing trees on your bike. The camera makes war with the enemy impossible. This game can not even deserve rental.
