It is one of the best things about being limited that one can easily be deceived by advertising. I have spoken earlier in another film, which the film business (comedy) makes it seem funnier than it is. Seeing this ad for this year 1981 makes me think this will be a wildly funny film. What my brother and I went and saw and I didn't know was that the area used in the TV advertisement was the last part of the film! <br /> <br /> Since this area is the final result of all the previous in the film, I can just think that nothing else to use funny! The last area is, because of the young potion, Dr. Fu Manchu returns from an old elder old man, inside of a bright Asian boy / Elvis like a rock star! (With the back singers are not down!) Some of the actors were just too quick with my brother and I sat in this way without laughing for anything. It was only natural that we were expecting a kind of "Pink Panther", Peter Sellers was very good. It is a shameful disgrace this was his last film before he died. His appearance on the Muppet Show was more entertaining than this sickly flop. However, I am not mistaken. I make a mistake everyone involved to try not to make the best film of this. 2 stars are being generous !!
