This film makes Peter an Elf in Robin Hood's clothing instead of a man in a costume-perhaps-Robin-Hood costume and ignores all the aspects involved. This film makes Wendy be a idiot to knock. And poor Captain Hook TOTAL clown. And in fact if every Disney cartoon must have a character that has had too many hits head, they made one of the lost voters that one. The only character that has never been disturbed in this film is Tink. The only star is its. Is it just a story? Darling parents don't even have time to identify their kids gone !!! It is probably the most important thing in the original story and destroyed it! Also the famous nursery area between Peter Pan and Wendy is a wonderful piece - No thimbles and no acorns - one of the small things that makes the original story as a unique one. It is even amazing that he has lost his shadow and helped him to seize. (Even with his shoes and it is not good for me.) \ T Now the sun now if you do not know before - this version of Disney does not have anything commonly common with the original story - which is not just a story of children but a great, beautiful story. <br /> <br /> This irritates me.
