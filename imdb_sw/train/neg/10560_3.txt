Many other viewers here, including many of whom I respect, hold this piece of fear of Europe's sleaze with a lot of attention. Personally, I did not like it at all. The most unusual attempt in the cross of the intermediate period of sex and abuse. Jess Franco with his ability makes these kinds of film very well. Unfortunately, the filmmaker of Joe D'Amato's filmmaker does not. D'Amato's most popular films are bad for outdoor exposure. This, the original film with him, does not contain the most disgusting events that characterize his worst "Anthropophagous" and "More Dark" performed. Finally, his unusual film that cannot manage the viewer in any way. Without a sleaze feature, it becomes very bad. As I said, some have enjoyed this film, but I've just got a perfect example of writing for laziness. <br /> <br /> There are a few movie stations. Ewa Aulin (from "Candy") is in it, and it looks very good and often has honey. However, the icon of the cult film Klaus Kinski is completely lost in a small non-affiliated film. She is tired of the role and has no manic ability to do very well. The color of the music is good and there are some moments of unusual odd gore gore. Still, this is an engaging and insignificant film that can be very motivating. (3/10)
