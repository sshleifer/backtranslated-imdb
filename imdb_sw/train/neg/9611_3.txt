There are very good things about this movie that I can't name but a few: <br /> <br /> BOGART behavior: 1. Name it ?? Whip McCord (very simple, so I will leave it at that.) Boy, makes the sound of 'Humphrey' beautiful.) 2. His long hair, red and brown socks. 3. Its black Bart get-up, full with spurs! 4. I do not know what the shadow of the lipgloss they wear, but it is not also the one that is interesting. CAGNEY's character (Jim Kincaid): 1. His lipstick mouth does not make him any favor, either. 2. The person screams for his hat during the entire film! Could they find a hat to match him? Even less? !!!! 3. Its plates are very tight back. 4. He smokes off the gun once, if you know what I mean, and I think you're doing. <br /> <br /> If you are a typical fan of Bogart or Cagney, and the figure may be changing the speed of seeing them in the west, make yourself a permit and don't forget the idea. IN THE SURVIVAL OF SURVIVORS IN INDIA! (That is, when they don't look at the exit.) It is all the same, I agree that in the west it is my kind of small film, but I have seen a lot, it's better than this. At the comedy level, or as the top camp, Oklahoma Kid works. Otherwise, it is an observer. So, just look at this as a) you should see every western b) you are a perfect Cagney or Bogie c) any of the above comments are interesting to you. Woah ?? ..
