I shared with IMDb only to comment on this film. I've been through this movie, and the only thing that impressed me, is that somehow I was able to stop. I have seen a good number of movie action and not, but Princess Blade has some evil fights I have seen on the film. Many sword battles involve waiting for the back and four questions and hope the opponent does not do the same. I have seen the best films of students and the best steps and the stadiums. Now we have a film of "futuristic action" and the worst action, and almost no sign of the future. Most of the movies do not even have any action and shows the ongoing relationship with Princess and the farmer / terrorist and his troubled sister. The movie has many plot lines, and none of them pan pan out of the value of anything. <br /> <br /> The part of the problem may be that I watched the dub, which was quite bad. All were healed in their mumbled lines so it was difficult to follow what went on. But I have a great idea. (Knowing exactly what was said he could not save the film in front of me) \ t That's what I thought was when I heard about it, and now I've lost 90 minutes of my life. Don't let this happen to you. Keep clear.
