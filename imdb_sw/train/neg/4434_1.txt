I lost this film, thinking it looks like a good historical piece. I found it a piece of garbage. This film was sparked in many places, almost everywhere and horrible in all places. Mira Sorvino's performances of the queen playing a young student declined. Ben Kingsley should be stripped of his skills by considering this film as one of his projects. Fiona Shaw should definitely stick to play Petunia Dursley; The movie at least Harry Potter is more entertaining than this thing they call to play inside the film. <br /> <br /> The movie looks like a college student took a class in 101 movies and miserable. Almost every movie area has been cut with some effect; The final result is actually a bit of editing which I've ever seen. Jay Rodan was almost like Elder; very bad had such a bad script to work with. Rachael Stirling gives her a good effort as a lost woman for waiting. At the end, I would like the Blockbuster Video paid back. I am so glad I didn't use 10 bucks to watch this fiasco on the theater. Having made this game of Marivaux since the 18th century, it makes me wonder how many people over the years have had better naps during this work. If I were there, they didn't hear the play on snoring. Thank you for the convenience of modern DVD players; you can jump back to boring or bad scenes. I think that means I just look at the beginning and the end!
