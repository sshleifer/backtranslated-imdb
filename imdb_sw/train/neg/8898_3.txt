Can damage images? You can't think so, but it's true to me here. Listen, I have a lot of old movies and I know a lot too much, as well as drivers of immobile drivers in front of screens, etc.. But much of the hokey business is related to action events. Having a fake landscape, artificial mountains and flowers shooting after being beaten as seen in the "Brigadoon" expires over time. <br /> <br /> In addition to music entertainment, this is always independent. What songs a person likes, one should not be a great part of judging the film (if someone likes songs). I was able to explore this movie with the 1950s of corny, dancing, romances and characters but that was' 50s and many people liked these things. Music performed very well in '50s. I, I loved '30s and' 40s with a big tap. For '50s, the pipe was out with these new things - which I can stand - was. What? That makes this movie lousy? Not only does the one I don't care very much about the most beautiful, the best director and the great prospects, this film hit a box at the box office, and with me. I liked to love more, being a dream myself and that's a good part of this story. It is not a stupid and beautiful city and good people who make it sound good appeal. Then why can't I connect with this film? His part was also playing. I don't care what you chose to play on the tap on the screen. But - it didn't really free me. There was no Scotland, no top islands, just a hokey history to look at it that way and turn me around from the beginning. Take one step to the reality of today where "goes to the place" many times.
