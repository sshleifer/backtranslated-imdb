This is almost the worst movie that you ever see! 2012 Doomsday now draws a rug from under this, for me. Props is a perfect example of what Frank Zappa once called 'cheepnis.' It seems like space events were made at the 1950 power station, before the damage. Music loves. Acting is wood and ham. The characters that show are inferior and don't know. The plan is predictable. It's immediately and transparent when they hit the technique and ideas from another film. The quality of the direction asks faith. But you should see it, if you only know what should be one of the biggest budget for the small budget. This is an indirect example of a stupid movie!
