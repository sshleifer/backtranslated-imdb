This is one of the worst horror movies I have ever seen ... Unfortunately, I am a movie buff movie and bored any horror movie unless it is for t.v. When checking the box says it is rated R for a year and a language ... Where were you? Was it the same place of death where you saw the truth? I could ignore that if there is a short shortage or good conversation. There was not even one laptop or exciting one on this mature film. Sometimes horrible movies are amazing because they are stupid, but this was just sad.
