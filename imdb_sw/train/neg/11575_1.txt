I have been studying the wonderful book of 'Goodnight Mister Tom' for years and was soon when I had the opportunity to look at this issue. I have heard the beautiful words about this, so I was very optimistic. Once this film was finished, I was scared. <br /> <br /> This film is not the best film. 'Goodnight Mr. Tom' was a very poor adapter and usually 4.5 / 10 of the book was missing. In particular, I have found that many characters and some good events in the book were not here. There was not much discussion, it ran and very fast-moving, but I was very at risk of the fact that it had never seen a love relationship between William Beech and Tom in this film that was actually dropped. Creating is not all good, either. I thought this might be very good, but it was quite different from the book! Instead of a bad situation, it is one of the worst I have ever seen. This deserves a good remake that would be better than 1000 times more than this rubbish.
