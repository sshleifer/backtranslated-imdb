I couldn't wait to receive the DVD after hearing about the film. It's a disappointment! This was one of the most mixed films that I have ever seen. There were many predecessors, others resembling others, that it was not difficult to follow the story line. I could not understand how George Clooney received the acting award for the film since he had no involvement, at least in the first half of the movie. My wife and I stopped after an hour of trouble and stopped the DVD. I was very quick to distribute to see if the end was better but after much confusion he decided that the upgrade space was small. The corporate partner told me that many films "come together" in the last minute or less. I was happy not to lose another time, waiting. I paid the DVD off the next day.
