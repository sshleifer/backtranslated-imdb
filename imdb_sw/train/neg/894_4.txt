You just saw yesterday at the Sao Paulo Internet Film Festival. Before I went I came here to see how it was tested, and at that time it was 7.4, a very good level ... After 15 minutes I had already died (I did not), but felt embarrassed to do so if the film producer was in the investigation. I did not like it yet, the conversation is unknown and no place anywhere, the characters are much lower than the conversation, there is nothing to guide anywhere, and the worse and worse: a lot of Motorola and organic ads on the film. Despite the fact that I have already offered to go to the movies and have fun, I still have to be bombed with the main character speaking on the Internet and the mobile phone is constantly going on his head; or another characteristic of bathing or just cutting his hair with a high-quality shampoo on the screen! All of this could carry as a plot, characters, romances, whatever was good, but it was bad, very bad! A "do not know how to do" sex-in-city. Do not waste your time or money.
