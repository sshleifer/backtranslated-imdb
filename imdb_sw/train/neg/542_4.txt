First of all there is a Gujarati Theater then there is a sound. Both have their strength and fan following. Vipul Shah director should look elsewhere instead of the Gujarati Theater when making sound production. First made Aankhen (adapted from a Gujarati play) - which had a unique plot, but could not be a Indian film. Now he has made another play Gujarati and his name Waqt - running against time. In general, the feeling is a stranger. The development of conspiracy is not a Hindi film. For example, playing between father and child is better left for the Gujarati Theater - do not bring in the Hindi film. Even the best track comedy left for Gujarati action. All exhibitions are moderate - there is nothing to shout about - to prevent Shefali Chhaya Shah who is wonderful.
