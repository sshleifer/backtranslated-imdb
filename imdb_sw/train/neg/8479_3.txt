Well, when I got to the board for this film, I was looking for people to enjoy it. I was surprised to see that people over the age of 7 liked it. I enjoyed the movie ... but just b / c me and my little sister (who is really just 10) did anything amazing. I'm sorry, Jordan, but bad. You know the movie is dominated to the toilet when leadership cannot act. And did not have a good script or plot to redeem. I thought also that the character of Pamela was very blind ... until-sleeping for pathetic. Even though he said, I thought there were a few characters, such as a nice Spencer, Hollywood, and Ronnie. Still, not enough to redeem the film. <br /> <br /> Two things about this film that I can just cross: <br /> <br /> 1.) The Spencer player would fall for it. Okay, eww. I looked at the date and time in fact, he is more than four years older than him, the difference in the "Go Go" was considered to be very big. Jordan is a very beautiful girl, but in GF, appeared as 10 or 12 ... appeared as a little child! Jake Abel (Spencer) appeared as a college student. <br /> <br /> 2.) That there is any way that Kristi Yamaguchi would just come to skate for one girl. I mean, I know that Katelin is good and everything, but it still seems impossible that Kristi will go to a boarding school that had no skating skills, or that the school would have used a skating coach and that relationship. It is all said ... it was not a very bad movie known, but it was not good even for DCOM levels, which I think is quite low.
