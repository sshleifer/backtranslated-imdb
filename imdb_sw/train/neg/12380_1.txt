The filing of this film was lost from the beginning when writers and directors left the good news, just replace the terrible threats. This film was seen to be of interest to children, but it could not even finish it. Most low-budget movies have the potential to be a great movie, but this film is not the place where it is close. Fortunately this will be another film made easily, and easily forgotten. This film was the possibility of practitioners to make a little money on the same side until their position came to a real role in a good film. Anyone who has a respectable film for film, should avoid seeing this film at all costs.
