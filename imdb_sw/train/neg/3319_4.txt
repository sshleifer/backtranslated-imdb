I was surprised to see this film. I would like to hear it better than published for the novel. I was depressed as I was. <br /> <br /> How any fan of Jane Austen can measure this situation is hidden from my eyes. Traders have decided to cling to the bits of humor which are embarrassing for the best time, but also damages the feeling of the period. As for the cast: Gwyneth Paltrow makes the heroine very unknown (but then any star of the 'hot' of the US will be doubtful in the role), Toni Collette is miscast, and the poor Ewan McGregor is made to look laughable! I can't say good about this film. I seem to be among the very few who do not have the standard, but if you want my advice, see instead of the TV-related production of Kate Beckinsale - you believe me, that's very good for this superficial trash.
