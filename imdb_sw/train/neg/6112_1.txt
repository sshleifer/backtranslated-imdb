I was thirteen years old, when I saw this film. I expected many steps. Since the Escape from New York there were 16-rated in Germany I entered the movie as a fall. It was very boring. Later I realized that this was just a decoration where the husband shows his wife. I mean today you are doing this through the internet and you pay for instant access. It's more than 20 years ago, but I'm still angry that I waste my time with this film. This is soft-porno for schoolboys. Eliminate Bo Derek and paint him with paint - beautiful. But then they should mention the film of Undressing Bo and drawing it.
