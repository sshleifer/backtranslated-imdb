** SPOILERS !!! !!! ** <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> The Cabin Fever has my complicated film for the WORST of the year ... which I have seen is. This movie is GARBAGE automatically! There are many mistakes and films that you can't help but wondering how bad it is. This movie was most likely to be good, but eventually did nothing. The characters were as dumb as one could be; for the whole movie you just ask yourself "why would you do that?" or "what are you sure in doing this?" ... this is how trivial and stupid characters are. We can not find the background in them, so you usually can't give the mouse as $ about their destiny ... you can just laugh at their ignorance. (/ Marcy) for example ... was he that horny that had slept with Paul (Rider Strong)? There was no point in it .... almost as if the creators of the film needed excuses to give him the virus so voila! UGH. Can anyone go into the forest and drink water from the cabin tap without looking for the first? Why did Bert not just hit the patient from the beginning? Modern would have been on the same way .... instead, they finished killing him yet. <br /> - Why took them so long that they finally decided to leave the cabin, even if they had to walk? 'No, I will wait until two second friends are infected (one far from death) and finally opt walking out there. What is the reason behind Paul's attempt to fish out of the body of the Hermit, just fall into the stem caused by a virus infection? STUPIDITY clean! <br /> <br /> I swear, common sense was not a friend, under the knowledge of these idiots. I don't think there is ever the end of more films. At first the children ask the cashier of a hick store what the gun was, and he answered that 'his to the niggers'. At the end of the film, the 3 boys of Black (dressed in clothing, one of them in the du-rag not down) go to the shop .... get to know that the cashier was scoring for them to use for hunting. Then, he keeps giving all the pounds and striking his hand and laughing around them as if it's his home. OK /> <br /> OK, WHAT HELL Was it a matter of that?!?!?! What? It is not possible that one could be, the film artists thought about putting it on the film? I as a black man was caused by the first 'Nigger' view. It was meaningless, useless words. My question to the creators of the film: what was the last and the Black children? Was it to make me forget about the original racist comments made earlier? To overcome things with the Black audience, to make jokes from them? Well, I for one, I didn't realize this exciting attempt to funny funny in a little bit. The whole movie was a .... The PATHETIC quiz in the film production that should not be given during the day. Peter Jackson thought this film was good? What film did he watch? ZERO * from star **** ... if I could give a low score I would like. Please, IMDbers colleagues, do not waste at 1 1/2 of your precious life to look at this disgusting 'movie'. This is one of the worst movies I have seen.
