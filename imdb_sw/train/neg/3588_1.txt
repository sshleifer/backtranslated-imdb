Tracking up to 1973 "Tall Walk" continues a real life game near the Buford Pusser's Tennessee car, but this unit resembles a TV film. Bo Svenson takes the lead from Joe Don Baker, but he is very gentle in part; comes as an ambling countryman with bat instead of guitar. Qualified staff like Richard Jaekel, Luke Askew and Robert DoQui die very little. I would like to give it one star star its good purpose, but the screens are transparent and lazy of normal events and production is the destinations. It was followed in 1977 with the "End of the Chapter-Walking Long" and the 1978 film with "Real Hero Hero".
