The reed Diamond has a husband who gets amnesia who has been in mind for more than ten years after she was found asking back and blood on her hands. Doctors want to test a new experimental drug that will return to lost memory if it works. But when drugs give him a false demon, he chooses to escape instead. When out he loves a little boy whose father (Greg Grunberg) opposes his mother, he did not let him close to the dark room in his apartment and make a whole hope. <br /> <br /> When the 'secret' of the film is tad easy to identify the way before it was revealed, I've seen the acting of Mr. Diamond have amazing enough to keep my thoughts around. (For the full interest of the revelation, I have been a great fan of his since being killed by its short, but most importantly, the role of Shield through the Walker & Dollhouse) is not a good film or good, but it can.
