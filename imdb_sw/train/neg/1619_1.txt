At the beginning of the movie, the beautiful pictures and the fox's events were amazing. However, the story was very slow and stimulating. Then the little girl begins to suck the dog, which leads to bad events. We live in the forest, and we often see foxes. One thing anyone should know is that it leaves wild wild animals, and enjoys them from afar. This movie sets a good example for children who will look at it, trying to create a wild creature. I don't know what the story of the story had to be. Even after the terrible events and the greatest fox, the little girl was still wanting to play with kits. What? He never learned his lesson? And there are other cases involving wild animal mammals, which only increase the pain caused by children watching this film. It's a disappointment that this movie was. And it's a very bad story that says. The last discussion discussed was stupid, and at the time my wife and I shouted on TV! I really hated this film, and I never recommend it to anyone!
