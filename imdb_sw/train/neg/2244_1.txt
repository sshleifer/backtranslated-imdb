There are two points that I need to make clear at first. First of all we know what Oscar this year was quite about this year. It was a way to show people that it was not color, and it has never been. They liked to erase all the previous ideas about themselves. Second, it is difficult to make a statement on the show, because in fact, what difference will it make? But, it's fun to write about it. This is the year I have been fed by Oscar! I will no longer look at the show. Every year they do something wrong. Before Crowe wins the "Gladaitor" when their real winner should be Ralph Fiennes for "Sunshine". If you haven't seen this film yet, see and you'll agree. The "Wide Shut Eyes" when it was released did not get a selection. And until this year it goes, well, the bad choice was on that place! Baz Lurhmann gets a selection of "Good Director"! Unatania !! "Good mind" is for "Best Make-up"? "Training Day" gets a selection? The movie was bad, and it seemed like Washington did not even turn into performance, all demonstrated he was, he knows how to use the four-letter words! That's the winning prize! Take the language and I bet it was about to play myself! I liked "Gosford Park", I did the truth, but why are they chosen 7? And how the world could not give Altman! I mean, c'mon, if there is only a reward for people to erase any bad feeling, what about Altman? That person has been a public eye for 32 years now with no Oscar! There were many, many things that bothered me about this year's Oscar, but, I will live with it, for a long time I've never watched another show! Highpoint (and only one) of the show was when Woody Allen appeared first to be awarded the prize. That will drop as one of the greatest moments in the history of the show.
