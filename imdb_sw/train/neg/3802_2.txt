I know that actors and actors act like trying different types of movies - hey, nobody wants to find a model - but Danny Glover, Brenda Fricker (happy birthday, Brenda!) And Christopher Lloyd should know more than this. "Angels in Outfield" is another movie where everything seems to disappear until someone or something comes hard and save the day. Do I even need to tell you how it ends? The movie is just ignoring the lowest down (models running on are the sci-fi cinema movies from '50s). If these films had a little political voice - or at least gave us new life - then they would be the same; this is just useless. Far closer to diabolical than angels. Also star Tony Danza, Adrien Brody and Matthew McConaughey, and I think they don't want to emphasize this in their renewal.
