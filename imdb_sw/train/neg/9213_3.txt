I got this movie in a small observation held by members of sports sports clubs. We predicted that this would be the "madness of reefer" of gaming, and this film more than release. <br /> <br /> Tom Hanks plays Robbie, the boy again starts his college career after "rest" for semester. What we, the viewer, we know if the film grows, is that Robbie was desperate for a game called "Mazes and Monsters," a game that he learns again after a gaming team took him to a campaign. <br /> <br /> This film looks on many levels, many. One section includes a "gaming lighting," which is probably the best way that I can describe. When I am sure that this was meant to be "worship" somehow, as many gamers know, it is very bad. Most role-playing sessions are held in comfortable rooms, usually on chee-tohs and soda particles. <br /> <br /> Acting, when not caliber, is not very good. This is one of the first responsibilities of Tom Hanks, and the Bosom Parliament and Bachelor's Degree were still one or two years on the horizon. The help that is used, while not very memorable, still provides good performances. Especially evil has become a TV-made movie that shows "playing games". see if you and your friends are a good night's movie plans.
