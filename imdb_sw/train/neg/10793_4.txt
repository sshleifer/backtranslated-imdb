I saw this film at the Toronto International International Festival of Toronto. According to the novel and science fiction writer Brian Aldiss, this film tries to tell Tom and Barry Howe's stories, twins who have been evicted from their families in order to create rock rock. Welcome to purpose, the film is also very clever and half (if you forgive the pun). By combining forms, styles and impressions, directors (whose original film was a waste of Lost In La Mancha) loses their way very quickly. I've never been sure if I meant to take it all by weight or not. Change, the dream system, was very little. Further, the promised and roll rock did not travel. I was reminded very much during Hedwig and Inch of Anger, the original and moving movie. But in this case, these songs were not good, nor did the great artists. The worst comparison would be the same as the desperate Velvet Goldmine.
