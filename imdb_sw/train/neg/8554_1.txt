The motion picture was, for any reason, made in 1930 and released in 1931. I would like to have a photograph of speaking a great difficulty making a change from the time of silence. However, this Zane Gray plot seems to be very weak. Also, Gary Cooper was perhaps just learning to act. The result is something that will not be accepted by today's standards. In 1931, perhaps. In 2004, it is unacceptable. Some actors did well. Sadly, the Indians always find a short end in this original west. They were living in the country long before a white man came, but according to a distorted history, they had no right to protect themselves.
