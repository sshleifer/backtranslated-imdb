"Three Unsuitable Daughters" are delicious, looking at the color of divorce, remarriage, and living with one parent. Obviously, social issues and economic difficulties have no place in the full picture of the life of a single parent of a parent who feels tired, takes a cruise, and then luxury and married to a conductor band. Even when the "only words of the film" causes the script to overcome the real life problems, "Binti" faces many many unusual songs, children who are not the foundation of true children and leader of the port port Iturbi himself. Isn't it any wonder that any real person can star in a movie that their people think they are getting married? True, this film was released in nineteen years. The love of the old romance of Hollywood and the only comedy can make a 'Daughter' film worthy.
