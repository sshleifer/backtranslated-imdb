I had to watch the film for my work, so I did not pay (on the contrary, I was paid), but I've got a movie to absorb more than the average. Witches were crippled, two leading actors ... well, using the "first-class women's club" in Hollywood, no longer in their "chick fire" age but more in their "district attorney" age. What was so angry with the film was the main line of the plot, which was very good "Beavis & Butthead Do America" ​​(which all the boys are jazzed on about some dude offering them money "make his wife", without realizing them 'expecting kill him). All in all, a piece of skin.
