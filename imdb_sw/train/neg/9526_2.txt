Way back when I had used the video for free I took this. OOPS Things that I wanted to mention out of the pre-release summary are these. 1: A person who had a lot to do and make this film had a wonderful fascination and ill for food, it was great and unnecessary. 2: There is some kind of sound behind the film that appears to be there all the time and the way I felt after the day after watching this trash I saw had something underneath. Maybe that was or was just very bad or both. Often in movies you can tell the author and director not had much experience or talent. And do not ask about acting.
