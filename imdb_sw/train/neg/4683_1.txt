As an old submarine, this was one of the worst submarine movies I saw. First of all, circulation inside any US Naval vessel, particularly Navy of Nuclear Powered Trident in an unlikely way. These men are better and are committed to their mission. The responsibility they carry is surprising and takes all the way from Captain to a member of the youth workers. I can't see any crew crew to break their union between Captain and Chief Officer. The CEO who acted as a character played by Denzel Washington would have been opened by the Martialed Court, then beaten by the Navy. Not surprisingly, the Navy refused to send a technical consultant to help make this film. Finally, if any of the crew members of the aircraft crew made the volume of the noise done on this instrument, they would be highly qualified. Traders learn early in their work to be quiet as much as possible to avoid detection. They do not have doors and even talk quietly and wear soft shoes while it goes. I was surprised how they described the staff as they continued. Sound music cannot be tolerated. I know to show pictures of submarine life really without selling film tickets, but this is up to the level of ignorance. I will not recommend this film to anyone.
