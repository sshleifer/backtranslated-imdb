I thought that these movies were losing what I expected to be better than they were. I am so happy to pay to see this film and that I didn't have a movie for this. Where to start on this film, acting in this film was moderate, humor was awesome and just the whole story of this movie was not specified. I thought that this film had a desire to be good, but it was not more than a waste of time. I think that acting in this film was the worst of the actors in this film had chemistry, it was not just. I think if we probably had a different player to play Kirk than Jay Baruchel would have been better but at all I watched this film looked up and I had no feeling that he was not working on this film. Now, Alice Eve did a good job as an actor but there was no chemistry between her and Jay. All actors in this film had no names and were not very affected in this film. Humor in this movie was not quite funny, there were a few of the films on this same film but nothing worth telling your friends that they would understand. I think Jim Field Smith had a difficult time with this because he couldn't decide if he wanted romance or comedy. In fact I think she needs to be connected to the Burger King ads. I think this movie would be better if the authors went to a different director. The story of this movie is the same as every girl boy of fire just a beautiful story of love story ?? boring I think it would have been better if it had more nature, but it's something to lose. Honesty did not recommend anyone to see this film. I think you will have more entertainment for a dentist than this film. So save the pain and not see it.
