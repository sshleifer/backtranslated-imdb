Joe Don Baker. He was good at "Walking Long" and had a good part in "Goldeneye", but here "Last Right" all hope has gone ... the dark side has won. Like most humanity, my great experience and this was on MST3K, and what experience! Mike and robots drag their claws into a good body of Baker and skewer this flick completely. It was obvious that they were just starting with "Mitchell" on their kick's fight with Joe Don and here they lie on the theme. <br /> <br /> It makes wonderful experience, though: there are a lot of riffs choice. My favorites - "John Rhys-Davies for sale", "It's 'Meatloaf: Texas Ranger", "None of them deserves a sponge", "Why was wearing her dress for bed", and my favorite - "' The son of the ... 'What was the son of: the son of Mazizi MONTH? ‚Äù<br /> <br /> By itself," the last judge "is, as Joe Don puts in the movie," a great oil nada ". But here, in fact has a value of entertainment. If you get a chance, get this version of the "Update Right". <br /> <br /> Two stars of "Last Right". Ten for MST3K version only. Oh, and try to visit Malta when Joe Don of the city.
