If you hate redneck accents, you'll hear this film. And to make it worse, you see Patrick Swayze, been trying to be redneck. In fact I can't stand redneck accents. I wish Billy Bob Thornton, was good at Slingblade, but was bitter in this movie. And what is the name of Lonnie Earl? How much hickish can get this film? The story of the story was stupid. It is usually not this movie, but I couldn't stand this film. If you want a good movie of Billy Bob Thornton, go see Slingblade. My mother bought this film for $ 5.95 on Wal Mart data ... I think I'll close and give to my grandmother for Christmas. It is possible that I cannot stand redneck naturally accents, or that I can't stand Patrick Swayze. Maybe if Patrick Swayze was not in it. I did not laugh once in the film. I laugh at any ridiculous size. If they showed other fingers to be pulled, I could laugh. The fingers of people who are lost by accident always make me laugh.
