I don't know about you, but what I like about Tom and Jerry cartoons are interactive (often violent) between the two characters. Mouse Manhattan sees Jerry leaving Tom behind to have an adventure in New York, and since I'm worried, this is probably facing a lack of cat! <br /> As magical as Jerry's 'Big Apple' search could be for other T&J fans who have commented here on IMDb, I couldn't wait for this trash to stop, so I could see the next cartoon on my DVD. In fact, the only part of the whole area that I really enjoyed was when Jerry almost 'buys a field', hanging fast at the end of a broken candle, hundreds of feet on the road.
