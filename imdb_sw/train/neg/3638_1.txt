The film shows France's uncomfortable problems with its colonial heritage in the West (Francophone) Africa in a financial and psychological way of a young woman, France (here symbolizes her national image). It is often a portrait of a controversial and challenging challenge of a young woman to achieve a terrible time in its history, in particular, and the national desire to reach 'another' which is once 'owned' and created. This seems in such a way that it puts things in close proximity to the idea of ​​travel (or being in transport) from now to old; he remembered the reality of the modern political and economic reality.

They are not just behind the dark and uncomfortable against France who wonder if he is trying to find a world that he has never known, and the hope of one that cannot be found in Cameroon.
