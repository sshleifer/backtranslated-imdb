I want to give this movie 10 ... I really do. Some movies, especially awesome movies are a budget that is good. The scarecrow has a sensible insight who can implement the cobs of grain as a bad weapon ... definitely suits this system of 'careful budget'. The depth of the movie is definitely its powerful and continuous action and allows to implement, keeping the audience on their seats actually causes creepy ... ninja ... youth-patient ... before thirty years old student ... Draw a cowboy ... Device-cracking ... A baby-bitch scarecrow in the limelight as a creepiest horror icon of the year. All I can say is, 'you can dig' and suggest watching movies like Frankenfish if you are interested in this type of hilarious fear. <br /> <br /> (WHAT HELL IN THE RUN??
