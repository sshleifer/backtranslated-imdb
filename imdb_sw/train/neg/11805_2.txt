Look at nature and the same head from 1944! This is made for television movies, it's just God-bad! Although it uses (as much as I can) around the same conversation, it doesn't work! Is it acting, leading the poor? Well so is it for TV, but why look at the bad copy, when you can get your original natural hands? Especially if you have been corrupted by the plot and not enjoying nature like, if you have looked at it first! There are few things that are different from the original (it's short at once), but it's all worse! The actors play the part here, not just the bill! Are you not a believer and who can work on G. G. Robinsons from nature? If you want, just look after you see nature and you will be very brave, if you look through! It's almost a cleansing!
