Good pain! While I still maintain Manos: Hands of fate is the worst piece of mental suffering available, Hobgoblins came sharply close. This ... thing ... insults the audience when every opportunity. At least a movie like Space Mutiny and the Future War can be interesting in the line3k, this was difficult to go through. I was taking a seat on the bed with pain. This has made me ashamed-alone! Even if you are a fan of MST3K and you have made it your goal to see every single attempt, think twice about seeing this. <br /> <br /> It's bad.
