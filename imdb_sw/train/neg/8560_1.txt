What time we live when someone like this Joe Swan-whatever hell is considered to be a good film manufacturer ... or even a film manufacturer even! Where are the new products of intelligent and talented movie developers ??? We need them bad, and hell and masturbation! <br /> <br /> This movie is not worth anything, just like the characters in the movie don't know anything. It is this terrible, called Gen Y, which is full of stimulating, some of which declare themselves films and out of trouble learning anything about the trick before the shot. Well, Orson Welles was a film manufacturer. John Huston was a film manufacturer. Fellini was a film manufacturer. Dreyer was a film manufacturer, etc.. Recent films like these show how young folks, so-called "filmmakers" can be when they go out without a script, no direction, no thought, no "legal" camera (everything so much DV), no edit tricks , nothing, means "insurrection" or "higher" film making. Nope, called ignorance and sluggish or pure masturbation of movies (and there really is in-your-face "jack-off shot," so be prepared). See original films of the original "indie" films: Linklatter, Morris, Allen, Lynch, Hartley, Jarmusch, Jost, Lee, or Herzog ... no one has done such a thing as stimulating and useless like this, but Swan-nothing in hell, still goes to SXSW every year and spells like a certain type of gutsy, a new talent. It will decorate! I can't imagine anyone who likes this, and everything else known as a film manufacturer (all of which has been seen by me) is very bad (new things made to appeal to the most common audience, one of the sitcom calls). Be clear, unless you are a friend or a partner of the characters ... for a second thought, if you are a family member or friend you would like to be embarrassed to see a family member or friend in that situation. This is not art. This is the ultimate opposite.
