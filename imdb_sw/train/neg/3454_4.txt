Cut tries to resemble many slasher after screaming they tried to be, spoof of a kind of fear that tried to be clever by reflecting on other popular movies of fear. Now, I don't know 'shouting,' if I think 'shouting' is a very good movie of fear that works well to combine fear and comedy. Cut failed in many levels. It has its time but generally does not work out, even if the movie "very good", less than one average. <br /> <br /> The first five minutes or so are the same as keeping a good story, away from the fact that Kylie Minogue can't really do it, and surprisingly gets her tongue out, going to figure. Go ahead when a group of film students want to finish his film, which seems to be a curse. And, as you probably predicted, direct staff and employees are taken slowly and a masked mad. The most unfamiliar plan, the worst acting and the prediction is a few of the following features. There is a lot of reflection in the film, everything from 'Kichea' to 'Saw the Chain Saw of Texas.' This is not smart either, it feels like the director wanted to feel smart and cool to mention other popular horror flicks. With a slasher there is a little bit with no dirt, which is a serious worst when it comes to a matter that doesn't have much to go for it. Actually, I should support this film because I am Australian and we don't like the time of fear (we still have our gems, however) but Ward is definitely not one of them. However, it kept me for 90 minutes or so, so it's a good thing at least. I can't recommend this to anyone except hardcore fans, who can know what this film is trying to do, but if you are looking for a good film, stay away. 2/5
