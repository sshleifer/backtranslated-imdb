Before I saw this film, I anticipated a fake game against the ideas from the book; instead, it is a book, interrupted by major events showing "different diseases". That doesn't hurt me, but it hindered my fun of the film. One story or even two or three long stories and text from a book inserted through the film would be an option, in my opinion. If you make a film on psychology, you should find interesting text (and more suitable) than this. The film draws a time of a little bit more than a 19th-century video encyclopedia of sexual psychology and it will not be quite if it was not of a sexual nature (because "sex = attractive" for most of us, even I). Luckily, there are several stories and actual development of behavior that attracts us. But, disappointing, Krafft-Ebing's sex theory went free, for the most part. I was hoping to use a story to show how immortality in his psychological outlook is still being done by many to this day. So, at the end, what do you have? A comprehensive book of fetishes and a few dimensions, with fascinating stories showing the trials and suffering of a few "sexually active" before they are healed. For many films, the film goes to the speed of crawling (and mood) of his. And, like a low-budget film, movies and acting are not over. Although I * enjoyed music, clothing and interior design. I heard this subject of a film that had been the same as my copper, and I still feel it is a film below the average. Entry 3/10; 4/10 if I were more generous. I can't imagine anyone who enjoys this if they are not ready to have a sexual desire.
