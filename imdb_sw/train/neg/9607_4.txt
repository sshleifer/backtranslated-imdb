Don't listen to the name of "Waswolf Woman". Europeans are well-known for putting emphasis on sex and dirt on real events in their scary films, but this here is just a little bit. "Waswolf Woman" seems to have a sex scene that is characterized by a head of madness and brutally killing her boyfriend. Enjoy the first few moments, but one hundred minutes this becomes very fast. He does not even havewolf, but the chichi of schizo whose grandfather had been executed for lycanthropy. The film can not even determine its tone, and the first ten minutes (flashback) have an unusual odd fear (I thought I was in the classic garbage after these) to research rather poor women's behavior to frequent abuse and torture of revenge. At the end, the director insists this depends on the true story. Well, it's okay. <br /> <br /> Be fair, there are few aspects of production entertainment. Iswolf's girl's head is a viewer and there are few effects on the effects and events of nude. However, these love very quickly. Also, dub discussions are very good in the camping style, particularly the many emerging doctors (are on the job). Unfortunately, the film becomes irritating quickly. There is no real plot or anything else. It's a shame, because reading the notes I heard the film has real potential. "Waswolf Woman" is too far, it goes slowly, and very little, even with the type of exploitation. (4/10)
