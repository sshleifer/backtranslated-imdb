This is one of the 70 most interesting movies out there, and it is more important to run ten years of Bigfoot. It is also known for the slightest touch of the movie, especially when half of the light, the first half is taken by the DRAWING of all items (like another user said, one of the songs dedicated to the character, Travis Crabtree, who climbs the string in time, then ... leaves, never seen again). Although it is a dated pain now, it is still a horrible movie that shows scary children, and anyone who enjoys any of Bigfoot or a culture of hillbilly 70 should get away from this. My favorite part: The boy gets scared that jumps the first head through the door (!?) And the author explains that he went to consciousness from "shock." Yes, I would say to break the door and his head is more likely to go to consciousness, but nothing. <br /> <br /> star 4/10, or 7/10 if you like bad America.
