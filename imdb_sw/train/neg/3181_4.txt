This film was not made by who fans. The best time that fans will expect at half an hour at Tommy medley are just lost or locked up: In Christmas, they did not show a blow to Daltry after the line "Tommy does not know what day it ...", Expressed almost no * city * Townsend guitar on the pinball wizard, there were many shots during the best time to go to the mirror, and the worst, in the second half of us we will not take (listen to You), they took us around every shot of Gita to burn Pete. The great chunks of the film are beaten from behind the band. It is a very exciting film to watch, and does not provide products. I don't know if the director Murry Lerner is not just a fan of who, or worse, for him at least, if he * is a fan of who and these are * eight * cameras can offer him. With his credit, there are rare numbers before Tommy, with some faves, which are well shot, and sometimes editing is brilliant. This may be enough to make other viewers happy, as long as you expect Tommy. The voice sound was common in the infection I saw from DirecTV; can be different on video or DVD.
