Shecky, is a legend of god, do not make a mistake. Until recently I worked for the retail chain of HiFi and UK, to run their testing department. We would go through a new star, they would be expected to learn how to find a detritus range that returns as non-working one way or another from stores. Now for tortu ^^^^^ ^ ^ ^ ^ test these new servants, we will give you a copy of Going Overboard. We had hundreds of copies of this film because everyone who bought a special model of DVD player Goodmans who had this film as a free gift, got round to send their DVD player back, they never sent back Shecky. Our new staff will have to use only to go to the exchange to measure these machines by mistake until they get a disc or two of them to try them. Now, why is this film so bad, where do I start? Adam Sandler, who can be so, is very funny, as in Happy Gilmore, or the Wedding Musician, he must have one-day hell. Some of the workers said, and what is Billy Zane? His name produces in some of the worst movies all the time, and he is a good actor. Crazy. The quality of production is quite zero. I would have been willing to give this zero if I could, because they could not even call his full name 'Moskowitz's invisible' release. However it's worth checking so you can see how far Sandler has come, and how she can go down.
