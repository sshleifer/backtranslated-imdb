This was a fictional story with a fantastic story! Willy Nelson was as hard as his strokes. The only movie was seen as a very long announcement for red lips lips that Jessica Simpson wearing - especially if there was very close on her face. Cluster was not exciting and I said - soooooooo predictable. Any money spent on making this film was a waste of shame. Any tips on other Marilyn Monroe movies did not add to the glory of Blonde at all. It was also impossible - Jessica Simpson was able to enter the position of secretary general in a drop of hats - that was laughable !!!
