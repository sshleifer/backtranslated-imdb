After 30 seconds, you are already aware that there was no real budget for ending this cheap. The story is taken from the big cinema as "The Chainsaw of Texas" and "Hills and Eyes". I like these types of movies, even if they look similar (Turning Bad, Wood Forest, Carver). But "Side Sho" is hard to watch: the participants are very bad, the conversation is fun and music is stupid and not completely lost. You don't really care what happens to the characters. Those so-called bad are also not interesting at all and instead of variable. Why about blood and gore? Well there are some, although it's cheaper and the action is being done very badly. 2 points, only for gore and blood but you understand that this is not appropriate to appear, even for the hounds of the year.
