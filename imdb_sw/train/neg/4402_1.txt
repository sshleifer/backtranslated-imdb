I usually like Lesbian movies even when it's not very good. I am interested, I think! <br /> <br /> But this is just holes. Yes, the environment and buildings are good, and there is a short but beautiful combination, but otherwise this movie is a perfect waste of time. Annamarie switches between moving and getting on / throwing stones or taking any medicine or sucking it well, and Ella certainly places this disgusting character through the entire movie. At any time we have been given any insight into why this is so, or even why Annamarie is broken and removed. If there is at least a certain type of closure in (possibly romantic?)! The relationship between two, there may be some kind of satisfaction. But though He is telling you one time he asks Ella "why do you love me?" Ella does not accept this. It has never been clear if this is something other than Lesbian's on a road-boring road with a direct woman. Even the partnership between two women and the local people they encounter on a journey, which can be alive and skilled, is rather flat, stimulating and incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> There is one good joke in the film, although I'm sure it was not optional. Women travel on a two-seat Ford seat and a medium-sized stem. However, when they bury the camp, they have a big tent, a gem, a bed, and even a table, a chair, and a printing machine! On top of that, when they go to the ferry, we see the freight wheels, maybe they, maybe also in the trunk of a small Ford! And through the entire film, we can't see a single gas station, or anywhere that would seem to have any chance to buy gasoline. Especially they travel to the eternal miles of desert desert. So where is the oil? There may be many lesbians out there, good or bad, but there is much that is better than this, and very few that are worse. Leave this in the rack.
