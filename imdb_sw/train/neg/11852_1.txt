This film was supposed to be shown to a 'ladie' student who was ready and ready to sit once and for all. However, I didn't care about her job of sitting down, because I didn't care about her behavior. I don't understand what all the beautiful women saw in it. He had no class at all, or charisma. He should have at least had a way on himself that made the women weak in knees instead of his saxophone play, but for free. Because he is a musician doesn't make him sexy. Not to mention, the things he did to get the attention of the married woman loved for five minutes to know he was quite concerned with anxiety. What? What does this person have - ever? If he was standing, and stopped making and saying stupid things he would be more attractive as a character, but alas, his behavior was bland and boring. Gina Gershon's character was not necessary for Britain. She would be a very attractive girl with her usual voice chat than making a little British impression that sometimes would lose out on the film. Only two characters I cared for were fish and bottles. Now those two had chemistry! College selection for all? STAT! Cave holes, lack of character development, bad act, unwanted act, while photography ... What is the mess of the movie.
