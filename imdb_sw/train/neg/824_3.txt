Gene Hackman finds himself out of jail with an unnamed government organization that wants to kill him. It is obvious that hackman has skills skills for work. No one tells him anything, he is given if the audience is given bits and pieces of information. That should be worried, rather sad and interesting. Hackman passes with a message, but getaway is messed up with a guy on this wonderful command everyone who has died to cover it. So everyone who is beaten to death is ultimately helpful. One of the other observers said that the film was twice as long, almost three hours and it was completely reduced. Perhaps something was lost in the translation, but I tend to think it was a sympathetic act for the audience. The talented talented talent that was with people like Richard Widmark, Candice Bergen, Mickey Rooney, Eli Wallach, and Edward Albert was completely destroyed here. We do not know just what the federal organization did all this, FBI, CIA, DEA or even IRS.
