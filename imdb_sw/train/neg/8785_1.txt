I often say about the filth of the most horrible films on the market, and sadly Noise White had reduced my belief that the film industry still has the ability to do so. I was surprised to find myself growing up as much as the plot was wearing and the static headache had increased. I found Noise White to be the most restrictive of our efforts to stop the unbelief. Even after experiencing a serious problem with Michael Keaton, I had no relationship with his loss. Until the credit I had been waiting for for something - anything - of a substance to connect to the story of the characters, but that forgiveness has never been. Indeed, there was a time to give up the heart, but just because loud sounds tend to do it with a dozing viewer. The time of the act was disabled, Michael Keaton may have a role to play now. Perhaps the only quality of the redemption that the White Voice should provide is a wonderful archietecture in the two Keaton homes. In general, the White Voice leaves one with the idea of ​​the pain of losing that those who die are being beaten in the world of three shadows, trying to deceive life into following the dead to their own graves.
