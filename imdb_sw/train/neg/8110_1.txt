I think Phillip Kaufman read the version of the Kundera novels and then began to make this film. Okay, certainly won't have a natural punch. The Kundera novel is great because of the fiction of the myth of the story, its ability to enter and out of the story it builds. This movie doesn't even try! One sequence of Tereza's dream, so important to the context of this book, is renewed and does not know any meaning. Also, with this maybe a little, Daniel Day-Lewis looks a lot like Ben Stiller in this (I know it's not a valid complaint, but hey). A perfect example of Hollywood pictures of other publications is good.
