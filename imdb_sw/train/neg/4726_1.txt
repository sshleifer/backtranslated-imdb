However, other films about self-abuse, pride, non-hate, the attractiveness of personal damage we need to care for. Do not make a mistake I am very clear for all types of movie movies with a characteristic of behavioral damage. What I refuse about this is that there is very little history for this person. Why does this person hate himself and the world? It had a script to deal with this more they could manage mercy for it. If he comes out as an unkind attitude, not sad, he just hates. After taking a lot of pain to make this person mad and anti-social as possible and make his fate as black as possible the author then has the courage to end up happy .... \ t which I have seen but it is there to put a good battle! Man! Don't waste your time.
