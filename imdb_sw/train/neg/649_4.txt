Well this film was made for one reason and only one reason to make money! Manufacturers were not worried about killing the most unusual movie. I realized that this film could absorb as soon as it would pg-13 how many pg-13 slasher films were good? That's like asking how many women have been on the moon? The answer is NO! The Sunday of 1980 was a traditional hub but certainly deserved to be recognized as a film that stays true for its genre and deosnt trying to be anything more than that. <br /> <br /> My problem with the night of Prom 2008 is a way that manages the killer and I have three major problems with him ..... /> <br /> 1) The way to run, he was bound in a mental institution and he ran through vent weather! WHAT HELL? why would they have air air in the patient's room? What? Want to be at ease during his stay or something? 2) His goals are very sure that the killer needs all the victims of family and dead friends so that he can have his own soul, he says he loves him but the second minute tries to kill him, and wants to kill him, love him or just kiss him? 3) The killer is very good, how did he build all his skills? He was a teacher, so in this one place where he kills a boy of victims when he basically on his sleep and he does not know, all is silly 2 star out of 10 terrible, silly, stupid quiz in a terrible movie
