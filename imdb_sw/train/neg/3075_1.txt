Oh .. this is clear up with some of the worst movies, but I definitely seem to be worse. Imagine Gremlins rated R. Good however, I met Rick Sloane at a sci-fi meeting, surprisingly, he was teaching! It was one of the low budget meetings, where everything is going, everyone has been brought into something (if you want to see the pot, you should have to see what some friends and I have been given). he looked like a very good boy, he was very cool on my questions and comments on Hobgoblins, and even told me not to look at, and said he liked MST3K version! For all, Rick Sloane knew what he had done. And I think it was as bad as Mars Attacks. So I think I stand for this film and open it 5, and despise all my MSTies. Sorry boys.
