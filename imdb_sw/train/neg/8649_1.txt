This movie fails for each level. I have an idea, let us take everyone involved in this film and take them to the hot center in the east. Maybe we are lucky they will be shot and killed and we won't have time to lose them again. Did I say that I have never been bitter about a bunch of movies to decorate throughout my life? My God, I can't imagine anything that I have ever seen that was wrong. I would like to look at Ishtar 25 times more than staying for 10 minutes of excitement for the film. If I have come to meet anyone involved in this film, I will clap their faces and then beat them meaningless. That's my two cents.
