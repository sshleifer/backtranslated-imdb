Absolutely one of the worst movies I have seen for a long time! It starts off bad and only decreases. Katherine Heigl is a horrible shock in the role of Lolita and Leo Grillo is struggling with the effectiveness of what is essentially a cut-off character. A delegation organized by any interest is Tom Sizemore, who acts as a village man and goes further on his role. The script is bad, it makes a bad job and has a big hole holes enough to run then two-decker through! It is also the most sex movie that I have ever seen! Katherine Heigl's behavior is not good at all. He looks like a bad, unfortunate pastor who loves the poor, innocent man to deceive his wife. It means every movie that he is under, and the message associated with the plot of the plot only asks faith! In the end, he can't even free himself by shooting someone who is obviously (ha!) He feels angry and guilty, but the script allows him to commit suicide, and thus free himself from the eyes of men anywhere. Horror. Don't waste your time.
