T. Rama Rao made a very good film in the 1980s, but seems to be a film manufacturer who cannot tolerate changes in times, styles and fashions. He has experienced this old fashion making film. It's not bad, it's not good. Anil Kapoor in general performs its two functions of the father and son, but often the fraudulent script makes him look funny and pathetic. Rekha is good, but then - she is always good, and here she is nothing more than that. He does the best of what he is given, but he always does. In conclusion, there is nothing good. Raveena is the same, which means common, not bad, not good, no. <br /> <br /> This movie is melodramatic, often stupid. Maybe it's a delayed film? Well, however it will still be less standard. The script is awesome, the film is approaching, and the story goes anywhere. It feels like a film made at the beginning of the 1990s, but the script makes it even more visible, the style is similar to the 1950s.
