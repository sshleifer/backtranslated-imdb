"Drawing 9" is a kind of one movie or likes or hates; fortunately or not, I have left it with a strong sense of time lost and that the bonds of "whales are evil" propaganda. Interestingly, the film would be interesting, especially its first half, until it is unknown that every action shown is used as a matter of various whale hunting issues. Until then, it may be a little exciting to look at the daily work of Japanese workers, but later it becomes clear that anything that appears on the screen is propaganda, and no one frame is an exception. I use the word “propaganda” because the movie uses basically a moral playback, where “good” and “bad” were not given during the action but are placed in the stone. Perhaps I am the only one, but I find that kind of anonymous and unknown art, even when it's all about good (no fear here) efforts to protect the environment. In my opinion it is a cardinal sin when the film material is identified without justice, just for stretching. In my opinion, "Drawing Drawings 9" would have been easy to reach 75 minutes, but has a torturous height of 2 and 1/4 hours. Yes, there were interesting shots, but it was not enough for these departure to 15 minutes of anything without notice. The film does not have a normal status, and no change of characters, but not a document, but a kind of fancy installation. That is an unusual form of film, but it can still be viewed as an art even when the concept is simple and non-existent here. OTOH I also believe that the director should have some trust and did not pretend that it could be given for less than 135 minutes. And yes, the music marks are similar to the whale's sounds. It's amazing. <br /> <br /> 2/10.
