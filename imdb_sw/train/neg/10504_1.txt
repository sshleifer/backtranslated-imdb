I could not look over 14 minutes. It is a great mix of bad acting and very bad conversion. Shots used used are disgusting, they break 180 degrees angle at all. My head hurts to check the load of "you know". The dirt on the "secret machine" window makes you see light from the lights in the windows ... it gets angry. What else ... it's so bad written all the time it's just doing you want to scream to the woman who is leading there. I just mentioned a short film, but I'm sure I would like to be better than leading a feature film ... The unknown story, the only long-time French kissing tell them that it would be very good. So it's very good, try to avoid these worst movies at all costs, save you 5 or so for renting, and that at 1:30 of your life you won't be able to return ...
