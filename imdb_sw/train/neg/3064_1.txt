"The destruction of the original" was a great flick. The purpose of the trick, the characters who seemed real and voluntary. Preach, plainly; has lost the point of what nature was normal. The black charger was cool, but even that could not save this flick. Why stick to Challenger white? I didn't think it was the best choice in '71. Other films were not voluntary. As when Vigo stood on the rock overlooking the canyon after his "Dream Quest". Her Indian was standing next to her. Vigo was wearing only his white publications. Sorry - it just looks for a lie - he examines the vista in its Fruit Looms. Another part was at the end - after the fall of a few burst - the announcer said that the effect was closed at 180 mph. Then he says that the soldiers said that his remains were not found because he had set the fire on, but some people believe he was locked out and hidden by friends in the crowd. Then it shows she leaves out of the car at 180 mph! First of all, you can not open the car door at 180 mph. Second, the car is not suitable to travel by direct line to 100 yds. And no one can put it. It would be quickly once about 30 times. Three, blowing the floor at 180 mph, you would cross into different pieces of squishy. No matter, we see him at the end standing with his daughter. All in all, a movie that can despise anyone's intelligence.
