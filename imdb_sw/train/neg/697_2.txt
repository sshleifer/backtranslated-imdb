Two things are good about this film is two unknown celebrities. First, Daphne Zuniga, in his first appearance in the film, youth and anxiety, and apparently which includes his body today, steals at the very beginning, which is all he enters, and that's it. He is just plain starting out because he does improve with his next projects. Second, the scores and well-known Christopher (Chris) Young is what keeps this stinker getting one star ... yeah, I know one more star is not much, but in this case the film, it's a lot. <br /> <br /> Others are just a stupid stupid stupidity of college students who are trying to clean up a dor that is due to cuts, paid directly by an unexpected killer, blah, blah, blah ... this goes. See the first eighteenth minute and Daphne Zuniga, then turn.
