I am a great fan of the film. I love all kinds of movies. This is certainly the worst movie that I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I find it follows the book closely, which brings the point that not everything should be a movie. Especially since the fact of experience in the book has been considered to be more questionable than once. <br /> <br /> These characters have no quirky, they are mentally ill. Things that are happening are not interesting, disturbing; especially considering should be true. <br /> <br /> This movie had a sense of Royal Tenenbaums, another movie I hated, just Running With Scissors was even more active and less funny. I can't get these hours again. I wanted to wash my brain after looking.
