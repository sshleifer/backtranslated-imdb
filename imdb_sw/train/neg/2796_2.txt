For the most part, On Demand offers other awesome horror movies, and only provides other movie screens everyone has seen, and already has comments. It was this, or Invinicible (I love the Mark Wahlberg movies), which I have not seen, and I was in a movie view, which is rarely available because I have already been watching all the movies I have a million times, and that's many movies, I don't have much interest in new movies, and the boy, this film has been interesting. I can't put in any trophy, I will just tell you that only a few of the very few actors in this film, it's half the best way. I think a great, dead girl who kills everyone, is very interesting, but she convinces; I would take him to a psychological bitch every day, so he fits his well roll, though it is lame. Treatment is not good, only a few kill, or I can say "pain" is the same, but you do not see too much and no parts of the body in the movie to make injuries look more than convincing. Near the end of the film I was asking my partner to open it, and to become a member of the band, the 'recording' parts were not very attractive either, although what happened would really happen when going to record. I have done, if you want to look at this, suit yourself.
