Wonderful ... I love all film staff and films of dark humor; but he didn't like this even! It's bad, horrible and certainly never worth. Anger cannot make a whole plot of film, embarrassment either. And it was true. Long-term full-time fills the movie; could be removed. It should be in short shorter format, certainly. Maybe I expected too much from the staff - like to save the movie lol -. It is also filled with more than the clich√©s of the characters and the state ... I do not give you why people liked ... "Poetry", "hope"; nope 'mam, did not see anything like that! ^^ All in all, it's empty and unusual, sad and hopeless. Oh darn this one ........
