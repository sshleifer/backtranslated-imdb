A good film about a woman who is a beautiful twin sister's sister at home. Then he returns home to get all the same and that he will have to know what happened to his sister and why. <br /> <br /> This is a kind of thing that works around but not 't totally. I can't put my finger on why it didn't work but it was so nice that I kind of wanted it was the best, or at least had got the little things right - like having girls who play twins in flashbacks be closer to size. I think maybe that is wrong and there are many small things that are wrong.
