I wanted to love this film more than I did. That is because I like foreign wacky matches - especially wonderful that get you completely in amazement. However, although this often took me to surprise, this was almost never a good surprise. It reminds me of South Park that almost every type of community was broken until only those left by broach were very sick to be funny. For example, after examining adultery, drug abuse (almost all kinds - from pot, heroin, speed glue photography), adultery, S & M, suicide, murder, etc., the movie reached hilarious topics ?) pedophilia. Mother encouraged one of her children (who was looking at the age of 12) to sleep with men in the neighborhood. In fact, one time in the movie gives this boy a dentist instead of payment for dental work! Funny? You should have a child. This movie goes very far and enters into the "black hole of comedy". What? Should they bother about the next tumor, cancer or rectal?
