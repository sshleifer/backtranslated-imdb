I thought this movie was not quite morally. I mean, how would you feel if your partner left your wedding day with your cousin ??? I would have a heart of heart! It is known as comedy but I did not find it quite funny. I thought it was easy to find cheap cakes and take them. I love the movies of Julie Stiles, but this is discrimination. Jason Lee star in another show of shame, which sometimes proves that class and good values ​​are not important in today's society. It had a complete lack of taste and I despise movies like this. I understand that people are advocating this film and it is morally because it is 'just a movie', but I still have my score that this bad behavior should not be allowed on the screen. I am not trying to say that if you enjoy this film, you are a bad person, because everyone has the right to their own views, and the parts of this movie are excited, just telling them that in real life, people who act as actors in this film were acting shamefully.
