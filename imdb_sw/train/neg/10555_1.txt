First and foremost: I love good Splattermovies and don't be afraid to contact with art, but this flick of the budget is not one! The quality of the image has been greatly damaged, sad voice which I ever (!!!!) heard, and for FX ... well-low quality makes some of them not so bad as they could in the real movie (what this junk here is not) . No fancy, storyline-thin thinline, acting first and rare talk - I think I calculated about 10 sentences in the entire movie, always consistently 20 times ... similar to a lot of films (can be a sign for what kind of The viewer this was done !!!) The story seems to be a little boy had to look at his father and kill his mother, he got psychological damage and if an adult is going to visit, doing a show of self-adoration. So far, it is very good ... But for these art-artists-idiot artists, this plot is a line of setting the most alarming events of a series that has no message or no meaning (new intestines to be cast, naked, bound The woman in the pit of the earth ... why and why is the only time you see a woman with a forest in the "movie" of blood blood? Horror? Yes !! Is he sick? Yes !! It is important? No! Art? NO !!!!! Everyone who misses this cheap show for art should be as soon as possible to visit his psychiatrist or should look at Pink Floyd's "wallpaper" to see how similar topics can be made through art ... last (!!!!!!!!), Andrew Cobb ... !!!! And all that leads-out there, remember: Not everything looks cheap and makes it clear that it is absolutely not "Art" directly ...
