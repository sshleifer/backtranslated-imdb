Paying the charge is a game played in this game and a revenge plan is carried out with a wonderful line of stories that sets the stage for fireworks to come later. Why would a man cooperate with the wife of the master of the master's hero in the house of the gangster himself and the perplexed characters around? Why would the unhappy woman insist on the distrust of the whole stranger and expect him to take her and remove her husband and trouble after living happily after her new love? Certainly the hero, here at Kevin Costner, must expect answers from the husband's husband who gives the movie an excuse to indulge in a useless and violent year. Anthony Quinn, a good actor that he was, certainly deserved the best, and Madeleine Stowe is a horrible example that is so hurtful as he incites him to attract his superior. Stowe is the same but his Spanish drive does not work. The coming of a few players are good, especially Miguel Ferrer and John Leguizamo and Sally Kirkland are attracted as a rock star.
