MONSTER - He was good; I loved the special effects that have created this monster which looks like a new version of "Creative From Lagoon Black." The exhibition and the animal around the earth and beat people were suitable from good to stop the jaw. ANSWERS TO ANSWERS: Many stories take place in the heritage area as doctors (under government orders) say that SARS disease comes from there. In short, we find a known story of the government. You know, I expect these Liberal balance ideas and Hollywood films continue to paint our government as a bribe, but it looks like the Koreans are photographing, and it is very stimulating. Here, it takes off with the excitement of this "monster". It only attracts the film. The main family shown on the film should look at the distance when the little girl in her family, being dead, was struck by a creature. EXAMPLE: EXAMPLE: Example "don't waste water" message because this is what might happen - monster mutated awesome. This was the anti-nuclear anti-nuclear message from the 1950s when radiation caused small sores, spiders, fish or anything in these schlocky sci-fi films. Now "its environmental issues" which are intended. This is a particular scandal. I usually laugh with slapstick but this was not funny. I don't know if the Korean feeling of humor is that sad, or the film tries to be ultra-corny deliberately and take off the old "Godzilla" films. Let's hope to be the last one. TRANSFER - Video transfer was good. This was a bright picture and a loud voice of many people back. I watched this in Korean with English headlines. That may be an offense if the Korean Voice of the sounding sound became angry after half an hour. It is a promise but it was a huge cuts and even interesting in many places, which is not enough for a modern monster film. Two hours was WAY too long for this story. How this film attracted record groups in Korea I do not know. It should not have many ways to enjoy and support.
