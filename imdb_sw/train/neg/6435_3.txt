I find it hard to believe that anyone would put this film in the same situation with an exception. Where the rin was a cunning and exciting, Stigmata was odd, normal, and also formulaic way. This is one of the most beautiful movies I have seen on time, but the picture doesn't make up for an increase in definitions that make it impossible to fail. <br /> <br /> My intention in this film was shown when compared to The Exorcist, and my visit to the official site added interest. The site had many stories of "real" stigma in history. However, the location of the scene, the movie is very much concerned with its efforts to "trust" that becomes facing the first time, then it is very difficult to look towards the end. I began to doubt when the priest was accused of examining the miracles that could walk in the room of beauty where we - we become the heroine shedding hair and, in fact, eliminates the priests. The plot: A woman who has no faith in God begins to receive the injuries of Christ (Stigmata) and is distressed by the distraction. The priest is sent directly from the Vatican to investigate the case. What? Frankie with Satan, or the instrument of Jesus Christ? The only miracle in this film is that it finally ends.
