After watching Awake, I led the conclusion: the director and photo writer Joby Harold made in the morning with the intention of laughing for the player, for the fact is that the film is full of ignorance elements. For example, the hospital uniform the spirit of the main character uses ... Is the doctor's spirit removed it from the apartment? In contrast to Lena Olin's great, all actors bring bad displays. Hayden Christensen has zero words and that applies to Jessica Alba. Wonderful Terrence Howard has lost a lot of responsibility. It is so ridiculous and full of amazing things that it is impossible to consider for detail.My recommendations are: skip this movie crappy.
