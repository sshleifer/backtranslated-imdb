Mummy says vignettes about men, women, and sex between them. Huh? At first, mummy randomly asks the viewer, "Think of having sex with this girl. Think about having sex with this young man" 37 times, while photographing half of the youth of honey. Later, said the boys pelt mod mod girls and ... vegetarians? If you ignore (or quickly) through the flight of the mummy, short is not appropriate for them. I have seen a few of them rather interesting. My personal love is one where a confused person tries to persuade a girl to have sex with her when her pet lizard sits in bed. This is one, well, a wonderful movie.
