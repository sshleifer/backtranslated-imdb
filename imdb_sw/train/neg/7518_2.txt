Scary movies can be fun with a small budget, a bad acting, and a bit of panache. I think the film is not available, because, when one area is too late after another, people make unhealthy wounds of the air. If not very interesting, it can be interesting. A horror movie could go for a long time with the concept of exhaustion as "college children in haunted house," the same way bad movies were very happy with the same level of the same level. The end of Hallow, unfortunately, does not go long. True, it doesn't go anywhere. It uses the best part of an hour to start useless and unknown characters and what looks like a normal artistic game. I have nothing against the development of behavior, even in a horrible movie, but these are a single-dimensional (alpha-male, milquetoast), that is the loss of who are more likely to be sexually active.) Using forty- with blood, the droning minute with them was more frightening than when the blood began. Well, it means to shed blood however. When college students turn into anything they dressed as for their haunted home (a man with a vampire, dressed in O.R. scrubs and some white pancake) seem like they did in their home haunted house clothing; The Hate of the Dead Living, using such a theme, is the main task in comparison. There is no truth to talk about, nor is there any real threat. I thought about this from every way. If it was supposed to be a strong, exciting thought of fear (which would explain why things are moving slowly), pathetic sex events and cheap organisms could approve. If it was supposed to be a true blood & guts horror movie (which could describe schlock) ... where blood and guts? And anticlimax is one of the inappropriate breaks of the movie I ever saw. It is a type of film which, although it does not have the author through the film, is stored with sound sounds because all non-meaningful conversations were not enough. <br /> <br /> This was complicated ... from outside it, I wonder if I just sit through a frightening Christian film. Maybe "I know hell is there" of the opening did not mean that way, but there are some tips (or misdirection - I don't know what). For all the dirt in the film, the line as "gosh-darnit" comes from a little ridiculous, and so many of the cross worship, the fear of God, and the fear of the devil, especially after the sex & T sexual intercourse (single sex) one, one girl). If it is a Christian company (the Highland Myst logo even the same as the cross), then this film is very tolerant to a non-existent camp. A powerful person cannot be an advertiser for a bad film. <br /> <br />
