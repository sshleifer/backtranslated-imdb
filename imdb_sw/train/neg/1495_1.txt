I have been looking at horror movies since I was 5 years old, and the start of Kids Players. At that time, I have seen great and bad movies, but this is without question, the movie of DUMBEST I saw! The actors did everything they could and the material. The plan was only emotional. More, it was all to run. I can stomach a lot of blood, but that was just ridiculous! In one of the incidents, the disease is stricken at the end of the back and burned with its intestines! Fool! Another problem with this movie is that its boring it and maybe a smaller movie ever made. The end is just dumb. But again, it goes with all the rest! At the end, when the girl goes away from the pastor, she receives help from an older woman. An old woman makes tea, but when she turns out to talk to a girl, the girl attacks her! He turned to a cannibal! Movie hit.
