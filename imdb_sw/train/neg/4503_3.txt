I was attracted to Rob Marshall for Chicago, but Geisha's Memoirs become a failure again to fight western and Asian art. In general, the area is good, but after insisting on the recommendations of the proposed exceptions and other foreigners may find themselves. The great cherry blossoms was, in fact, overturned. It is probably the cultural diversity of view here: the ultimate beauty is not a kind of pride, as a really good geisha will not be a western sauce in the movie. Some ideas have misunderstood serious errors. Like Taiwan, I have no doubt that the actress is good. The actor / actor can play any role when he can look like it. Gong Li is good, but the emotional power that demonstrated in this film is not translated into Japanese style. All I saw was a beautiful and jealous Chinese girl. Michlle Yeoh, one of my favourtie actors, didn't even see as Japan. Some of the comments have highlighted the female characteristics of Japanese women, which I cannot accept more. These are very beautiful I think even all contemporary Japanese artists deserve roles in Geisha, not to place two Chinese and Malaysia actors who grew up in different cultures and probably didn't know the Japanese culture very much. Geisha is a good shot to stimulate the curiosity of the US audience. But it will be insulting for the film itself and the effectiveness of the art if the movie defeats Oscar for the best dress, the best director or the best image.
