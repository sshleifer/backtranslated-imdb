I finished watching Pie of America: House of Beta and I say, this was a bunch of trash. The first US American pie was a hilari, the last 3 was a sandwich and should not be called US Pie. As you emerged from the title of the film, Beta House, it's about friendship, freshmen, girls and, the original part of all, falling in love. Of course, a boy with his way and chicks is Stifler, who, along with her husband, tries to complete the other impossible tasks. It was true and fake. It is quite realistic and the plot is very weak. The two sides of the university's battle to see who gets the same thing (something like that) Counting: The strict script + compatible script + misuse of the American franchise Pie = the time lost This movie cannot be connected. I give them two out of ten, though many of them shot sucked there were dirt and girls girls, like 2 funny scenes :)
