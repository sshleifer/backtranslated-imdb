I was at this film festival in Toronto in 1997. After the investigation, when the author / director and other members of the delegation were found to answer questions, no one could even feel trouble asking anyone. Typically the film is misinterpreted (why in the world was a random setting excluded from certain events?), He worked hard (David Arquette, for Dorothy Parker's description, did not run the emotional gamut from A to B. He climbs at A and brings it lunch) and not entirely mean. Participants are characterized by behavior without reason unless forcing a plot to move in some way. At the end, the film comes to an end and the uncertainty that is supposed to "make you think." Unfortunately, what makes him think is, "Well, there's 90 minutes of my life I have never been back."
