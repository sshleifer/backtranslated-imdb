Not bad but not a very big heist film. Kirk Douglas is recently released from a prison in prison who, after leaving the offer from Mob, decides to pull the work himself. He uses the practice of fans of circus Giuliano Gemma. Wonders continue. Douglas and Gemma recently found themselves followed by the mafia goon Romano Puppo with the inclusion of a love of a very real love with a Douglas patient (Florinda Bolkan). Director Michele Lupo keeps pace moving fast and there is at least one best and innovative car tracking series involving Puppo & Gemma. Although the Italian production, many pictures seem to have been done in Germany. Douglas is good, not just wipe in Giallo quickie. The amazing Bolkan offers a sharp performance. Music is for Ennio Morricone and the movie is for Tonino Delli Colli, who was able to work with everyone in Italy (from Wertmuller and Fellini to Pasolini and Leone).
