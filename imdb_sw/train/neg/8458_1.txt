I bought this film last weekend at the Movie Gallery. It was to buy 2 to get 2 free of charge and I needed one more to choose this. Bad error. The box reads if it is a very good movie. Well, it will start if it's this beautiful film. For 5 minutes, that's it. The movie is about a young woman, Laila, who is killed trying to save her beauty, Jack, from the cow. Laila's father, Cordobes, is a player in the city who is afraid. She thinks that Jack killed Laila because he was afraid of the cow, and he keeps looking for her. That was the first 5 minutes that is good. The following after this is just getting 100 times more. Anyone who wrote a script, in my opinion, had to have some kind of acid or something to do because there was nothing else that made any similar meaning. Jack is in the run and finds this DJ's travel radio called Maria who gives him a ride. I think Mary should be the character of the Virgin Mary. You know, Jesus' mother. But, who knows, I could not make his heads or tails. While driving ... we get to see bad people, magical visions, encounter spirits, magical obstacles, etc ... And all these things happen in a way that your brain hurts from trying to learn what's going on. Needless to say, I took again the movie and separated it for something else. It is horrible I tell you of, terrible. And, there is absolutely no fight with cows in this movie. Unless you count the first minute of the film. I hope I helped other people not waste their time on this film.
