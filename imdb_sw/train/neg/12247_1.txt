This film is very awesome. The terrible as it is losing 84 minutes of your life. Special effects are very scary. Acting was not convincing. Its about the crocodile that attacks the tourist view as they are publishing a document about "opening blood". The blood is when they move around the sharks around but they turn very badly when the foot crocodile 31 forbids holiday. The Pope does not appear real. Crocodile is even worse, and it gets even more pathetic when they are running a creature form, but the crocodile gets stuck with 2 women flash it. Deaths are fake and pirates are just filling time. <br /> <br /> Inappropriate, horror movie that is not worth seeing!
