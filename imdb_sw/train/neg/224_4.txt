The worst thing about Crush is not that it has done a very bad job, or that the plot is almost gone, and it's not bad even the camera function would be better. No, the worst part of this film is that it has a very short period of time that enables you to expect there is more to come. <br /> <br /> But at the end, it's very little, it's too late. If you are a fan of violin music and less tears of 40+ women who cry and embrace and talk about children and marriage - then in all ways, do not lose. <br /> <br /> I'm not so excited to see the things mentioned above in the movie, and as a result I had a very good time. A few brilliant jokes can not create for all others. <br /> <br /> Decision: 4/10. You are guilty of wasting my time. <br /> <br />
