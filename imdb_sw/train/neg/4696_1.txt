I know people and I have done some animation and graphic design and show is awesome! They are the richest ones who do not have any talents, and perhaps begged Nick to receive them! Alex has played for one year, playing 4 1/2! The movie is awesome and so is the show! This is the most comedy of the mix that even isint funny I've ever seen. It's very foolish to make me want barf !!! It's just so mad that Nickelodeon will accept something like this and so dumb! They are sooo stupid and weird! I hate them and show them and think once Nick knows how stupid it is that they want to remove it!
