I watched this one on a DVD for a dollar so I could easily enjoy it as this awesome film is opened. every time you think you can't get worse, it takes. Acting is awesome. The plot has no meaning. Head "Revenge Revenge" in the DVD version of the United States has nothing to do with the script. Characteristics of the action are clearly taken into their first take. There are many mistakes during the conversation that show that there is no intention to make another take for at least trying to make this movie bear. I can't remember that I found the worst movie and I often got bad - well, but I can't defeat the Wesley Snipes. No, who am I dancing, at the wrong time, Those who are not worthy are the best photos of Oscars compared to this piece.
