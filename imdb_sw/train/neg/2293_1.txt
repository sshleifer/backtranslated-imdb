If this series should be improved beyond Batman - The Animation Series, I, for one, I think it has failed so much. The characteristic of the character is mad ... (Catwoman, for example, seems to be bad ...) But what is offensive is that it has made Batman look like a kind of wimp who can not care for himself in battle, without the help of two, even three on the other . I mean, he is Batman, for God! I know comic books, I know that Nightwing and Batgirl are supposed to be the partners of Batman, instead of Robin, but still ... do Batman saying that he needs help from them ... What, he can't handle a few punches? In BTAS, could he cope with several opponents without any trouble ... He is old? Come ... <br /> <br /> And another thing: I don't really think that Batman will allow a child like Tim Drake to go to a recent battle, without years of hard training. One, unresponsive (and Batman is everything, but not guilty), and two, not what happened in the community, if we remain faithful to them. Batman - The Animation Series made history, and its animation, its stories and characters ... That was the story of Batman. The New Adventures series turned the story into another flick of Batman.
