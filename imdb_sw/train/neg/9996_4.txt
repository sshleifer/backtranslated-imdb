Although the production and direction of Jerry Jameson is a definite improvement, "the airport "77" is not much better than "1975 airport": the separation of business waste (this real time) was thrown with respect. Jack Lemmon is an experimental bird that is faced with the thieves of art and falling into the sea (all the publicity claimed that it was near the Bermuda Triangle, but no mention of the film itself). When the rescue ships come to bring the plane out of the water, we see all their cranes stopping (instead of blindness) into the sea and it is difficult to laugh (consider cranes to close the airplane, passenger and script of water). NBC used the air as a "cut-off director", and at least an hour of extra pictures - more than the publications - have emerged in the case with all the tricks of "Gilligan's Island" section. The most exciting time is the flight of aircraft, and some players are very happy: Lee Grant is an alcoholic, Brenda Vaccaro who had no courage, Joseph Cotten and Olivia de Havilland are at war age. Still, calmness is mixed with destructive military details that eventually breaks down the patience of man. ** from ****
