This movie gets the second star because I work in the city and I love to see it damaged. The effects were good - I heard it was more expensive than a Korean film made. that is more expensive and is still worse than it makes a lot of money loss. I rented it so I can't complain very much on what I paid, but it was a couple of hours that I can't come back. The holes of a lot of plot. stimulate to act every board. I don't recommend giving time to watch this movie, life is very short. if your friends want to watch this, run. I can't stress how this film was bad. Where is the second dragon that happened? why didn't you show earlier? What? had the fingers of the rocket on dinosaurs 500 years ago?
