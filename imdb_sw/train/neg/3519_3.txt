There are some Stallone movies that I like, but this film is not available for my low expectations. I've found this film hard to believe. For example, a group of terrorists who lose land in the desert is ready to live for at least two days. Also, in all this desert Stallone and the company continue to walk on bridges and levels that provide short-term cuts or plot equipment. Also, Treasury fighters do not seem to coordinate anything with local rescue people. Also, bad guys could not hit the barn on the barns and very high-looking weapons. I loved the woman of John Lithgow at the beginning, but the character is the perfect psychopath that she does not have. Finally I couldn't believe it. <br /> <br /> Not eligible for rental, even inappropriate to take during watch.
