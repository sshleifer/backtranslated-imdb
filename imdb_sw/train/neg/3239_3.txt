Ah, the series of "Guinea Pig" ... I am convinced that I am desperate for the whole series ("He has not died", "Mermaid in Manhole", and "Meat Flowers and" Blood "differently ... and even those who are not in any way ...), but the "Devil's attempt" is just a blow. it seems not particularly concerned with what is going on and screaming or clapping while under "hideous" (often "torture") suffering. "Meat and Blood Flowers" is a symbol of more and more violent "futile" material. fake, but the film is also facing the level of authenticity. if you are dying-hard, ikl for any other reason than to see what the talk is about, but I can only give this film a 3/10 generous and that's just for a needle-through-eye area ...
