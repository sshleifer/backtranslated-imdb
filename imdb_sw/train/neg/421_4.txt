My title above says it all. Let me make it clear. If you have seen the BBC's "Planet Earth", which I am sure most of you, then you can't make this film very much. And I have all the remains of the "Planet Earth" I saw this film very high, and good reading about it. I was happy to monitor. Sorry, I went to the movie and the movie started, I saw it is a Disney movie with the production companies that reported the BBC and Cognitive. And when they started the first events on the polar bear, I realized from my DVD home "Planet Earth". <br /> <br /> The movie continued and continued with me and my friends to identify all the events that were from "Planet Earth". <br /> <br /> We were very disappointed, for I think 90% of the picture is from "Planet Earth". I say 90%, because some events that I didn't recognize. I feel I just didn't remember them. So finally what this film is true, is the integration of different passages from the different "Planet Earth" records, and the targeted children's information. Yes, the story is quite alright. I would like to give you an example. While they show the children of polar walking away from the mother of the mother, the author says, "The children of polar are not like human children. We never listen to their mothers" (I don't remember the real words, but they are so). This is interested in "Planet Earth" for children!
