A recent message by a woman claiming a military history, was a suggestion "A woman's life is not worth more than a man". This political political logic is not true as history as well as biology. Companies have been able to recover from a significant loss of men, sometimes at an amazing pace. Germany was ready to fight another war in 1939 despite the 1914- 1918 war in which more than two million people were killed. In the South American Union of Triple Union (1865), Paraguay found three neighboring countries close to its male population all but destroyed by fighting in Chaco 1932 against Bolivia. No community, however it has or ever can survive to lose its number of women. It is only when the nation's life is faced with women being sent to fight. Israel faced the situation in 1948 but since then it has never been considered anti-cooperative units for the Defense Force as well as the popular image of the Israelite soldiers. It is a Hollywood fluff.
