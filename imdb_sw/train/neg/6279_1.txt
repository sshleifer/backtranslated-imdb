It is, in fact, looking for something that does not mean. In order not to damage the film to people who really love this look flick will explain the story. Normal women every day, walking down the road and then find himself driving his own car. He is following his events and much of the time that is with him and his family. I made the account effectively to comment on this film, how it was written badly. Acting was good, the events were great, but the story did not bring you anywhere - it could be greatly expanded and made to be a global catastrophe. I don't know what the author is trying to accomplish by doing this, usually at the end of many films your questions get answers but this film asks you, What happened and 1 hour 20 minutes did not pass by. <Br /> <br /> Spoiler starts with _______> <br /> They had this area between 2 dimensions (our and behind glasses) that would come into the world and kill us. It was not explained to all during the film, and you do not know how it happened or why it was or when it was done. Nothing is defined during the movie. The main character should not be even the main character. At the end of a young boy who eventually separates and goes away (her sister's sister) must be a protagonist but sadly the movie ends 20 seconds after. I bought this film for 10 dollars, throwing it out after ... don't waste your time. I hope anything like this will be done again.
