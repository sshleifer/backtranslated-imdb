I think that shots and lights were very bad. I watched it for the first time I thought it was an old version (1956). When I really found the true year of film I was trembling. I did not know that there could be such a bad film soon. That's all I wanted to say. This film had a good plot though, nothing could be lost if you could just read the novel that George Orwelll wrote. All I want to say has already said except this: I do not believe that this film is likely to get a lot of rewards and options. Well so. Long time
