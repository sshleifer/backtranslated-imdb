This is the worst movie I was awarded to pay for except the "Survival of Hitler's brain" the worst movie I ever seen. When this movie came out I was a big fan of SNL and SCTV and so I was expecting what I thought would be a funniest movie that could be generated since it had no TV barriers that shouldn't be done. Writers should assume we will put it in weight, some fraudulent jokes, cheap sex and hey we have a part of the risk to divide comedy laughable. The game's screens are not more than cheap cost to let us do. The sitting seat involving one girl and her boyfriend is a bad secondary school. Gun gun ads were good humor to Seasame Street. The Skit of the Subway LA was a bland humor using inappropriate blood. The French leader walking around with the blind saying "no difference" for the French emphasis was, also you get my point. The only exception that played a role in Chevy Chase for a whole minute. This means getting 60 seconds of entertainment on this film. I have read the comments on the whole country there are stones in the 1970s and you will love this movie if you are on top. Many countries were not stoned in 70 years. If unnamed writers were stoned, they must have been in the drowsy medicine. There were 4 others at the playground instead of myself when I got this film. Of course the word did not come yet about how the movie was bad.
