Van is a feelgood movie about a man who tries to attract girls in his new car, to deceive them. The only thing this attraction does not fail is the fact that it shows the fad van in the United States at the end of 70 years. It seems like it was made entirely by amateurs. It's trash, but I loved it! I need to admit I am a fan of garbage 70s! This hope makes it less than IMDB 100! <br /> 2
