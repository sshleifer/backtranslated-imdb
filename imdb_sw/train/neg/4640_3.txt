Hunters dismiss what they think is a man through the forest, although viewers see him is a wolf. Hunters do not seem to realize this, because after removing him, he usually appears when they beat. The doctor enters the eye of the waswolf into a person who lost himself in a laboratory attempt. The man, Rich, gets sex with his nurse (Stephanie Beaton) before he even gets his bandage removed. After leaving the hospital, he finds his wife sneezed as well. When a smoke machine sends clouds to pass on a new painting (for a fake branch in front), it returns to bewolf! His Torso grows bigger, divide his shirt, and grows a large mask of waswolf over his head with a red light in his eyes. His pants are stable. The mouth plays without considering, although some type of robot (or hidden hands) on the fingers gives a lot of time to look. With the high cost of waswolf, there is a fair amount of blood and gore, and that has been done well. There is even a pleasant pleasant future in the movie. However, when someone falls from a height, a very bad dummy works. Rich has a friend named Siodmak who is a specialist of witchcraft, and he has also injured a small man with stems called Androse who is also an expert. They try to help him a little. Rich kills people who have done him wrong. A police woman is investigating the murder and is trying to beat Beaton, who does not care so much for lesbians so there is nothing coming. It is very simple, but between dirt and blood and gore, and not a good story to combine (kind of). Available alone, or in the box Scream Queens Vol. 1.
