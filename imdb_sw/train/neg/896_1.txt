This film is bad. It is not hate but it is very high. The movie follows the life of a small family city in the middle of 60 years. Father, the head of the school, lives in the middle life crisis. Enter a good teacher from the main city who starts to challenge his pupils' ideas and other things that happen, if you think of yourself. The director did not agree with his teaching but he is good. You can connect dots. Her boyfriend (Winona Ryder wannabe Tara Frederick) is buried with a small town and wants to live. She gets bad advice, depends on other bad guys and seems to have a reproductive program not taught at school. Amazing! To see that the director Paul Shapiro has worked especially on television, this film resembles an adult school after school or a very special part of one of the most mundane.
