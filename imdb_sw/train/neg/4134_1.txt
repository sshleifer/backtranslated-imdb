I believe that I couldn't stop watching this film from the second that started. Just how bad it was! It is kinda like to look just a dry color to mix more. I mean you stay there and wait for something to happen, anything in fact, especially that makes the whole film meaningful! At the end of the film I was sitting there looking if there was any chance that I would have lost the first time explaining everything or if I could be lost during the film and I lost parts that dealt with the plot (if there was one truth) together! The main thing that was so confused about this film, near the end of the great girl (if it really was a great girl) was in some kind of reality, what does hell mean? Suddenly he got up and was in a mental institution, bound for bed to be a drug to doctors or something, then more quickly than it would have taken me to divide my hands, decreased and he was getting out with some random vampire! did not make sense of sodding! I'm tempted to write an email to the creators and want my time back, I mean I've lost two hours of my life looking at this trash! I am kinda interested to know if the filmmakers themselves themselves really knew what it all! we seemed like someone had edited all the pieces that could make it wise though I think the film would have been 4hrs for a long time to do it! I totally turn away from someone else who wrote another review, I was duped royally with this film by his name, and that alone. I'm just sodding to thank you that I could not buy the film, no matter how often you see it in the local pound shop. You would have thought that it would give me a clue that the film was a whole bunch of trash for the film but to be honest I think Â£ 1 was so many ways to use this film! what sodding a big waste of time with beautiful blade blade, i mean i wish i OD'ed, not more painful than watching this film !!!!
