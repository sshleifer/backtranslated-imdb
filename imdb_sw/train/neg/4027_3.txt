This should be one of the most Spanish films in history. His lack of fraud and controversy and his general political reforms make it a newborn, and only the good / bad characters. The world is not just like this, and good movies show characters with problems and other obstacles, obstacles, etc.. However, what I hate most about this film is the father of Bola's friend. The director tries to teach us a good lesson: tattoo artists and shaving heads are not always bad, in fact they can be better than an ordinary father (wow, this is like ... philosophy, or something). Thank you, Achero. I will recommend you to the Nobel Prize for Scripture.
