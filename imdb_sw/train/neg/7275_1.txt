"The National Nation goes to the cinema" (1981) is a very bad movie made, compared to "The 9th Outdoor Program". Lampoon movies unreels in three different vignettes and non-connections, each with different artists. The only common Thread is the lack of any redemption features. <br /> <br /> Well, maybe there's one. Another inspector on this site has said that shots of short-term nude are good, and he is the same. Misses Ganzel and Dusenberry surrender their property voluntarily, to one place and two parts, respectively. But their delightful displays are, alas, lost. Directors seem to have forgotten that even T&A requires a reliable story around, and no even before. <br /> <br /> The third part, star Robby Benson and Richard Widmark, is the most disgusting, and the worst option as the windup of this film. Benson has a passionate army, giving a great report for his first day of duty, ready to quit the street of evil. He has been linked to the former, unintelligent warriors of Widmark, and when these oil and water partners started on their first patrol together, we see the possible liberation of the previous film failure. Perhaps, perhaps only, an old modern elder will be replaced by a partner of his new lover of responsibility and honesty. Perhaps all will end with joy after all. But not, this film leads directly to the toilet, without the redemption, the unpleasant end, no related story of any kind. Before the "National Congress Goes to Movies," I thought I had seen the worst schlock that Hollywood could possibly turn. Unfortunately, I didn't see half of it. <br /> <br />
