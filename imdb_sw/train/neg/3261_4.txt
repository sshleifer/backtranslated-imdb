After Watergate, Vietnam and the dark days of Nixon and Jimmy Carter eras, the world needed is an old-fashioned hero to pick up poisonous snakes and criminals in America 1936 or the South American jungle in a series of amazing cliffhanging adventures . Unfortunately what happened in 1975 was Doc Savage, a Bronze Man. Perhaps the best that could be said of the actor George Pal's final story of the film is that it is often designed well but the harder to deal with Kenneth Robeson's novel pulp-karatasiback probably had George Lucas and Phil Kaufman leave the theater and speak to each one "We can do better than that," and add a stick, Fedora beaten by some of the characteristic mistakes. The biggest part of the problem is that Savage Doc is in many ways even difficult to write for than Superman? A striker, a skilled, humanitarian consultant, scientific and intellectual skills in the Greek Greek body of God (or instead of TV type Tarzan, Ron Ely, Charlton Heston, who is interesting here), nothing he can do and, more than a destructive , nothing can harm him. That person is a real Aryan ubermensch creature of Hitler (no surprise that DVD is available only in Germany!), With all American values. And if there is anything that is ignored (not that there is at any time) they don't have only one side to five of them, the lowest (low) of the fifth. Chemistry, electricity and even an archaeologist I can accept, and by stretching I could go even to reach the need of a construction engineer, but what kind of hero takes a criminal lawyer to him in his adventures? In fact the Doc's faithful brain was added because as well as the hero is caused so much and usually by all means? even Kryptonite could put a dent in it - it is necessary to be a dangerous person in the story, although except Paul Gleason is all so badly beaten and overturned (as in many places in the film) They are happy to kill them all during the opening names. Criminals do not do well, with Paul Wexler questioning each of the dangers of a geography teacher like Captain Sea, Scott Walker (no, different) to give one of the worst accents of films (it means to be Scottish, Ireland, Welsh, Greek, Pakistan or Any nation no one has ever heard?) When Robily Hilton's Marilyn Monroe-ish, blumb molumb, has given Paris (no connection) to run for her money in the unlikely bimbo units. these obstacles, this should be better than considering the various ingredients? The lost tribes, a pool of gold, dog and biplane and deadly poison that comes alive, locked in an attempt to discover why D's father was killed. Unfortunately it is a matter of tone: in the superheroes of 60 and 70 holes it was not a stimulating figure that can be seen by the events of the art and special action events but were given as some statistical data of the budget base and events. quickly hit the cheapest price as soon after the birth, films focused on the market of matinée only: you know, for children. Is there a long time that rumors that the previous ward was more straight-faced? and most of the value of the camp has been added after the production, if it is Colgate surrounds the Doc's eye, polling words to identify different styles of fighting in the last dust and the Sea of ​​Sea or the lyrics of Don Black's gung-ho to John Philip Trials of the Sousa ethnic race? but much was in the movie started with. After all, it is difficult to see how one of the village-born children are calling from a big bladder that makes the session expected to be anything but a joke that falls flat, while Doc's definition for Pamela Hensley's why she can't date girls can be a written area to the Batman of Adam West. Instead, during the funniest usually helps with precision, such as Doc depicting his sixth sense to, er, hitting the Adam's apple. Perhaps the most serious problem is that, during the pledge on the paper, the action is taken in an almost unfamiliar style, whether to expel native killers on New York's screens or run from the sea full of evil people. Even the idea of ​​winning green-green snakes when they offend their victims can not bring any interest from director Michael Anderson: after being shown to them several instances in advance, Doc can take them without more than a seat with a fan just connecting curtains. However, apart from all Docs of all Docs set by its logo and look more than designed plastic than copper, the production pattern is often good even if it is obviously LA stand for New York while movies Fred Koenekamp ensures that the film often looks good though the low budget. And it is good to see a superhero film that does not spend much of its time on the original story, though one has been left with the idea that Doc has come out entirely from Zeus's own hips. It is a film I would like to love more, but it feels like 100 minutes of lost opportunities. No wonder Doc Savage, Enemy Enemy of Evil, Good and so hope promised the end of credit, never happened.
