There is no way to avoid the comparison between Cat in Hat and Grinch Who Stole Christmas, then let's get that part out of the way. First of all, I would like to start by saying that I think Grinch was an unpopular and unpopular film. Cat was ... well, it's just bad. Jim Carey was thrown because he is a skilled physical player, and without fear he does on high, frightening characters. Mike Myers fell back into his old pocket approach. Why, why, why Mike Myers ?? Children can take care of the little, and the number of people with Austin's power will not be able to spy on this film. So, the studio was thinking? <br /> <br /> Cat also relates to Linda Richmond. Can we talk? Why Accent New York? Not exactly what Dr Seuss has ever written. Myers was even allowed to beat skirts in his Scottish shtick. I wonder how many director and studio tried to edit before just giving and saying "as long as they say fahklempt", you can put a sound. " Meyers never found to find any comfort, either with costume, make-up, or talk. The joke, the few who were present, were odd and old was not good. When Myers climbs a garden leaf and gives a camera: "dirty", everything but a shot of the player was not there, and even that did not help. <br /> <br /> The same people created 'Whoville' ', clearly had a hand in the creation of a city and house in' Cat '. The sets and talent were very attractive, and gave the viewer a great damage from bad writing, leadership, and Myers. It was a pleasure to have Alec Baldwin and Kelly Preston. Dakota Fanning was the only actor who appeared to know that he was in the primary film of Dr Seuss classic, and remained true to the genre. Split SPCA. This cat should be neutered and never allowed to reproduce again. Please, please, no good.
