The Great Experience of Robert Carmichael is a bad film for every way. Script, dreary speed, lack of detail in any character, trivial objects, horrible actions, unwanted season all make it possible for the worst film I have seen. I didn't find anything interesting, fun or mentally stimulating in any way. I think the creators of the film thought they were doing something flawed and dark, with its powerful lights, long long term silences and sound of odd sound odors. If so, they were completely defeated. It just hit me, and I would never have looked at it. Avoid at all costs.
