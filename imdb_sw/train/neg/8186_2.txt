Did anyone read the script. This has to be one of the worst text and lead over the whole year. Three major actors, Paul Giamatti, Rachel Weisz and Miranda Richardson could not smoke this. About two-thirds it looks like the eyes of Giamatti said, I can't believe it is signed a contract. It's not the worst movie I saw, but it is on a very bad Christmas movie. Not enough lines, but what else could they say? Well, the movie is not available to the Vaughn's con-man discussion, his character is a angry boy that you can't get past. It was just walking through the walk, for no one could see it.
