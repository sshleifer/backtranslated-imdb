Talk: stilted, clichéd; Acting: hammy, clichéd; Plot: predictable, clichéd. <br /> <br /> What is just Christopher Plummer Nastassia Kinski doing in this waste "B"? Plummer was established decades before this film was made, Kinski had artistic works like "Tess" and "People's Cat" behind it ... Must have been disappointed. <br /> <br /> All bad people have bad people - bad * bad-guy guy! (Plummer exactly! Where * learned to do "Germany"?) And many of them have bad sneers-guy too. Innocent characters face up to their fears enough to laugh at you. A good person continues to live, among other things: * 5 "throwing a knife-deep knife in his shoulder - just draws out and seconds later is using hand without any difficulty; * hot fire gun (I think someone talking to .50) The foot that comes out by connecting the fake around the foot of the pants and afterwards has trouble; * several fist fights which can strengthen many blows to the face and also run to the crane - first at the door of the door; what looks like a third floor, on a paving, without a little trick of a misleading foot or any kind of disruption. Script has 3 clever lines, others all the time is fast and blurring. The plummer brings a certain class to its part, and of course it is the best performers in this flick. Of course that doesn't say a lot, but it can make a villain of pride without using more ham techniques using here causes better "Ve haff vays and meance" and some risk, but you always know you are looking for Christopher Plummer making man. <br /> <br /> This movie is a great waste of time. Acting, as it is, is a 70-color film of the 007 wooden exhibition to meet the events of Bruce Lee which is very obvious to fight, but even around almost as well as Roger Moore 007 or Bruce Lee's film. Don't bother.
