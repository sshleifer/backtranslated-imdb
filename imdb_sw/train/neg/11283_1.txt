I heard the Rancid Aluminum was the perfect waste of two hours, the plot of the plot was thin and mixed, the elegant line on the players had a terrible conversation and the most accents of course. The camera function was a lot of experiments in places and although it might seem that the director tried to convey it, it made it more difficult to watch. One of the most pressing elements of Rancid Aluminum is the most use of information in the entire film as long as the whole plot is explained to the audience. The best performances were nothing to do and act. In fact, the most interesting performance came from Dan Behr of all people, although he actually does the office of a deliberate office. Not in any case and see this movie unless you need a reason to get some sleep, there is certainly the best way to spend your hard money.
