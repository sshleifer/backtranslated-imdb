This is Peter Falk's film. Period. I was 10 years old when this film came out; I was already raw film at that time. Of course neither my parents nor I did not see this film when it came out, but I was passionate with its kind of advertising and aura that this was an important film. Okay, 34 years later I saw the film - without seeing any film directed by Cassavetes previously. He is a hack, in general. Edit edit time, editing. The performance of Gena reminds me of the stint of Dustin Hoffman in the "Rainy Boy": technically par but completely note one. As Tom Cruise stole "The Rainbow," Falk takes the cake for this film. I was angry with Gena's performance, indeed - it was more appropriate for "Awakenings" (blecch!). It is not his fault: he is the case of the basket from the first place to the end. We don't know why? But the character of the Falk looks real and amazed at the speed with Falk as a very bad person. Shave away at least an hour (editor is needed!), and this would be a photograph of the woman's not under the influence but simple, Cro-Magnon, a person who comes with a wife who is unemployed and still cannot deal her three children and hours of her husband's work. <br /> <br /> I 'So remember Cassavetes for "Dozen Dirty" or "Baby Rosemary." He would have been a good director he had reduced his own extra character - as he shows it to this film. Bob
