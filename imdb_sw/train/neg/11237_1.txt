I went to see this film and low expectations, but with the hope of translating and seeing my home home on film. Unfortunately, that's all I have. The story deals with a known district (secondary school), but the plot has been dropped by a common feature that adds little to this well-filled theme. Although the quality of acting was generally good, the content of the film was awesome. The violence of the film was clear - women were not accepted unless they were married, wanting or both (although this was installed as a post-female choice). Worse is racism - the angry Jewish mother, a black man who still lives at home - with brutal violence (torture of the geek class). We should be embarrassed if these characters are thought to represent the residents of the city of Kalamazoo, and the writers should be worried that they have brought great and brutal displays on the screen.
