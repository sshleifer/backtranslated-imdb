Being honest, I did not like the "General Decision" - which was definitely the template - very, but compared to this piece, it looks like the hub of art. Not only that people walking in the film (temporary actors will be insulting to all other actors) should attend more classes, the boy who built the environment has not yet seen a flight from a distance. It is very foolish, that only 747 aircraft attendants are in, but this is just a tip of ice. The film is full of destruction (for example, use sleeping gas, then do not use, then use it), which has dropped my score finally down. You can be more happy to re-bridge the sock or dig a hole in your knee and fill it with milk.
