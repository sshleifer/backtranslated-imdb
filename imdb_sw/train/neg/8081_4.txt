One of the requirements of science fiction, at least before it starts to congestion, is that it is very appropriate. I would like to think that a bomb to fight something could do more damage than what was required. But I will hold that to physics that could see the Solar Crisis. It is a world crisis facing because the solar flares come out entirely. They are approaching the Earth, so much so that there is no doubt the fire, as if the whole Earth was Valley Valley. The answer is a bomb to fight something that space ship will have to take the sun and explode there. That will overturn flares in saying the direction of saying Mercury to give not directly to the World. Who will deliver it, but captain Tim Matheson and his staff. That's like he can put his thoughts on the existing business and not the lost son, Corin Nemec. Keeping a personal problem of family problems is admiral Charlton Heston, father of Matheson, and grandfather of Nemec. There is a village member here, Peter Boyle who is the CEO of the national organization that the crisis is trying to control the world food for the victims. The concept that he cannot live does not come into his thinking. He struggles to lose Matheson's message. Solar clashes are seen as a bad mix of 2001, Space Odyssey and Underwater Ocean. Boyle seems to be taken from Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor in Superman, apparently he is the only one in cast who knows he is in Turkey and adds more effectively. <br /> <br /> Some of the cast are supporters, true blue and lighter. Except the mouse on the desert desert Jack Palance who finds Nemec and cares. The most important thing here is that the film was led by the Hollywood film of flop films, Smokes Allen. The movie gets four such stars for the listed and it was out of time to draw thanks.
