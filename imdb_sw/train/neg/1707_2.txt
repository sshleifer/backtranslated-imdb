with a $ 30,000 budget and this movie still looks like it was made for $ 50. You can say from the first to the last frame that didn't care little about promotional film or plot, was just happy to make a movie of a zombie. The ultimate result shows a lazy filmmaker who loves zombie movies. It would be good if only he had been given a service. The end result is a long-term zoom in the year that is not done, and even more than steel is produced on it. What happens when you combine great hopes, big dreams, good budget, hard work, and one Idiot behind the camera.
