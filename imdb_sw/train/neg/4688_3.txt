Allowing the class to view this in English was a bad idea. Bad movies and more education may have an impact, but this seems to have no effect on the class - every teacher left, the conversation started very fast - and I do not feel the words "Shakespeare" or "Shadow" is widely used. And when you look at this, it's easy to see why. Acting is not something special - everyone looks tired for bits, reading from the page without service in the world. Shakespeare has always preferred an exhibition dialogue to action and death, but I can only understand a word that anyone was saying. Dress is not so bad nor not the special effects - the class will not have loved the film, but did not take p * ss exactly. But it's very exciting on a film that does not exist of any kind of inspiration or fun. The showcase of the ship at the beginning of the film was not very well - although the rain appeared to be untrue, everything else was done well and beautiful. But where were the heads and masts crossed? Where was death? Where was the wind? Ariel's behavior would have been taken very seriously if he was wearing clothes - but if all was on the show, he was just another reason for joke. This film is not suitable for any sex or sex. Women and girls will not be able to enjoy it or enjoy it, and there is a lot of naked men and a lack of action or death that will put many men and boys away. The rain did not occur badly, but this was seen as something that producers did, not something they wanted to do. And the total weight and lack of inspiration suggests. 3/10
