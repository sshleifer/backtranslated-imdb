While James James is the western western, this film has fallen as the worst film of Alamo has been made. The story was horrible, inaccurate in such a way, and false fiction of the boot! Promotion was hit by four winds. Can anyone find a sequence of code? Mexican workers were sufficiently strong to fire tanks that have been found to have mud and ramrods still increasingly out of existing ones. Come! Then there is Brian's ignorance hat! The cost of the cost of the cost should be off or something. Or just out of their mind!
