Seeking an unknown cast that seems likely to remain that way, this "film" is still another cheap flick that emphasizes how this was released. I have no problem with fear and slasher comes exactly, is actually my favorites. But when they have been made this BAD, it really takes a monkey and it is not surprising that Ghanaian has a very difficult time. The story is like a clich√©d and without imagination possible by a group of people in the cabin out of the forest hit and broken by this zombie / ghost boy. It's not a story that takes more, it's a bad acting and dialouge, the house has led to the quality and loud sound. Do not have laughable effects with some amazing lazy text - these are out of daylight still we mean to believe it at night? What was hell to think about? What, had just one day of all this film? Did he fear the darkness? (Is it cautious to see a striker walking around the light of day and lighting acting as if its black, though) they could escape from this film without being seen. I am sure one of the "youth" plays bingo under the pub - but he is 40-45. <br /> <br /> However, good for a laugh but just another waste of film and time.
