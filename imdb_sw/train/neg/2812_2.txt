I saw this film recently in the film festival. It is the love of an old drunken man who came out of great depression and a middle-aged woman who works in an employment office (INEM). I've found a very simple and full story of the clich√©s, taking the title of 'social' of the movie and turning on the comedy of romance. The leading actor did a good job, he apparently looked like a drunk man, but Ana Belen does not believe as a working class woman, he looks, acts and talks very much like a "top" woman. What it means is that Ana Belen struggles for herself. He does so in all his movies however. The entire series of films was very bad. Photography is bad, not to use it properly in all of the panoramic aspect. The discussion seems quite written and stretch many times. The comic situation is normal from Gomez Pereira, but in this case they are not quite funny and sorted wrong. In my opinion this film is not recommended to watch. Only if you like the original films of Pereira you can enjoy this a little bit. However, I came out of the theater because I felt I was wasting my time. The creator of the film was near the door. I wonder what a director feels like when he sees someone walking out of one of his films, especially one that makes everyone enjoyable.
