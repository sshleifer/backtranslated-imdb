If this film was on false behavior, the film can stand alone and be judged correctly. Unfortunately for the viewer, the movie depends on the "truth" which has been so much banned by Ruben Carter. The fact of the little truth had been ignored (Carter had no number at the time of the murder, there was no evidence that he rescued a friend from a young child in his youth), but some of the big things, as it seems to have been bound by Joey Giardello for the judges "racist", innocent of those who have seen the fight with the tape, and totally disrespect Giardello. Why Hollywood feels the need to make a hero from someone who, for the better, was in trouble and almost more trouble than anyone who should be (caught many times by hitting women) is amazing to me. Ruben Carter had never, to look at his actions in 60 years and even now, when he refuses to talk to his son, a man who can look up. Everyone knows that Jewison can lead, and Washington can act, but why they chose this story as their car is over me. What? Hollywood requires a lot of black hero who need to crawl in all their photos to make them honest? (Here's a comment about Denzel playing a movie about himself? Now this is inspiring) Based on all of the accuracy in the movie, I would recommend to pass this.
