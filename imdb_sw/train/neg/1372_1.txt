See this on TV. I am glad that I have not gone to the movies to see this or spend money on renting. The movie is quite predictable - from the corrupt owner and tenant, for snaking electric cables. This program is very weak and unlikely - a buffer expert is beaten by the bone of the bone of the bone (using a real video) and all he does is to rise and move. Bumps scream less than a million miles per hour and stop dying along the road. Some real banguki material is amazing and shows its powerful ability. But the contract between the actual guns and the objects put in place makes this film even flimsier. <br /> <br /> What! You yourself grace, don't bother with this even on the T.V.
