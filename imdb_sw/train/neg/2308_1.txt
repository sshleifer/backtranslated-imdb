Okay, the box seems promising. Whoopi Goldberg standing near Danny Glover pardying a famous farmer and his wife painting. Then you hit this child in a DVD player and all hope is lost in less than five minutes. It seems to be a comedy. And I must admit that I have just laughed about ten minutes before the end. The film contains the following: a neighbor who was beaten by neighboring violence, a boring legal, racist, lynchings discussion, and death and burning. Hilarious, huh? No, please, if you always listen to anyone's inspection, please do here. You can't even try to look at this trick. Dial! I said, Call! Anyone who puts the name here on this must judge.
