Wow You are the best way !!! Corny, Corny, Corny That's how I feel about the film. It started well with a good idea, a boy (Edward Asner) escaped from Jela dressed like Santa, a group of children finds him and believes his real Santa so fake Santa asks children to help him get a stolen money bag. The film is like the Christmas version of "Whistle under the wind". The movie starts well but gradually becomes Cheesier and Cheesier for sure that it finally becomes ridiculous and you just cant take this film seriously. For example, you find a Scrooge character called Sumner (Rene Auberjonois) who is a general Douchebag who treats his little boy as a garbage heap, treats him so bad that he even buys beautiful clothes, this poor child wearing Jeans and Holes in it! but the second second and fake area of ​​Santa visiting Sumner and at the end of the film you get all the guys blowing to Christmas Carol and giving her baby offender a embrace ... yep is how Corny embodied ... I'm all to feel a good movie especially when Christmas and I am a great fan of the movie TV season but this is a very high way for me, it's a shame because it started well but the second half of the movie gives us a feature of a typical film that doesn't match all of the contents. Not too bad, there are some hard work, especially from children but there are many more Christmas movies.
