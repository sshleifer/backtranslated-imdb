here, I would lift my hands on the keyboard, I'll tell you what salad is going to order. from time to time, works as a charm: he is a view, omg how does he do it? My bullshit detector freaks as i even passed this show when I'm looking for stations, I have to be very careful (these days are important too often, so I don't need to get broken up idiotic crap like this ... pay attention to that far!). Is this supposed to be a fascist of the fascist to make people believe in the invisible world of uberman control and skill? or what? why is there exist ?? <br /> <br /> This is a show of eighty, quite amazing and contrived, and I can't understand why it's still on air. so it can geeks offer SO SO very good moments during such hard (Sarah Connor Chronicles, True Blood), but give this nonsensical drivel ending. it shows if the Firefly (if there were any like that) fall off after the season, but mindless things like this that makes zero logic means just wearing up. yeccch.
