This film was purchased for one dollar at Wal-Mart on DVD and so I don't feel like I have lost anything by watching this film, except my TIME. He enjoyed the act of Tom Hanks, (Robbie Wheeling), who was very young looking and gave the best performance because it was a bad script. The story is about university students who decided to play the game Mazes & Monsters, just in a very realistic environment. Robbie Wheeling has had trouble in the past playing this game in other colleges and is advised by her parents to leave the game alone and get a good class. Robbie meets a very beautiful gal and has a romantic fling with her and immediately begins to play the game, she stops making love and acting like Monk. There are some scenes in the film which are considered running around the old World Trade Center also in the floor of the Observation and Roof area. Instead it is sad to see this part of the film where many people died because of the evil in the world. This is not a very good film, except Tom Hanks tries to put the film above the interesting level of entertainment.
