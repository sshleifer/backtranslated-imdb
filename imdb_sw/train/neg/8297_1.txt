Ugh! Where to start ... first, Campbell Scott is not a stop angst becomes a real turning after a while (very short time) as he internalizes his mounting influences, curiosity and anger. Just don't care! These characters as presented by the author and director cannot be absolute, and in it are important. You don't give us anything that makes us care if they are adulterers and if they still love them. When Scott said to his wife quietly, "I killed you" in front of their three daughters at the dinner table, after the self-centered self-indulgence, I wanted to have - and then did the same thing for smug, deficit of Denis Leary before being canceled on the looney bin. Damage of time and perhaps - only resources.
