Have you previously enjoyed Wesley Snipes in many stages of travel and what I expect more, even from the IMDb of 5.8, the movie does not charge and even though the story is thin and unusual, the acting is very serious and it is a "worst" situation. playing "strong feeling" accompanied by a bad act ... Don't keep it when your film is not entertaining, if you want to cry it can be useful though, though your tears will be due to seeing Wesley Snipes in the awesome movie films ... <br /> <br /> I offer this 2/10 was really bad, if you want to see a good movie going to see a shooter or rent, all of this beautiful film is not.
