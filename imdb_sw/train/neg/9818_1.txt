This film raises several questions to consider in my mind. First, how has Jennifer Tilly been able to continue the film work for the same time all the years with the sound of the breach and the smallest voice of the hammer that she employs? Second ... what on earth were people obliged to make this film offensive and very amazing thinking of? And third ... given that there were people misleading enough to lose this like, should not have someone in the system - label, distributor, or somewhere - right enough to prevent actually completed and released. In fact you will need to find a very long way to turn the other movie as bad as this ... and even not scared like a terrible movie - which, since it can be seen as any legitimate movie type, certainly it is. Movie allows from beginning to end of the worst kind of madness, abuse and abuse, and basically no items to redeem. I don't really advocate for control (which I don't believe) ... but I can't see how anyone can draw anything positive from watching this movie.
