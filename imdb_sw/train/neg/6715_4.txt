I entered the game you are expecting to adopt 90 minutes good if not light. I stopped or distracted. This movie can not create its ideas that seeks to have ended up not much of anything. There are a few interesting lines and several popular films (Blow 400 - for this character? Arrive!). While no characters get treated with great respect, more than thirty men get worse: all bad, fat, sad, forest. If you have a sense of a movie related to gay relationships, see Participation Plans, Long-term Assistant, Trick, All Over Guy, Red Dirt, Maurice, Philadelphia instead. It. <br /> <br />
