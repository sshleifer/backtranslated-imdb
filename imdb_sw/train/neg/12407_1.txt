Alicianne (Laurel Barnett) is living in the newborn for Rosalie Nordon (Rosalione Cole) who recently lost her mother. But Rosalie lost her dead mother and continued to visit her grave (easily located in the tomb right behind the house) at the end of the night ... where she also meets her "friends" ... start well with a real chain in the cemetery ... then falls. The story is thin and there are TONS padding to make a film for 85 minutes long. Acting is bad in the board (and Cole can easily become worse). It has been misrepresented by some of the WORST edits that I have seen on the motion picture. Exhibitions (and sounds) are discarded without any reason or reason. Also the film has an alarming sound (and clear) after production. <br /> <br /> About blood and violence - forget it! There is very little and what seems to be fake. I haven't seen such a false blood-looks like ketchup! Decay, without meaning - right forgotten film. You can fly this.
