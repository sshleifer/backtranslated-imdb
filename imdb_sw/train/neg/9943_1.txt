Cover art (which includes a man with a pellet scary gun) would make it look like a military film. (It is impossible.) It is interesting that the real name of the film is the Trojan Warrior. (Trojan is a brand of condoms in the United States) This movie is blocked by homoeroticism. If you like these things, then this film is not very bad. However, consider these points: <br /> <br /> There are many different types of actors & small, (one area even involved every actor and erection bulging in his pants.) Film also bathed in gaudy colors like lime , peach, and red. From a movie perspective, this film is a doctor of drag! Several publications show the characters standing so close to one another, often touching when they talk. Also, the cousin's hero loves women, and everyone else in the movie tries to kill him. Is there a message here that the filmmakers want to convey? <br /> <br /> Will I get into the events of fighting? (Yes, the personal parts of a person get the same battle.) Military art is short and thoughtless. There are no concepts here, just your normal action you can see on the old flick of Chuck Norris. There is also an exploratory vehicle that can be the first to track speed on the film.
