Spooks are enjoying garbage, with well-tracked surveillance, ignorance squares and discussion, and the third level involved. Many have explained this is the British version of "24", and one can see the similarities. The American version incorporates the silly weak squares, but the action is the best player, sexier and I suspect, it is expensive. Some people describe a weak comedy as a "gentle comedy". <br /> <br /> This is a gentle spy story at, quite the opposite of anything made by John Le Carre. <br /> <br /> Give me Smiley any day.
