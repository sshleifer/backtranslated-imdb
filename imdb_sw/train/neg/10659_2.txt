Filmatography: Ideal, beautiful camera angles (I don't remember to see the movie of the late, with close-ups, until this). It can avoid bad scenes with soft camera. NY is well displayed. Likes the lower corners, especially (touch different). Music: Not surprising. Songs are not perfect in your mind even after watching the movie. It may be, I expected the same quality as "Anniyan". Desire. Characters: Kamal requires slowing down from the process of complicated action. His age and stomach show the truth. Also, he should avoid the intimacy of the nearest sex process. It was very difficult to see a whole / old star still trying to play as 20+ heroes scenes. Love can be explained at any time; when we are older, you can still describe love well from afar (without touching a woman very much. For example, love is shown by Rajinikanth in "chandrmukhi") I don't know why he accepted this. This, not my problem, I think. Some have a limited presence. <br /> <br /> Trend: I expected Gautham to exceed (or measure-up) to his other movie "Kakka Kakka". He hired me. It took a long time to open the movie due to various issues. He walks in a few scenes. Even things that have happened have emerged from the famous director. <br /> <br /> Overall: It's just a beautiful movie. Too many images. WE NEED NOT FOR CHILDREN (and adults who expect some kind of "Entertainment"). Thing
