The Japanese feeling of adoption, editing and music markings should be different from the American flavor, but in fact this film may have much more and less work on the post production. Somebody in Hollywood needs to repeat again, make this film and I think it will be a great hit. Stories are interesting and interesting. There is something on the side of the city, the gritty police, the earthquake, sanitariums and the killing of wonderful salt water that is enough to be captivating. However, this story should do just a little of the mind and maybe be 40 minutes short. I need to say that the sixth "sense of feeling" was established in this movie, and that was obvious from the beginning. <br /> <br /> As it stands, Japanese film lovers who are very dying should have to see this movie-oh-boring.
