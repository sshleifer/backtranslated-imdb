Imagine that you are asked and your date is what film you wanted to see, and you remember seeing the exciting trailer on "The Grudge." So, with good faith, you recommend seeing the film. It's a Halloween season, after all. And it was a box office box at the end of last week, so it should be good ... so go. <br /> <br /> And you are really in a state of shock when the movie ends the way, and you hear by hearing say, "that can't be the end of the film ...." But, alas, it is. Think about coming from the cinema to be shy and shy by suggesting a dog like a movie. You think your date thinks you are the head of the bone by suggesting that cruelty, and your proposal will surely end the promising relationship. True, it was so bad that we all broke the laughter as it was bad. I don't see the future of Miss Gellar in the movies, and show that she puts on television later. In fact, it will not be long before it is submitted to the sale of the sale of the Buffy market, and it will not happen soon, if you ask me. Horror, terrible, terrible. The plan was useless; The proceedings were bad. It seems that the whole end was found to be "Jump II - Return to" Cat-Boy ".
