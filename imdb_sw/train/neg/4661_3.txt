This movie has Richard Pryor, Rosey Grier and others. It's a wonderful WW2 movie, and serves as information on racism. It is important to check to understand the fact that movies show how we feel about issues when they are produced and not about the time they show. This is a 70 movie movie not 40 (WW2). However, there are some good cases of 7 black people led by a white captain trying to catch a pond. The story tells Captain to learn that these men are soldiers and not just a service company. There is a place that could be from the movie of the Civil War and not the WW2 movie which shows what the film is about. Black Lt gives German women peck innocent on the cheek, and the white Capt irritates. I enjoyed a movie from the curiosity of the stars and Genre attracted me.
