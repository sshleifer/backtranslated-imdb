I stopped watching this POS as soon as the snake began to "take" the plane. At first I thought maybe it should give "one" to the comic aid. But I realized I could just look at three stooges for free and laugh more! Then my respect for Samuel Jackson has been destroyed without protesting. And Hollywood shows once again how to be removed from their true reality. When I was a child we got a snake with fun. The only thing that the snake is doing is to get under the luggage of luggage. And no amount of Hollywood's cartoon snakes can change that. <br /> <br /> This movie is not suitable for Blockbuster's journey. Understand: if you pay, "the victim" alone is your dumb ass. If you want to be very scared, I advise you to decrease. If you want humor, go to your local comedy club. Their worst supplier will be a million times better than this garbage.
