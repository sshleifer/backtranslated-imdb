Wow. It's a terrible change of good novel. These are just a few gripes. - The scribe of the screen removed two main characters from the book. - The program has changed very much. - Sound ringtones sound as if they are automatically downloaded from text texts (which can read well but not the same as mentioned, especially for Chabon writing style). - Acting is more wooden than cabin log. (Esp. Bechstein) - This should be put in 1983 ??? It deserves more than 2003 ... It is not possible to be perfect to watch this film, so it might be possible to deliver ... (fear). I really believe that no one has ever seen this, or at least anyone who reads the book of hope of honor (the Wonder Boys). I love Chabon as an author but he should be ASHAMED to deal with this. <br /> <br /> No star.
