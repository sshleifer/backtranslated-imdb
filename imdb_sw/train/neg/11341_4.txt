In this way Fellini has been working for the rest of his life. The line between the wonderful work and the free free association is very small, and what kind of film that finally fits in most often depends on personal feelings. That said, "Casanova" has left me with a nice cooling for its sets and a little more that can not be adequately inserted by Bukowski: <br /> <br /> "Casanova also died, an old man with a big cock and a long tongue no guts at all say that he lived well is true, saying that I could spit on his grave without feeling is also true women go to a great fool they can get; which makes today: we have raised a slick and durable, indoor inner , such as the Easter bunnies we develop our poor children. ‚Äù\ t he was given, with more sympathy, but he was not angry yet. Casanova's environment is made from decay and abnormal behavior, the Fellini theme was dealt with by "Satyricon". The series of conspiracy is a small, smooth character; and Donald Sutherland is bad and reduces the stage of disruption. However, there can only be sure to show Casanova as a fool. And I urge anyone to create this without being obvious; Fellini could not. More than that he is seen here as an old man - maestro, indeed, but a person whose attraction is more proud than anyone else. I find it difficult to imagine the audience who enjoy this film. It was an inappropriate story to tell.
