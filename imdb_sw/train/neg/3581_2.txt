I have not been able to decide whether this film is very bad, or, to mention Enid Coleslaw, "the worst has gone well and come back to evil again." It does not matter, it has forced me to look in the same way as a bunch of extraordinary breasts, and it offers many images that you forget even if you want. There is a young boy Ray Liotta also telling pigtailed. A future later, there is Ray again, destroying also, not to spoil accordingly shaped but a garden hose. There is also a difficult problem to tell her mother of authority that she wants to go to bed with Ray geezer, Walter. There is a composer in the area of ​​the cemetery yolling the best line written by Also or anyone else: "WWWWHHYYYYYYYY!" There is a garden of the garden again, like the Walter's surface and also the sound "Is this more for your love?" There is also a date to turn to the integration of each other soft prayer that begins to break each other's clothes. There also shine but forget to remove her dress. Perhaps better, there is also a printing machine too, but instead of the keys there are a few heads of those who have hurt him (later, I was afraid to open my laptop). And finally there is also in the "Awards" to reveal Hollywood to the cesspool is, hitting the second best line, "I think I'm not the only one who has ever **** on its way." "than I have a better picture, so I will quit. Beware, however, that once you start watching you may not be able to take your eyes on the screen until two hours of your life are lost forever.
