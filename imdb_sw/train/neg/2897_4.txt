There is little to get excited about "Dan in Real Life". First of all, the whole setup is generally derived. What? Do you really believe that during the first meeting of the first meeting in the restaurant, Marie will not tell Dani where she was going? And since Dan was speaking during the conversation, why would he be attracted to him? For this, I have never had Marie so much impressed with Dan during the movie. He is very narcissistic and has little to convince us that he is a good man (for example sleeping in Marie in a bookstore, mocks his brother about his old girlfriends and tries to make Marie jealous and "blind date"). There are more skills like the ignorance area in the Bowling garden where Dan and Marie are found in the whole family. Oh as if it could happen true. Dan in real life is slow-paced, sappy and manipulative. Even the donkey climbs as the Book of Jane Austen Book to get the highest score than these predictable tears.
