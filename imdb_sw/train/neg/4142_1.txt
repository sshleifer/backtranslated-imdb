This is the worst movie I saw! There was nothing to say about this movie. I have seen bad movies but this takes. There are no films and films you give to the movie to do quickly or you wonder what hell is going on because you can't think hard to be the person who thinks of this film and you are watching it. I feel sad for anyone who should stay this hour of pain and half. Please get my advice and see this movie because I know you will think it's a great waste of time you have spent in your life.
