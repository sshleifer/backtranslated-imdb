First, I am not a fan of "all the things that eat meat in a new way" of the film but I am a very bad movie so my neighbor's house explains that he had a bad movie. This is. So we begin to look at it. First of all - written on camcorder sans tripod! The second white white voice is called a black black man! Third, no conversation makes any sense. Fourth, the zombie events, though unacceptable and disgusting the poor and tomato tomatoes, let me believe the director (and my second neighbor) need psychological help. It's funny for 5 minutes but it gets very fast. It is so amateurish it is like to look at the bad book dubbed the school video .... and zombies. Remember for anyone involved with this film - I want 20 minutes of my life I watched this, before I went to sleep, back.
