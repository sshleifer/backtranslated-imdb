Birthday girl does not know what she wants to be - it's comedy, do you! It's a drama ... you just don't know. What can be a very interesting or touching film that ends in a person's country. The premise is pre-sufficient that has confirmed the script full of interesting events but difficult to release any and end petering out. This is a real shame if you look at cast - it is very stable all the way but it does not get a chance to shine. Very disappointed.
