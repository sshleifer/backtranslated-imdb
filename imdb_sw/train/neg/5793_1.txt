It was very bad. In short and (of mercy!) Short "Dozen Dirty" series of television which made the star Ben Murphy and made almost simultaneously (also for the cheap Yugoslavia). I was embarrassed for the planned members of this film - and for Telly Savalas especially. He was a waaaaaay also an old man with oil for a role (pushing 70 when he made this garbage), and an inspector who makes a similarity to Telly Greek in this and John Wayne in "Green Berets" very large. > <br /> Other viewers have said some of the right sounds that this crime against celluloid has, so I can't come back here. But I will add that I am wondering that no one mentioned the top-looking hat that Savalas is wearing on his big head, beaten. I am also wondering that this fall of the film trailer has a high score of 4.7 here on IMDb. <br /> <br /> Besides I'm concerned, it's "1" certainly on the board. If you want a good example of why blowing a death franchise is actually a bad idea (especially 20-plus years after nature) - look more than "Dozen Dirty - The Fatal Mission". <br /> <br /> Awful - avoid !!!!
