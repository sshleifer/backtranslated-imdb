I saw this film first in the Soviet Union and many erotic events were organized only by the control committee. But, in Poland in 2000, I looked at it in full form. And so what? The plan is very strange - 2 men live in a natural catastrophe and find themselves on a planet full of powerful women, similar to the basics. Men are now trying to fight it and then a whole clich√©s of sexually active monitoring, men wanting to have sex, women are shown as full idiots (you can agree with them or not, but they really do not know), and so on. Even the performance of stellar Jerzy Stuhr is here the wood and very strange - comes only unwanted faces and repeat by saying such words as "I am in the elevator and chick nude and I haven't done anything to him!" This was intended to be a comedy, instead, it became a much farce, full of predictable jokes and innuendos under-waist. Don't waste your time on it - this is very bad.
