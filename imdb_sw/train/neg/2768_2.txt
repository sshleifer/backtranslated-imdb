This film was awesome. They did not develop any characters at all times and story stories were played out. It was hard to sleep. You are looking for practical events on this film as its strong points but D-Wars are wondering you and even allowing it in that department. Also, the acting was only a step on the level of a small budget. And I have that great meaning. I was so happy to see the last features because this one was just bad! Please, whatever you do people, don't waste your time and money on the crappy film like D-Wars.
