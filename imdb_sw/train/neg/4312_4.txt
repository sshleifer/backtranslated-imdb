This acts as a satire during women's rights movement. Of course, that does not mean the COACH (movie) is a good experience to see. It goes in the same line as FASTBREAK (which was the best, but still fit), and basically it is a standard rate. What this movie means is not interesting is easy to identify. Anyone who serves time away from normal work to teach a group of lunatics to get their way to a sudden victory makes waste. It's the same feeling that you can get after watching this. A good attempt to diversify sex for someone's responsibility, but I expected good things.
