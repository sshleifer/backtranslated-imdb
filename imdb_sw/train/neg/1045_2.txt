Adding Victor Vargas is very faint in what is trying to be: real. Unfortunately, there is no truth for this film. Characters and situations feel quite fake and fake. <br /> <br /> Why? Redirect the wrong. Peter Sollett uses all the wrong tools in his arsenal. It seems Mr. Sollett to read somewhere that not his film lights would give a real feel. Still! It only gives you a bad feel. Similarly, shaking a camera does not provide a documentary style for your film, gives the audience a headache and prevents it from what's on the screen rather than reinforcing it. <br /> <br /> Of course, what is on the screen is a very fake screwed, as that Mr. Sollett wrote his script with the sole aim of trying to check "hip" for his Sundance friends and showing how "edgy" is a manufacturer of The film. <br /> <br /> Overall, the only permanent feeling this film leaves you and the bad director Mr. Sollett is. Sometimes, how about taking several text and leading classes?
