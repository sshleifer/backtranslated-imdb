There have been many films according to the same theme. A good girl needs a good boy to impress, give her and then (guess what?) she likes with him, there's a bit of fumbling followed by a line before everyone makes before the last fun ...... This has happened many times. Something I knew before I started looking. But, despite this, I had worked hard. In the right hands, and a good cast with a sharp script can still be a good way to pass several hours. This is not one of these. <br /> <br /> This was terrible. The women's leadership did not lack a charm or who was completely defeated even in the midst of me. I was not worried if he "found his man" or remained a widow and unhappy. The leader of the leader who, after a few words of wisdom, I wanted to kill. Just to remove it. I had no idea that the male sexual leadership was a way of seeing all those who know the light. Non-fictional video full of uncertain characters. none of them seemed to work, they all had more money than mind, the bride who still keeps his marriage after learning that the bride was sleeping with her best friend .... plus "I could not even have had never met" !!!!! I would like to continue but I have found that I have lost more time on this dross .... I could describe it on starting a character just to be very laughing with the name "woody" but in fact it was the only interesting thing that happened in the film.
