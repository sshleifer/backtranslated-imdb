The Fishbourne exhibition (who looks very strange in some way) and (short featured) Ed Harris is wonderful, unlike Connery who does not seem to be aware in his role and end up in the motto of an 80yr old man. In fact the screenplay doesn't mean; think about 60 minutes. The last final plot and an appendix of a sudden turn-off without any form of issues related to characters. It's more crash than screenplay and can be good for screening in screen-wrights' school. More reminds you of more details of this feeling. The capital punishment is not a matter here, although it is a matter from the beginning; it's kind of losing away without further comment. Swala and environment can be good.
