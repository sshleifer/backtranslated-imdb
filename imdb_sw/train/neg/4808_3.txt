Yes, I have seen many movies related to witches and magic but this was very clear. This movie begins like this cult of wizards led by Orson Wells very bad play the role of staring (they could not find someone who looked and acted more like Satanist) he just didn't in this movie completely. But however, the coven takes a new member and hits a doll that resembles a man and makes it a miscarrage. A woman who had a disorder with her husband to a place called Lillith for busness and a woman at the same time sees her sister's image or anyone who calls her and shows her away from there and never uses her power there or she will die. Couples after sitting down in a strange city discover that all the inhabitants are sorcerers and he has a fears and fear of all his neighbors and friends. Then the strange things begin to happen as a woman hides the burial that happens on a hill that causes a sudden (interesting) and also to see the little boy Orson Wells on playgroud that later asks a woman to help him bring her back to life. The woman recently tries to escape the city but finds herself being a dependent with the local authorities and finds herself ignoring all that the spirit is trying to warn. This movie is the same, it has time to stop but it really would do better than having Orson there.
