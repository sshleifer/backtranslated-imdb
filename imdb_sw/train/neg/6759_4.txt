Another case of a respectable DVD case that gives us film-video quality. It was not bad. Rochon performs a function that can be used by Damn! The cast is looking good. I have never seen that many people of misulibound hang together regularly. This movie wanted to make you think Rochon was a murderer, but it was not there. My biggest problem with the film was that at the end, I didn't have a lot of care who was a killer, and a real killer had little meaning, since it was out of blue and film artists thought 'ha, betcha did not see that a person coming, player! '. Yes, there were persistent mistakes (especially for the ever-changing Rochon wardrobe), but for the indie player it is not bad. I was sure that at first it was an excuse for girls to go up, but that was just a gimmick. The discussion was more thoughtful and painful. It just doesn't have great prospects that come into this, and it won't be bad. And coming to Lloyd Kaufman is very strange.
