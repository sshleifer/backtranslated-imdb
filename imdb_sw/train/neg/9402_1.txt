Why was this film done? Even reminiscent of the generous tax agreement that Australian filmmakers were given, cannot have a good explanation for this given film. By virtue, the actors beaten in this film are the celebs of Aussie b-grade (not actors, people like John Michael 'Hollywood' Howson, an original player from the port at Hey Hey her on Saturday, and the voice leader at the countdown. But to say that , this is still very much seen when you give priority to the brain that is deserving: no. Script is bad (even for personal confession of confession) and the quality of the film and the film is even worse. It is 'authenticity'. Anyone who is attracted to Australian movies, please, with God's love, pretend that this film has never been made.
