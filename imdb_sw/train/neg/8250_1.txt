I ordered movies from Korea because I had an extra in it and I was determined to see how it looked. After looking at it I can say that I am ashamed to have any part. I feel embarrassed not for myself but for everyone else who had a part in making this "comedy" complaint of the UK. From start to finish the film is predictable, stimulating, improper, pleasing and cringe worthy to the point that several times I actually looked away from the screen in dis-faith. Until you see the movie it is hard to remember how interesting it is for friendship and un-comedic. <br /> <br /> Not just a bad story, but a badly made film. In one area, you can see the operator or assistant director pointing to S.A. time to delete. I will put this description in the 'Goofs' section. Over the top side, filled with feelings (despair, anger, shame?)
