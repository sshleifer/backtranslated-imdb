This movie is quite bad. It comes with several random explosions and then reduced to the puppet of the T-Rex sock talking (!) To the audience. It goes back and forth between the puppetry of sock and animation in all, probably because the creators of the film can not afford live executives. I will prevent a long, unsuspecting, unintentional conspiracy that drives this sad video in a cruel moment 85. One of my friends found this very popular video in a hobby shop where it sells to publish b-movies, and buys for it only to enjoy it, but, as shown, their intervention was not needed. This film is more self-destructive than we could. I thought that "The 9th Plan from Outdoor websites" was a more cheese movie, but let it be for Japanamation / Lego / Sock out of it. If you see this movie anywhere, enter it without hesitation. It is very rare and most valuable, many laugh good.
