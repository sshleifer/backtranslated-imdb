Another done by a piece of TV! This is an insulting movie of the war (I use a word movie in the loosest form possible!) I thought the work of Telly Savalas was hit down the rock when he made a voice on a tour of Birmingham video video which has shown the Tarrant on the TV over half, but I forgot that he was involved in this! I tried to push into my mindless memory, but the cable television brought memory memories and shouted from me! I love little (laughs sarcastically!) in a film that claims to be a place from Liverpool in forty years, but it is obviously a shot of the Zagreb Church at the end of eight years. Also the steam train Commando's train is trained on JZ shows (Jugoslavia Zeleznice, or the Yugoslavia railway government) marked on the locomotive obviously clear, although the creators have tried to drive them out. Why is it not just a film in the UK, if so many films are installed? The cheapest, and celluloid waste!
