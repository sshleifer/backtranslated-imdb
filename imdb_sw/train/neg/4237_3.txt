JUDAAI was a brave film with Raj Kanwar at that time in 1997 when such a topic was not in the box <br /> To give him his credit he succeeds in showing how selfishness changes someone and how much one can go to get what he wants <br /> <br /> Yet the film is a romantic text, many places of ignorance <br /> <br /> A man wondering why Anil doesn't watch TV for his wife? time gets a lot Just show how poor she is? <br /> <br/> From it is well addressed but the handling is directly out of the 80's Comedy Johan- Paresh which includes here and there stands as a big finger if it is not suitable in the story /> <br /> Several interesting events / <br /> <br /> Instructions by Raj Kanwar are not enough though sometimes music music is the same but many songs seemingly forced Anil its parts well Sridevi is the best in its place Urmila is good Among other Kader Khan is as usual Johny Lever is funny, Paresh inakira Farida is a respect
