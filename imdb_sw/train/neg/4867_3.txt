Just what we need! Another remake of the cinema of the cinema harvest, with Eddie Murphy again again in his second time after Pastor NUTTY (1996)! This shows why we come from special ideas in making the best film, ladies and gentlemen! It has some of the signs of hope for its visual and interesting pictures of animals that can act and talk to human beings. Things can only get worse, unfortunately. The jokes of the bathroom with sexual references to kill a piece of "family" at once. Even parents and children saw the trailer announcement on The Family Channel, which was followed by a completely angst and disgusting movie cinema. Unfortunately this is a continuous period before the millennium, but enjoy it as it continues because things can only be worse and time. More failed by the entire new DR. DOLITTLE. It's quite a plot, feeling too flat. I also hate the voice of Chris Rock !!! We need more sound voice sounds than a group of overpaid celebs who do not want to announce bankruptcy. I will have to agree on my local newspaper to give this among the five worst movies in 1998. Then again, the original version was nothing, either. The second Murphy project can be PATTON if it doesn't care!
