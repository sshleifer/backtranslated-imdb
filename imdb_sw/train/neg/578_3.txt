This is not a good film. Acting is very surprising and powerless. The film does not seem like it is going through a real horrible way to go under the camp and kitsch way. I have never seen the first film but this did not stand up on its personal characteristics, there are several non-verbal and observer groups who do not know the importance of the female vampire leading. It is not recommended to watch
