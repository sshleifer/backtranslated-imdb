I saw this movie the first time at twelve o'clock on Saturday. In fact it's the perfect time for this. I've never, We saw a movie that was actually more predictable and punctuated by discrimination. If you want to see an exciting movie, don't look at it because you can lose a half live. However, if you want a good laughter, please see! I even bought thanks to Chuck Norris 3DVD for my fun Saturday night. What specifically hit me is that the area of ​​everything that would be expensive to make is copy-pasted from the Documentary Discovery or the old TV special in the US Army. Additionally I was surprised by the fact that they did not put a little effort in making the production real. Afghanistan is, as far as I can remember, there is no place near any sea and yet to one Deke only runs from sandy sandy sand and its aircraft ring and is considered by the submarine (probably diagnosis). Later in the movie, Deke gives us the terrorism of Islam against the wall. In a slow motion area you can see the long hair of the Korean beating the air during the beat on the wall. You liked it. I recommend you look at it with other friends and a large amount of beer though, then you will understand why I've been mad enough to use the 6.99 euro on the box.
