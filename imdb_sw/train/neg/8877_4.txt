'Major Payne' is a film about a great man who makes life in hell alive for his group of boys in marin. This film does not really have much to offer, but it provides when several hilarious ones are worth checking. Do not expect him to be an unpopular film, however. Just expect to laugh your way through the film and at the expense of other people. The struggle between Major Payne and the chubby boy were hilarious, and that's all I remember about the film except for boys who want to take revenge on Major Payne. Again, it's not a great film, and maybe you look better during rain when you need laughter.
