Some of the films that take pound have been the most beautiful - the 23th century films opened several Italian and American movies that were not clear, but though Hardgore opened Fulci films among others, the bulk of their results was like Zombie Chronicles . The only positive thing I can say about this film is that it is not close to as angry as the Stink of the Body. Other than that, its amazing film of anthology and technical skills of the Lego house built by whelk. It is known elsewhere, but you need to be concerned about the film that brings the verification of the action in the loan sequence, so when you reach the zombie attack, you have seen it all ready. The worst of bad films will have a ball looking at a continuous 18,000 error and a diabolical act of cast (especially a player, who was very bad made me a little laugh), and kudos to Hardgore for the intervention of crazy by offering a very bad version I felt like I had to look at some of the home video tour of the camp. The worst, bad things. We have done things like this when we have a camera, but common sense holds and these films appear in our cabinets somewhere. Avoid.
