This movie should be called the Need for Speed: Movie. For those who have never played games Need for Speed ​​are more about hot cars and beautiful women and almost no plot. This applies fully to Redline. The only thing about this movie that was level was the cars. The act appeared to have been forced and published, the firm was more powerful, and the plot was almost gone. I just watched this film to see how bad it was and, when it was bad, it would be worse. And at least it was entertainment. I just want them to show Eddie Griffin playing Enzo somewhere in the movie. For all, do not give, do not leave your way to see it, but if it is on Showtime or HBO and nothing else above, it is a barrier to honor.
