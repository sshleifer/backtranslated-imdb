This is a sad movie about this woman who thought that formerly loved her was probably dead, but her scientific father had just spell on her to be a very good man of shark. Kinds of Beauty and Beast. It is possible to use a football drum area and perhaps some of the singing, but there are some very beautiful plants instead. They make this pretty girl, so she empowers them to be killed by a guy-guy instead of breaking through the entire movie. A woman of a scientist is a good father who tries to reunite with her fish shark and a woman who was involved with him, even making them a personal time for sex, but this woman is a very unknown snob and she thinks shark-guy is a bad monster, icky and she doesn't nothing to do with him. He left love! Just because it was a shark! I thought it was sad how all he had to do was kissing and he could go back to normal and they would live happily at all times, but not a kind of movie.
