As some comments show, this film may be afraid of you, when you are a young child. (And that's probably all that pleases him.) like that. I'm just talking about "plot" (if you can call it). <br /> <br /> SPOILERS ahead ------------------------ <br /> I don't want to give any more damage than important (like after reading this, you still want to watch this film) but if you graduate from any school, this is just a great hatred of your mind. During this watch, I was always satisfied, because what was just happening was stupid. <br /> <br /> This includes: <br /> <br /> - The creation of UNITE (bad UN-party) / we should just believe it is bad. Is it so bad? If so: why is it wrong? <br /> - The symbol of evil in the form of tattoo <br /> -> there is no need to impose this for people, so why hell (no pun is planned) do it? Just ask for Christ with your heart just as the ministry of the mouth / hell. -> because no one, who in this movie is considered a "real Christian", does, rather than saying prayer. stupid. so ... just say the prayer before the rapture and saved - no matter what? <br /> <br /> So, review 1/10
