It did not mean a group of semi-applause and beat. That's right. For 5 minutes we see this. It is black and white shot and half tons of men and naked riding around each other with a musical instrument. It looks attractive but there is no plot and in fact - the violence that originated in this was the obstacles. Also the subject of this lesson is played but the mixing with violence is not a good idea. Other people who love gardening before they can be like this but I have seen it is unknown, confusing, stupid and (emotionally) distracting. True - what is it in all of this? I saw it as part of a concert and gay audience sitting there quietly. I wish I could go down than 1.
