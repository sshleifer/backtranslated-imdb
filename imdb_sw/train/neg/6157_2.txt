Yikes, it was one of the night's sleepless nights that I described those ways and around this movie stinker. In other names in the cast, I would like to expect the best film. I am pleased to see Oscar winner F. Murray Abraham being reduced to such a horrible part. I hope the money was worth it. And the students, they talked about the fence if they were talking about life in war or through a terrible disaster. I mean, I'm locked up, it's a fun game, but I've never been brutal. The only reason I watched this film is because the village fell under the sofa and I was too lazy to get it.
