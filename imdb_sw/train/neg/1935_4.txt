Chinese story of Ghost Ghost III is quite a completely sequel of two beautiful fantasy films. The film provides special effects on spell spelling which one can expect, but fails to pain on all borders. All vendors play too much caricatures of fraud. You should be still in the diapers in order to get humor of slapstick even with a funny laptop. The plan is predictable, and sometimes progress is similar and often decreases. To the end, the movie begins to resemble the old Godzilla movies, including special effects of copper-than-life and (well, even another) spirit and head of Godzilla. Maybe I would be surprised if I expected the camp. <br /> <br /> It is amazing to see fantasy fans who should consider - in this case because someone thinks they could get rid of a little more money out of a successful formula. They can't do it again: the silver cow is now dead as a dodo.
