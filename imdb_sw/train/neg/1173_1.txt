If I had a single camera that was suddenly hit on the floor, enough film to take just one shot, and then lost the film and had to create some bucks to buy digital tons of digital, and had to make a two-hour movie about The French Revolution, and also did not have any sets and had to have my 4-year-old child, and also the actors I found were people who did not have to do an annual opera inspections, and I also had to use any music in the entire film, and also the screening function on the camera did not work but at one time it had started to enter and could not 't stop, oh and if I hate my audience, then I might do kind of like this bad, still wrong, hilarious , worthy of hell hell. A very close view of the fake look had reminded some of the recent creation of George Lucas, which made it so desperate because through the entire movie, there was a little bit of hope behind my thought that the film would have a high level. in the petition of space / space space laser. I don't mean to destroy the movie for those who didn't see it, but that's not the end. The only thing I can think of that lost more time than watching this film was writing this review. Peace.
