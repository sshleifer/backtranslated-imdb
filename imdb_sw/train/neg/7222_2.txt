To know the comics of Enki Bilal for some time, I had to see this film. I thought this would be a good way for the artist like Bilal to broaden his art and ideas to the audience. I also thought this would be a good film to recommend, and I thought I would love to enjoy ... I was missing! Movie was a real passion for watching. The idea has potential ... but, the film leaves you a lot of ways, and basically everyone who sees this film is left to be able to do it well. I will not comment if you should see this film or not. Chances are if you read these pages that you have already seen, or that you will see - but be ready for 102 bad minutes.
