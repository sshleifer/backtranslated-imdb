What? Have I lost something here? This "Reformation" has everything that the Brookmyres's first novel had. Everything away from stories, laughter, black humor, political preference, reputation, plot, and state of mind. God is beginning to end. They made a conspiracy of the plot, had a love between Parablane and a soldier, and what it was about, Dr Slaughter was shown as a man standing, and who was Jahanne was Annette Crosby thinks that? It seems like they had done the three-hour efficiency, then up to 90 minutes. (Though 90 minutes seemed to last forever.) Please, please do not do so for other books of Brookmyres, (especially "Blind Country.")
