I admit I did not finish this film because it was so extraordinary stupid and not worth watching. I watched it with a room filled with children, who also did not laugh with humor and humor. Director, Bob Dolman, appears to have been very busy with sphincters and genitalia that are increasingly the real story I had. NOT A FILM WORD OF KIDS! In addition to the fact that these content is non-standard, the movie is just stupid has a bad flow and does not mind behind it. It is losing a very good story. If you are reading a book when you were young and loved it, then don't waste your time watching a film that makes it so bad that it makes you angry. Buy your children book instead.
