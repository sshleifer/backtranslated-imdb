Film, the release of Universal production of Protelco-MLC, is to overtake the boring theory of breaking the molecular structure of the object, taking it into the cell as "clean energy," and then sending it again to complete the "target area." is important, but Professor Paul Steiner (played by Bryant Haliday actress, "Devil Doll") thinks it is a volunteer, and Patalia (his assistant), Mary Peach and Chris Mitchell (Ronald Allen), lives. During the test before identifying Dutch scientist "Lembach" (Gordon Heinz), his machine fails because of damage, so he "has described" by his delegate, Sheila (Tracey Crisp) to take revenge. Of course, he fastens and comes out looking like "pork" and strong for lightning people. With this new power available, he can produce some Cockney fighters, a security man named Latham (Derrick de Marney) and his laboratory manager, Dr. Blanchard (Norman Woodland). He can also enter the pharmacy and steal a pair of rubber gloves and a black coat, too. But in the end, however, despite the attempt of Hill and Mitchell to help him, the clown destroys his equipment and himself. In general, the movie is completely useless without any messages. One of the most popular films is sad.
