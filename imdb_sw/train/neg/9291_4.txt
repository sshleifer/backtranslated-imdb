I can't believe that none of the official reviews of this movie warns people that it has two exciting events of sexual abuse. It is as if our culture accepts this kind of behavior but not just violence. My biggest problem with the cinema is that it does not seem to judge these attacks - as is the case, a woman who is constantly abused and pressured never accepts men responsible for their actions, and no one else. One person has been stopped to complete the attack when someone gives a dagger to him, but he is just punished with "you can't force a woman to love you" instead of "you should not force a woman to have sex, you try" ... a woman's view, the movie is allowed. It is a kind of "cast bone" for women to enable them to become skilled fighters and leaders, but the movie is described more by romance - which understands the idea that human humanity must involve power imbalances, and men dominating the woman loves. A military military fighter does not use any fighting skills to try to defend his attackers. He never will make them apologize - instead, SHE seems to apologize. In general, a repressive and interesting movie, with cinematic movies and some anti-cool pictures, but it is not the same as the hero for a long shot.
