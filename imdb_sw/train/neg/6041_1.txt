This story about three women is a very good study about: Muriël (Charlotte Van Den Eynde) a little, Laura (Els Dottermans) who is about 37 and Martha (Frieda Pittors) an older man of Muriël. They live together in one building. They have different expectations of life. Laura's key wants a child. Muriël comes from the village and wants to change his life in Brussels. Martha dreamed of her youth when she was a little girl. In fact there is nothing happening in this film so that you can wait for something - to accidental events - which can simulate this story. While it goes, you find that director Dorothée Van Den Berghe only wants to create a physiological image of three women and no more. This film is frustrating because you expect women to learn from their experience that is not so, so one is left with a sense of weakness.
