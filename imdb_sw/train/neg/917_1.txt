This film was done with a very bad taste. Script was very bad. I feel very sad for the late Gregory Peck who took the position of this title to the B's one of the greatest historians. The movie was incorrect and inaccurate to those who fought the Japanese in World War. There was a scene where I almost vomited, showed Macarthur in the bunker on the island of Corregidor talking to a soldier like a safe politician when he comes across the injured, a Filipino green soldier. A soldier who is dying and dying can sit directly on the head and say: "No pope, no mother, no uncle 's and Macarthur offers a few discussions that Americans can't stop" Philippines. I mean if there is a more active area that shows the United Nations as a good world savior please tell me for this reason it takes a cake. With openness and intention to cover the contribution of the members of the USFFE (United Nations Far East), these are Filipino volunteers who were united in the US army during World War 2, who died together with Americans they are fighting the Japanese, who walked along with Americans in the Bataan death march and protecting The Corregidor is the cause of the guerilla attack after Macarthur left Australia and his famous speech 'I will return'. My late brother, the Filipino world war 2 war and the USAFFE regime was one of the many who fought Japanese with respect and love for the home country. I think this movie does not respect them and for thousands of other tribes who relied on mental preparation for its popular return to the Leyte Gulf region.
