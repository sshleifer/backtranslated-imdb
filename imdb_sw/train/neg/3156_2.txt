I want to do one thing clear- I love Michael Vartan! But this film dismisses it. His acting is still very good, still as charming, and still looks good. But the film itself is a lot of waste! Natasha Henstridge, Sorry to say, comes on manly ... you always wait for him to run with his best friend, who own a small story-story is a little weird. I and my family (who sat and watched the film with me) were also evicted by the sound of the film; sometimes music was not good and what's going on in events. However, even this was not the worst part of what I saw was a desperate film. I could forgive a leading female player, I could forgive the freakish characters who were thrown into the mixture, and I could forgive the non-tracking music choice, but which was to choose to cut the middle part of the film and skip straight to the end? The end was planned from the beginning but how you get there is left unnoticed. If you are a fan of Michael Vartan you are running this movie: place a poster instead.
