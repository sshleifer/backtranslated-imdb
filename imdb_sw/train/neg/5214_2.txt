METAMORPHOSIS I work on my way through the Classic Chilling 50 Collection Pack and METAMORPHOSIS is the seventh movie in the set. Released in 1990, METAMORPHOSIS seems to be the remake of the "Vampire Age of Atom," which also showed the scientist struggling with the same results. Setting in modern times, METAMORPHSIS is not my type of awesome movie. The university researcher works to lose the human genome to create a serum that would prevent aging. He was forced by the government to publish his newspapers; and, giving certain results (or risk of losing money), the scientist decides to use himself as a pig in Guinea! When you first think that it had no adverse effect, finally knows that serum actually has done it in an unexpected way! <br /> <br /> Act is off; and, the exhibition left me with a very low interest in the film. Circles around it. And, science behind the experiments and their results are not only fraud; it's amazing; is ignorance? for the best. <br /> <br /> As others realized, the end turns out to be a gag of 30+ minutes, which seems endless. Without giving away, I would say this, "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde meet the Creature from Black Lagoon meets only Home."
