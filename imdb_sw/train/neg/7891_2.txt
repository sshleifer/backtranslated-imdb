The summary of the IMDb strategy will not explain the meaning of this film. It should be read 'Be ready to engage in the prison of 3 pew from the back of your family's church at the age of 8, listen to the preacher playing on God's will at all times you can think of returning to your Lego' home. <br /> <br /> It starts well with good intentions, creating a fantasy to plant some real and surreal signals such as Renny 'how to cut on my finger to heal faster? 'time. Then it slowly goes to the Christian concept, offering its absolute conspiracy in the washing of evangelism - if it is beaten. I believe I calculated the use of the word 'pray' 53 times in the next five minutes. After 31 years, I tried to deviate from the word's word, 'prey'. Sadly, this limited game of my mind made the film at least carry for the last 20 minutes. Plus it made me laugh when each character could say 'prayer' ('preyer' to me) if it was completely zany. In fact, even my Catholic wife stood on her seat from the weight, almost to the floor. To all Christians who reject this film who have posted this 8-10 star, your theological standards like Circular Circles, Ten Commandments, nothing from Narnia, Jesus Christ Superstar and so on. Drop off the more physiological challenges in films such as Jesus Camp, God who did not exist, Would Jesus buy, or will soon be given Courage. It is possible that Robert Whitlow's book is the best.
