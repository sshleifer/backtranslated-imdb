Several brides are killed at the time of the altar, and later their bodies are stolen on the morgue road. The journalist Patricia Hunter decides to investigate these genocide. He knows that right before each ceremony, the bride was given a rare orchid (thought from the mother-in-law) that had strong drugs that had overcome them. Patricia is told that orchid grew first by Dr Lorenz, who lives in real estate, and his wife. In fact, Dr. Lorenz is responsible for crime, by putting the grandmother in a suspended position, and using her thyroid water to keep his wife forever. Patricia, along with Dr Foster (who works with Dr. Lorenz on a medical treat around his wife) try to support Dr. Dr. Lorenz for establishing a phony wedding, which eventually leads Patricia to a mad doctor. This film had a very good opening key, but it basically ended with too many restrictions and other weak objects. Sent is decent, Walters and Coffin deserve better, but that's life. Russell steals the show (even outside of the Lugosi-hamgo who does not give one of his most memorable performances, even considering his monograms) as Countess Lorenz play the role and character of many stereotypical features of many of today's Hollywood prima donnas. You were weak and you ended up too. Testing, according to B, 4 films.
