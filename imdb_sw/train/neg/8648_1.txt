Well, basically, the blows of the film! It's a witch of Blair meets a fantastic pregnancy of Sean Penn about going to Iraq to show the world what "War on Terrorism" is true. Script looks like it was written by the 8th farmer (no mistake for 8 graders); two actors on-doing the whole film; they used the worst forms of cameras and bad type of film (not that I know anything about these things - but it didn't look like the real memory I looked at), and the worst of all Christian Johnson took a big idea to do. It reminds me when I tried to draw a picture of my dog ​​and ended up with a very bad figure of a stick looking at something that looked like a big turd. I would like to look at Blair VIII Magician, than to go through again.
