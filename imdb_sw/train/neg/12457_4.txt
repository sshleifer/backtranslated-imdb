It seems that Salvatores could not decide what to do with this film: some of these are very weak (and I say very, very weak), some of them are an attempt to explore relations between the main characters. All things were tested in psychological stimulation, but in this case the movie can not hold objects, because of the poor, high scripting, bad acting and very black, and very lightweight movies. I would like to say that Salvatores offered the best in other forms and in other circumstances, where he was free to watch the characters without thinking about the plot. In general, movie B, not suitable for your money ... Vote: 4/10
