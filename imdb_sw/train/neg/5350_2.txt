Yes, talk about bad sequels. Rick Moranis stars in this rough sequel of three-once-funny-and-entertaining "Honey I Shrunk the Kids". The concept basically has the same way as the first film, but with adults instead of children decreasing and domestic houses instead of the garden as a exploration world. If you think this looks interesting, think again. The movie is the best boring, less less shameful. First, the continuous series has been completely flushed under the toilet. The only remaining player of the first movie appears Rick Moranis. The wife's play has changed, the actors playing children have changed, those who play neighbors have changed ... I call it. They are trying to make us believe this is one family, but the result is amazing to say the least. Second, the story is the first rehash, and not one of the original. All minorities (and nothing) and the risk factors presented to the films are copied directly from "Honey I Left Children". <br /> <br /> Third problem, special effects. I am sure this has been done on a small budget, but it is uncomfortable, the worst way than what appears in the series. You should be happy to be afraid of these small statistics to explore the great local area, but perhaps you will live a long time. <br /> <br /> The fourth problem, getting a step inside the house is just boring. Few things happen, and when they happen, they are not very exciting. The first movie was exciting because children were dealing with nature, grass, and bugs who live in it. In this, adults (who come as a sick, compared with children) dealing with dust, cock and trap. What? I do not know why the idea of ​​the series of series in the series has already called on the Disney actors, but perhaps because they needed money in without spending five minutes thinking about something new. I warn you: leave this waste-garbage waste that should remain: find dust on the store shelf.
