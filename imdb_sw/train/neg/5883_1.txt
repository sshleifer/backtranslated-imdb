This movie has no fun for anyone who has lived with a family member who has mental illness. Many events also reminded me of my life experience. This movie was a man version of "Mommy Dearest." It shows all the pictures and the accuracy of the lives of many children of the mental illness parents. It also shows how easy for a psychologist to be corrupt and act as they are God. Someone said it was funny. No way, I say! It is the humor of the best patients. <br /> <br /> The movie is very strong and sad that my child and I had to leave the room. The best use for this film is for people who do not understand mental illness or do not believe our family.
