The idea of ​​Sarafina seems to be one of the sounds, which is far from the music perspective. It seeks to combine African music with a story describing the bad situation and the environment in which black people had to endure when the film was made. The breach of each of the two components is very good and the film is never suitable to quickly change between fun and fear. If it was a reflection of these situations it might be a good film, however the scenarios of school children are shot and soldiers are not very good around the songs. In addition to the worst cluster terms acting is not good, Goldberg offers abnormal performance such as the remainder of the cast. Generally disappointed. <br /> <br /> 3/10
