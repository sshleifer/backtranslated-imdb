When I was younger, I loved this show, but now ... BLECCH !!! This show is sappy, written badly, and not back to funny. The three leaders were all good actors and the beautiful men (the Saget stand was better than these showings came, as it was the best Couline to stand up, and Stamos was better than the average actor). Over time, Stamos wanted to off the show because he wanted to do more big things (who could blame him?). It was finally canceled when most participants claimed more money. Here are a few things that make me do things on the show: <br /> <br /> 1. The words of catch - How often one person can hold words that reject such as 'how bad' ',' you got ',' nerdbomber ',' cut 'and' compassion 'in 24 hours? Kimmy Gibler - The most bad character written on television. <br /> <br /> 3. Write-stale and mention as an oreo cookie. There are good text selected and bad text selected. The perfect house had a bad writing set. Three men living together in San Francisco- Enough said. <br /> <br /> 5. False things - Too much to remember. Children-oriented children had the most recent fashions and you can see the recording posters that can enter. <br /> <br /> Now this show is on Nick @ Nite. I would call them classic. I have nothing wrong to say about the people involved since I think most of them are talented for their own right. But this show was just sweet sugar, I couldn't stand after a while.
