Looking for the first on the cover of this picture, it looks like a good movie rock n roll. But do not let your foolish cover, or the fact that Alice Cooper and Blondie in it. The story of the story is just awesome, and so it is acting. Similar to simple: BAD <br /> <br /> It's not a movie about roadie, it's just a thin story of love, so it's very bad to see it that way. The only thing about this movie, is the sound of a voice. , and a girl who plays groupie is not looking good! This movie was a great disappointment to me, because it makes many good promises.
