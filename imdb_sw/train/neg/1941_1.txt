I can't believe that I lost five hours of my life on this trash. The five-day offering and this writer was very interesting and I looked forward to this. But many conversations were not quite clear. Suranne Jones was the chief offender since he sounded round or gabbled his line, but most of the cast followed his example. Far different were Bernard Hill and Anne Reid, aged whose diction was a model. Does the producers not listen to the pre-advertised production to ensure that the discussion appears? As a result I think I have lost a track of what went on, and since the line of natural origin seemed to have a metamorphose within their standard-and-us among Muslims and others I soon lost interest. The latter was perfect to combat the peak. Dud full.
