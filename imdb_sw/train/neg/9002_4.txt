Okay .... I have just 3 words - cheesy, cheesy and CHEESY! The only feature of the release of this movie is Dean Cain. Other than it - it's CHEESEBALL SUPREME !!!! The movie has some promises in the concept - the underground laboratory creates a real fire breathing dragon - essentially throwing over the "Jurassic Park" meets "The Leadership of Fire" ..... There are some possibilities, but they don't follow through. .. Specific effects are of respect - even if you know the dragon is CGI, it shouldn't look like the CGI .... It is not worth it to blame Dean Cain (though he is one of the producers), I would like to blame more on Phillip Roth - director and author. It is HIS work to make this film .... and, unfortunately, failed.
