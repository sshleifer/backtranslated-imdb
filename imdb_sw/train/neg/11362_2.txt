"Fly Me To The Moon" must be the worst animated film I have seen in a long time. That says something since I've taken my baby to see every animation for the last 4 years now. The story is to be generous ... trite. Sounds to work are sad, It looks very good. Humor is a kind of Romper room. Animation is passed to the cartoon type of Nickolodeon but this is released on a large screen not a cable television. It gets only 2 because of 3-D similar images. Some of the events were mildly tempered but we have seen it better in the past. I also encourage the insistence of the creators of the film to have characters flying away from the screens instead of entering many events. Although this is surprising for the first time it has been strong after 3 or 4 times. <br /> <br /> I'll tell you this though, It had a good voice sound. And for my son's record was not also things about it either. Bad movies.
