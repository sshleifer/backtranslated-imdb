It grows worse, the series is on a sharp drop. The first first line was accepted and since then we have seen buch of real, awesome movies. Robert Englund gives another good performance like Freddy but the rest can't do. The story is Alice, after living in the preliminary phase of the Nightmare series, gets a bad dream of Freddy Krueger from another time. At this time, a manslayer is attracted to the sleep of the unborn child. His intention is to be "born again" in the real world. The only person who can stop Freddy is his dead mother, but Alice can give up her spirit when saving her own son? See the first three, miss the next three then watch the last.
