This film was a disaster from the beginning to the end. Interspersed and exhibitions from "next generation of good lost" are interviews with Bono and The Edge as well as the artists themselves. This leaves a short time for the part of Leonard Cohen himself, who puts on everyone else in the film and his gentleness but gentle, wisdom and humor. All others are very busy trying to make him as a stoner like St. Leonard or as an Old Testament prophet. Many exhibitions can forget about the translation (especially Rufus & Martha Wainright) or less than bland achievements. Beth Orton and Anthony alone got away from Leonard's versions using a little barrier. Pseudo-avant-garde signals are disturbed in all films â€” like out of the direction of red color parameters on most of the spectacles and interviews, the most advanced camera function, the use of sound delay in some of Leonard Cohen's views (making it difficult to hear what is being said) and spooky, the illusion under the drone under a lot of interviews (attempt to add gravitas?). For the real thing, see the Songs from the Document Life produced by the BBC in 1988.
