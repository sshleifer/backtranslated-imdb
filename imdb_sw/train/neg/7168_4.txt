The author had a very good idea of ​​the story, but many mistakes in the implementation of the plot took away from the film to make it unknown.

Only humans "show" in the garden during the stormy night (at a very good time, can I add)? All in all was not "bad". I scored 4, according to the story and talent of Alison Elliott.
