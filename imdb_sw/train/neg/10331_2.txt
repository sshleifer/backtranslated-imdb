God, I was exhausted from my head when I saw this test. I was expecting a lot from them, for I am a big fan of James Cameron (and not just since the "Titanic", I can add), and his name in credit that I thought would be a guarantee of quality (Then again, also wrote wonderful days of Leaden ..). But this was surprising at any time of almost two hours of time. During all that time, it was difficult to pass beyond his two-line line, and I would be very hard trying to try any kind of plot to focus out on all the chaos that went anywhere. On top of that, I don't think the accidents of acrobatics even out of any part of the "A-Team" normal. For the news of Alba, yes, he is good, of course, but the fact that he only reflects one of the facial expression to the entire movie (pouty and surly), makes me also get bored for "gal wit character" schtick pretty soon. You can count me out of this, Mr. Cameron!
