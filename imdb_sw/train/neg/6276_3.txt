DOKA is part of the After Dark Horrorfest III. Not slasher or filled with gore. Glass mirrors and broken mirrors in this religious excitement from France and the author / director Sean Ellis. Radiology of success Gina McVay (Lena Headly) inters the amazing world as her life seems to have a strong control. When attending the birthday party of his father (Richard Jenkins), visitors are surprised when the glass falls on the floor because there is no clear. Things get very strange when she sees a woman who is photographing her own car in London's car in a similar car. Gina has gone to the doppelganger apartment and finds a picture of herself and her father. He drives away and deals with the head of the collision. Then her secret partner is not the same; that real family and friends are not easy to believe. Is Gina next to himself? Is he in the same world? His practice of being worse ... is he broken? <br /> <br /> Kudos if you can think this out ... it will not be easy. Editing cannot be difficult. Lights are worried. Other players: Melvil Poupard, William Armstrong, Michelle Duncan and Ulrich Thomsen.
