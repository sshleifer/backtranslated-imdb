With these people who make a lot of shots, using old photos, and gass animals to drive them out, not to mention that some of the events took place in a set by administrators, what does it believe? The former film is good, but the animal abuse and destruction of the locals are painful to watch in these films. I know, racism is the same in these old films, but there is more that make these couples lose trust. It was shown as a bird, they did not fly their plane, Martin Johnson was a former veudevillian, he used friends like Jack London for a financial advantage while urging the luggage, rejecting his wife's depression, using him as a good player, all of which makes these films more effective. They were not the first to travel to these countries, or the first to write about them. He was the same as a film manufacturer and photographer, but that's about it.
