I had great hope for this film. I thought an interesting premise. I came that way, although I have been acting, except Helena Bonham Carter, odd. I continued to expect my lost time without paying, but at the end I was left to ask why even they failed to do this. Perhaps in the George Orwell version there is a message needed to send. If this film is complete, it helped me to read the classic Orwell. I find it hard to believe his story can be like despair like this. If the songwriter's message is "normal life to live", then they have succeeded. I would like to recommend this film to anyone; 101 minutes of my life have been lost.
