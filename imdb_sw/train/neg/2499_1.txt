The release of this film is some of the best New Zealander actors, many of whom I have seen in the mysterious roles, this film even fills me with deep shame from one country like them. American fake errors are the first sign that these things are about to appear wrong. As other replacement adjustments noted the luxury passenger ship is actually the old car ferry, adorned with a few of the most stolen flags from a lot used car. Many of the cast seem to be from (large) long walk New Zealand Soap Shortland Street. It's like this film was coming to the shortland of Christmas, the result of many gins, and maybe a bit of salmonella. Imagine "Under the siege" meets the "Boat Boat", organized by your primary and primary school and autistic and get the idea. <br /> <br /> If you are an actor, I recommend to see this film, as research on how to destroy your guardian.
