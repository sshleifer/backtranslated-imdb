no doubts in this serial! When one part ends the acting is shoddy, the effects are poor and the script is so bad that the last thing in your mind is how Batman and Robin will save you a day. No, in fact, the last thing in your mind is to look at the next section! This show is so exciting that I can't see how it has been done, don't leave it alone on DVD! It is obvious that the effects are not made with modern movie Batman, but even the script is bad. Unpleasant chaos about one professor with a rifle or something like that, I don't know at all, because it is too bad to follow. See the 60th edition, or 90 versions, or even Batman When it starts, just anything on this version!
