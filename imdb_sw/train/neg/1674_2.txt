The cluster was exciting, but sadly this film does not do any justice. The search was quite good, and it was shot well - but stylistically a lot of direction was not the same (overstylized rapid editing has been done that there is no effect .... I waited Steven Bochco run in credits followed by business), the characters were identified only by the coke usage The screens (and everything big left on Boogie Nights for character development), and no characters have the ability to draw the viewer into the story. A very forgotten film.
