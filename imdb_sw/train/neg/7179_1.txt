It does not matter what the "message" is - this film is overpowered - the worst act, the function of the limping camera - I don't know why Carr agreed to try and eliminate the stutter - he is lousy there. You look at the other on the DVD and how he has the camera to follow him closely - he just puts it - he likes to be a center of attention. He is a good actor - he reminds me of another proud movie player - Eric Schaffer. Some of the Carr has had this film shown in the Youth Churches and the New Age Churches - where demolished people are struggling to strengthen and strive themselves on how the film has touched them and perhaps did - but if the film itself is choppy, predictable and sappy.
