Ursula Andress' body naked is one of the things that make you believe in God. Two other women (especially those who play a maid) have good bodies too. Why is the top grade that I can give film with quality and quantity of just 3 out of 10? Because, to the incredible Ursula body, we should sit in a very unpopular and interesting film (keep in mind that I watched the full 101 minute, not the 78th minute of America that might reduce a lot of outdoor equipment). In the Italian-comedy culture, many of the characters are exaggerated caricatures (freak army, "latin partner", a regular drunk, girl widow) that is not funny, just overacted. The last word: see this, but put your finger on the fast-forward button, you will need. (*)
