Drones, tribal race, bad pipes of synthesizer, children sing. Reflect more on the "world music" considered. This is a tourist film, and one of the lasa. What really kills is an excessive system. India, Egypt, South America, Africa, etc., etc. No change, there is no definition of seeing why we are suddenly ten thousand miles away, no ideas made in the picture. Only a group of third-party developers and "baskets on their heads" as another expert said. Walking together as long as that had some deep meaning. If these people wanted to make a video of the World Music 3, they all had to do it was the head of a hundred miles south south where the best part of Koya was shot, and films in Mexico. That would be the best environment for "life in change." <br /> <br /> But no. They decided on a tourist trip made by half the world with shots of more closed filters. The only thing to recommend this film is that it does not hate it as Naqoyqatsi. RFJ
