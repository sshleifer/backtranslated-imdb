There is this reason that goes straight to the video - the story is good, Nick Cage plays Johnny through the worst - sex in churches, and other scenes that up to the worst (if the scene in the laundry room) cancel this movie. Judge Reinhold as buckold is the same- but the movie itself with its destructive themes and revenge is not correct. But it is a good film of trivia competition - because few people saw it.
