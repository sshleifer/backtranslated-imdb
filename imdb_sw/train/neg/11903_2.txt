Wenders were big and $ Million Hotel. I don't know how it came with this film! The idea of ​​giving the situation after spt11 and the view of the American Society is optimistic, which makes 2 out of ten. But this is not a movie. For the best man can do with a great idea (clash west-east) There are important things happening in the Middle East and are offered only on the MAC screen for the American girl's fingers who are actually at the level of ignorance (because she is just ignorant about reality). And the most important thing is the idea that is offered to religion is somehow bothering me. At the last place Lana says to allow the stability and try to hear. And the back music says "... I'm going to ask" something not about religion. So it ends with this. How you will see the truth if you are close to your eyes and pray. Lights have been shining on the truth.It is just that no one wants to see it. ps: "My house is not a place. This people" The only thing that gets 10 out of 10 is that sentence. So it's going back to making this film. (by the way, if the "person" is mentioned below, America is the best young man is not the best, it is "poor" and "hopeless" who register for the army requiring sufficient payment that is not provided by the government!)
