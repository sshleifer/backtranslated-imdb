I watched this film because I love Nicolas Cage and well, I found it strange and useless ... so I decided to go around a little bit and get my hands on a 70s copy. Wow. it's different. One of the first was the best way. I would like you all to know that previously it made a statement, their existence had a purpose. In fact it was a Christian public demonstrating their pagan fear. If you are in it it also gives a comment on life but I don't want to go in details, just, just put it, if you were desperate and would like to know what you should look like, feel free to look at the 70s version, dated a bit, but the best.
