I am going to say this was the worst gay movie I have ever seen, but I can honestly say this is a bad film like any kind I have seen. You know you 'we have trouble when the movie starts with “personal information” from the Director, asking for “understanding” of listeners for “many challenges” that are facing the first time Director. The radio list is very bad in many pictures is hard to follow the conversation, and this from the DVD version. Bad lights, bad sets, bad pictures, poor script, generally bad to act every add up to make this "film" unknown. I did this at the end of a bad trial after several attempts, and I immediately released a DVD that was purchased for folly. I am sure there are many challenges facing the Director of the first time. But, don't try to dig this attempt to ignore it as a finished product. I see from the IMD statement that this was not just an attempt by Richard Natale's first attempt, but also for itself. That's the best thing I can say about the "movie".
