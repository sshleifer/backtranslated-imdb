First of all, this film can be divided into three categories. The promised revelation, along with refugees of horsemen and Cheyenne. This is followed by what can only be described as part of the long-term boring, with the muscles of Candice Bergen completely and "Blue soldiers" to travel together to secure the prison security of the Army. Miss Bergen offers inappropriate words of letters every time she opens her mouth, and it looks like she left out of the movie Jack Nicholson of the 1970s. The third and final part involves the complete slaughter of the Indian village. This is definitely passed on the set on the anti-war propaganda, that comes as long, angry, and generated. Not recommended. - MERK ................................ Jacobe (comment on) Here is an idea. Why do you watch the film you witness, instead of singing your free voice. This is not a political website, it is by exploring the film. - MERK
