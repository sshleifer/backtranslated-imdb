I wondered why John Wood was not playing Dr Falken until I watched the film. BAD BAD, bad science, bad acting and generally bad films. Please don't see this film. Use the original "War War" if you feel nostalgic. I do not like to be beaten with a conspiracy to strike the idea of ​​a terrorist attack either. In the first film W.O.P.R was developed because Russia had about 1,000 U.S.A. In this film the idea behind the computer is to kill a terrorist in training before being a threat. Politics aside, one of the good things about the first film was to show that even a stupid computer could understand the idea of ​​a war at the end. There is no such insight given in this film.
