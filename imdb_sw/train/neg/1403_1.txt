Very bad films! Nothing happens. There are no ghosts, no trains, no secrets, no interest. Regular BRUTAL attempt to comedy is painful. Everything else. Cluster is idiotic: a group of people hit in the middle of no-place, because their trains were held for less than 3 minutes. And the railways leave them a place to stay, in a severe storm? I don't think. Oh, they can walk 4 miles in the fields of the dead. um, yes. Certainly. Or, they can deal with the hospitality of the rail, and stay at the 'haunted train station'. The station that was not found to be anything except GIVING, completely without ghosts, interests, or conspiracy. It is so bad that this seems impossible. <br /> <br /> This should be added to the LOST FILMS list! aargh !!
