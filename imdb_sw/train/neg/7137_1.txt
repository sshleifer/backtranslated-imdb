Cars in this film are amazing. Acting in this film is bad. The plot and operation of the plot is not good for the mind and it is the same. If you are very worried by movies where someone changes and suddenly goes to ridiculously speed, put yourself in trouble with money. Good movie for fans of racing? Well, there is a place where they make a mistake to mention NASCAR driver as a driver of a rally car. If you can't explain the difference, visit the look, you will have an explosion. In fact it comes down to this, there are very good cars in this film, run by evil and are not quite available. Acting is especially frightening because of a very serious plot. If you want to see girls hot, walk mtv or vh1 instead. I am disappointed that these good cars would be represented in such a bad film. If the automotive class compared the film, they should be running with broken bicycles.
