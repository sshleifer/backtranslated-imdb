I don't know why this film was declared wild wild, quirky, filled with laughter. There is not much in this film that will be interesting, nor does it get the moviegoer. Annette Bening (who works as Oscar deserves) comes here as a collaborator, and his performance seems like normal. Brian Cox's character combines with irritating, and leading to play Augusten ?? Joseph Cross? it seems that he had no personality to carry his responsibility. The best thing about the film is Evan Rachel Wood, but it is not enough to approve this interesting, inappropriate film. The film was quickly lost and it seems for good reason. I have seen some of the incredible events (Brian Cox and his only toilets who use the worst scores of 'You and I and everyone we know' and 'Squid and Whale'), some embarrassment, and many of them are unsettling. I saw all the experience losing time. Don't waste your time?
