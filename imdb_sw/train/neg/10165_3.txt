San Francisco is a big city with good reputation. In this one, the artists did not attempt to use the city. They did not even set up basic basic information. So I don't recommend anyone because of being a movie of San Francisco. You can't think "oh, I've been," you will be thinking "two stories of hot / stinky armpit have turned out in the speech of a quiet hotel?" Some titles used in Eastern and Eastern speech styles. It prohibits, but acting was always able. The stories were seen to be beaten with three different styles, at least at the beginning. Chinatown's story was more effective and interesting. The program is weak, broken down for the area from the local Hong Kong movies. Previously there were more tension and emotional resonance, they were prepared and developed well. But acting is fun and we see James Hong and other light objects. <br /> <br /> The white intro boy had no meaning. I think the filmmakers do not know what to do and so, then they left it open and wiped out. Father is an unusual attempt in the independence of Berkeley - in fact, people, everyone knows not "groovy" to live in the ghetto - but its groups are more exciting. They lost a good chance. To be educated and exciting on the West Coast, jupk here is a different type of yuppie boil than to do in New York. They are the same as fail but they always benefit. That would be interesting; this was not. <br /> <br /> Introduction Point Point of Hunter was more ambitious. It was more than three derivative, and stylistically far more from San Francisco. You have seen it done before and you have seen it done well. Even the video game was better! Though it is not natural and unnecessary script, these characters have the ability, artists have talent, and something interesting is starting to force its way around the focus of attention ... about ten minutes before finishing. A good idea is put into the wrong hands. <br /> <br /> PS, there are a few who were here, see if you can understand one.
