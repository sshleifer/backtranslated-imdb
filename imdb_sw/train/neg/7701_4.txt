The previous version was better. They should be left for good information. This movie killed the whole idea. It was interesting, more interesting, and the beautiful places were very far from creating a slack. This movie seemed like trying a very difficult way to be bad, and that was definitely not what I wanted from this good. Not to mention, that for a long time had caused it to be repeated. So, sorry, Tyler Perry, but try for the next time. This film is only kinda, and not funny either. Sorry. Star 4/10 is. Jay Addison
