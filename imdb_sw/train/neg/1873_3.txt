YOU WANT TO WANT! Let's be glad that Parker Posey is a real actor, and not just getting into the "quirk of the new club" of the actors. True, unless this means that the language-and-cheek satire on David Mamet - terse, the confusing dialog presented alternately in the machine guns quickly or monotone (think Ben Stein) blandness - or flat out dry comedy; This film should be in the run of the Rotten --- or worse. <br /> <br /> Like as hard and posey is not enough, we have been worried and even more concerned Jeff Goldblum. There is more wood in this film than a dental factory. Adding this amazing work already, it is a lot of other tasks, based on the forgetful actors, who watch or sound as refugees from the American Top Model, Don Pardo, or even a child, who speaks the word ". has been "like" beans, which only refers to the fact that there is very little about this film, we are investigating its emphasis on whether it is Canada or not !! I think I laughed at the places that should be great, and take a big part that has a sense of humor. Even the sound of sounds appears as a music caricature of Alarik Jans for the "House of Sports" of Mamet. If taken as a spoof, the film is close to trouble; if taken seriously, just a piece of consciousness of drek.
