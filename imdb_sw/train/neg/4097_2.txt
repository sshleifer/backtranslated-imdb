The bad news is still terrible. I gave it 2 because sometimes some of this kitchy identification appears to be interesting. It should be better than "Mulva, Zombie Ass Kicker", and development should be funded. Or maybe I was drinking too much when I looked at it and felt generous. Anything, "2" is. <br /> <br /> Maybe the best thing about this film is that on the fastest. It takes elements from many important themes to Kill Without I & II and to combat events, destroy them, drive them down, lose dialogue, and spend the whole mess in one hour of real video. <br /> <br /> You would like to smoke a lot of power if you want to enjoy this. And get this DVD on a video store at a time! You will hate yourself if you pay late fees.
