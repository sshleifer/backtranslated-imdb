SPOILERS (IN TURNING TO DO IN TWO SECONDS OF THE MOVIE) \ t emotional Sy. He makes man so much, even with a psychological sense, and he is completely lost in character - there is not a very small one for an executive who can recognize. Neither the worst of the film is the same as it is. Support (and artists) will not look at the primary porno location (it is not appropriate that every character but Sy is 100% card). Sometimes, the director actually seems to be trying to destroy concerns: we know from the first time a) that Sy is a perfect job, b) lives, and c) that gets nabbed in the end. Therefore, all who are left to reflect on how and why, and the answers given are not all interesting. <br /> <br /> The program is plodding and uprived, and has a nonsensical short time (for example, the husband filters his wife for his expensive taste, though he seems to spend all his free time in a discount discount discount). About two-thirds of the way, Sy does something that will not be so ridiculous that it is amazing how much he cares about his great retaliatory plan. With the last commentary of his psychology, out of 'Peeping Tom,' is a terrible shape. The talk is of the worst kind. Not upgraded, or odd, or adequate, or bad in any other way that can be considered fun, even for filmmakers. Instead, each line is unique, the task of hiding - it's like the director gave a plot of conspiracy to the newspaper writer and said, 'Hey, I need a suitable script on this - for an hour. 'It made me cry, honestly. This game seems to be a loss of the renowned support-of-ninety-nine-year-old (`Hand-bearing ', for example), and when indeed it is not good, it has never been scary. Fetishism of Sy often makes you feel uncomfortable, but it's not enough to make the film work. In the end, the lack of crafts from everyone involved, but Robin Williams, is trying this. 3 out of 10.
