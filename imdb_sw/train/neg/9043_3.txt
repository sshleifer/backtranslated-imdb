I went to see this with my wife and the child of 3 years. He seemed to be as much more than my wife and me. Writing is amazing poor for pixar / Disney excursion. In fact, I had a very difficult time considering all the time. The movie looks amazing but the story becomes just a weird and long wind that I was hoping my baby would sleep in so that I could pick him up and walk out. It is not to say that the film is' t interesting concept, it has been told so odd, (the bad screenplay?) especially when “meet family” for the first time. I know we should get the feeling that the family is wacky but a good master, they could shorten the sequence for 15 minutes good (apparently, I've never done it). At that time I was playing my head looking for leave.
