Nothing in this film is funny. I thought the premise, to give the man the libido of the sheep, was interesting and should give some laugh. WRONG! There is nothing amazing about the movie. For example, the main character of passing the goat in the middle of the garden yard is not pleasing, it is bounds on dirt. They are around and sex in this film for one level, and not just funny. <br /> <br /> We all know that dogs will eat anything, anywhere, anytime. The protagonist does this for everything, everywhere, every time also not funny. It becomes cliche. <br /> <br /> Rob Schneider is, I think, is accepted in the role. For this, I mean that he is not a bad actor, but for decaying material it is difficult to comment on quality. However, Coleen Haskell, the other half of the male-romantic leadership (does the person count the number of animals that the main character has the same interest as the romance leads too?), It seems to be embarrassed for the whole thing, too should be. It seems to be working on some kind of vacuum, separated by all other actors in the film. Look at this film only if you want to be bored with inappropriate materials, well, repeat.
