I don't believe anyone liked this film. I have seen many low-budget films, but this has found a lot. Low budget does not mean the movie should be closed. Fear does not mean the movie should be closed. There is nothing terrible about this movie completely. It was just a fest-gore, and particularly disturbing one for it. Acting was normal, considering that all were not heard by the executives, but the story was sad, the discussion was sad. The movie tries to come as "art", or something. That's not one of these very real films that cost only thousands of dollars to do, but they are well done. This is not just an excuse for some of the very sick people to keep their obsessions on the film. Another review here also said that the sound of the voice was heard ... that is because many of them were written by one person, and some songs were written by one of the film writers. There were no features of redemption for this movie completely. The complete destruction of my time and money.
