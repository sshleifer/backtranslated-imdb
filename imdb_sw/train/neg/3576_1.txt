Even when I saw this film for a young man, I was surprised how surprising it was that Zadora also made a star in the movie about the artist lying on his way to the top. As beautiful and beautiful as Mrs Zadora, even she could not put this excuse to the donkeys of the movie from the tanking. Even his photoshoot to Penthouse, which "Lady Lonely" was mounted "back in the day," can put this movie from the tanking. The only thing that could save this film? Script completely different. Give this a miss.
