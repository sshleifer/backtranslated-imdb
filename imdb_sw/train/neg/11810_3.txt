I saw with some amusement that the end of credit, PD Detroit is grateful for their participation. The police chief even has a line of speaking to himself (and a young man, you can tell him he can't do). The reason for amusement is that in this film police shot first and ask questions later. It is not a type of PR, I would like to think of the power of the police would want. Other than this, this is your usual callers and film bandits dressed for 70 'with a color angle. Alex Rocco has been given the responsibility of the lost soldier who cannot come forward and is bound by a mentally ill wife. He does this by hanging out of the house house. Hari Rhodes is her boyfriend who has a groovy wardrobe and likes to expel suspects while wearing trenchcoat. The movie goes up until the last shootout that makes it absolutely no sense (why people that are guilty of theft, take all the police force?). Not only do we see one shot but since there are four bad people, we see four. Then there is an emerging end that should leave one to think what really would have happened but just left me to think how stupid. See that director Arthur Marks was also behind "Foster Friday" and "Bucktown", I didn't have to ask myself.
