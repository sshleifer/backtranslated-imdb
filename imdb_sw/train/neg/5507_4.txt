This was still another great display of the American TV show from sixty years. It's amusing enough but it had a huge amount of formula. The Martian World Environment and it meets people is not very sharp, in its view. Normal capacity associated with human bridges, finally closed by him and help him return home. On the way also gets a girl, Hannah. This is a good display of the popular Hollywood stars that I have not seen for a while. It enjoys adopting another spare time if you don't have something better to watch.
