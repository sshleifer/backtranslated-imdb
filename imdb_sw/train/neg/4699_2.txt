wow, the port of the beaten brothers. I must say what. I think I can say this show just sucks. number one: they don't have talent, maybe they can't even play instruments. number 2: for the business they said they were popular but nobody even heard even until the crappy show came. Look, in fact the hijacker is bad, I would like to give 4 out of 10, but what it feels is how everyone says they have such talents and Nat is detailed and writes deep. Deep my ass! he talks about hard wrestlers and inner feelings. wow, I could read what it says about the walls of the bathroom and it would be deeper than that. And they were not famous for themselves, their parents are famous celebrities and wanted their children to be too so they created a bad show. I feel it will soon be searched.
