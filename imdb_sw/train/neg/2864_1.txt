This film is very bad makes the truth. Imaging is a good quality school class, acting is exciting and the director must be removed forever from the film text in any way. Evil cannot even look like a comedy like something along the Showgirls lines. The only thing this DVD was going for was that art. All I can write to those who have never been fortunate to witness this please please make a prior approval and do not waste your time or money on this trash piece. If you want to see films on interesting issues, there are many more deserving ones in the area such as this garbage.
