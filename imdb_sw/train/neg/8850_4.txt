Now this film does not irritate anyone, but it was interesting for two reasons - two big and small reasons - well, that's three reasons, not. <br /> <br /> The first reason this is interesting is a special effect. I've seen it very interesting and somewhat interesting. To see the hair growing on Marsha A. Hunt and Sybil Danning were exciting, especially when they were involved in the third house. Interested in this, this is that this Marsha Hunt is a popular "Brown Sugar" of Rolling Stones, and that he was in the shade of an unprecedented shade in London's rock music. <br /> <br /> In addition to special effects, there were two other films in this film, and they brought them regularly during sponsorship. I lost count, but I swear that Sybil Danning used those points for us in installing credit at least several times and maybe much more. Theyu was a very high feature of the film.
