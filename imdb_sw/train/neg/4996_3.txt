I enjoyed the first half of this movie, but, wow, did it change corny, or should I say, "it's just stupid." This is just another example of temporary humor. It may be interesting in 1940, but not now .... even close. <br /> <br /> Dick Powell is always interesting to look at. I really loved him when he began to turn out of his boyfriend's voice and a loud voice of Busby Berkeley music where he is mature and also hears it too. It was as good as "Jimmy MacDonald," but others just thrown the stupid characters, the worst that the boss (Raymond Walburn) of Maxford House Coffee Company, who had nothing but scream at all. He was brutally heard and had a serious impact on the movie.
