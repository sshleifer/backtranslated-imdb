I lost this film on Netflix after winning all Oscars, to see if it's really good. Firewall Locker is a real picture (for the most part) of a group of soldiers in Iraq. Film films around Will James, an uncomfortable soldier who gets adrenaline fixing from danger, and defending bombs. <br /> <br /> Where this film appears to be missing in my opinion is Plot and Film orientation. This film does not have a distinctive conspiracy with other films such as Black Hawk Down. What this film tries to do is focus more on characters, and their different perspectives about war. Bigelow is doing a good job of focusing on the characters, but there are many points in the movie where dialogue seems to be difficult. The Locker error is 131 minutes long, but it feels like a movie 3-hour. . It was untrue, and very long. Overall, I thought this film was OKAY, but because I gave it 6 rather than 7, it was because it was a great loss to win the best pictures in Oscars. I felt like this film would be very good to consider the Save Private Ryan Lost Best Picture, but it was better than this film. Another so-called Black Hawk Less just won Oscars 2. I really don't know how this has won the best image. If you are looking for a war-torn war, the rental of Black Hawk Low. This film will forget about a year or two.
