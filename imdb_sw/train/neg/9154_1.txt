THE. WORST. FILM. JUMA. You did it. After watching this gay-looking film, I think a person around the neo-neyo-brain neurotransmitter has made him the worst sex movie ever, all in a non-attacking gay culture. I had to leave the movie and call a friend to come up just to get someone who shouted when I stopped the movie due to shock, unbelief and despair. <br /> <br /> Of all the awesome and effective writing and valid and conspiracy plot, it's just a well-made film. Dog with handycam tied to its tail can be better. Hardly, after reading a few special reviews this film is here, I think the author must have twelve IMDb accounts. Anyone who says this film can be seen as nothing but joke, is a liar or paid too much to say so.
