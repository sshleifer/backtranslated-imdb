I don't know what about this film that made me react to viscerally against it. Maybe it's the characters who could not be seen and did not insist enough to keep. Maybe it was a story of destruction. Perhaps it was the fact that Rob Lowe was wearing a long and gold ring. Maybe it was because at some point in their movie they all hit in the song. Maybe it was because the 1980s have never been 80s. Maybe it was because everything was a golden session. Maybe it was because the character hits his fist when driving away from the camera when switching off. I don't know what made me hate it, but if it means trying to look again I am not ready to know.
