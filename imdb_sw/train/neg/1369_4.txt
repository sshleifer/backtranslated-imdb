The second film of Amy Heckerling Johnny Dangerously is a 1930 episode of gangster made in the traditional Warner Brothers. Star Michael Keaton as a middle-aged gangster looking back into his hard life crashed when he grabbed a kid trying to steal something from his pet pet in 1935. Mother Keaton (Maureen Stapleton) has persistent health problems, so Keaton falls in crime at age through Peter Boyle. At the same time, fargan Richard Dimitri has a rival crime with Boyle and Keaton ultimately rises to the ranks. Joe Piscopo has a change of heel like Danny Vermin, yes yes, Vermin! Griffin Dunne is Keaton's younger brother who became district attorney, his wife Glynnis O'Connor, and Marilu Henner playing Keaton. The movie seems to be cheaper for cheap, making it look like a television show rather than a film show. <br /> <br /> The movie begins bigger and then sits down as expected after the first half. Due to the combination of talks and gags, the film maintains for the first half, but loses the steam speed and flows under the freedom and destruction in the second half. Keaton stimulates the scenery to do well James Cagney feeling. Stapleton has several evil lines that are just terrible, not interesting. Piscopo makes once "once" once very. Several helpers try to win a fortress like Danny DeVito, Dom DeLuise, Ray Walston as a road dealer, Alan Hale, Jr. as a desk army, and Sudie Bond as a cleaning woman. The second half comes on the hit or lack of the type of television and is no longer available. The closure of the 28th anniversary of lift is an astronomy such as The Call Of The Wild Clark Gable film was seen in the early marquee in the film. I think Heckerling should be more aware, since the targeted audience will certainly be aware of the 1939 release date of the Bearing. * 1/2 of 4 stars.
