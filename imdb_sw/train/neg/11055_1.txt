I watched this film with high definition on television. I am in the wheel due to neuromuscular disease and like watching small films made for those with physical disabilities. At first I saw the main character seems to be a good and interesting character. His message on the disabled and during the life he used to fight that disabled people identified and integrated into the common labor market is large. And my problem is not for the real person who did these things. He was a good man. But this film is completely false and physically contrary to the message that I preach, I found it stretching. <br /> First, they had no one in the position of title and physical physical disability. Certainly they were capable executives, but it seems to be legitimate to preach on the lease and then not to work for anything in the film. More is included in the fact that in one place in the middle of the path through the film one appears to go to the podium on the strokes, seemingly only one foot. But CGI in this area is obviously embarrassing. When? Couldn't find the real amputee anywhere with the film? For the second second shot was the most financially sound to make the effects of CGI than just running amputee ACTUAL? At the time of the film I found it to be an illusion and the opposite of the message that was trying to show that I came here and cried about it as I am disabled. <br /> <br /> External image.
