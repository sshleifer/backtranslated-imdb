Seeing as the end of the final world championship ended in an early and despair way by Ronnie O`Sullivan winning the Greek Dott for 18 to 8 episodes. BBC 2 got a gap in their schedule and thus decided to announce the MOON movie I had absolutely no knowledge I missed a few seconds of the title of the head I had no idea Viggo Mortensen mentioned in it and thought it could be a cheap TVM, certainly the opening and clouds Pearl and Marty took their children to the Summer Camp they have the same type of TV text to see though the image of the most popular movie (looks very much) shows that this was a movie film and was not until Viggo Mortensen's call as a hippy tracker that I discovered was the release of the movie, after anyone of the Mortensen is not a star in TVM, I mean it is like a story like Robert DeNiro appearing on the film directly on the film. Wait a minute, not Bob ....? Some people on this site have mentioned that Pearl and Marty are a couple who are unreliable and I agree. I can understand why Pearl could be attracted to an exciting young man but does not know why Walker would be attracted to Pearl's house open house. For sixty years it was before my time but surely if you get a choice between hippy chicks and a housewife is not a choice. Remembering many people took LSD those days so I think that it spells a spell on the MOON it really is a romantic game for the heart (Just like you expect in TVM) and dropping several coming to events. So why do you include a clear scene of sex scene? It is the remaining streams and movie and it is possible to leave menopause women who had 20 something in 1969. I say the possibility because the movie also seems to have a target of teeenage market and come to age and young people may have been hit by historical and social conditions of a man walking on the moon and Woodstock. In other words A WALK ON MOON tries to attract many types of listeners but may appeal to any of them
