I can't bring the baby under 8 to see this. With young children destroying away from buildings that were advertising through dangerous machines and listening to Cruella's horrible laughing in the name of a few events there is a lot of concern for a young child. The live action gives a feeling worse than the cartoon version and there is a very short time of horror including a young man who seems to be a farmer, a lot of time you will be worried and you can be afraid of little children. I don't know what the people of Disney thought but not the story or acting was their standard level. Youth is good But this movie is the best scope.
