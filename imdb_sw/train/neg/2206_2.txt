The scientist on the island is very sad about losing his son who died of kidney cancer. So he thinks: why not sell my dead child in the hammer of the hammer. Yes, who didn't? It's a little hard to deal with the fact that the shark hammerhead killing everyone is called "Paul" always. Also, William Forsythe was thrown as a hero of the MacGyver-kick-ass -day-kinda without trust. On the other hand there are a few small fire that makes you look at the screen when the shark Paul tells someone to die. In fact I see bad movies b quite exciting. But for my taste it would be the most beautiful movie if it was made to say 1000000 bucks down. Then it can be fun.
