and forget this. Fully. If you really need to see Madonna act, the "Body of Evidence", at least Willem Defoe is in the same one. <br /> <br /> In this film, when the set is good, you may want to chat the dialog. You can't miss anything. Bruce Greenwood is lost, Jeanne Tripplehorn is pregnant, and Madonna is very bad, it becomes amusing. Why they had to beat the original film in this mess, I would never know it; I think they thought it was "bankable". Madonna, as an actor, certainly not. Even though you will rent the original film since 1979, however, you will enjoy it, and the administrators in it can work. 1/10.
