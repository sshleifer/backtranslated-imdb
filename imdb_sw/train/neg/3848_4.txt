The film is very appealing to Debbie Reynolds and Shelley Winters who live as the mother of the killers. For the horrific destruction after the experiment, the two women are participating and leaving NY to California to unlock and song and dance studio for girls of Shirley Temple. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, it becomes clear that Reynolds has made a mistake in taking Winters with him in California. Winters has a very sincere woman who seems to be going to her crawler. Make things worse, women living together, receive phone calls. Reynolds, who puts on the wig of the blond, has recently enjoyed the rich father of one of his pupils, with beautifully played by Dennis Weaver. <br /> <br /> Agnes Moorehead, in one of his last films, for a short time is seen as Sister Alma, who Winters is a loyal listener of. <br /> <br /> The film really belongs to Shelley Winters. He is heavy here and the weight seemed to make him work better. Winters always performed well in the task of measuring his nerves. <br /> <br /> The end is the macabre and who can forget Winters in the piano to walk away and look completely?
