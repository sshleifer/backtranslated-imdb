... from this bad film! There are many bad things with this film, act, write, guide, editing, etc. that is amazing that something happens up and proves that it's worse. Music! I noted that the film has two authors listed. This must be the reason why each one has a music, the "D" shadow of the movie shows. He has never heard the words "less is more". It was very painful to listen, I shouted every time there was a talk, not that the discussion was good. You should be sympathetic to Robert Wagner and Tom Bosley, I am sure they haven't seen such roles in the evening of their work. Look for your own risk.
