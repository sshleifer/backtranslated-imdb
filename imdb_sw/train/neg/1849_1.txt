I wished to see the argument that it could be a class in the severity, but the only thing I got was to write bad, leading a horrible (the tracking of the shot does not come in) though the director can say that he is going to, it seems to have been identified and seriously damaged. anyone with VCR 2 and stock was a small video budget. I would say that it was not as simple as a mini digital video. There are some simple ways to modify the film and what the director has, as through the order etc. But it is obvious that he just doesn't care. There are many attempts placed on this film as a sandwich of ham. It can be done well, but that will mean extra work.
