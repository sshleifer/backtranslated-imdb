Ulises is a literary teacher who comes to the coastal city. There, he will like Martina, the most beautiful girl in the city. They will begin a bright romance which will end in the horrible death of the sea Ulises. A few years later, Martina married Sierra, the richest man in the city and lives with the joy of being surrounded by money. One day, Ulises planning will make her passionate to rise and act without thinking. The program is very strange and no characters have a good place. In addition, three quarters of the film are sex acts, which are still well organized, very frightening, when we want to see further development of stories. It's just a bad film of Bigas Luna, for many sex, no move and stupid characters everywhere.
