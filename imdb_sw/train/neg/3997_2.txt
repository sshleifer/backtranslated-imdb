After cheating the top IMD, I decided to go to this movie. Beyond this high level, I intend to prevent reading any comments. I wanted to go to the theater with a clean slate, without knowing the plot or having a preliminary expectations. <br /> <br /> From my rating, you can see that I was desperate. I enjoyed the development of the main character Mike Enslin. I was also happy that the hotel manager tried to talk to him outside the hotel room. When Enslin entered the room, I was ready for other terrible things. <br /> <br /> Chocolates first appear on the river and toilet paper installed. Enslin reacts in a reliable way. He is taken out. I am encouraged to consider myself, this would be good. People who made this film understand that the bottom is more. <br /> <br /> But what happens next that was a great stop. Simplicity is quickly replaced by a prediction shot ... Just a blast of viewers and every trick Hollywood scary in the book and hope that nothing will work. Let's look at, the radio clock that turns itself? Good, that's always scary. Things around the room? Good, you can't complain about it. The blood comes from the walls and sinks? Great. Gods who commit suicide? Good. Something else? What? About loud sounds, trembling, flame, more trembling, deleting room, more blood, etc. etc.. And it's all done before. To overcome our sensitivity to the sensitivity of all kinds of things in a quick series, and they will not be able to look away. Really, it didn't work for me. And you know what else? When I go to see a horrible movie in the theater, it is common to hear several groups of girls in the audience talking in fearful times. But this film did not have a terrible time. The listeners were silent and unwilling. I don't feel under my back. Nothing. Shining is 100x what this film is trying to be. <br /> Why do all these people who claim to be one of the best movies of any time? Friends of the director? Sorry, I don't know.
