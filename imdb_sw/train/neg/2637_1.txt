Hardly, I don't even know where to start. It is as if someone gave a budget of bazillion for a third autistic manufacturer and said 'make me a movie about secret service'.

Everything was useless and blind and meaningless ... and random .... and blind. <br /> <br /> Here is your SPOILER; This movie is a sad thing that you can see. However, if you liked this piece, you will also enjoy it; Deterrance, Blue Blue, and lobotomy part of the front.
