Under the average movie and poor music will focus on movie based music? Normal script and full-dimensional direction. Salman Khan was doing his regular work. Ajay's performance is diminished in time as it seems, especially its styles as Rock Star was awesome. Asin was just a display. In general I felt like losing my money in movies. Salman Khan continues to be young as 10 years ago compared to Aamir Khan. There were many songs in all the movies that shouted "Man Ko Ati". The most important words to impress UK Music Assistant was not the most interesting. "Khanabadosh" can be easily understood by English Music Assistant. Another movie I saw last week was "Wake Up Sid" which was a simple story of love and good leadership & acting despite the average music
