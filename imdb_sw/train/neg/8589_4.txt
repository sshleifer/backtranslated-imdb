First I would like to spread this post by saying that I am a fan of the original Star Wars MOVIES ... I do not read books, play games, wear underwear or eat cereals (if there is one). I am a fan of the film. By saying this, I am trying to see how people give this film a great reputation. Take this movie alone, and without comparing it with the predicting predecessors (EP 1, 2), I do not understand how you can say this is an amazing movie. For all the terrible offenses in the script dialogue - cheesy, events created (ie R2 suddenly become badass, and the long CGI dismisses non-touch events in humans), HORRIBLE's work, and holes holes ... good? There was no real internal problem within Anakin; it seemed just like a switch to hit and was all the sudden. I was not interested in the film up to the last 20 minutes or so (which in a way was destroyed by "NOOOOOO!" Frankenstein area). When you scan the screen for the amazing effects of CGI and fill out the gaps with their angry gaps when it would have been and should be said, this is not the Great MOVIE. With a "dark" sound, it had a great impact on the speech of all the characters. Closing with the question: From the beginning to the end of the film, was there really a sense of urgency and importance for what was happening?
