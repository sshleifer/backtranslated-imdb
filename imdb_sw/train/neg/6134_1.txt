If I could say better than Gymkata, I at least felt my money was not completely destroyed. Then I saw Steven Segal On On Deadly Ground. This movie should see the revival though on MV 3K. If Santa Claus wins Martians he can make the head of Tom Servo burst, someone wondering what can watch this film can cause. <br /> <br /> There is a very good reason why Kurt Thomas did not work on film. The dreck of this dreck should be forced to wear beds every day of their life who say "Bitch hanging me! I was a writer on Gymkata."
