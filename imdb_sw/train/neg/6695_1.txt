I've had something for this car for a while, and apart from how he looked at this film, there is no complaint. But after you found it last night in your EDUCATION, I am sure: that's the only thing in the film that is not down. Script is awesome, acting is awesome, the direction is terrible. I saw other ideas about someone who talks about what the big scenes of sex had been? Not at all. While the movie is so bad you can also just make it a porncore softcore, but instead I get to see the pasty white dude block me from seeing the Wuhrer body and scenes that give me nothing except tease. They should only go to the cinemax so that the movie is not the perfect waste of time, but no. With this awesome script should be able to appear to Wuhrer, since that's the only pro movie of the movie. 2/10, just because it appeared to be very hot.
