I have a 5-minute rule (sometimes I will leave 10). If the movie is not suitable for the first 5 or 10 minutes it will probably not be better. I have never seen any film that has proved to compete this theory. Dan in Real Life is definitely no exception. I was looking at this turkey and thought; wow, this is not interesting, not touching, not sad, and I don't like any of the characters altogether. The counselor of the counselor / widow counselor to raise three young daughters, who fall in love with a brother's love. I think the identification can be "a consultant who could use advice"? I don't know. In character no way struck as a qualified person to give advice. I THINK THAT'S irony? I don't know. He is going to see his parents, brothers, sisters and their children in the form of a family bond, which seems to be very good, and enough food for a good comedy, story lines ... no one appears. The main story is basically how she likes this woman, but she can't be with her. Anyone who has a whip will know that he will eventually take it, but you should suffer through unpleasant pain, talk, spiritual dialogue "love killer" to achieve the inevitable end of happiness. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
