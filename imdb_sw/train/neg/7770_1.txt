This full movie movie was led by Bill Rebane, the man who is involved with Monster Go-Go Go. As I approached the end of Cold I came to an amazing conclusion that this film was worse than 60 of the shocker. Story ?? as much as it is? it is about three millionaires of the group who invite a group of people in their home to play a game of macabre games. Anyone who can manage the speed and live to the end will win $ 1,000,000. It's a very simple plot but Rebane can still review a misunderstanding. Things happen. The characters are completely forgotten about. Nothing makes a lot of sense. And then it ends up. Weirdly. What do I mean hell was the last? I think you have left to draw your own conclusion. Production and acting ethics do not have a question of world-class film. In fact Pamela Rohleder (Shelly) is not good. He is awesome to the surprise he is encouraging. Unfortunately one thing can not say about this trick of the crash in general, it's just a mixture of basement.
