I've tried to love this film, in fact. In looking at it, all that I can think is, "This one gives me creeps, I would get a preventive order". It also calls out OUT in the main letter. Is this a conversation before making a film? "Let's make a film that puts two people who are free, uninvited in a relationship that adds separation to them and encourages them to complain about their bad lives!" From what I have seen in life is that the last thing in the world we find interesting for a partner partner is always self-centered. <br /> <br /> The status of the movie is open 80-ish; comes and decreases. Don't make a mistake, the film has time, just a few.
