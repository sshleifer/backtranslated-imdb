However, other movies about a group of intellectual people on the road trips their way to travel for a short time or, in this case, to visit the downward attraction. As a result, as expected, it is not good, as this shows the other side is home to a group of visitors, survivors who have survived prison prisoners for many years before. Father, who is a professional photographer, has the right to stop and take pictures of the place, just get that still crowded. Several members of the family walk away to see various attractions, just to be afraid away. They think they made it safe for them, van van explodes (amazing!), Leaving the search for refugees and lodging in a small town, which we see is unique to disasters (surprises!) <br /> This film looks like expected, together and family hit and killed by freaks. There are some fighting in family parts, but it may be one of the worst events in the film, because they have been badly killed. There is nothing original here, unless you count an inappropriate voice that is played during certain events that completely destroys the situation and the state of the film. Acting is as bad as I have seen for a long time and everyone involved (it is very bad when your cast out is done by "Blood Camp." The special effects are lousy and the end makes me love my TV. <br /> <br / > Still, however, in spite of all the mistakes, I enjoyed this film. Sure it has "very bad it is good." I made it through the whole movie and even enjoying it with joy when I finished ridiculously cliched conspiracy, acting badly, with special effects of cheesy. Although the end left me not afraid and angry, especially because the film is not suitable to start with the end makes the whole film meaningful. /> <br /> Below, I can write many films you have seen, you have seen. The best. Although not perfect, this film is very bad and not far away.
