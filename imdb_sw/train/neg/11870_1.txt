This is the most straightforward film I saw. I first noticed as a child and even think about it now bothers me. I know it was installed when life was hard and I know that these people were poor and crops were important. Yes, I get it all. What I find difficult to take I can remember one time of light in the whole film. Maybe it was true for life, I don't know. I am sure that the acting was a high score and direction and quality of documents etc. is amazing and I know that every film cannot end up happy but if the family film is bad in my opinion. I would like to recommend it to anyone who wants to be interested in the film. I can't stress enough how this film touched me as a child. I was talking about it soon and all the sad memories came back. I think it would have all but unwilling to reach Prozac.
