After hearing many people shouting about this film I thought I would give you a go. In addition to being very slow, which I don't care for as long as waiting is worth it, but not just. As many others said there are many differences and many films are not really available. The ears of 4 men have been changed by shock, panic over the body to complete carelessness of fish. In fact if they were the kind of men who would go fishing with pleasure, then they could only give the body information and said they only discovered after their fishing trip .... why on earth close the body to a tree, go fishing and then tell everyone you found the body 2 days earlier? It is very difficult to watch a film that knows that the character of the main characters is the same. For some of the city, well you think at least one of them can show some curiosity about who killed the woman! The body itself, naked except for those who build .... what does it lead to it? If she was raped and why still knickers? If she was raped and dressed, then why not remove the future bar of knickers? If he was not raped, why should you remove his clothes away from the ignorant .... leaving yourself with evidence to remove? I really don't think of any realistic situation that would lead to that rather than killing someone to steal his clothes so you can fill your shop! Oh well is watchable but just and because, despite the poor script, acting is powerful.
