A typical practical film: a good striker gets a burden on the confusion of fake warriors and Japanese gangsters. The best results have good displays, short-term decline of the snicker, and some of the right action measures - with the opportunity to look at the beautiful Danielle Harris - who makes more of her size as the daughter of the rebellious boy. <br /> <br /> ** out of ****.
