I tried to like this app; I did the truth. I even purchased a pilot film, first on VHS and later on DVD. However, I could not enter this story because its two characters: "David" (Bruce Willis) and "Maddie" (Pastor Cybill) seemed only in love with themselves, for one thing. I agree that it is a clever discussion in the exhibition, which was an important part of the success of the TV program, and I enjoyed a lot of discussions. Basically, this was like an old screwball movie of '30s and' 40s and male versus female. You get lots of votes, charges, shouting and shouting. Many people like to fight with that kind, but I hate it, so I've never been in the daylight. Allyce Beasley just as an anonymous "Agnes," had a leisure. It's too bad he had little time to air. The pastor was good in the eyes and I think women say the same to Willis, but the bigger debate between the two finally took me away.
