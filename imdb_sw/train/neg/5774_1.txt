This movie is a very small effort with Spike Lee. He has more power than this movie. Get Bus when apparenly resist the racist, it does nothing but berate whites and undermine the black state quo. This movie program is about a group of black people who travel on the bus to the march of the million Louis Farrakhan. Then it has every kind of person you can think of: homosexual, Muslim, complainant and Uncle Tom (thrown away and then though). There was only one white man on the bus. He was charged as a racist the minute he got on the car. In spite of being a wife and the fact that he explained is the situation he lived to be a racist and stop the bus. This should not be seen as a victory but a sad disbelief. You may think I am a racist for writing this but I mean well. Good luck next time Pastor.
