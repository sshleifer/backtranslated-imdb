Will the film and Amy, Posey and Raechel have something wonderful in it? Believe or not 'House Bunny' made this excellent and funnier. Hope the nobles had a good vacation and earned money - this movie is a shame for all. It's cliché from beginning to end. Clichés can work well with the script, or at least the idea. This movie has nothing but use cliché after cliché instead of ideas or script. It uses a persona of preexisting of executives instead of developing characters. Bad, sad, and garbage. Now I seem to have ten lines of text for comments. True? Why? As the Ops Manager of this IT is another example of inappropriate coding.
