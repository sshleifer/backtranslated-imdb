All Allen made "September", indicating that even genius can spread. This is "September" of Mel Brook. Without stupid, boring, and no matter what, I must admit that I did not look at him until the end. The flick park among the less respected (e.g., "Money Money", "Beach Sea", "Grill Spitfire") that can make me sleep or force me to reach the "restore" button. And I say this, sadly, as a fan of Mel Brooks dedicated. He should be connected to the direct comedy and leave the social definitions alone. How his colleague who made "Young Frankenstein" and "Spaceballs" can overcome the dog if this is more than me. Avoid at all costs.
