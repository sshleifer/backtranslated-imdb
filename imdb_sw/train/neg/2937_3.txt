An attempt to appeal to those who do not like opera, using the characteristics of one of the most opera singers all the time, fails badly. All that is needed in this film is opera, and one can find the Pavarotti record to do what he does well. This plan involves love with a doctor who heals his sudden throat. Just because it went out a long time ago is largely forgotten. Like many opera stars, Pavarotti is a good actor and has a remote presence from his singing talent, and nothing he does in this film ignores these views. His judgment is in rejecting the bad script. Probably because the big operation can have hidden stories that endured this. Who knows, except those involved? What? We need to know? <br /> <br /> The program is weak and causes. This film is like walking through a muddy mud to take the juicy sweet (opera music) depends on the mud. We have other ways that we appreciate the great Pavarotti, and this is not one of them. Just find one of its many superb opera or sound-concert records and identify the master tenor where he is most suited. It would be one of the IMDb's 100 Films as more people to remember and give some lots; it would be good for the list including a number of artists, artists, models, and athletes to use their use through the film. Often they often go badly because of unsuccessful acting or bad script. Pavarotti would have been a good actor and he had no sounding sound. However he works as an actor (opera requires), even Jimmy Stewart could save this Turkey script. <br /> <br /> I respect 3 out of 10 because one can be a fan of Pavarotti and opera Songs because of this film.
