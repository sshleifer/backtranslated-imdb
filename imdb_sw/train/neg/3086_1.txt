I once thought that the "Stone Age" was a very bad film made ... I was wrong. "Hobgoblins" passed through every way I could think of and a few that I didn't. In the "Stone Age" I hated the characters. In "Hobgoblins" I hated executives ... and everyone else involved in creating this hostility. I will not insert a teaser on this film, not a cruel. I could not share innocent people like you yourself with such suffering. In fact, any discussion of the plot related to this film is meaningful and despicable. The words I will use to describe this film are as follows: uncomfortable, uncomfortable, worried. Finally, PLEASE don't see this film. I ask you, from one film partner to another ... no, from one man to another, PLEASE. For your purity and unconscious mind. Destroy any copy you get.
