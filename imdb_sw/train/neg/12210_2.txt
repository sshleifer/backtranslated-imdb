This film is a joke and must be one of the worst movies Stallone has ever done. This is an 80th common movie where you have one man destroying the whole army for himself. "First Pt 2" is similar to the "Commando" of Schwarzenegger, but there you have Arnold to kill a terrorist when you have a special nation that has shown you as bad people. This movie is the most common anti-Soviet propaganda. True, this was the climax of the Cold War, but I am sick to have Communists or Sisters always shown as an enemy. There are many movies in America that have this thing directly. Why can't he have a film showing Americans as an enemy? Who will believe that only one soldier will destroy the whole army? What? Do you think that something like this will happen really? For its appearance, the average, the English brain saw it.
