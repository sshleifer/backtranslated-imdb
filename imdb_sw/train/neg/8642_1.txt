I tell you this is a bad movie, for just the fact that when you see this film in the guide, it is listed as a document. As I watched, I began to laugh, thinking, is this one hoping to believe that this is true? So I had to investigate it, and now you see it is a film, but now that it's not a document, it is now a bad movie. SO, either any way, is very bad. I really didn't do that to the end. I had to close it. I am the NYC Police Officer, and I felt that someone was trying to deceive people to think this was a document, and intended to make money on my horrible day with my colleagues. So, I took a little personal. Maybe I was blind with it, and not as bad as I personally think it is. Everyone has his own opinion.
