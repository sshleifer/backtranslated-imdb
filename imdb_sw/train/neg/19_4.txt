I am a great fan of Arnold Vosloo. Finally to see him as a star of a recent movie, not just a little bit, it's fun. Unfortunately I used the film thanks to the campus and the only thing I can say is that I did not like that the film was made in the neglected area of ​​the city and there was no natural or local traffic. I can say that the actor leaves the proposed thing, but Arnold is the best actor, I have to pull it up to the orientation of the hours and the supportive contribution it leaves. <br /> <br /> I love Arnold Vosloo, and made the film appear. Otherwise, I would like to write it as another film of pride. I have seen a place of rape and compulsory rape, but the last lost participants were very good. But the effects of the shooting were very bad. There are some glitches in the film (promotional) but they can decline according to the low level of the film. In all I enjoyed the film, because Arnold Vosloo was in it. Jackie
