Being a filmmaker of himself, and having some dark and exciting feeling of humor, I thought I was in treating when I got home "My ..." (not that the DVD cover offers anything away, instead of choosing a quote solution from for controversial director, Chris Morris, "short film including events"). I had to have a better understanding, and to avoid this non-verbal (and often negative) toddle. The situation in the church is awesome to watch (especially since we all know the bad behavior of Morris towards pedophilia from its famous TV series, Brass Eye) and you do not use any purpose rather than frightening. How this film is called comedy I never understand. The driver's view looks like a novel idea for the code (after being a runner himself, it is often a fascinating and non-restricted view of the film process) however this is sad not here. Instead, we are used for someone in high school emphasizing on dogs on the film, before concluding that there are no striking dogs. This is very interesting, but it is not recommended one chapter of the cell. <br /> <br /> Saying that this film goes wherever it would be down. Much depends on its elevated style, at the cost of conspiracy, behavior and dialogue, leaving the viewer distracted by insufficient. His message over-simple - that one should take responsibility for his actions - is two clear and clear example. <br /> <br /> The film has its time of pseudo-Kafkaesque sursealism, but eventually, it fails to convince, delight, shine and end up angry. If you want to see a true piece of the short film, I strongly recommend "Franz Kafka's Life Life", and Peter Capaldi.
