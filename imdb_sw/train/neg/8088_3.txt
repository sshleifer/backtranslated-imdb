To make a good film you need the best characters or the best director. You need at least one of the two. In this eye of the needle we do not. I don't even remember the name of the director. We should not do much in his work. I love so much Donald Sutherland but he can never be a great actor in the movie. He lacks. Sutherland is the best in the movie when it looks for no more than 15 minutes. I would say for example Sutherland was the best at JFK's Oliver Stone when he spoke to Kevin Costner on the park bench for 10 minutes without stopping without taking a breath. Wonderful. But Sutherland being a great actor in the movie is not good. Kate Nelligan? It may be good for TV series. The DVD is bad. Awesome color. A terrible light. I could not even know the surroundings of the storm Island for how good it was to photograph. Ken Follett's story was good but it was a pity they turned it into an unpleasant film.
