this film has it all; The function of the camera, reminding the stones of martini, or the oliver stones, the strong acting of 'heat', the bursting point of the movie jerry bruckheimer, the magic dialogue of the tarantino script and the epic to say, 'godfather' < br>> The judge sets the characteristics of fire displays, but also shows the depth of emotion and strength. its performance reminds me of the robert de niro's motta exhibition in a strong cow. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> <3 / / <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> / Special effects result in technology and film limits on their borders. Independent day has set the standard for which this film has succeeded, and it has become too extreme. <br /> <br /> in general, a good acting from its released list (like the nightclub invitation list of oscars!), classy locations, promotion point, and tight script.
