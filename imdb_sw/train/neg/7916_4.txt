Where to start? It includes an incorrect password: <br /> <br /> "Beginning of X-Men: Wolverine tells the old story of violence and romantic Wolverine, its tough relationship with Victor Creed, and a bad weapon plan. " <Br /> <br /> The history of war violence appears to be non-violent. His relationship with honesty has been enlarged on the hard to understand how they have any relationship. We are thrown from one place in the opening area that shows them as children in the run, on the accumulation of war events that they have fought throughout their lifetime, and finally at the moment where it is part of the hardcore team of killers. <br /> <br /> There is nothing in the way to show their relationship as a brother. There is no problem set for us to believe it is true or even love. <br /> <br /> The movie's feature of the movie between Silverfox and Wolverine was forced and wrong. We are thrown in love so quickly that it is more before you can see the eyes. After introducing a character, Silverfox is killed away fifteen minutes later. We are wondering why we should care about this. Who was he? With the most important element of this retaliatory, this romance is surprisingly unknown. It ran just because it was required. Not surprisingly enough, while Wolverine finds that her love has died she has left him in the trees to decay while going to find Sabertooth. Being romantic that he is this was not a character for him is still necessary to serve a conspiracy in overcoming a great surprise. <br /> <br /> As for the X weapon program, just simply say that after injury to the pain Wolverine pain is up and runs. Finally he gets home to an old couple who are very easy. Surprisingly, Ma and Pa Kent are not ashamed when they have found someone who is naked in their barn. Is it any wonder what awaits them? <br /> <br /> In the previous films and comic books, the main reason that Wolverines' amnesia treated him on the other hand was hinged on the fact that he said he had been bad and knew this was the case ... Is it? really wanted to remember those fears or to hide them and to continue his best life to fight against the criminals of the world along with his team members? <br /> <br /> As described in X2: X-Men United when Stryker gives some of its secrets it is said that Wolverine will be harassed if he knew the bad work they did together. This film makes the team truly sure it doesn't do much. There is no violence, no acts of violence, only harassing a few locals in foreign countries for ten or fifteen minutes on the screen. It seems that Wolverine was not a bad person under Stryker completely. Instead he tried to always put a seat on his brother Sabertooth which therefore was a violent agent we all thought Wolverine had. Finally she comes out together. <br /> <br /> There is no collision of duality here. <br /> <br /> Idiotically remove the behavior of good and evil DULLED stories very much. They can also give him the ball head. There were tons of other errors in this film which contradicted the X-Men's trilogy, including the introduction of one of the Deus Ex Machinas lights forever. script. <br /> <br /> Publisher of memory. Really? It seems to be the only thing to bring Wolverine. However this was apparently forgotten when the agent after the agent was sent to bring him down and shoot with bombs that would certainly not do him. <br /> <br /> Another problem with this film is that he tried to focus on Wolverine during the throwing in tons of other mutants that had nothing less. Interesting characters were just wearing a window and they did nothing for the story. Many were in the film for 5-10 minutes and still find yourself looking for more and less Wolverine. <br /> <br /> Fred Dukes (Blob but not a comic version) can blow the horn launched a tanks and quite a bit for physical destruction to him at least, but a simple headbutt from Wolverines metal noggin is enough to make him? The optic balls of the Cyclops (which instead of having the power of concussive now are similar to the lasers) can burn through buildings but when expelled from Sabertooth just smeshes her down without even destroying the clothes its. Does the Adamatium of the coat are anyone? Gambit's attraction, instead of using his signature cards, takes place in some kind of acrobat of things. In one area with a failure of the damage he has been confronted with insight and Wolverine ... then surprising for a few minutes later he is on the ceiling running TOWARDS Wolverine. As he got to know, he ran a few blocks, climbed the building, then fled Wolverine and Sabertooth in the middle of a refusal match is still explained. <br /> <br /> Some have denied this film weakness to claim was given to the comic and therefore should be weak on character and heavy flash. The idea that this movie is a comic film is flimsy and superficial because of the fact it is correct. <br /> <br /> Book comic books, a real Wolverine ... is a good story to bring a screenshot. It does not have its old sugar gown nor treat the reader as useless junkies of CGI. It was a well-developed story and though it was addressed and changed for a while, it started with WEAPON X and Barry Windsor-Smith. The greatest and exciting stories. <br /> <br /> This FOX film should forget about it. Does anyone have a magic gun? <br /> <br /> 4/10
