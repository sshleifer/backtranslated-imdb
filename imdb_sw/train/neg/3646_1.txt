Ooo ... my god ... this is of course the most fun movie I saw. Acting is bad, the story is weak, the characters are weak, and the whole film is not worth meaning. This couple for ordinary leadership, incredible events (such as where the child reaches the stream and falls in secret), with a very deep conversation ("Look!" Not to mention the fact that Mr. Atlas was the only thing that he could fail was the case of chocolate bars. But this is the charm of the movie. Sit down and look at your few friends for good laughing. <br /> <br /> I love this film, because it's just BAD!
