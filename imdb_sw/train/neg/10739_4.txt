'Iedereen Beroemd' has everything we can expect from the video directly to video. It's a story about a man who believes his daughter can be a star. The only thing he needs is to find him in action, surrounded by cameras and journalists. A simple program that needs to grab and make some blackmail. The problem with the movie is not a primary plot, but how it is done. Everything should be funny, but not. It is meaningful and common, the characters are inferior, and the last sequence is completely without peak or feeling. The last sequence is probably the only area where you feel like laughing, but just how exciting to start the whole.
