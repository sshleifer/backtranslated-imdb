This film is not ideal, it tries to be fun and humorous, which is dry and stimulating that the movie is two hours of suffering. In the whole movie I was thinking of the same thing, "this time it will end". One thing you give them, is that they have a very short time, and why I gave two stars. It is common and uses almost every old blonde dragon in the book, even those who were not funny at first. It is basically a movie to cut the blondes and record the entire repetoir of blonde jokes. <br /> <br /> To count all, this movie is a blonde humor lost, it is not worth paying any amount of money to look, it's just bad.
