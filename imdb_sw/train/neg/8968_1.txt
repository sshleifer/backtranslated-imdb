Writing the screen is so dumb I am sorry for that I have taken two hours of my life I never return (iep this information before). Acting is so-so. Things change often to enable you to watch and wait for something wrong. However there is nothing original in this film. When the first Cube was a horror movie of horror, which did not do much of the last mind, the cube of the cube has taken over it and tries to record the same story, except this time it makes the feel of trying to try for the grazing of everything that the movie's The first did not answer. The comic thing is, the director builds a real picture of the first movie that was wonderful, and tries to describe. But these events are only copied, no connection. This document is sooo useless. I can imagine it is written by the 15-year-old 15-year-old with a baseball cap and a beer pack for a class project. The best part is the end, they reduce the good man of wunderkind, and become a player who has lost the first movie, and you see him when they find him ('this room is green.') In Cube 1997. Goodie gooodie, clap clap, what twist. First of all, what if you didn't see first, this does not mean any director of nitwit. Oh, another great idea: instead of numbers identifying x, y, z coordinates of the room (cube 1997), this time is 3 letters, each providing one of 26 possible coordinates values. Duh. Except now the permissions are no longer availableâ€¦ and he allows the mail to disappear before anyone can use them. I want my money again. I think I had to write this since there is so bad, it is not appropriate, or just a stupid idea in this film. Directors / authors should be required to have some talents.
