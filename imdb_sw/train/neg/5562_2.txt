This unpleasant film has little to recommend. Dolph Lundgren provides performance which is better than either this script or his other films allowed to be allowed. And there are frequent snippets of dialogue that indicate the film may be able to provide some insight into a wonderful subculture. But no. Motivations are either murky or trite. Many tasks are small. Script creates an incorrect mix. And the position of the useless director and considering the matter is a terrible thing. It is difficult to imagine who the audience is for this film.
