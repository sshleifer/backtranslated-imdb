Come Tina Fey can do well then this. Once the movie started I knew how it would end. Certainly it was sometimes. Even laugh very funny. But there is no laughing enough to save this film. I did not recommend buying this. For many I recommend leasing but that's all. Mother Mama has funny but it is predictable and fails to have the last heart end up struggling. Tina Fey and Amy Poalher made a good team. For girls are one of my favorite movies. Tina Fey and Amy Poalher both did well in it and are doing well in this. But this is no better. Mama Mama had great help in helping. Dane Cook, Sigourney Weaver and Steve Martin increase in size. Another movie of pregnancy has hit the world of movies. After Knocked Up and Juno, Mama Mama looks very average compared. Knocked Up and Juno are Hilarious, Heartwarming and having an end that leaves you with a smile on your face. Mother's exposure had no meaning and weight. <br /> <br /> Baby Mama was not the best comedy of the year and does not try to be. I recommend but it does not expect it to be quite a hilarious. Expect a moderate comedy that does not give you a great feeling ending is trying to be. I give him Mama Mama ..... /> <br /> 4/10
