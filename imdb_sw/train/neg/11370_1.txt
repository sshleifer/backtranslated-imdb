This video has an external way to combine and drive Americans about Islam. It is a pity that people who did so believe that the American people are dumb to believe, perhaps, as a citizen of the United States, everyone must fight against this kind of decoration. If you want to know the truth about Islam, don't let anyone tell you ... QURAN IS PUBLIC! you can read it alone and decide if what they say is true or false ... This video uses many audiovisual strategies that are run to run and involve non-related items. Music used in some points prepares the public to hate what they see, even if they don't know what's going on there. They use images that have been lost from their original content. Do you think you can make a movie similar to every religion in the world?
