This film was a great destruction. The brutality of violence and violence in this film was very disturbing. some cases were unnecessary and unnecessary. The main characters are not able to identify or even hear. The character of the leading protagonist was as slimy as they come. The status of patients / hothouse is set to the highest display. little or nothing could learn about the Spanish civil war from this film. Fortunately, I have been getting hungry and realizing this is not true! In addition, the use of the same sex attraction as "fear" of unfortunate was also offensive and ineffective, while the DVD is promoted and advertised to attract gay viewers. The participants seemed anxious in their roles, as if they were trying to pull away from this mess. I think if you like to watch the children and pets of the killing are violently, this film can be very interesting to you.
