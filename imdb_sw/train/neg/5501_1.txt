I thought that My Dear Martian was very sad and released !! It was not funny at all. The audience stayed only on the entire movie and they did not even laugh! Even children did not laugh! That's sad for the Disney movie! I thought they could look for someone better to play martian instead of Christopher Lloyd !! He was really a fool! And she was not funny! I thought the talking suit was really dumb! In the previous series of television sets does not talk and around !! In my opinion they should not waste their time on this film! I give two thumbes down !! Really waste time and I won't recommend a movie to anyone !!! Thank you !!
