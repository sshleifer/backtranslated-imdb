Well, I bought this film from Woolworths for my friend for a joke presented on his birthday, because the front cover was guilty of sex in it. But we decided to look at it again. It is for the purpose of hilarity. And I have poor, but this should be, one of the worst films in history. It started completely, and we thought "Ok this could be the same". But after 10 minutes, we were very wrong. It started when the "amazing color of the color" turned into a more obvious character, Scouser / Australia (I say it because it had a feeling that was not recognized), who works I can only say, was bad. Then it came to an end, and at that time, we had lost the will to live. The color of the color ball. The only thing I did on this plot is that they did not win, but amazingly won by default. I know this has nothing to do with it, but the name given to the team was too big. Important damage. I mean they could take the most amazing name, like "Anti-Christ Destroyers" or something. Or that is what the film should be called every time.
