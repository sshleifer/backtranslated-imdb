THE NATIONAL LAMPOON'S CLASS COMPANY was flop when it was released. It didn't last long in movies in my big city. Why? Because it's BAD !!!!! <br /> It is not bad in a good way but it's bad for the most unpleasant way. The whole selection of executives was most unknown then and remained unknown after this turkey. The idea is really great (the performance of the slasher flicks) but the action does not fall into every element. <br /> <br /> Just avoid this "comedy". Your time is more valuable than using nanosecond to look at this embarrassing misfire.
