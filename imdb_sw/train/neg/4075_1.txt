I am scared of fear / gore of the film and this year was so bad, I felt embarrassed to not just "actors", but also the director and poor poor producer who put his money to this schlock. <Br /> <br /> From the head, you could expect a horrible murder, a certain amount of story and for some leadership or conversation. Instead, you find what appears to be a small part of the gender and sexuality of the Third Stooges. At least I laugh at Stooges Three. When I look at this trick, I have turned the other TV and started looking at Howard Stern until something interesting happened. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, I kept watching Stern. Look at this "film" I realize that I can produce movies with three monkeys, DV 2 cameras, $ 50 $ in autonomous change and broken PC. This film is my inspiration to enter into non-budget films. Watch this film if you are witnessing, but be distracted ... there is nothing here but a lot of talking with a very small step. This makes "KaZaam" looks like Meryl Streep's film. I'm sure Germany did not prohibit sex or abuse. Other countries need to consider.
