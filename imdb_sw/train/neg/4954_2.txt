I raised him to watch the original series of Batman, and is a novelist of Batman's picture. For the hero of the comic book as an iconic like Batman, there are certain features that cannot be changed. All freedom of creativity is good and good, but when changing quite a character, then it is very far away. I bought one season for "Batman" in the hope that an extra bonus element could give light on the minds of the creators by making such an impression. In an interview on the decision of "Batman," one of the artists or authors (I'm sure that) said that "We felt we didn't have Batman, but we can combine with criminals." So, they made Joker a little child begging for caution, penguin into some of the anime knockoff, Mr. Freeze in a thief of super-powered jewel, Poison Ivy on a hippie boy, and many other shameful works that make Bob Kane climb into the grave lake. <br /> <br /> Counting all: I would like to have more hands so that I can give this show FOUR THUMBS DOWN. Reduces to my rating and 2 out of 10 just because it uses Batman's name. Warner Bros ... this rethink! Please!
