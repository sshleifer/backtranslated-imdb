Despite some gentle tips in the script and the value of the general curiosity film, the Wolfman Fury emerges as a lighter and less attractive tour in the lycanthropy, preserved only by the presence of statuesque stability of Perla Cristal. Other players, including Naschy hammy, are a complete writing (although no doubt is assisted and often dubbing with anger). Although the screenplay takes a sufficient variation on waswolf / Frankenstein / Dr Moreau theme for the body out of a dozen movies, the plot is so developed, the reputation is so weak and the conversation so verbosely ignorant (at least in English version), that any recent interest Turgid cases have recently dropped. Zabalza's direction seems to be bright, even amateurish. His session is painful and unsuitable. He was not helped by the Villasenor's most bright lights. Even the promised sets are not so much available that a few attempts by the director to give viewers fear are introduced before early. humanity is absolutely worthy of special judgment.
