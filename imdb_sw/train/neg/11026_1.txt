I finished reading a book about Dillinger. This movie was very bad. It's like they got a list of names and they did everything. His hobby and getaways were well organized, up to the second - when it was over, they left if they had all the money or not. They had the details of each road, where to turn, etc.. Purvis never saw him at the restaurant, he was told that Dillinger was paid for his food after Dillinger left. Purvis never even saw Dillinger before night Dillinger was killed, just his pictures. The path of his messengers were dead. Dillinger never did steal the bank itself, as he did in this film. If I have never read the book, maybe I would enjoy the movie. Acting was a little over place. The step decreased again. For a second thought, I doubt whether I would like to enjoy myself even if I had not read the book.
