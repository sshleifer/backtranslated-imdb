The Russian movie, "4," follows the life of three visitors (not four) who meet one night on the inner bar. One is a musician, one of the vendors of frozen meat and one telephone girl. 4, "I collect it, it is intended to show damage and hopelessness of life in Russia after the Soviet (the characters have to create a story to make their life seem to be more interesting than they actually), but The movies can't be so bad and stimulating that I am very doubtful many people will be able to stay all the way. There seems to be a proposal that runs through the film that the Russian government of shade makes several shades of shade behind events - the cloning of the secret equipment, selling thousands of past meat meat, etc. - but the movie is useless and incomprehensible that I doubt anyone anyone can realize what anyone is coming here. With a good acting and few untreated screens, "4" is a long-term long-term competition that should be avoided at all costs.
