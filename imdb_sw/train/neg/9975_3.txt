I remember watching this film several times as a very young child, and there were parts of it (many in fact) that I didn't know. I think I've seen it once as an adult, and then I understood those parts. The only problem of looking at it as an adult is that it was not an entertaining thing for me. So what kind of film is this? What is the "children's movie"? It's not difficult. It has language and issue should not be for children. What? Is the example of each parent feels like they continue with their own children? Maybe, but then why don't you consider John Ritter's behavior instead of Junior? When the film is 7 years old as its main character, to do well with the audience, it should be a film for seven and less people, otherwise older people than they do not have a way to communicate (even 8 older adults would not like to see a film about a child who is much older than their whole year). I am sure that this film does not work well in the box office, and the reason it should be because it could not get the niche on the market.
