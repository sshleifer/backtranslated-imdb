Did I get into something or is the smell that comes from Day 1 + 2? God was behind everything? What has God done with Sci-Fi? God is the only answer when you cannot think of a wise explanation of something. In fact, this is a particular problem with the finale of the series - in fact they could not think about a reasonable explanation on the abundance of major questions that raised in a series as well as how Kara Thrace returns from the dead in a new brand new, how his old dog and body emerged when you finished on World 2, why Baltar has 6 ideas on his head, why 6 has an imaginary Baltar in his head, etc. so they describe to "angels" or just not to describe even. <br /> <br /> The last 2 program plans had large holes to fly Basestar through. For example, why Galactica and her crew go to the responsibility of suicide to save one girl (Hera), especially after Adama saying no way she would try to save them? Because they found the core of Cylon? That is not a good reason to sacrifice the lives of the workers. And how did Anders know the place? And what was the meaning of the characters before the war? It's like they forgot to do so in advance to throw something in the last minute. People who wrote the last two sessions could not be the same writers who have created what was now interesting. It feels like writing a script was made by evangelical Christians on the message 'spreading' message. Forgetting to try to strengthen the unlimited end in the program, the important messages that the authors wanted to cross are: do not put your trust in technology as it will cause your destruction; God is your ultimate salvation (lucky if you have a disease that you need treatment) <br /> <br /> Think in the last film series of Star Wars tell you no "power" ... instead, Jedi actually gets its power from Jesus. Then jump their birds on the nearby stars and go live forest and Ewoks. What? This can be the end? Nothing is frakken 'without.
