Previous comments made me write this. It says that Muslims are blonde and Serbs are dark (because our blood is mixed). This comment states that these comments can be made by the racist. See, the race is nothing. It's a blind eye. It looks like Pierce Brosnan but not Ireland.

Anyone who uses racism and prejudice such as Lantos (producer and director is racis for me. Yuggoslavia all in Hell but they will not return to our dead relatives. of Sarayevo, the terrorist terrorist groups, Islamic violence. Adds: I bow and pray to all innocent sisters and Muslims, Catholic or non-religious, killed in this war. The human lie that is not quite good. It helps Lantos to fill its bags with the most spot, the same!
