Nothing can save this film, even Superman. <br /> <br /> Ten years ago special effects would be amazing. Proper reference can be more sensitive to the best performances from the actors. But nothing except feeding the script to the dragon can make it. Pile holes, rough lines, horrible pacing, overtaking the end of the same shots of the CGI dragon blowing through the road ... ugh. Avoid this at all costs. <br /> <br />
