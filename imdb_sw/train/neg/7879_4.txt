First, I must say that I loved the book Farm Animal. I read it with my grade 9 class, and it was good. We also decided to watch the film will be useful. The movie was very disappointing to me. Movie eliminates certain characters, and lacks many points of the book. It jumps very close, and does not describe anything in detail. If someone was watching this film without first reading the book, they could be confused. The most disappointing thing in this film to me, was the end. The last book was more powerful, and in the movie, they changed it! It was necessary to be a pig with men in a union with a kind of "melt" together, but instead, the movie made it like animals when they rebelled against pigs. In general, I don't think this movie has taken the exact meaning of Orwell shown in his book.
