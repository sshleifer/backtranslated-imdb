Glass. Glass (1990) is a distracting movie. Why did I watch this movie when I was young? Who knows? Maybe I was one of self-discipline to watch one awesome movie after another. I don't know, I think I needed a hobby during my teen years. From youth (Rainbow Harvest) seeks comfort in an ancient mirror. Recently he learns about the awesome power of this ancient mirror and uses it to beat against those who have offended him. Films like these, the power provider has adverse effects. This changes in and out if he likes it or not. The film's film for some reason was returned to dh. a few years back. I don't know why. They should leave it on the shelves and collect dust. People love this reason. If you'd like to know why. Until then I don't like this movie and I have no reason to look at it again. It is not recommended.
