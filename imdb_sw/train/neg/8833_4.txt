For any offense to practitioners (all set up good performances), the whole story did not work well. The movie opens for a great zinger: the old boy guy car car of the little Aborigine road. But then, we have to endure 40 minutes of character development and a new group of characters ... and we don't know why until 40 minutes has increased. It turns out to be the ones who finally discover the girl's body ... and the story continues from there. <br /> <br /> When the story takes at that time, it goes anywhere. After 2 hours, I asked myself: Was this something, or was it just to see the characters fighting against racism and ignorance of how they used discovery? The story was finally unsuitable and felt unsuccessful. Although well done, there is not enough spine in the film to approve it.
