To a large extent, I mean, when I first started watching the show I thought was good. But the plots were even worse. The story of the story was either very or predictable. George is not always funny, sometimes makes stupid. His joke is reduced. Her mother is a silliest character of the show. How can a mother treat her child the same way, if she was a daughter, but this was her son. I offer this 4/10 show just because the first few show it is a little funny. Actors Constance Marie and Masiela Lusha do a good job. He does not know how these shows play for a long time. If you are too tired if I had anything else to watch, I would like to show you this look.
