A black boy becomes a rich white player, and a rich young man seems to agree with hip-hop culture, and a lot of "funny" films off this. The problem is that it doesn't work and almost doesn't work. Well, so no one could expect Lance to grab the same body and suddenly start acting like Charles Wellington. That would be very much to ask. I will give them. But at the same time, it goes far beyond the other direction. I should think of a white rap player and overthrow things, playing as he is a bastion of hip-hop culture, and just people * agree *? And what about Sontee, who loves and he * like a rich white guy *, though he doesn't care about his money or power? This is absolutely impossible not a sad thing. I couldn't stop the unbelief and I couldn't finish the film. I added one extra star because it made me laugh, even hard, several times. But I can not only get more than a "white boy doing hip hop" that has never been well done in any movie I ever saw that is trying. This was not an exception.
