I would like to recommend this unless you are very interested in David Copperfield and want to "complete the set". There are good performances (e.g. Uria Heep) and the guided time (e.g. beating), but in general it is similar to comparison to the 1999 edition of the BBC, with previous versions. There is an unpredictable change for a story that does not serve good purposes except, possibly, wipe (stolen cases being a case for sure). American writers were well chosen: Sally Field is a good actor, but he is wrong as Betsy Trotwood, and his English emphasis is better than cockney Dick Van Dyke. I can see why Michael Richards was chosen to play Mr Micawber; he reduces it rather, however, and irritating. He also says his lines with an emphasis that goes beyond eccentric and becomes just preposterous. Anthony Andrews is as dangerous as Mr Murdstone, but one almost intends to give the black cape and tie David's mother on the railway line (though this is perhaps part of Dickens). <br /> <br /> I got this for free with the newspaper. It was helped to pass on Sunday afternoon, but I felt more desperate than the last beat
