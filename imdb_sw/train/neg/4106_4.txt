It was very difficult for me that this film would be a garden but I was desperate. After becoming a player of Pekinpah movies for years, I found this DVD, reduced significantly, to sell and think it was worth the shot. A few opening loans, a special sign for Pekinpah fans, has a cuts between man and animal, but here we have an immersion sound for children playing in school when a bomb is planted. A wonderful celebration. Then, when stopping, Caan and Duval, traveling on their next mission, Duval drives a bomb on Cann that his last night had a STD, it was found only by losing his pocket when Cann was next to him. The next laughter is amazing, and it is revered by Brian Depalma wearing a kill, at the expense of Angle Dickenson. The problem with the elite of the Killer is that after the opening loans, the film falls flat. Even the Elder I General Alfredo Garcia has the value of production, confidence for anyone who knows what I'm talking about. I use Pekinpah's credit as additional teaching material, but soon after it was finished, the Muslims of Killer.
