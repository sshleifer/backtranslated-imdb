Only children under the age of 12 should be allowed to see this film. All of us should take a book, a MP3 player, or just take a good nap to endure the experience of this event. This can be incorporated properly as a "hitting-up" movie distributed on the TV. Children will want to see this film, and they will love and hate the film.
