As always, I went to watch this film by A.R.Rahman. Otherwise, the film is not recommended. Rajni wanted to finish his film work and this film would have been successful. But fortunately or unfortunately the film was a failure. After this gave a hit by Chandramukhi. I'm waiting for his next Shivaji. <br /> <br /> I have read another user's comments on Rajni. I found it interesting if the user comes from TN too. Rajni is one actor who does, I think, from his heart is not in his mind. He is not an actor like Kamal Hasan. I think we need to know Rajni for his power to go on time. Anyway, I need to fill 10 lines with these comments ... so you want good luck Rajni ......
