I, too, had fraud and installation. I, too, fell to the installation of gory and casing the DVD which claims that "the worst fans like each copy was pulled from the shelves". Although it was cost-effective ($ 6.99), not all was needed - no threat, and a very small year. The end was very happy and did not give the punch that it would have. I don't even know how it was "Nasty Video" and how bad it is. The story comes out, the characters are open-act actors ... does not live according to the promise. The bonus feature of the DVD ("interview") is very strange as the director looks very much and not all there. The leading actor of the act as seen in Shakespearean production. It's a great laugh.
