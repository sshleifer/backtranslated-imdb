I lost 5.75 to see this amazing movie so I just want to know a few things: <br /> <br /> What a dog's point is divided into half at the start of the movie, the disease has nothing to do with split half. What motivated Karen into the shed, has already been infected with her room, they could tie her out where she would be safe. <br /> <br /> Why was Hermit going around the forest to ask visitors to help her when she could just ask her family, a pig woman, to take her to the hospital? Why did he not have 'Can any of the perpetrators be concerned about walking in the city to get help when things start to get worse, are they all lazy? Even if Paul was threatened by a w / shotgun guy considering a wife, Paul could send Jeff or Bert back home to ask for help. The girl who loves is impaired. <br /> <br /> What was the box thing? <br /> <br /> Why did Jeff go back to the cabin after the departure when everyone else was infected, if he was a great jerk to leave in the first place would not just return home? <br /> <br /> As the police went through all the trouble to gather children and burn on the fire hole, why they gave Paul half into the river, it was not necessary even for the plot because the water had been destroyed. Who makes lamonade out of the river water, the trick has dirt leaves and bugs in it. Why these two children could not only use tap water, it was dirty too, so the end of the stupid would still work.
