One of the most forgotten movies that were hit by Row Poverty in the 1930s, was raised by the magic of DVD. Lion / Atwill player (often a helper in many of Frankenstein's films) as a pair of twins that are involved in the murder. One kills the victims (the perpetrators involved in the scandal) and asks the witnesses for a real time, and the other is deaf and is seen "innocent" because he cannot speak to the witnesses. Of course, where it falls off as if it is a discovery of birth, did not both deaf? Oh, well. It works very well here, making it deaf and deaf. Unfortunately, there is no one here who can make a valuable act.
