This movie was still a waste of time ... Why oh why do I continue to rent a crap like this? ... someone please tell me ... * sigh * Oh well. Refer to a nearby film: Cube Zero is best suited if you really enjoyed the first film, (like I did), and just want to look at what's on the last film (hopefully) shared together to put the poor administrators and screens employed, then without This course is a movie for you. But if you are looking for a good film and acting good with a wonderful plot ... * evil grin * then this movie is definitely for you :-D .... OK I'm lying ... At the best time this movie is approaching. Well, I must admit that other elements were good. Well ... well and I laughed a few times, feeling bad things, but yet I was charged. :-) But all of the few things that are not suitable for the "ok" is not enough to make this film quite valuable. Unless you count "Manos - Hands of Fate" one of the top ten EVER movies!
