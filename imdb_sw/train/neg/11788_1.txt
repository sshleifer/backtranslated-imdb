This was one of the worst movies than every !!!!!!!! It was so bad, I was surprised through the whole movie! The plot was SO cheesy; especially the end. This movie turns from the end of the world-saving e-eles season! I mean, c'mon! And I swear ... I think they are using SOCK PUPPETS for eyes! And there was a horrible scene of middle kiss with two characters who had been divorced. How predictable! It was so terrible that my mother, my sister, and I could not finish, and when we finished, it was about a year later! The second time we watched it and we fulfilled it at this time, we made MST3K comments in all the film. <br /> <br /> Summary: Just watch this if you're a movie basher! Make a hint view, see here for sleepover to laugh, and I mean great laughs. Also look for shock. An example of this film: this movie is a very crowded field of cheese and puppets of sock!
