This is the only answer to yahoo who says this film is more realistic than the classic, genre elaborate MASTERPIECE, Jaws. Yes, brainiac, white whites (and other types of shark, beef, black tip, white sea tip, tiger) are known to many places where easy animals are found. Humans do not often make it on the list, it has been given, but the shark in the film was repeatedly described to show unusual behavior. It's not like it never happened. The deaths of the whale's wreaths destroy near the entire city, playing human crocodiles, swallowing several thick basins filled with the North Atlantic lakes and knowing when some people, all the friends of the "nemesis" preceded above, have close to the water so they reach , it's very small to be interesting. Such as this wasteful turd. Laughable. The big white pope is also known to often chew on boats, underwater pools and people on the raft and surfboards, since they seem like seals from the bottom. Shark's size of Bruce (if you do not know, see) would have been more than able to sink the boat like The Orca (hey! That's the name of a good despair we discuss!), If it could measure more than 6,000 lbs. I would like to continue, but I don't need. Jaws are amazing (best act, excellent effects, best music, better writing), Orca is a crap (BLATANT eliminate Jaws, writing lousy, disgusting effects, conspiracy plot on this side of Olson Twins Flick). It doesn't take masters from Columbia University to see it. Watch the best movies.
