O dear, oh dear ... <br /> <br /> For JM fans, this was a nail in the coffin until the A-list of Hollywood's work was concerned. After a stable turn in a girl can not help, Bus Busturi, Burglar and Rock Hunter seemed to Jayne was well on the way to become one of the hot stars of the city of Tinsel. However, the emphasis and the racy of the racy and the appearance of this force that caused Mansfield to the other side, that is, the lower price of the Euro loan until the Fox could leave its contract for first place. <br /> <br /> This movie is really diabolical to lose everyone's time except Suzy Parker who is the only thing in this very bad film for devices. Many people blame the poor Jayne and his grating performance by returning the poor to this film at the box office and when he is in pain in this film, he can only do his best with the equipment. After all, Cary can not put the screen on the fire he? After returning to Jayne took 10 steps back in his track as a great actor to accept (just for the appearance and Grant) to show this squealing, idiotic menace. Alice's character is a full song of the cartoon and though it seems to be good to eat in the boiler suit, everything that appears on the film reduces your nerves. We all know Jayne can do better than this output and still here around as a prize pudding. Real shame. Request this clear comedy. It's more trouble than funny.
