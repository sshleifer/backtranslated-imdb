What a bad movie! For some reason, science and outdoor laboratories have grubby workers, dirty, strong, misanthropes living inside. These people who may work together on complex scientific projects cannot be seen to agree on how to live death in the hands of the CGI dragon. Traders: A well-informed scientist whose great skills to work is “talking” and “looking at sin” has taken a dragon. When labor had to work on this kind of thing, other scientists were amazed, because it seemed they were all back in their experiments and caught with their pants down. Some of the stories are like THING, or a few Indians of ten, where employees are dispersed and killed if they are trying to create a way to escape and / or defeat "dragon. The CGI dragon is a dark gray, which appears to be a popular color for the most cost-effective CGI. It doesn't seem better than cartoon, and black gray tones makes it hard to see any interesting details in the body of the Dragon. All it looks is a gray blob. Acting is less awesome. These scientists act as a group of children who cannot agree on anything, and this makes it easier for a dragon to kill off in various attempts to avoid, hide, etc.. Dean Cain is no better than any of the unknown characters in this movie. He seems to sink to the level of his cast. This movie is real, very sad. Acting is bad. Stories are dumb. CGI is very cheap and amateurish. There is nothing worthy of this film, not even a good killer when doing work or other work.
