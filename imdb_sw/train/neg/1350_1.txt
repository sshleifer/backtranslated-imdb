This film deals with the Chief of Emesis Expert's Auditor who has returned many years to the current peace city of Metropolis. The Claw program is to delete the Gadget once and for all using the new "cooler" crimefighter to help destroy the popularity of Gadget. Unfortunately the film fails in amazement, the series was good, but it was raised almost 20 years later with a bad result. Without the voice of Don Adams as the Auditor's Gadget no longer exists; Dr Claw is not just a horrible under threat, but it looks more like a wrestler with a cold, than its original awesome self. This truth is a children's movie, but the plot is very weak (in heaven letting mention animation) that is the same as comparing the previous series. One has decided to fix Penny and bring him for two years faster, now he has a kind of rebel quasi-punk clothing and does not play half of his role in the TV series. Talk of Gadgetmobile, including the angle of the plot which focuses on ONLY talking cars. Maybe I was the only child who loved the show who is grown jaded, but I thought that the live-action version was more painful than I could carry, but now they go with this full spring watering under the TV series series on us. It's more than I can take.
