In some ways, the back of the storyline was the most interesting combination of several types of popular films in an interesting mix. However, there is no point in this film was very clear that it did not deserve to blow close shots. I felt as if I had been hit on the head and the strange details of the disease that kills people. The author appears to have only photographed pictures from other films as an alternative to writing lines taken for real characters. The characters did not help things. No chemistry. I think they were supposed to develop some kind of attraction just because it is an important element of these stories. However, the authors did not work very hard to develop chemistry. Indeed, both are attractive, but if they attract each other it seems to be an open question. Turner's attitude of faith shows on the Sabbath of development very quickly and without some reason. The practice of the Sabbath should be a doctor who cannot be seen to have a law. Consider the behavior of Jeff Goldblum in "Independence Day." Typically, that kind of behavior should show some kind of talent or beauty. The Sabbath character does not. He is Cassandra and only the knowledge of the things and the eight ball of magic. It seems to be equal to random position. Death / death is a wonderful experience. Each actor was trying a little more difficult to show the pain that had happened to them. Symptoms are seen as bad soil, such as video from 80 years, Peter Gabriel, I think.
