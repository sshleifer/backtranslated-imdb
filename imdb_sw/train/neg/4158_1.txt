That's by far the worst films I saw! <br /> <br /> I can honestly say that I've never seen a movie worse than this! <br /> I WELCOME !!!! <br /> I 'm a BIG fan of "B" movies of awesome. As you can think .... I've been exposed to some of the worst that the film industry should provide. I was thrown to this film with his head. I mean yommon ... what a true fan of fear did not want to have fun with the title "Vampires vs Zombies" ??? Photos of "undead" fighting with "undeath" played in my head. I thought myself ... "this must I see" !!! <br /> <br /> Well .... sorry to say ... "this I would not have seen" !!!!! This movie is very confusing to say a bit. There were vampires fighting zombies. In fact, no plot !!!! If you would like to ask me what this film all about I can tell you honestly I don't know !!! <br /> <br /> There was no plot! No story !!! <br /> <br /> This movie is completely inappropriate! !!! At the end of this debate ... I found myself feeling sorry for the poor people who had invested money in this project for sure they don't mean business
