I lost this DVD after seeing it when I watched something else. When I saw the head on the jacket I couldn't believe my eyes. I read Yalom's book about a year ago and loved it, to really impress the work of Yalom in general. (I am a clinical psychologist.) I watched the 30 minutes of this movie and I had to turn off. I don't know if I can take a lot more. At a high level, false ideas, as some have said, only convince them of the best and are offensive and cause worse. Acting is lighter when it should be enthusiastic and pleasant when it should be bad. The show of Lou Salome is just flippant, and Freud's wise comes away as a school student. I see very little of the spirit of the book given so far. I was hoping to be able to recommend this film to my students. Instead, I will take them to the book. Imagine that.
