The biggest event of violence. <br /> <br /> The film goes from one place to another, and next to every violence comes out. Now it is not the person who has been affected by violence, and the film without fighting it has something missing. But, please, not one after another. My answer was not shocking or frightened, it was: "Here we go again." There is a story of the story between the incidents of violence, but two-thirds of the way through the film I totally shut out, and I can't wait to end. If the best film makers can do, they should find something else to do with their sad life, like making shoes or giving letters.
