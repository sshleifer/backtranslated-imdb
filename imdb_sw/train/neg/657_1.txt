POM NIGHT (2008) <br /> <br /> Guided by: Nelson McCormick <br /> <br /> stars: Bretagne Brittany, Scott Porter, Jessica Stroup, and Dana Davis plot: Three years ago, Donna (Brittany snow ) he witnessed the death of his whole family by the hands of his teacher (Jonathan Schaech) who had slightly reduced. Now, he is preparing his friend the pastor and his sad friends. Once there, it begins to die directly because the killer came out of jail and no one was injured to warn Donna because it seems that his prom is very important to intervene. It makes a profit: I have cut a few good out of the film due to a terrible conversation and a dumb attitude. Everybody has decided to tell Donna that a person who cannot be caught by him (he doesn't seem to be good) has fled from prison. Their reason: They don't want to embarrass him in front of all his friends. LOL <br /> <br /> cons: I would like to start by saying I am a big fan of slasher. I usually have fun and even bad. I even like the awesome PG-13 films. TOURIST TRAP (1979), one of my favorites, was originally rated PG. I also enjoy POLTERGEIST (1982) and GRUDGE (2004). So the fact that this is a duplicate film of PG-13 has nothing to do and I enjoy the movie. First of all, I had a big problem with stories. I love slasher films that don't even have stories. At least they can have entertainment. This is about a teacher who loves her and her student, so she kills all her family. A few years later, he tries to provoke him to destroy the prom and kill all his friends ...? Then there were streams that I doubt that anyone cares. Claire (Jessica Stroup) fights with her boyfriend, she has sand, and I didn't care. This should be a feature of Life, not a remake of PROM NIGHT. <br /> <br /> And then ... this is a slasher film with tragic deaths. I don't care even though it is not good, some of my favorite slashers (HALLOWEEN, CURTAINS, original PROM NIGHT) were not yet but they had an effective murder. Here, we have half of those who die in the hotel room apart from the screens, a woman injured several times without injuries to injury, and near the face of the bad actor as she screams in pain. I am sure that girls aged 10 were afraid, but not me. I also hated the characters. There was a friend of Donna Bobby (Scott Porter) and I can assure you that you will never meet a partner who is lighter in your life, unless you are a male. Then we had a contemptible friends of Donna Claire (Stroup) and Lisa (Dana Davis), and a girl for Chrissy's (Brianne Davis). If you thought the characters in the KINGDOM KING were sad, try to watch this film. Don't give us Ronnie (Collins Pennie) and DJ (Jay Phillips) who gave me flashbacks for Usher's performance at SHE'S ALL. <br /> <br /> Add to everything predicting action that turns out, awesome soundtrack and a great lack of respect for the original material, and you have absolutely stinker.
