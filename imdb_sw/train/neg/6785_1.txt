> Warning this is a spoiler! > This movie is so bad that I doubt I can write enough lines. The greater the shots patterns were well thought out. The participants were very good especially Richard pryor tho I'd like to see more of it. Madeline Kahn and John houseman were ordinary. Dudley More God bless him he could do well. John Ritter again I'd like to see more of it. In my opinion this failure is entirely due to the failure of the author. Perhaps the producer could be pulled out immediately when he saw what he had created. It is so bad that a lot of money has come into this boiler, while with little change here and there it would have been in my opinion made it. They had to pay the standards of the authors. In order to produce one blade.
