okay. at the beginning, the taxi driver is amazing. this, this is not a taxi driver or amazing. what is wrong. but I thought it was funny funny, which means that it had some features of redemption. like talk ... wow. there was more or less conspiracy, all the characters were ignorant, and the movie was preaching. there were some places I was thinking the movie could dive into the violence of a taxi driver's type, which would have hit a message at the end of the film on a very difficult head. I can't even believe that there are 20 other people who have seen this film. Yes, it's worth checking if you're really bored and want to prove the fact that anyone can make a movie, or at least they can try.
