*** SPOILERS *** Let's start with the "good" of this film - the work of Cynthia Rothrock and Richard Norton. Some of the acting are bad (this is not supported by an angry script). Worse is man, Buntao, the head of the Asian crime union (played by Frans Tumbuan). I cut my head as he described his "fury" about losing money for money; bad performance. Patrick Muldoon is not much better, and "his hostile line" (that's the rest of the title of this film) was given as bad as a person can do. There are no other main characters, but no other actor / actress was known in this film. We next come on the plot. This should tell you all you need to know: In the original "Rage and Honor," Cynthia Rothrock, who plays Chris Fairchild, was a teacher in the inner city. Now, he is C.I.A. agent (or was another government organization - sorry, but this film was so bad I did not remember it). Hmmm ... I can think of what C.I.A. The application process was. Interviewer: What is the old work experience? Chris: I was a teacher. Interviewer: OK; you are employed! I just offers "2" because of the good working and good plot to lose the end (although we know that Tommy (Muldoon), the secret villain, will be taken).
