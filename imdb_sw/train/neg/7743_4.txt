This film was one of the worst I have ever seen. It is a mixture of mixed police and play for two Hollywood investigators, Harrison Ford and Josh Hartnett, investigating shooting at a hip hop club. The plan comes from there are many ways to develop. Ford comes in real estate on the other side (Martin Landau is one of his customers), Hartnett runs a yoga school where he hits his chicks at the right time, both of them facing surveillance and interior, Ford facing old partner (Lena Olin) IA's investigator and he is a psychic who has a radio show, a man who has launched a murder at the club is an old dirt player who beat Hartnett's father years ago. Toss in the car must be standing with some attempt to ignore the humor, and that's about the matter of this turkey.
