This movie is far away from the worst film made. If you have to create a film that turns a boy who plays Lars in more powerful things than making a damn film. I should say that I could look at the Leprechaun at 6 times before watching the trailer for this POS film. Adam sandler should be limited from any film after this embarrassment. Watching this film is like a mix of listening to Cher and voluntarily put your dick in a blender. Anyone with half of the brain's brain will know that this film is not suitable for dime. If I had an extra dollar and I had to use it, I would give support to Lorraina Bobbitt before buying this movie.
