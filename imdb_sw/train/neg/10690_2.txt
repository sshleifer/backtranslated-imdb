I think possible that I've seen bad movies, but this is a real stinker! the plot is meaningless but that is not worse. The guide is not where you close to what you would expect from andy ching. he has the ability to do a good job but failed to pull this movie together. <br /> <br /> angie harmon, play female leadership as a journalist who is behind the murder of the president, really worked. there was no chemistry and beauty, her character was flat and timber, and 5 inches high in which she was wearing all the movies were not stupid. This decision for harmon puts its place under the "b" list. <br /> <br /> and what was a good cube to think ??? she has to lend her a number of best displays, but this was far less than what we've been expecting from her. <br /> <br /> poor james wood and reynolds burt. poor poor poor.
