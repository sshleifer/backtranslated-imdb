I rarely make these comments but I felt compelled to rescue others the pain I endured while watching this film. They are very foolish and are not taken into account in the general story and details that you cannot stop unbelief. The problem begins early, when you see a government researcher next to the new Porsche and eating with his team in a barrier that looks like a castle, leading to Capitol Building in Washington, D.C. That kind of life in government salary? Ha! It's just bad. Near the end, when the wicked man kills the good boys, the last group does so in ignorance that you want them to die, to clean the gene village. Special effects are good - any producer's money can buy it - and chief executives have been older in other films, but the screenplay and patterns here are moronic. Many people have wondered if there is a deliberate mind behind the old film Paul Verhoeven, the stupid (Showgirls, Starship Troopers), but this film should stop surprising. He is just bad.
