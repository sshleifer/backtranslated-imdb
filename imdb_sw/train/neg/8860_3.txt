Okay, if everyone says, this film is a perfect dog. To some extent this is because it was a sex gory film which had many exciting things (or dark under invisible appearance) to avoid the rating of X; but the film has many other errors. At the beginning, the author seems to have hadwolves and his vampires mixed. Baddies in this film are furry and do not like money but for every other respect they do as vampires. Now you can not only do that with a flick of a fukra type, you should be connected to the rules of the type or fans to get all confused and angry to stop unbelief in something wrong. In fact the whole plot (confusion and non-presentation) is something that has already been done for vampires, but it is not good for any movie to bewolf. <br /> <br /> Secondly, waswolf's clothing is the lights you have ever seen. Anyone in the movie's business waswolf should know that the dress waswolf and change is something that fans evaluate substantially, but some of these waswolves are just goofy. <br /> <br /> There are a few good bits. I really loved the score. Some have mentioned Sybil Danning's tits. And ... <br /> <br /> (*** SPOILER ***, if something like that could be there) <br /> <br /> I also liked to attack a waswolves castle. There are many horrible movies that depend on suspicious characters, but in this case they get the first good weapon to fight the waswolf and go to death. I mean, you can kill waswolves and money ammunition, and we have very good weapons these days. Shouldn't be too hard to put two and two together, hmm? But in the usual style this film goes up and adds some of the most zany and exciting anti-lycanthrope weapons.
