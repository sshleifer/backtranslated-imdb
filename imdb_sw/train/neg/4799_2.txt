I am a great fan of awesome films of less than 80 budget. This is not worse but still not interesting. The plot line is decent but it draws out for too long. You miss a half of the movie before you see any zombie action. You kill not very creativity and zombies are not very cunning. In fact I think this movie would be better if they left the zombies and made it a certain fia. It seems but I feel that this film stole at least an hour of my life. I will give them a credit for that of nature. If you're really on horror B movies it's worth watching but if it's not, don't bother. But you don't take my word for it.
