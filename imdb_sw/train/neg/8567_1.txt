When I lost this movie, I had a very good hope ...... but when I saw it, I realized that the movie was small (too low) than I expected. Employees were bad (the wife's doctor was one of the worst), the story was stupid ... it could work for the Disney movie (except for murder), but this is not a comedy, it is a masterpiece of the folly of folly. Title is well selected except for one thing: they can add a stupid film after the Dead Men! I give 0 and half out of 5.
