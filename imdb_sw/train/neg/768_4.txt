I agree with many Columbo fans that this film was a necessary change of structure. Columbo is a unique fault and police tactics. This movie looks like a remake of any casual spying games from the past. And that's the reason for the disturbance, because Columbo is not a common detective. There are two parts in this film that has left me amazing. First, I can't recognize the title of this film. Misleading. Perhaps the best title could be "Pastor" or something else. Second, Columbo hides a piece of evidence without giving reasons (for at least the audience) why it does. I don't feel betrayed, desperate. I am happy Peter Falk to return to the common Columbo. <br /> <br />
