I can't waste my time to write an essay and waste your time. I would like to say, however, that all those who insist on this film even made is to be totally ignorant. Johnnymacbest, you can't play that card, and I mean a national patriotic card, making people not watch this film. this is a movie that shows his free will in this country (oh yes i play that card) although the director is German and deserves to be executed on the hand every time he gets to the camera, but the world is full of controversy, and one thing you've heard before, like the GTA controversy. It's comedy, laughing and worried, not all offensive, its dark humor and certainly you have no heart to take, past have passed, yes people remember those lost but its time to continue, that was !!! 7 !!! years ago. You can still watch this film and have good moral values. Besides, I am insane, and who needs a soul?
