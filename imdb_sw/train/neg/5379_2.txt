Released on a DVD in the UK as Ax, Choke is a young slasher that drastically fails every department: the story is almost no, causing a film that includes many people walking around the dark building; except the two characters (which are obviously the film's followers), everyone is the opposite, meaning that the viewer cannot take care of the little while they are being killed; deaths are not enough (except for a short pound of meat pound in an artificial blood is turned into your stomach); and the free sex area is found around any dirt (wrong offense to do in the flick of the slasher!) <br /> <br /> Blind program sees the members of the punk band locked into what appears to be the world's biggest night club (there are endless zones of neglect and apartments, unlike any club I ever saw) where they are taken by an invisible defendant. With a low budget effort, production values ​​are the same, and they all seem to be capable enough, but with a lack of real sense, the absence of confusion (this is a slasher, so where is the graphic splatter?), The way of a terrible conversation (especially from a player who was not dead-fast-enough) and misuse of tacky video in an attempt to add a certain style, the movie becomes very fast.
