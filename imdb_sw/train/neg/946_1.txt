Why does this show that they are popular? It's beyond me why people like it. I think it's one of the worst sitcoms out there. Because it's so popular, I've tried more than once to look at it and I can't do it through the whole section. <br /> <br /> For one thing, acting is awesome. Everyone is busy with the point where it intends to look. They speak in an unusual tone, using unusual tones, and have a strange language. I found it better to work in a kindergarten school. Something else, not FUNNY. Plots are preferable. They are not creative, intelligent, or FUNNY. What? Not sitcom should not be funny? Why not? <br /> <br /> At the end, what is seven years on this? It is about the truth of the seventy years as "Happy Days" was 50 years. Who hit this dweeb? And now does the movies? Oh, save us all! If people think this is a high-quality television, it sounds to me.
