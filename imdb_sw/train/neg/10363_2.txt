I have grown up on the wrinkle stories of Wrinkle in the Middle Ages. My dream was that one day the scribe could meet their child sitting on a big sofa reading A Winkle in Time, and he would think, what a wonderful movie that would do. Unfortunately, the reporter of the image failed, changing characters, cast to the damp, and all out destroy the plot. I know that it is hard work to change a popular novel movie. But why can't you remain true to the book? Why should you change the way the characters think and act? For those who have not read this book, take it, get a soft bed, and let your mind run wild.
