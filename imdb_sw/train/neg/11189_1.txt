Always enjoy the great films associated with the natural and deep natural sense of the spiritual world. However, this film has just left me away from its production and direction. There is nothing to enter into a deep discussion about what this story describes; all I can say is that it was a great waste of time and effort to put it on the big screen. Actors, Mark Addy, Thomas Garrett, gave the best performance in his British country, and we have seen him in the "TV position". Heath Ledger, played the dude of the real evil and we saw him recently in "Brokeback Mountain", '05, gave a great opportunity to help. Shannyn Sossaman, (Mara Sinclair), did a good job of deceiving the priest from the church that was not recognized by any faith. Don't waste your time, you will have pity!
