Let me begin by saying that I consider myself one of the most vivid films (many!) ... Film is my passion, and I am usually in my rental-movie area. .. I also feel the need to add that I often ask ME for advice on movies whenever I come there, and I have not seen the ability to leave the place without having a discussion or exchange of ideas on what is going on the film-worship area ... renting stuff, and that's why this movie was suggested by one of the boys in the video-video area. He said he thought I should see this, and since the file said something about it being a movie with Jodorowsky (one of my favorites!) Sky, I took it. The choices I have given here are not right, because I didn't have the right to think it was bad, I just didn't know how to measure it otherwise. The question of the question would be more suitable ... <br /> <br /> This is the first and only film that made me sick for my stomach: I felt sick! What? Am I the only one whose stomach has turned? I didn't want you to turn it off, or maybe I can't because I was attracted to the wrong ... <br /> <br /> I don't want to see this film again. It's not bad, 1 as I said. It's not my cup of tea (or just eating it) ...
