This film is very amazing. The man wants to take revenge - but when he rejects revenge - there is a video camera explaining all the time. Who is the person who has the brain's head in his head to sit there and do so long before the video camera? Only the fact that this document can not even happen unless someone who cannot bind it destroyed it for me - but it's got dumber! <br /> <br /> I think writers of the script have bad habits that are cooking their brain cells and making them out of the holes of the plot can run a batch of armored tanks through. <br /> <br /> PLOT: A person wants to take revenge for the death of loved ones, but in the middle of a plot something goes to the opposite, and then it will not be expected. These people just write this story were not dumb like writing it completely unrealistic turns that never will happen in this way. For authors I say - search for help with your great mental problem.
