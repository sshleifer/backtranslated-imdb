Steve Carpenter can't make awesome movies. First of all, throwing was very bad for this film. The best part alone was a colorful colored colored red color from Buffy Vampire Slayer. These movies do not have a monster (usually a key link on a terrible movie), no action, no acting, and no emphasis (it is also an important link). Wes Bentley is a good actor but he is dry and clear in this that is sad. There were a few parts that had to be funny (continue with a boy / hate movie) and no one was laughing at the audience. I thought that this film was rated R, and I was not careful and realized that it had been changed to PG-13. Otherwise, watch this film if you like Me Still I know what you did Summer Summer. That's the only kind of person who could get this movie even awesome. And by weight, this is Steve Carpenter, stand up to make awesome movies. This film makes Scream look like a Chainsaw massacre of Texas.
