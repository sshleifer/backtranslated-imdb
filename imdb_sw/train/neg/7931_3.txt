The blast of television stations should be grateful forever for the production line of Randolph Scott Western, because at any time there must be one of what looks like 100 Randolph Scott movies to play at least one center and budget. "The Man behind Guns" is an early example of the 1950s of melodrama and pre-WWII production standards which depend on the secret plot of the killing of historical killings and practical events to hide the lack The complete script of character development, and thus lacking doubts. In the coming years the role of these films will be taken by TV shows as 'Gunsmoke', 'Bonanza', etc. - and these worked well. Randolph Scott, looking particularly grizzled in this, is a good man, struggling against bad people against who will ultimately win. There is no greater interest in what it stimulates emotion than what his horse is feeling, unless you wonder if he will know your previous misunderstanding and the female leadership at the end. Music is a strong symbol of the emotional state of 'characters' rather than acting. But it's good if it climbs your boat; and I did not cut you to enjoy 'Discover, Kill', or. <br /> <br /> Work of workers, walking, and aging quickly. 3 stars for effective installation together; 0 for artistic efforts.
