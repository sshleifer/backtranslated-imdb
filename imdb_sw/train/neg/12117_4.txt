Can you say yourself, "Don Johnson as Elvis? Is that work? Is it possible? It seems like a horrible choice to me, but maybe I should have a clear mind. Maybe I'll be surprised. Maybe he can get it out." NOT! Don Johnson is not a bad practice. But he is Elvis terrible. He is too young, he said very weak, he has also been in a hurry ... well you have ever thought about how bad he would be. Add to that the black hokey wig with the foot of the line and the mascara and it is a huge aggressive fuel. The best I can say is that since Johnson's acting is polite and since his joke is so far, over time you think even if Elvis again. You see him as another star of the lungs instead. Then, at the same rate, the movie becomes visible. Stephanie Zimbalist also should not be thrown as a beautiful, beautiful woman, Linda Thompson. But he is attracted to his own righteousness and plays a part with honesty, beauty and intelligence we expect from all his responsibilities. There may be a lot of intelligence in its performance. You should be a type of dope to cling to the dope to misuse. <br /> <br /> Nothing new in this story; we've heard it many times before. If you have searched for new information or understanding, you will not find it. It is told as the story of love - one that is not required: Linda for Elvis and Elvis for drugs.
