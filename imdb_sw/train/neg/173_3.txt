A good sequel, but does not have a packet of the original horn. The author of the screenwriter (Judd Nelson) includes a new identity to lead his own novel CABIN AND LAKE. Still killing evil, but the movie seems very tongue-in-cheek. Any humor is not kind of funny. The total project seems to have the quality of quickie and sometimes Nelson is the highest way. This film is about a script written before going to the screen ... this should happen on this script.
