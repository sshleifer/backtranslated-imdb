Beaudray Demerille (frail Peter Fonda, who also led), a gambling player, leads young Wanda "Nevada" (good, but not talented Brooke Shields) in a poker game. With the impossible pair (of course) comes to find Indian gold in the Grand Canyon. That's a story and no need to find more meaning in it. Not only. Acting is too weak, which was quite a surprise from the fact that Peter Fonda was leading. If you are looking for something interesting in this film, check out the beautiful environment and beautiful looks of young Brooke Shields. His character is however very irritating (especially at the beginning) and dumb, that never never comes as sexy or appealing. It's not bad, but, from the story, I doubt that anything more can be done with this. I wonder why Peter Fonda was directed and given a star in this film. He should have spoken to his father (Henry Fonda) in coming (meaningless) in this confusion of ignorance. Unfortunately, this is their only film. Couldn't Henry be in EASY RIDER for example? 3/10
