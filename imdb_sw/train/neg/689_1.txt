What ...... is this? This should, of course, be a great waste of films, settings and cameras forever. I know you can't put your high expectations of the 80 slasher, but this is very ridiculous to be true. I give this film for $ 0.89 and I still feel a desire to go and claim my money back. Can you imagine who is tough? STINKS? Who is a powerful killer in this film and what inspires it? Well really, you can't take care of possible care. And why should you? The makers of this litter certainly did not care. They did not try to create a bit of tension. Director (Stephen Carpenter - I think it's easy to get money for such a name) also made Kindred (1986) which was fun and recently made the Salvation Spirit. Grab the full too, but at least he had Eliza Dushku. This junk has first Daphne Zuniga !!! (Who?) Yes, it's true, Mouse's Mouse. His most unpredictable behavior dies around 15 minutes. He is the second person to die. The first victim dies directly in the first minute, but no one seems to mention or forget the future and who cares? Some of the characters ... were not eligible for real-time executives, not really interested. You expect to die for a quick and painful death ... and not just their characters <br /> <br /> My humble attitude = 0/10
