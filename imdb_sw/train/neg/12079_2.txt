The evil will have gone around his grave if he could have this enough German-TV adaptaon to play his classic. It is obvious that a very little money spent on it. Increasingly, the catwalk and some columns set by randomly decreased. The movie was ineptly dubbed in English, and English actors voice regularly mumbling their lines. All production was dark and dreary to feel much. And just where Fonterbras in this movie however? MST3K provided this kind of tender treatment that deserves it. <br /> <br /> Be or not? I would like this movie never was the first place.
