I watched this film last night and I was looking for the best after watching all the cool trailers. When the DVD cover was beautiful, just as I started looking I was thinking like others "oh my God what this is". when it was a little creepy but then the mood was destroyed by stupid music. There was a rock and opera during what was supposed to be suspenseful scenes. That's where the damage was for me and I was shaking head to think Damn I lost money again on hiring and being deceived by the art of the well. In contrast to the music itself, it was just in the wrong places of the film. All editors of the film do not have the option they do. The electricity, indicating that they were caught in the stormy sea. This would be more interesting but it did not happen. Acting is not the worst I have ever seen to be unknown and this is obviously their first film. Another reason I had been disappointed was the plot was not minded. At the beginning 2 people felt all the young people get on the boat, then at the end it should only be the girl 1 we were and the other were either his friends thinking or were ghosts I did not know because it was very displayed. WhyteFox who wrote a comment here says this is a true story. He believes in the spirit and spirit and says there is a haunted boat in this film that has been made. There was no mention of this film about being a true story I've never seen anything like that but I didn't say it was impossible. I think if anyone has a desire to rent this movie, do so at your own risk. If you like horror movies of amateur students you can love this.
