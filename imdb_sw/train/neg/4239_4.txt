This was better than the average movie I thought, because it is located on the cable. I expected something on the line of the cheesy melodrama and the bad effects that were seen in class as Christmas rush or First Lady / Target / Shot, etc.. It was well-chosen ... I loved Ron Livingston as the most powerful SWAT Commander. It is good to see him again experiencing the same material that he was very lucky with the Band of Brothers. Producers and designers had done their homework because all the events and shots looked like they did that day back in 1997. So, if you get a chance to see this film, and I'm sure that FX loses everything 50 times ... take 2 hours and enjoy.
