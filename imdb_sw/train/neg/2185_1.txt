... or audience. Refer to the latest .... You've found this doctor who has tried the body parts stolen for some obvious reason. He wants to enter full, but he feels he needs to do it in his apartment. WTF ??? Then suddenly, unfortunately, and easily, his partner gets his head cut off by a traffic accident that HE is responsible for. Sucked with disease, he keeps his head in a pot of lasagna (or is strudel?) And the pump is full of "adreno-serum" (sic) to preserve it. Then he wakes up, pointing to his head (by saying) even though his neck was locked in the string, and he had no lungs so he could not talk even if he had 'em. It seems bch praise is not appreciated all that his partner has done for him. Such as the woman ..... / / <br /> Then her sadness turns to the handkerchief as she sees the possibility of combining her beloved head on the body of the first sleeve band that can take off the street. At the same time, a doctor's assistant, a kind of dime-Igor shop, gets a philosophical argument with the head, who has hit a telekinetic friendship with a "monster in the closet" (each mad scientist has one). Finally the picture writer understands that he cannot continue to comfort misogyny and fear of friendships on ad ad infinitum, so he kills everyone, then it is possible to go to the bank to check before the financing financiers have the opportunity to stop payments on it. Have I said that I think this is a bad movie? A person who has to tell Turner Classic movies to show the intended version without gory elements. A supporter's view of his hand is broken, pirouetting around the house without stopping a lot of blood wherever it is worth only.
