I don't believe all the features of this film. Playing with movies was Sleuth. Michael Caine wants to be Olivier, and Reeves wants him to be Caine. Caine even had the courage to make a remake of Sleuth and Jude Law to play its original part. Jude Law? Do you mean that "Alfie"? <br /> <br /> This movie was made during the work of Caine when it was obvious that she needed to pay off debt. He would do anything for money. He could star in the winning films such as this, and "More Poseidon Adventure". What seems to be a trailing character for this movie is Reeves death. He deserves more than a memorable movie for this lousy movie. And so Caine. This movie can be found in $ 5.97 bin at Walmart. With gems like "Island", and "Criticism in Rio".
