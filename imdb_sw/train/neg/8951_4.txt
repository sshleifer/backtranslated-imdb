I am a great fan of the book and Orwell is certainly my favorite reader since studying the Animal Studies on the GCSE. I bought a DVD from a great curiosity, Burton is a very respectable actor when I heard that he played the role of O'Brien I had been beaten. I looked at the trailer on the DVD first and some fear began to enter, especially with the "Head of song", and heard the voice of Eurythmics shouted "1984!" The frequent beaten with electricity is as bad as it seems. Work is generally good, Burton and Hurt plays their roles well and tensions in the Ministry of Truth towards the end you can feel, especially in the harsh area of ​​Room 101. However this is also where the movie is . The movie spends a lot of time watching things of Love between Winston and Julia, which actually isn't what Orwell was writing about. He was writing about the horrible future, about how Ingsoc builds the mans' beliefs and then beat them all in his name interested in Big Brother. The movie jumps over what exactly the most important part of the book, Winstons come according to its position in life and the world, and re-education through O'Brien. <br /> <br /> Feedback on IMDb is currently saying that the film connects the book is not quite good. Julia is not there when Winston visits O'Brien, they do not volunteer to Brotherhood Goldstien and confess their mistakes. There is no clear mention of previous events where Winston finds articles and Unpersons but it is not mentioned close to the end, if you have not read the book is completely combining. <br /> <br /> The bad screenplay, which some of the best acting can not save. Michael Radford seems to have completely lost the argument that Orwell was trying to do, and the sound of the electric sound is very clear.
