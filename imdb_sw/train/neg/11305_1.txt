This is very west in the west especially because it is not historically inappropriate. It looks like it was hit on the back in California instead of where Jack Slade lived and died, Idaho, Colorado Territories, and Montana. It records every so-called 'strange' man, 'a good man.' Script is awesome; there is very little direction, and good acting. Dorothy Malone is completely lost as his wife. Mark Steven never found out how to show this amazing Jack Slade. In real life, Jack Slade was a good administrator of action. He was afraid of his people for his fermentation. After drinking he would start the struggle and cause other problems in Virginia City, Montana. In order to ensure that he cannot motivate them again, they took Jack Slade after ignoring their warning to leave the city immediately. This is a bad movie. I can't advise anyone to watch this film except to see how Hollywood holds history in love, even today.
