A very good player ... a leading player made OK ... film, plot etc was completely planned and incorrect can also be good for a good ... whatever was a little or no necessity of Carlitos Way ... and should be avoided as a blow and fans of any means of Carlito ... no mention of Gail in fact he ended up with other aircraft, no mention of Klienfelt, no mention of how he got, no mention how he ended up in jail. .. tried to make it as original with the backs of the flash at the beginning ... but being honest when you looked I was looking for a zero score ... unfortunately I could get a high level ... <br /> <br /> The terrible monetary in what was one of the best films of over 90 ... was generally about Â£ 6 and 2 hours of my life losing ... for "all action" in it, it was really interesting and probable truth ... again for fans of any way to Carltio avoid this fiasco ...
