California's small town of Diablo faces a mysterious death after sheriff Robert Lopez unarths the old box.Legend has that the box contains the Mexican religion of the sixteenth century called Azar.FBI agent Gil Vega is sent to investigate and join forces with The daughter of sheriff, Dominique and Mary fight with evil spirits and blood. "Legend of Diablo" is quite trash. The film should not be a year, the acting is the worst and the trend is wrong. Rental is the only part of the film I enjoyed. I am a great fan of horrible fricks, for example I loved "Torched", "Live Feed", "Bones Disease" or "Watch Watch", unfortunately "Legend of Diablo" is a great park directly to avoid.
