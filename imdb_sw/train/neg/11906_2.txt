Watching "Der himmel über Berlin" as a boy at the end of 80 years was a great experience for me - "so this was what the film could be". With "Paris, Texas" and "Until the End of the World" still has a special place in my heart and mind - a covenant for Wim Wenders specialist. Unfortunately future years have seen a sharp decline in the quality of his work and the "Million Dollar Hotel" and "Land of Many" to strike a terrible step. Gone are the most interesting photos or music. There is no search or show great insight. All that is left is the perpetrators of the covered political information, which drives nothing except the clichés, and actually says the truth of the entire audience. Is run run well? For any reason, it's time for Mr. Wenders to make it or stop it altogether.
