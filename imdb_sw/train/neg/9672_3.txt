Although most films are very popular, the Kosher killings are played, but not true. The Kosher Act states that the animal must be aware when the blade touches the skin. The Kosher massacre is appropriate as anyone who knows who has seen one, or has seen a Peta film showing the murder of Kosher, which the throat of the animal is cut, and the urine is cut while still alive, you know, and it is clear to be sad. We must remember that history is written by the winners. What? Is anyone even allowed to think that perhaps Israel was right? Isn't it saying anything that the Nazi Minister had prevented these religious murders, and the Jews are still doing it today?
