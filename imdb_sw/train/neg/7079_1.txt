There is no reason to disconnect this flick. From the key to the opening, I knew I was in trouble. It was done as it was a small film, but nothing was happening. Looking into the world of sexual abuse is amazing, but for sure. <br /> <br /> Set sex scenes, bad plot, and cameos with Ed Begley Jr. and Rosanna Arquette don't have enough to save this film.
