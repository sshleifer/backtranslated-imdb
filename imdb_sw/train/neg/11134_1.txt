This is a flick of a very goodwolf. The video is dark and inappropriate. Voice not found and inappropriate for memory and mixed. Script is a cliche ridden junk with casual characters as a tough detective who shoots werewolves and his handgun money! [filled of course with a shot of money]. Acting is like wood like characters. FX does not exist, lots of close-ups arewolf jaws and right. The only thing shown is T&A's basic T instead of leaving $ 30 for this trip to look at the latest photos of waswolf: "Dog Soldiers" and Sean Pertwee.
