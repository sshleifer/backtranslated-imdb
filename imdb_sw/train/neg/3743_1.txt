Jared Diamond did something in the first place that other people in the world did not have animals to feed but Europeans did so, and that explains why we were able to make metal and steel machines. But in the third place it says that when Europeans in South Africa reached the north they fled to the Zulu people and other ethnic groups that played cattle and sowing seeds. Why does it describe their lack of technological, economic, and artistic achievements if they had the necessary things that the author's demands were needed to succeed? Diamond also claims that the virus-like virus (brings North America and black slaves) was our great weapon. Well, if 150 Europeans can defeat 20,000 indigenous and South African non-South African fighters can win Zulus 10,000 * without direct injuries, then I think you should conclude that the virus does not apply. And without disease, we will succeed. Malaria says Europeans are standing in the North American colonies, killing "thousands" of Europeans when they do not affect Africans. (I would like to know the exact number but can't say.) Then at the end he says today Malaria kills thousands of Africans and that's why they can't find us. So what is it, Jared? Did malaria help Africans to prevent them or hurt them? And how did Europe do well with great trouble in our history? It also seems to have a strong desire to say that Europe's reasons were successful because of the unfortunate. The times the evidence threatens to exceed his theory of rickety he refuses to accept that perhaps Europeans succeeded because they worked. It is sad to see this fact of the neo-Marxist truth to try to prove his point.
