I saw this on an art gallery that also showed "Last Days" and Charlie Chaplin films. Based on the quality of other features, I decided to give the position of "Immortel". I was almost walking out of this movie, and I like science writing! The story has been set up in New York's future city, full of spots of the Blade Runner events and such discussions about human beings making cloning / synthetic. Unfortunately, the screen was not opened for an hour and forty-five movie. The three groups are in this world: human, human, and Egyptian gods. Fake people seem to have a high hand and control of the politics of the city. Humans are slaves and are used for eugenics and contribution contribution. Egyptian gods have a pyramid around it (directed to the great Pyramid of Khufu, and completed and outwardly damaged, allowing the soft cap to the pyramid. Is not the pyramid around the future would be perfect?). The pyramid sits on the city and no one understands what it is or why it is located. I will not give you a so-called compound, but there is a lot of unwanted year and many outdoor items. Film, as I said, seems to have been caused by Blade Runner, and maybe also with Fifth Element and Matrix. At the end of the films, the list was listed thanks to Britain, France, and Italy. The film is FRENCH, but uses British actors who do not speak French. Therefore, it is obvious that their French talks have been called. This is overcrowded, and I thought that to turn back and forth among the real humanities and drawings completely. It doesn't help that animations are poor - not better than video game. Skip this one.
