This powerful fan of DORIS DAY can get this even considering watching. When a person thinks about the wealth of material available for stories about New York City's popularity, a film that could be dealt with many stories of real life what people were supposed to face, this is less than a barrel for lack of storytelling. Once again Doris is angry because the one who accuses her could be caught in the dark night when she returned to Connecticut, took a potion to sleep and wake up in the morning with someone who did the same, walking in the house wrongly. No one can save this mess - not Doris, neither ROBERT MORSE, TERRY-THOMAS, PATRICK O'NEAL or LOLA ALBRIGHT. As directed by Hy Averback, it is a very weak day of the car, it has promised to make a film because of the destruction of her husband and it cannot eliminate it. Very bad.
