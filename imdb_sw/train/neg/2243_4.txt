It is not even necessary to review, except as a warning to the audience. It is a common story of the actor of the drama actor during the WWII film. No fear is involved, no doubt, nor any surprise. One of the most horrible moments that seem to be very small is amazing. The visual style is very flat and non-existent, although there is very good editing at once. The story has not come together, and the film is really just a brush. 4/10.
