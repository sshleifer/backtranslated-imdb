at first I was happy to know about a new superman film, i though it would be nice but it wasn't. <br /> <br /> is a bad copy of the work of Richard Donner, Lex is no longer a hosted host, even played by Kevin <br /> <br /> the bad deal is the same as the first premier filler movie Especially. The script is predictable and simple (all the war is available in the museum or the old woman) <br /> <br /> The story is a bad thing, it must be Kevin Smith Script and may be better. <br /> <br /> I just hope the good without Brian Singer and the new director of talent to do something new and not copy. They all read you later
