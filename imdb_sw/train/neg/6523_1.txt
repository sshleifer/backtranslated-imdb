SEARCH TO CIRCLE MY RECOMMENDATIONS. SIZI FULL FILIA KIWE - TRAINING ON DVD only can be found. <br /> <br /> *** I loved to give this film even two stars. I mean how it is possible to put just 1 out of 10 !!! Here's how: Comparison of the epic film of Tolstoy novel "War and Peace" and historical events of the war, with respect to the Red, and the most loyal, the best-to-the-state of the novels of the novel would be difficult but bring to sit for seven hours - if it was what you saw. <br /> <br /> trouble you can't see that the film - anywhere else I knew. I try to view the DVD version of RusCiCo - it is considered the most accessible version since the letter is closed and retrieves disconnected from other DVD records. But, it is one of the most short films I have ever seen on the DVD. The image is muddy and inappropriate, often blows. It is almost tolerant if you reduce your brightness, color and image levels to a high level .... but the problem cannot end. <br /> <br /> Sounds are also the wrong way, loud in the section, almost uneudible to others. And in the language, it is a big problem for English speakers - the dubbed option has other good actors, and some of those awesome ones whose performance declines, and parts of the film are never used. , back to Russian and even French randomly. The bottom option is not the best. Subtitles do not appear under the image, but surely - hide some beauty (or what remains) in the environment. Additionally, headlines are often poor (embarrassing criticism that the script took pain so that it might appear next to the real Tolstoy words), and the headlines also seem to stop part. So, even if you come from color, brightness and photo settings, and turn the top way, and select the lowest * and * English is called, you are going to get a movie that is awesome to watch and hear. It can conquer that content? It may be able to, but at seven - who can stand for a long time? <br /> <br /> Maybe one day, someone will come and restore this - and maybe then I will see a jewel - but for now, I can't give more than one star for something that I can stand looking over 12% first.
