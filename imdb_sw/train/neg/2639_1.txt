Let's first start this review with the fact that I SIGNED UP by writing comments and warning people to save their money! This was one of the worst of trash I have seen since The Hulk. The story of the story was a trash that could be predicted to come. If you expect 24 but on the big screen, delete the prospects under the toilet once with the money you can spend on the ticket. You can find more comfort in that way. Acting was horrible, the plot was untrue, (with what is known as "misleading" at the end.) I must say this. The end was surprising to me. what could be considered as the only place of good action in the whole movie. The whole offer was bad for a few reasons. First of all, they should have a change of work for an accident, because Michael Douglas played the player that KILENA Keifer Sutherland would have to play. When Douglas was blowing the waves, whistling phone lines, blowing systems and taking people chasing, Sutherland has a little messenger who is always ad mood even when things don't go that bad for him. He has a very bland agent, nothing like his kind of Jack Bauer gives us 24 love fans. I can promise you that this movie will tremble in all places. It can be better compared to the "Provider" remake "in the Fire Line" but written by people with mental disabilities
