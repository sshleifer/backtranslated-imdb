I can't find some of the great buildings of this period - that Miranda is so wonderful, and that there is something very serious that makes you do. Someone here made a statement that maybe it's a circle of light waves or something rather than being evil. Miranda is just a jerk. The item is slow, contrary to the way also speaks. I also do not understand why Kolos is an ambassador - why does the federation leave them only? There is one place I do, while Kolos speaks through Spock about the loneliness of human experience. In general, I like TOS and even with its lighting, I will see more. This part though - mmm, I could not sell it except a copy of $ 3.
