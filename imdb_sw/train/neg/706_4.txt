Myths and show were good, but it was really sad and I hate sad movies. Ri'Chard is good. She has put on high performance, and the girl who played her sister was awesome and very beautiful. By and large, I thought it was Carmen Electra until I saw the IMD details. I can't say anything wrong about Peter Galleghar. She is one of my dear actors. I love Anne Rice. Now I am reading the Vampire Chronicles, but I'm glad to see the film before reading the book. This is a little too "real" to me. I would like small tiffs of Lestat and Louis for slave problems. Eartha Kitt was very interesting and after her behavior did what she did The movie was damaged to me; I could stand up to watch another show. (sorry for equality, but I don't want to give anything away) Sorry, but it's not my type of display.
