The only appearance in the cinema is the death of the player of the sniveling and the response of the living characters. In all other ways, this film is a Heater, Lake Placid, and Alligator, and a little bit of Godzilla (1998). <br /> Just like the movie horror of the 1990s, two women without star each take their clothes at least once. Female leadership cannot, because she has a better agent. The whole movie surrounds the images not too much of the so-called blood surgery, where the surfers ride off and erase the affected water shark. In this film, the magnificent salts of salt-water also occur in the area. People are given. The movie ends. I don't care about the bad movie of fear, but I hate the worst bad movie, which this is obvious.
