If it was not for bad conversation with the script. I mean, the direction was about the subject. Artists were doing their best to bring their characters to life. But at last, something that was missing was a strong script to hold all the pieces together. I would strongly recommend not to look at this. Unless you are interested in Al Pacino as I am and you will look at everything he plays. Even if recent results are poor. This is after S1m0ne, the second worst movie for this actor who once knew how to choose roles.
