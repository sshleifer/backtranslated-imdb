I saw this film by accident and this movie was accidentally ... well it must be. The women of the blonde are beaten, the man seems to be lost from one place to another for a moment then disappearing and repeating, hiding.he was'nt even the great hero so I do not know how he did. can not frighten the cat and that is not hard to do. The “old in the bathroom” mirror should no longer be in fact alarming years ago. had a soldier on the choice of villain, another cliche (played with idris elba and a very accent of the United States, he from London) did'nt director have a clue and has made a perfect film of cliché and making "awesome move" which was apparently COMEDY. scary. pathetic!
