Unmarried couples (Brooke Adams, Jeff Hayenga) are going to the doctor (James Karen) to try. It works but Adams slowly knows that there is something very wrong with a child ... I saw every "moving" coming. Trends are poor - they seem to have no idea how to hit the base area. Production values ​​are - to be good - lousy. Very shade. And, the scenes of the year are very bad (I almost turned off when a pregnant woman started to hurt herself in the womb) and lousy special effects. The film is completely destroyed at the end when it becomes clear he had no idea how to finish this film. It is a good act that makes it possible. Adams, Hayenga and Karen are all doing a good job and looking at me but that was about him. This film has never been opened in 1991 and is still unknown - it's easy to see why. I offer 4.
