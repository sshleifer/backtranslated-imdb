I was expecting to see it during production. But it was quite big. A great cry from the modern world of Dr Seuss. It was so bad and not very good I don't think Dr Seuss could pass. How Grinch stole Christmas was much better. I understand that there is a joke of ignorant adults in it but my children still don't know. Although the Cat in Hat Blasted their evil they caught a lot more than I would love it. Look at what they do with Horton to hear who they are.
