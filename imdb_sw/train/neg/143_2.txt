In an attempt to restore the kind of slasher of a young man that has been taken by spoofs like the Movie and Shriek if you know what I did last Friday on 13, Valentine fails. Why did people like Halloween? Because it was original, new and went beyond anything that was done. Why did you like Scream? Because at least it has made sense. Valentine is just a stupid-ignorant fool who can not any year what so-ever. The program is similar to Halloween and Cities Legends are not funny. And when the murderer will come to the screen, you know who it is, it's sssssssssssooooooooooooo just possible. The type of slasher of the boy is DEAD Get on it! <br /> <br /> 0 out of 10
