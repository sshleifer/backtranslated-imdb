This document comes with an interesting Cluster - it makes an exciting and persuasive argument that Jesus' history as reliable is wrong. However, sadly, after stimulating us to this, the movies exchange completely gears and become a bit more than non-stop attacks on Christianity, and focus on simple goals. The author / director clearly has other issues with the Church (he is an old evangelical Christian and he has some anger) and this film seems to be his kind of release. It would be interesting to see the first 20 minutes have been extended, but in general, the movie is desperate.
