Ouch! This was very painful to stay. It has an interesting and exciting theme, but all goes to hell from there. Matthew Modine is almost always on foot and angry, and can not despair in this. Deborah Kara Unger and John Neville turned out an amazing display. Alan Bates and Jennifer Tilly, among others, played on the top. I know that's what the scripts are, and it's hard to complain executives, when the script and the director does it. If you're going to have inappropriate characters, that's okay, but you have gotta good material to work. It wasn't here. Run screaming from this film if possible.
