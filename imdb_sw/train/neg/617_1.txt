First, I would like to start a quote my friend said during watching this film: "All this movie would dare you. You know, like," DUDE, I WANT TO DO TO MAKE ALL MOVIE ". For this movie, they have made a good effort to reach that head. The effects are, of course, poor. The program / talk is like a collage of stolen bits from every movie B horror movie made. The actors, I think, should be in college. However, its parts (especially at the beginning) make it as if they should be in high or middle school. It's useless. Scarecrow around killing people is not so easy to enjoy. (SPOILER: Finally, when they beat Lester's name and it breaks out again, the black and Scarecrow both laugh, perhaps out of their apologies to their last location, and in cheesy conversation.)
