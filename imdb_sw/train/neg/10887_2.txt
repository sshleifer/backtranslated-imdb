...... this film is very bad, the only thing that stands out from giving 1 mark was the fact that I unfortunately have seen more. <br /> <br /> Music of the jungle, demon blowing, and Fluorescent UV style blood / teeth / eyes gives it a "bad" look, and the script is bad ..... this film is more like a test to see how long you can live before you give up it. It is also predictable but not in a good way. There is no film that does good. I watched it for the last 10 minutes and I think I would like a little bit of it. (oh and acting does not allow the film down, it's also bad)
