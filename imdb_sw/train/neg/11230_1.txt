In the sixth grade, every teacher I thought was a good idea to make this film a lesson for the whole semester. Each class had something to do with this awesome show. We looked at English and we wrote in the papers as we were one of the characters. In math we said about charts and other marine tricks. In science we talked about whales (which was really interesting, so this was not a 100% waste of time). Every day it was suffering. Not only, but they could give us this fear twice a day by making us look at the school hall. I could see if this was a new series or something, but it was, like, '93. I'm still trying to block this out.
