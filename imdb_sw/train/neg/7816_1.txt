It does not matter that the comic books of Superman are undoubtedly uncertain and their goal is ten years old. The important thing is that "Superman Returns" is a bad movie. <br /> <br /> At the beginning, the question for You Dear Readers, how many of You really believe that Superman will fail and bald Kevin Spacey? Any one? As I thought. No providers here. So let's get serious issues right now. <br /> <br /> First, this movie looks like a business (area in the bar and Superman / Clark Kent. Think of Superman's business, two and a half hours. Let's be very bad this is not "Amadeus" or "The Departed". You really feel that this film is a very long way. And special effects are not unique in the way. <br /> <br /> Second, the situation is silly. Sometimes even if something is acceptable for comic, in the movies it looks just stupid. And it's like that in this case. In fact the dialogs are embarrassing. I can't believe someone took money to write. How often will we be held by the crime talks? How often will the laws of physics be dealt with? (Jesus, not just the power of Superman but also the criticism of the materials that he uses.) How often will Lois Lane be corrupted by Kent? How often will Hollywood manufacturers look for stories in comic books of trashy? Since there are difficult to make a good story, why have a weak story to start? It doesn't just work. Youth, get. Try hard, please. Or just get out of this strike forever, who cares. I felt that WGA is quite a strike. No error. I do not ask the disabled people to be paid, but the quality of the products they offer. In this case there is no quality even. (At this point you can ask yourself: is it bad? Yes it is.) <br /> <br /> Third, the act is weak, which is quite surprising since Bryan Singer (ordinary people) point. Kevin Spacey is happy, but he is the only one. The audience is not a sense of joke. Thing is that the hero of the comic book can be developed to be a real personality, with clear motivation but also with doubts, fears, deep. In this case no one has done the job, and the characters are not really interested. Finally, all the efforts of the creators turn out to be a parody. The second unit is very bad that attracts attention, since nothing interesting is going on any screen. They are trying (if they are trying), funnier finds (but not a laugh You can expect). <br /> <br /> Final conclusion? One word: shame. <br /> <br /> This particular film, women and gents, is camping. Don't waste your time and don't lose your money too. Stay home, read the book.
