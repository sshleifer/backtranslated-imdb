In fact, I looked at this piece and the lowest expectations. Dieter Bohlen is a member who cannot be defeated who lack of talent is reduced only by the size of his ego. This was the first movie of cartoons that I wanted was 100 percent of free humor. It's rude, offensive, redneck and badly opposed women. Therefore, it is the ideal creation of Bohlen, but the ordinary viewer will be removed by it. It is not surprising that it has never been displayed on the cinema: It would have hit the bomb during BIG! Even the cost of MegaEuros 6.5 could save this piece of craft. Save your time ... with money!
