Well, I watched this film over 2 years ago and now I have taken it out of the dust shelf to look at it again and I must say, in fact I think this movie is good. This movie got buzz like bootleg I Know What You Did Last Summer 3, as well as the Last Stab was Scream 4, and this movie is not bad. I mean it had an error and it would certainly have been to open this in the movie but still with the popcorn of the midnight click, this film is not half bad. It has some awesome, and some of the true women of fire I can add. Plus shows off the new show of Joey Lawrence though even though it did not defeat any of the great Hollywood or ...... I don't feel bad for that person, he had a similar job in the early and mid-90s with flowers, Disney movies and brothers Lawrence's ever show ..... Joey Lawrence was a player in the sitcom area, but as if to return to 360 degree, his work went just south to make small budget movies like this. </> <br /> The film also puts you off, makes you think among the workers, there is a secret that someone knows, just despair at the end to find out the secret. It also gives you away from who is a killer, I had an idea but I still do not know who the killer was, but his mind with the secret was a huge cuts. Now, would it have a secret that had been given? This movie can be one of the best tested movies. But I am also a pastor of the subject of the college and I also at the university I had a spring break at the beach house of such size as one here and so just made me feel a feeling about this movie. So-so slasher flick. Good for the midnight movie.
