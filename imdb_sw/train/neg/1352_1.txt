Eytan Fox, while generally relying on the apologist's side of Israeli politics, has made several films very interesting in the past as well as "Walking on Water" and just an amazing film, "Yossi & Jagger". In the "bubble", however, has taken this useless and fair way to severely. <br /> <br /> In addition to providing this ovation film standing, people in the investigation I attended quietly and left. I also left quietly, disgusting to a very ridiculously-sophisticated film that translates independently as racist violence, and sexual abuse (and terrorism) as a burst of righteous anger; which means that the Arabs are being corrupted by the evil Israelites that they are angry with the frequent stereotypes of Israel's violence against them, and that, therefore, they should not be held responsible for their actions. <br /> <br> This film was not worth the money I had paid for tickets (in fact, I thought I needed my money back), and it was basically the Israeli model of Palestinian film "Paradise Now". If you want to be against Israel, then in all ways look at this film, because it certainly has such a system of faith. The fact that this film was made by the director of Israel and, even worse, the talented director of Israel, is the shame of crying. In fact, how Israel can be surprised to be seen as a State State when the Israelites themselves are making anti-Israel propaganda, they pray for faith. <br /> <br /> It is a shameful, sad film!
