That's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It is not intimidating or other things proposed in the summary of the plot. This movie is experiencing bitterness and I was bored for almost every 98 minutes. When acting is the best mix, the biggest problem is the script, which was not well written, slow and plodding without real direction. Occasionally the emotional state is only set by the breakdown of the line or the wrong event. I am not surprised that the whole cast was ill and throw between shots, they did after all try and dig the bad script. As a great fan of great horror movies, I am always angry that this bad thing is available. Save yourself for 98 minutes you will never be able to return.
