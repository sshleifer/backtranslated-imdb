As a Turkish man who now lives in Sweden I must admit that I often watch Scandinavia movies. Many like me I never understood. I think Scandinavia executives are doing their best in Hollywood. Last week I watched a video called "Polish Wedding" with my police friend and we were all the worst movie we ever saw. Unfortunately I was wrong with this movie "House of Angels" is worse. No characters can act, absolutely not a woman named Helen Bergstrom. The plan is very foolish no one can believe. I think the whole thing is a mess from the beginning. lots of bad votes except from Selldal and Wollter. Ahmed Sellam
