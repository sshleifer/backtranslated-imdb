I have seen my part of Woody Allen movies, and when they're not always good, you can usually be sure you will be welcome. Probably the end of the truth were Bullets Over Broadway ('94) and Mighty Aphrodite ('95) - since then those I have seen have been patchy but watchable. And so when I was invited to see a new movie of Woody Allen Melinda and Melinda, which I had no insight yet was released, I went gladly. I had never heard about it so I hoped I would be very happy. I found it definitely the worst movie of Woody Allen that I saw. The premise is described more, the cast is awesome, the script is slow and impossible. Many events did not say and were still cut off, I think filling out what would be otherwise would be a short film of 15 minutes. to play out of all events. The problem is not one of these two "films". Comedy is not funny and tragedy is not too heavy. It seems like Allen came up with a good idea but then ran out of steam, or when, to complete the film completely. The overall performance rate is too bad - Will Will Ferrell is the only one who brings anything to the table, and is basically the feeling of Woody Allen. Former artists like Chloe Sevigny come just as angry, and the worst of the group is Radha Mitchell as Melinda (which is embarrassing, because his behavior is located almost every area!) they are working and missing if it doesn't exist. Surely a long way from Allen we know and love from scholars like Manhattan or Annie Hall.
