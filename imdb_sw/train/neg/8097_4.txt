It seems to many critics as one of the biggest stinkers of all time (surely it's a great stinker of the director of Brian De Palma). Sherman McCoy (Tom Hanks) is a rich young man whose life goes to pieces when he and his girlfriend Maria Ruskin (Melanie Griffith) are involved in a run-run-run. His story is taken by another powerful man, journalist Peter Fallow (Bruce Willis). <br /> <br /> Well, as I said in my summary ... <br /> <br /> What! be? It seems to combine comedy, ceremony, and satire, but it certainly does not speak to the extent. Undermined by uncomfortable concerns, the same characters who you never want to be angry to meet in real life. I'm not a big fan of novels (I started reading immediately, but it couldn't finish because it was not interesting to me) but it is clear to me that those who have / are novels think this film is perfect. <br /> <br /> I've never seen many talented actors who are struggling to make a hard bottom of a certain film of quality and failure. What is it? Problems start with giving a good person to Tom Hanks in a role that is obviously unkind. And Peter Fallow's role in the novel was the Brit. Bruce Willis is bad, BADLY has fallen into the role. What were they thinking there. Alas, even Morgan Freeman can escape the film with his glory, forced to give a bad, strenuous speech on 'skill' after the peak. <Br /> <br /> This movie continues to turn on a strange horse. <br /> <br /> I liked the collection of talents; for I will give you four out of ten, but I assure you some people will say the most beautiful movie can be made from the source material.
