I've got this DVD from a friend, who got it from someone else (and that maybe he keeps going.) Even the DVD cover is cheap, like the whole film. Gunshots and fist fights and effects of delay, some of the worst actors I saw in my life, a very simple plot, made me laugh until my stomach hurt! With very few financial resources, I must admit it seemed like a good professional. Seemed as a film, it was one of 13 in the wannabe gangsta flicks no one to wait. So if you are tired and want to laugh, look at this film. If not, let's go out of the window.
