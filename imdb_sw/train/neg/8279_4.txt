This movie had all things to be a comedy smart, delightful, but for some reason it took the way to dumbass. Perhaps you did not know who his listeners were: but it is difficult to movie someone released by a plot, but it is also a slapstick and guns-dumb to appeal to women perfectly. <br /> <br /> If you have seen a legitimate player and its good, then this is like an amazing sequel. Chief executives like Luke Wilson should expect the best material. Jessica Simpson could also manage a lot more. Rachael Leigh Cook and Penelope Anne Miller are struggling to support the roles which are rather exciting. Many things in this film had colored numbers, various uber-clich√© sessions, the last minute "misunderstanding", even the children's party chaos. This only shows lazy texts. It should be possible to get this film enjoyable if you take it seriously, but it is much better to do better than the feeling of depressed and increasingly despair as the past.
