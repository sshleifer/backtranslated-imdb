Sith revenge begins with a series of long steps that are wonderful without being very exciting, then they get boring for the next hour and fifteen minutes, with a horrible chat like dirty values ​​that have caused all of the prequel series. The only thing that improves the case is slow - and I mean slowly - build-up for what we know will be the birth of Darth Vader. And at that time it comes, it's exactly the same. It's not good. Not even good. But quite good. This film is highly recommended because it does not absorb heaven as the previous sequels. Rather it is only turgid, lighter, and common. But you say, wow, the CGI environment is sometimes interesting. Will the lighting of electric lighting? They all are an unpleasant mess. I think the dark side has taken Lucas when he started these prequels and nobody noticed. This will make tons of money, but thank God is over, this franchise once worshiped has been beaten down enough. I saw a 12: 12 show, and after that, I heard a group of very young children say, wow that was amazing! But everyone older than eight broke one thing: I slept in the middle. It was a kind of neglect. I thought only to see the birth of Darth Vader would be better. He said all of us.
