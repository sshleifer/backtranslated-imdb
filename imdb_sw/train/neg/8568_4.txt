WORKS IN TIME is a certain comedy of fraud on a group of women planning to plan ahead of each of the men. It does not mean shame as a surprise I could mention but it is never good for its power. Imagine how good this would be if we had a Farrelly brother led by Ben Stiller in the role of Carter Elson. What is Carter according to Jerry Springer? Just curious because the words catch on Dr Elson's show are "watch each other and keep talking"
