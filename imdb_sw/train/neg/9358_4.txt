From the time the film begins, there is already a difference. If this film is held at Normand and Middle East borders, and it is also an international film, one can expect the good qualities displayed. This is not done as a loud voice of US planned. Also, I see the best performance, this story is very difficult to follow from the beginning. Who is it? Otherwise the film is very appropriate in clothing and environment. If you want to see a movie to get a feel for what it was like the old (although the lack of accents) then this movie fits tax. If you are looking for an epic film like the Kingdom of Heaven, then look elsewhere.
