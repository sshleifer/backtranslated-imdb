When I started watching this film I saw someone from Buffy, Xander, and saw how good that still does alive in the cinema. Now a wonderful movie I can stand, given that it is a good dose of weird as for the film film David Lynch, the peak of twins, losing the road etc. And you kind of have in one condition. This, however, made me shocked to remember the sites of madness about there on the theory of a conspiracy that is not quite good. I mean coming to the Nazi people who are conspiring with the United States to do the wrong trinity of evil powers? I was surprised that they did not mention the earth holes in this movie with Hitler plates and folklore. Maybe if you were about 60 grams of heroine and this movie would make some kind of feeling, but seriously I would not like the drugs if I didn't give this film. Should be burned, whipped and just forgetful Xander can get another job to work. It was not his work though, that was good, but the script did not make any sense. Sorry.
