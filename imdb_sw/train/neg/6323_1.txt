This movie is a bad memory since my childhood. This is one of those movies that show children on a rainy day at school when you can't go out to return, and you would like to have a look at anything, HOW ANYTHING. At least it was when I was at primary school. I just remember to hate this movie. In fact, I haven't seen 15 or more years, and maybe they don't use rainy days but I just want to warn everyone: You will be better off using this to keep your children sleep than their entertainment. Believe me, choose anything else. Although the topic is a form of controversy, the plot is tame and eliminates that I cannot remember anything about it except that I didn't like it so much that here, 15 years later, I felt the need to warn you against it.
