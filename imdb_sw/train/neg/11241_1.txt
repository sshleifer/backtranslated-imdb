If you are looking for eye candy, you can enjoy the Sky Captain. Captain of the Sky is just a video game that separates from live performers. The audience is good and attracts watching during the entire movie. Now, say that, those pictures are the only thing in the Sky Captain. After ten minutes, I knew I was watching one of the worst movies all the time. I was hoping that this film would be better, but it did not reach any level of interest. After thirty minutes, the need to go out continued to grow and grow. Now, I'm more than 2000 movies and I've seen five times that number. However, this is just the second movie I heard as walking out of my whole life. <br /> <br /> Act --- no. The three actors are sad. Jude Law (also in another movie I wanted to walk on) is just bad in the role of the head. I would like to go through Ben Affleck in Gigli than to see the Law again. <br /> <br /> Paltrow tries SO hard to be a camp, that turns back to his face. The last text I read said that Paltrow is thinking of staying at home and being a mother rather than acting. After this performance, I would like to congratulate the decision. <br /> <br /> Stories --- Soap operations are well written. The story behind the Sky Captain starts bad and is getting worse when it continues. <br /> <br /> Redirect --- no. Everything that is put in special effects that the story, act and lead is very bad. Even "The Phantom Destruction" had an effective and unsuspecting plan. <br /> <br /> I would like to give this movie "0" from "10". Avoid paying for theater and wait until the release of video.
