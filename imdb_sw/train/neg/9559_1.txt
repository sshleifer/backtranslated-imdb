I will try to use the words to describe this in the ... I / I saw nature, which was good in its own way, but behind that I would be afraid of the guide. And I was 'scared' when taking this, but now that I've seen it, I must say, it's worse then I thought. Why are these films still available for money while making my thoughts around. Let's start with the actors, not all good, but it is said, some make the heads turned out to be very clear. But the actors can do what with the script like this. It's just trying to have the original copy only when these places have changed, any kind of story has ended and any attempt to come up with something that has not been done before, fails to fail. For an attempt to get up-to-date, they try to make it exciting using the entire use 'big-brother' theme, but that has been worn years ago and does not provide anything but the filler between the beginning and the end. The experiment was made to try to save the film by making tons of '83 original, but it ended up very simple and sometimes sad. In conclusion, if you don't have anything, and don't mean anything, do ... go look, or play Frisbee ... with DVD .... and yourself. It will give you the same amount of fun
