I really love the book written by Robin Klein, so I was very surprised when I heard that a movie-based film had made it. But I was so frustrated with the cinema when I saw it because it didn't catch what I liked about the book - Erica is quite ridiculously funny and interesting way in which she views the world. <br /> <br /> From the beginning of the movie, I found that things were 'the same as I thought in the book. So, I just went on a journey. It was not all bad, I think. Miss Belmont was completely different from what I thought to be! I didn't think he could be smoke and drink - Jean Kittson, who plays with him, is a hilarious! For myself, I thought the movie and its actors / executives in it worked well, but alas, I am a fan of the book (one of all my favorite books) that I could not help but feel lustful
