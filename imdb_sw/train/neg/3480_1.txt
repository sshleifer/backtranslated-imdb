This movie is awesome. TERIBLE. One of the worst movies. I can't even think Gigli that bad. The confirmation made us say "NO", but then looking for something in the dreck out there right now, we have decided to continue and throw a shot. US STUPID. Touch is not an actor. He is a shape and can look good with explosions, but even Bruce Willis type got in "Die Hard". If he has removed his shirt and run around the bad guys, it will be comedy. The best place was Catherine O'Hara - she's always good. Gandolfini climbs again (if not by The Sopranos, he could clean) as he did in the Mexican. Removing hogs every area and if others said - no behavior has any incentive to their actions. FEW MOVIE RIGHT IN ALL EVERYTHING.
