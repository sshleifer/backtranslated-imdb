This is not a description of the real movie, but on the release of the RUSCICO DVD to North America. I don't know if there are releases and different updates, but the disks we rented had 2000 copyright on them, if that means nothing. However, the voice mixing on these DVDs was awesome. Rates often zo-yo-up and down; when the area cut off on the panorama war, the orchestral song could tremble loudly that I did not know which would hit the first - eardrums or my speakers. It was a time of discussion, the normal amount is dropping to a larger object being heard. Sometimes, the work of orchestra and Foley-work would have been standing when negotiations were found at a very small level. My wife and I have found that the only way we can look at this movie completely from these DVDs is if one of us put our hand on the village to keep the volume control. And, if another user said the comment, when we chose the English voice, the discussion continued to fix between Russian and English; and often when the characters were spoken in French on the song of natural dubbing was Russian, so you are SOL if you're not understanding. Finally, we have stopped looking after the first disk. Before you cancel $ 50 + for this film on DVD on your own library, I would like to fully enjoy getting your hands on a rental copy to see if you can enjoy this modern flick when you are injured with such a bad voice, especially never read a book you really want to understand the storyline.
