"It's hard to like to describe how exciting it is like to make a connection like a game like pictures and pictures as all as cast pictures like as a good measure like, and trigger as contro-like-like and make us more like money and like things." - Ellen , quote lost. <br /> <br /> "Kissing, Like, On, Like, Mouth And Stuff" is as good as artistic efforts as it was done. Looking like Ellen's pig's weapons and Chris blowing the string was like the length of my long experience of watching movies and things. But before I start like breaking the new US-20-something-air and “love” new to me, I would like to make it briefly as the top attractions of this image as a feast: <br /> <br /> 1. Chris doing an action its secret parts. And not just: how the camera way (directed by beauty and Ellen and Patrick) takes over the viewer with a full picture of the white fat stomach of Chris after completing non-Catholic work - which was really exciting. I can honestly say that I have never seen that grace. Chris, you should do more exhibitions on your next movies, because that's what we needed to develop what a talented, talented person, Lars von Trier and "Idiots 95", began. A quick w *** and then black, fat, white stomach: what else could ask for a movie? Needless to say, I can stay all day with Chris ejaculate (despite the fact that I am the same) ... Such poems are walking. Such a beauty, such a style. Non-standard access, false into the image to be a sequence - with a large amount of Zen philosophy. Even Barbra Streisand could not get more spiritual than this. Ellen's hairy, thick hands. The built-in camera cameras, so skillfully photographed by our two photographic directors (I can not insist this enough), Ellen and Patrick, often cause confusion about the correct identification of the sex. There were several instances when we saw a part of the body (foot, arm or foot), but it was often a switch game: What? Does that part of the body belong to a man or a woman? Typically, Chris and his fellow artists, Ellen, Patrick and his name, deliberately dropped us, because their bodies were good for creating this gender mix. It was sometimes difficult to think if someone sees a male foot or a male. Patrick is very thin and becomes very strong in his movement, so it is not available and does not exist, while Ellen and another girl are very bed, what with their feet and hands. Brilliant. <br /> <br /> 3. Brilliant - especially the way that works well with the topic of change of sexual roles: so completely natural and intelligent-blowing. Ellen has a character like someone, wants sex all the time, while his old Patrick wants to talk - like a girl. Searching. <br /> <br /> 4. Ellen's search for the Leftist partner. "He should love 'The Simpsons', which is completely Leftist." I am wondering that the creators of this film decided to break the long tradition of giving us the intelligent Leftists. Ellen is fun - and real - change. The number of "loved ones" that she and her free friends can say in less than 80 minutes is really a wonderful thing (3,849, to be right). They have been able to achieve their real life on a big screen for small effort, and I praise them for it. <br /> <br /> 5. Close-ups of fingers. There are many things here for footstep followers, which I think is a very free, very interesting way to reach a minority of gender. After all, foot and foot followers are given very little to the modern cinema, so it's best to see someone out there. <br /> <br /> KOTM, or rather, KLOTLMAS, offers more than facing the eye. It is not just a very small film about poor people who emerge in a consultative relationship when they talk about unhealthy conversation. No, it's more than that. It is on the light that guides all ignorant creatures; The leading light that leads to the futility of the various professional and artistic wannabes who have just dropped out of the film, and the plan to attack our minds and shades that will hope to play well in good festivals like Sundance and Cannes, enabling them to gain important exposure The real money for the change, which will later employ the loved ones of Sean Penn and George Clooney in promoting the salvation of this planet and solve all political problems this world faces. What's the best way to do it than to do porn at first? <br /> <br /> If Chris and Ellen did the camera here, as described in the last credit, then who lived on the camera when both were in front of it? They may employ some of the recipients and lock the camera in their hands ... Go to http://rateyourmusic.com/~Fedor8, and see "TV and Cinema" my: 150 Bad Events The list of Nepotism.
