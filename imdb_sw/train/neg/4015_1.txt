The friend gave me saying it is another classic like "Debbie does Dallas". Welcome close. I think my main complaint is about a very interesting actor in the porn industry forever. More awesome is that he is on the screen almost all the time. But I read somewhere that back in those days, porn had to have some "artistic" value. I couldn't find it yet. Just check if you are interested in the history of porn development within the district, or you can appreciate the art in porn movies. I know it's not me. But the movie director seems to be a talented person. He even tried to find Simon & Garfunkel to give him permission to use his songs. Of course, they refused.
