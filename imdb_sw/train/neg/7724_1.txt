To see all the negative views of this film, I thought it might be a second comic of a comic which had no meaning at all. I watched the first two events of the fight, I heard the generic talks made by Lungren, and all the other cast-out characters in the East, and I saw the movie that's very bad. Then Brandon Lee enters the story and the first builder begins to fly, the plot disappears, the script writers begin to drink and the movie tend to entertain, because it turns out to be the worst movie of EVER. Lungren strives its original efforts in "The Punisher" and others, with all the Van Damme movies, Seagal movies, and Stallone non-Rocky movies, with this distinction. This film has a very bad job (see Tia Carrere's face while in any area with Dolph, which is worth laughing), and bad conversation ever (the views of Brandon Lee about Dolph's little is the worst line in the film), and the most beautiful dress in The film (Dolph in full Japanese dress). The most effective "Tango and Money" picture, meets "Prepare," meets "Friday 13th" (because of the impurities and Lungren's performance is Jason Voorhees-like very much), for an hour and fifteen of the film player. Good (how about it is not bad) the show goes to a bad person (who still seems to be engaging in all his performance) and Carrere (somehow says his verse 5 without breaking out). Brandon Lee is just there for Lungren's sidekick, and doing a very bad job at that time. <br /> <br /> bad movie, bad. Fear and avoid. If you look at though, ask yourself why the underwater shots are twice as clear as many non-underwater shots. Speaking about the underwater shots, check out the area of ​​fighting the crippled water and the worst state-of-the-art war. This film has every version of the worst form of fighting for those with short attention and filling between the flashes of honey. BAD BAD MOVIE !!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
