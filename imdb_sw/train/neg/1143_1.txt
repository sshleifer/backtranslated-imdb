Even 20+ years later, Ninja Mission looks like the worst movie I could stand. Scandanavia's Ninjas enter a quiet, hot fire gun on their small gun and wild removing, then leave quietly. Wow, how do we get those invisible killers? Just follow the shelling and smoke! The worst bad dialog (or was it brilliant and just translated wrong?), Not the Asian front in cast, and the total total of 3 Asians among stunt staff. The program is ignorant, acting very much does not exist - again, the ninja can not act! Enjoy yourself - look at all costs!
