I saw this film first when I was 10 years old. My mother bought it at our nearest Kmart because it was sold for $ 5 on VHS. He thought it would be a good Christmas movie to me and my brothers to watch. This movie, however, feared the hell from me. You might be asking yourself, how about the film about Santa Clause scares anyone? The movie plan circles Satan to send one minions, Pitch, the world to attempt to kill Santa and destroy Christmas. That is true, Satan sends out demons from hell to kill Santa Clause. Pitch sucks Santa at Christmas night trying to seize a trap in the world when the sun rises on Christmas day, for if Santa does not return to his home in space, he turns to powder. Do not do wrong, movies are fun and entertaining right, however, the image of demons and demons play in the depths of hell (which occurs at the beginning of the film) is just interesting.
