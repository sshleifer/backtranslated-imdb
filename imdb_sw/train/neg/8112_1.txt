Hanna-Barbera is looking for life from other famous properties. Violence watches the water, the story is formulaic, animation is bad, music is bad and repeat again, and in fact, the show is not just funny. At that time, HB set each of its series through the same state of clich√©d, regardless of whether it fits the world of cartoon or not. So, Popeye and Bluto are seen in the regular part as the cemetery ("Hey! Popeye is popular, and Flinstones are popular.) Put together, and you can't miss!"). Also, in the obvious case of "private Benjamin," Olive Oyl and Goon have a common place that puts them as employers of the new army. Great! Why? Increasingly due to stress is the public service broadcasts in each section (usually normal during cartoons, but still angry). The Pope teaches his brothers about crossing the road safely, recycling, and - are you ready for this? - the dangers of smoking! (I swear I don't do it up.) <br /> <br /> Just the remaining remaining from the original cartoons is that Jack Mercer, the Popeye's voice from the beginning, continues to play a role here. <Br /> <br /> Should only observe once you get new thanks to the old Fleischer shorts. Otherwise, try at all costs.
