In over 70 years of watching movies, This should be one of the worst contested competitions. Mel Brooks, Mike Meyers & a few others have made very bad comedies, this is still the lowest of the barrel. <br /> <br /> It is unfunny from the very opening, to be handed over to the area during credit Diane Keaton who I usually like should need its bad payment. He needs to learn more about his trick. <br /> <br /> Dax Shepard (I don't know who he is), needs a better director, to show him how to act. <br /> <br /> Liv Tyler is also not on his role. Mike White needs to find another character, he has made that person very rarely. Ken Howard who started years ago as a first-class actor, not as he was. <br /> <br /> There is nothing respectable I can say about this quiz comedy movie. <br /> <br /> Rating: * (out of 4) refers to IMDb 1 (out of 100) of 1 (out of 10)
