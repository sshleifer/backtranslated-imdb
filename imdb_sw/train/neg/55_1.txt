There are only two films I will give 1/10 for, this stinker and "Man fallen on the earth." I remember seeing the Protocol on the playground in the first 80 years when I was in secondary school. Script insults anyone (including secondary school student). It completely lost the gag of the "hillarious" of the person being shot. Goldie Hawn is supposed to be alive but it comes as ashes and morals. Then there is a bad discrimination on the Arabs, followed by Goldie win over everyone to pull the populist dribble. Acting was bad, including Goldie Hawn. I couldn't stand to see the other film he had until IMO released himself for everyone saying I love you. This is the kind of film you do if you want to put an effort in writing a screenplay. Worse.
