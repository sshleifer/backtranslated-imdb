The film is very bad and undermines victims of rape. On the surface, it can be a fascinating film on rape but if you apply under the face, what is a negative message about rape. Aishwarya rapist is shown to be a vulnerable victim who cannot cope with all because she is MAMA. She needs a MAN to help her. When the community makes jibes on it and gives us his opinion, he doesn't stand himself. All are left for Anil Kapoor to do every talking while Aishwarya is crying. The Director (Satish Kaushik) came down a bad way to show the victim of rape as a weak and disobedient. What would be better to show a strong woman who rebels against her enemies in a bold way. The director is famous for being chauvinistic. His films are often filled with weak women but he tries to hide them in controversial roles. He needs to learn that just because the role is irrelevant, it does not mean that the character is strong. The worst view in the film is when Aishwarya 'purifies' after being raped. He does so to please his father who thinks it is now dirty. Although it is interesting that Shah shows stigma against rape victims for very bright light, what he does not show us is whether Ash's father was right to make his daughter do something like that. So we are left with a confused message about rape. <br /> <br /> Comedy is also not needed for a powerful film like this. Even more, comedy is not just funny. Ash is wood in his role when Anil Kapoor has nothing but noise. Music is mediocre except for the title of the head, which is a beautiful picture (the only part of this film). The role of Sonali Bendre is desperate and useless. In general, what could be the main film to remember end up being a bright surprise that will give some audience a great cleanliness.
