Another great movie of conspiracy that tries to blame the US government and Military Army (especially Army) for every epidemic since the Great Flood. Anyone who has ever served him while in the US military can see how this film uses. Uniforms, devices, sets, and the way is wrong. (And of course, All General Officers are the perpetrators of destruction or all the perpetrators.) Damp propaganda without an attempt to consider. Many theories presented have failed over the last few years. It uses every element ', news, and Urban Community from the Gulf - all presented as the gospel. (Actually, no one knows why other GW vets are sick and others are as healthy as a horse.) PS This is not new. War is not fun and I know WVII, Korean, and Viet Nam youth and other good diseases, too. (The government has a responsibility to care for them all.) Psychological films like this will not solve the problem!
