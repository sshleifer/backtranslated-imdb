Going into the film like me, I did not expect anything of entertainment except for the generation of killing ... what I got was a little bit. The night night 1947 The child testifies to his parents to do this while the father is in a suit. Horrible, runs the level and decreases. The story begins 33 years later with Harry Stalling is your usual joe every day ..... except for the fact she is considered by Santa. After his master hate him he goes dirty, dressed like a Santa and starts killing non-Santa's servants and his boss. The strange city takes him and as they are approaching him, he gives his car on the rock .... within a month. Not the best end I saw but it was natural. It was a slow pace, a stirring movie that had no quality of redemption except when Harry was going to attend church. There was no year and even “sex” events were beaten down. <br /> <br /> Too boring ...... 4 out of 10
