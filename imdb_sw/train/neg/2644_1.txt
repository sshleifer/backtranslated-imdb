Sentinel represents everything on the decline of Hollywood's soul and lack of sad thoughts that exist in many movies today. I can't think of one good thing about it, so it's normal, so the factory-and so lazy have encountered that it just really exists as infomercial on how to get money from the public, unworthy of the public. <br /> <br /> Program about the Secretary of the Secretary of the Secret Service of Prez killed can be entertaining. If it is addressed by a good director or caregiver which is. Douglas has been organized. Basinger is the First Woman, who she has a matter (unprecedented preferential, uncomfortable). Sutherland is the best pala who believes to be guilty because there will be no movie if he did not. And Longoria is nothing. The woman with fortune of Maybelline and ... that's it. I think there is little demand for women when entering the Secret Service. As usual in this film as the role of Prez himself is nothing more than a tool, a sign and is very bad written. Clark Johnson, who has given us the same as the SWAT pathetic back in 2003, the mechanical direction has no kind of signature and has the visual skills of the cheap movie. Douglas, Basinger and Sutherland seem to be bouncing and bouncing in their displays from a distance. Eva Longoria, the most obvious woman in the 21st century, is basically just in this to attract the audience of the Complainants. His role is 100% uncertain and has nothing to develop a plot or add to the development of character. He has 2 lines to rub together. Realistic and shameless knowledge you like. <br /> <br /> If you are a glutton of the penalty then don't leave you. But it's time and money you can't come back.
