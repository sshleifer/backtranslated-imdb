Mark Hamill must have a great shame with CORVETTE SUMMER! At this time, he uses a new form of "power" to return to his possession of a dream, red 'Vette. It looks like a young teenager opens during the first half and makes U-turn towards the wrong direction. Writing and leading work is done by horrible, and few events that you can not take hard. You expect this to be done otherwise, and also pulls the hodgepodge of late-70s. Just an old visitor like Annie Potts would steal the show and save this bad movie from repo creeps! His miserable but fascinating humanity continues to attract you, and this is the best opportunity to see him in the swimsuit. Hooray to Annie! Sorry, Mark! I think Power wasn't with you this time around.
