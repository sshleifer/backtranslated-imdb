While others may insist that by looking at other work and Bilal, one will appreciate this film, failing in one way. It does not stand alone. The program is a mishmash that combines color and substance. Here is an idea to start with a reliable story. Then the craft mark next to it. We begin with two different details, this woman who somehow turns into a human, "god" for some reason to be judged, but to get one last walking in the world, with this wonderful character of John which seems to be going on "a kind of rest" "more No one of these questions has been answered, but we care, no. There is no development to be impressed with any character in the story, almost we get Jill and however the development is spotty better. Unfortunately the movie is facing above all that is surprising (which is,) but at the cost of motivation development. I would like to see this written again by someone who can separate from a little material and not feel that every picture should be in the picture.
