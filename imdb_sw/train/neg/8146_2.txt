1 who looked at 11/7/2002 - 2 out of 10 (Dir-John Bianco): The modern gangster gang that grew up on God's human family in Brooklyn who would like to say a lot of letters and kill people. The only interest here is their attempt to show feds as much as a group. This is the only attempt to make a good text. The rest of the film was predictable, and at an affordable price. The quality of photos in some cases within the bars and floozy joints almost make you think there was a problem with your DVD player because of different differences and some actors were hard to hear when because of bad sound. Acting was a very good picture of all your favorite bandits from the best movies and corny names like Vinnie `Knuckles 'and Jimmie` Tattoos', and the plot followed too much of those systems too. So, go see the best movie of the gangster before you put your money for this.
