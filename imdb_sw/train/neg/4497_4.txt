- I prepared to write something that describes what I didn't like about this film, but this would be much harder than I thought. In fact, I can't remember much about it. I watched it just three days ago and it is not suitable for me. That's usually a sign of real stinker. About the only thing I remember was the most motivating and most of them. Wonderful of having Humphrey Bogart look-like as a detective wearing fast. It would be different if he could act, but he is the author of one note. The secrets of killing were dealt with by the young and had no doubt to lead them. If you can't see a five-minute killer on a film, you need to see more than the fear of Euro. Giving is a dead death for the identity of the killer.
