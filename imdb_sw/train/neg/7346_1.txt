I feel like I have examined the film film .... good work, taut, engrossing and something terrible! Two hours of reflection on the basic meaning and all of the word, sexual abuse and torture, rape, split, romantic relationships, corruption, living funeral, abuse, abuse, abuse. No redemption. And I was happy. I couldn't stop watching. What? What does this say about me, about people who do and act in this kind of thing, and the world that is desperate that ultimately the hot films will be common. And I am not puritanical nor humorless, I do not try to hide from the presence of darkness, and I certainly do not lead a safe life, but I am ashamed of myself. AND I am sorry to see my brothers in Britain blowing the dirty way of the way as my tribe. It must be good, but should it come into an amazing purpose?
