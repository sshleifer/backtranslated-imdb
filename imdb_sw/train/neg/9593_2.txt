Looking at some of the comments on IMDB, I expected the action of the action - maybe it's wonderful or stupid or one simple or comicy one, but essentially it's a movie action. Whatever it is that I looked, certainly didn't feel like a film. The story is simple and straightforward (although the introduction tries to make it easier). Take three categories of interest: 1) government 2) rebels 3) group of killers. Now delete the first (never seen in the film). Then just let one of the killers, princess, be hard on a trip to revenge. Add to the love of the rebellious and guilty conscience. And you have links. But they could not change the story or movie. Between a series of random and other non-standard photographs attempting to be Sci-Fi on a low budget, what you are leaving is a sense of vanity. The movie just doesn't feel like a movie, but a fantastic dream, incoherent, boring. Avoid it. <br /> <br /> 2/10
