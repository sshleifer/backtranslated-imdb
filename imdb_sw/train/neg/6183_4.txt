In 2005, George W. Bush began his second term as US President; North Korea announced its nuclear weapons; Pope John Paul II died after a long illness; and a movie called Into Blue Room occurred. The presence of this film is not as bad as other things that happened that year, but the film itself was bitter and perhaps, worse since that year. Now, in 2009, the United Nations has another President, there is another Pope, the new nuclear weapons of the Korean ... and film In Blue 2: Crocodile, which is better than the original ... but that's the same as saying: "getting your fingers cut is better than cutting your head". This way is the worst film that has given me a lot of exhaust and uninvited. Entering Blue 2: Crocodiles are made by actors of TV series who do not have absolute loyalty and amazing weight, but who is perfect for showing their bodies. (OC), David Anders (Heroes and Alias), Laura Vandervoort (Smallville), Marsha Tomason (Lost) and Audrina Patridge (The Hills) brings hollow and bad displays. I loved the previous movies from Stephen Herek's director (Critters and Bil l and Ted's Excellent Adventure especially) but on this movie, he can not produce even a minimum of tension, emotions or entertainment. The characters from this film are not only working badly, but also interesting. In fact, I wanted all to die.The movie from this movie is also lame and seems to be made by a technical team who makes promotional videos to Hawaiian hotels.In Blue 2: Reef is a bad movie that is better than the original film, but that it's similar to anything, as I said earlier. Remove this fippy film at all costs.
