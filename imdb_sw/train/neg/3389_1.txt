I saw the original "Line of Chorus" on Broadway God knows how many times and felt passion, despair and joy from this life experience in the theater. Michael Bennett knew he would need to think again "Chorus" for the screens but he didn't know how to do it. If the person who came with the show has been beaten - he should answer your question. There are some exhibitions that are made only to appear live - with viewers. However, Richard Attenborough's new work of "Ghandi" and playing with animals in "Doctor Doolittle" ended up leading this film that was not quite the same as the stage show. Horror songs were added (amazing! Amazing!), Great songs were discounted or given to other characters (which were useless). Michael Douglas was thrown. People who could not dance the dance tried to act and there was a famous woman of "Landers" who did not sing, act, or play - I think she had finished Ghandi's wife. Competition with Jeffrey Hornaday looks like anything more than a schlock from "Flashdance" refuses and no work. I sit there standing on how something to refuse and emotion can be cooked without anything. If you are so interested in this show and are returning to Broadway in 2006 - see but don't think that a long-term music event that was "Chorus Line" has nothing to do with this film.
