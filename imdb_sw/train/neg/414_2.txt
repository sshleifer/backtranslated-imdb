Entering this film you know that this movie has six laboratories in a laboratory with an invisible maniac. So once you think who will live and who will die. The survivors live in exactly what you hope to have, so there are no points of making a plot there. And if you don't know whether this is a B movie or movie that happens to be done in a laboratory with a story, William Devane has a part: the film's B status immediately. <br /> <br /> The movie promises at first. In the laboratory we are brought to an invisible gorilla who is becoming stronger. Oooh, the introduction. The best part in the whole movie is when the laboratory team makes gorilla appear again. Very serious side effects. They also make bacon invisible. There are two breasts hatched, dirty dirty jokes and enough out of place to swear to give this movie a rating of R that did not need <br />. as MacGyver on the fridge, which is more than 'Whaaaa?' Okay, there is one surprise. At that time the Caine (Bacon) returns once the last in the shaft of the elevator. It was a surprise but just because you say on television, 'Noooo! You are already dead! New movie! 'Talking about TV calls, that's what I did for the last 25 minutes or so. 'Put on f # @% ingggles!' Instead of placing their infrared logs so that they can see him, they try every trick in the book (fire burners, sprinkler systems ...). This story has lost its end. But special effects were good; that's the only reason I give them 2/10.
