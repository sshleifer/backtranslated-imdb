This is a large piece of limo I ever saw. It is so amazing that I would like to sit in the seminar on creation than to watch this if I knew it would be like boring as it was. Even 40 seconds of hot chick in bikini and big ta rede redeems this to anything less than 1. <br /> The view of this movie claim that this movie is "without funny fun" is amazing and just WRONG open. There is nothing interesting about this movie. they spend 50 minutes or minutes to walk through forests to talk about things you will not say or care about and are like cripples when people die because you don't even know who they are because they don't know. In fact, I didn't have to look to the end, but that should say something about how terrible. WORST MOVIE EVER. Once I left this dirt from my DVD player I started to erase the opposite of my cement in front of my house, not requiring other blockbuster customers to fall on the same mistake I had made for this movie. Then Zach loved his pants. Thank you for your time.
