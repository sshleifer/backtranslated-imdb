With the title "borrowed" from Werner Herzog and the liberal support of Kubrick, Haneke and Noe are very obvious that Thomas Clay considers himself cut off on the most common type of garbage in our UK film. "Robert Carmichael" (for a short time) puts himself on learning the truth of leaving the youth and at the same time it seems to be an investigation into Iraq. The problem and authenticity is that the perpetrators are so unreliable with the Ethiopian - as opposed to the fetal ideas of "young monitors" of many young people who do not have addictive drugs. As an Iraqi war investigation, the film about youth violence (for modern music talent - a sub-group of music has led to this emotional person) is too small to be difficult to consider. There are technical signals but some investigators have overturned this. If Kubrick and Noe show that the desire to be linked to the wrong intentions may be the worst film of a recent film. People liked "Clockwork Orange" and "Impossible" because they liked rape and abuse, but most of them liked to feel better culture for the most interesting things. So very Kubrick and Haneke are not enough (a strict and moral film manufacturer) here he writes this as one of the most prestigious films in years. (I do not contradict abuse in the film. Doing so with weight is a hard trick though - people in the cinema were happy Alex in the "Clockwork Orange" to show how the goal of Kubrick thought he had missed the mile. The exhibition of many film directors.)
