has never had a film that has led me to write a review but this was very bad. I agreed and tried to find out what this film has made snoop to see it as its first major but it really was a bad choice. made a good book but certainly did not work for me as a film. I found it strange, missing the situation and I found a lot of hideously stilted scenes. approved but not enough to carry a weak plot and weak conversation. maybe I have completely lost the point but to me it is wrong in any kind, it has never had any feeling for the characters nor included any problem, in fact I have found myself praying for the last and finding deep want to beat all three characters!
