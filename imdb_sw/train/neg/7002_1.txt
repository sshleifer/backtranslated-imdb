I saw this film and the other. The Trinity name is my name and I see that this is bad then the first. I don't know why they even made another film was slow and meaningless to say that I am all. I have been sitting several times and still driving my car to 5 minutes on the film. I love Terence Hill movies and I like Bud Spencer but this movie has moved me to the wall. If it had a line of different stories or at least more than a plot and more comedy could be funner and worth $ 5 I used to buy all the movies. But you make a mistake so that I would say to save your money and not leave this movie or any of what you might believe me about this.
