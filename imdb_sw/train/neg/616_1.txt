Let's say; some paralyzed child who dies and his soul is transferred to the scarecrow. Das no gonna happen! OMFG The prudent stupid child who cannot stand himself gets his ass taking him to a bastard a drunken bother his mother. When he dies, he looks on the scarecrow and he lets his spirit go into the scarecrow. A drunken boy has killed his death by making it look like suicide and thinking he had gone. Later we see the expulsion of the trailer and later gets another encounter with scarecrow. They had to meet for a short time with a drunken man calling a offender and scarecrow attacking and "He takes one to know one, lose!" The midwife walks around the building, calls him "father-o", and then gives the poor man. We can see how this amazing film comes from there. He continues to kill many people, later. He especially kills people who gave him a hard time in rl and goes away to kill other people of the random ass, for some laugh. No laughing here. Adds punchline to each kill, too. Every time he killed a man, he would make a karate flips and finish all with one of his signature punchlines. In the case of a man who was hard to hear, he could say "Here, and EAR of grain!" then shove on their ass. OR we can take a model from the movie! When he had killed the soldier and he was on his way to kill the only man who stood for him. His father, sheriff, told the madness to leave them, and said "Hey, stay a moment!" and he threw the pig into his chest and forbade him on the tree. At the end of the movie, he killed two people and gave a punchline "Gotta split!" and kill two people by blowing scythe in their heads. Wowzors, this movie has made me a cream of my bad pants. Maybe sometimes the guy makes a film, it won't be gay.
