I think the show has a good idea to work with. But the murder was poor. Script is poor and act is bad. There were many issues that could be shown in a better way, as a protest against gay marriage or a grave. The show can not be called as a comedy show if it does not humor sad. I should say that this show was not very successful in keeping the Muslim community at a certain level. Until now the second season is worse than the first. I was optimistic about this show, but I was disappointed. I still enjoy CBC by putting the concept in front of the audience. However I would like the best of luck for the future.
