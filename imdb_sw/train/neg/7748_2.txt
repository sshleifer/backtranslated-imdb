This movie was very bad. Sci-fi is usually my favorite channel so I watch all the original movies that play on it. I don't know if this film can be called the original. Starting zoo / theme reserves on a remote island sound very good. What it was, oh, Jurassic Park. But this has sabertooth tigers rather. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with a few college students at the island making some kind of treasure hunt. One of them ends up with a tragic death and some of the more specific effects I have seen. Blood seemed very like ketchup. Also at the beginning there is a scientist who wants to make a lot of tooth tooth tooth for people to enjoy. 3 of them have already fled and are traveling around to eat tourists, or people invited to the island to see the first cloud. Again, sounds like Jurassic Park. Perhaps the most cool thing was the toothpaste of 1000lb which drew near its front legs to kill a mad scientist and a kind of tooth that somehow decreased and passed through the boy's neck. The most fun death I have seen on TV. <br /> <br /> Acting is very fun, special effects are awesome. CG tigers can pass through soil models, and even some of the voices included. For example, when one of the college students was trying to escape, he used a ax to break the door, certainly he enters the door and almost 2 seconds later you hear the sound. This movie was very bad. Cheesy deaths were funny however.
