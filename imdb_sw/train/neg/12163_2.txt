The film putrid slasher completely does not have one quality of redemption. It has a Camp Counselor Angela (Pamela Anderson..awful as a murderer, his excitement when he disappears people do not like even) on the youth who kill the warpath who makes little or no prayer for his good behavior. We are running a kill, excitement of clich√©d as well as throat clans for one child watching his Freddy immunity, a child who gets a collection of accumulation, one girl who gets drilled, who gets a trunk into a trick (filled with leeches), a filtered person, etc. . It doesn't have one original idea to give and it's just a waste of time. That's unless you want to see Valerie Hartmen (who plays sly Ally) tits. More violence occurs off-screen so even that doesn't deserve it.
