The problems with this film are many, but I will try to mention what is more interesting and disturbing. First, when the theme shows several vignettes about the life of Manhattan, the fact is that everything, as usual in movies and television, had something extraordinary, usually the nature of sex. The lines of the story were narrower or nonexistent, and almost every scene, the camera shot, the conversation line, and expressed the feeling was completely, and quite fake. It finally reached a point after an hour of garbage cutting that I walked out (a strange thing for me in recent years.) I would have thought the filolm was led by some wannabe writers from outside the 3-level study program. The film, but I believe (at one time, a pre-Amelia director, talented) Mira Nair participated in this disgusting thing, so perhaps the leadership of the United States has come into the boat.
