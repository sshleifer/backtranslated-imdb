Ok, I saw this film first as at 9:00 on Cinemax a few weeks ago and I thought it would win a prize, the boy I was 180d on that. This movie is a great one. I mean, the mother of creation shows her true form only at the end of the movie. I'm going to "That's what? Why doesn't she show a little bit more earlier in the movie." The program will be the mother and baby's blood on the blood of young women. Isn't it better if they just went on, you know, the killings kill murder like several young women each other, then have a sheriff or a soldier know about and get into the past finding a way to kill monsters, except a woman / young woman, and have 1 people or 2 more killed in the process? I think it will be hell in the most beautiful way that way. It also gets because the child is the main character and is killed first. Why not remove the first mother? More, how can he have the power at the end of the movie when he starts killing people? He said that he was very weak. What had he missed with Stephen this time? I can never, never work on any movie with any actor, after all, trying the best. If it wasn't for good acting, I would like to give you this film 1/10. 3/10.
