Many have been made with the use of Rohmer's 'filling' technology. Sometimes it works well, the area where Grace and his wife provide evidence from far away from the assassination of the King is especially amazing. Sometimes it gives them an amazing film, similar to a home video. However, the failure of the core is that the strict monitoring of setting in the area creates the effect of leaving the viewer. We know that what we look at is not true and how can we feel about the characters? To say clearly, I didn't care about all that happened to Lady or Duk. Other things have died, I want to say, it's Lucy Russell's performance in the lead role. He is almost every area with success or otherwise the film depends on its performance. Well he says foreign language but can't show real feelings. His conversion to the area where he tells his friend Mme de Meyler (good performance for dumbler Helena Dubiel) when he saw the head on the pole that caused the laughter of the audience. Also, look at his hands while expressing emotions! All in the most desperate film, especially given the best views on this site.
