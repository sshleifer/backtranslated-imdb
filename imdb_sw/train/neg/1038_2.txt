Raising winner Vargas is just a bad film. There is no amount of refusal or a dollar channel used to change this sad reality. Perhaps Peter Sollett saw he didn't have the money to make the film he wanted to do and decided to take the easy way out by making a bad film that deals with the "current movie text". Maybe he doesn't know better. It's hard to tell. <br /> <br /> What's hard to say is the result. Except for a few viewers who will explain bad films in the authenticity of the conversion, a few will enjoy it. I know I did not. <br /> <br /> What! you are grace and pass this film.
