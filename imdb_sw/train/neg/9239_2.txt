Heavenly days make a very faux of comedy: it is a desire to teach us a civil lesson, and it will not leave you until we have passed the final test. Fibber McGee and Molly take a trip to Washington, where they see the ceremony in action (or not working, if you prefer), have a spat and their Senator (Eugene Palette in one of the worst roles of his work), know and interact with refugee children despair, and meet someone on the train reading the book of Henry Wallace. Henry Wallace! A year later, he was considered to be a dupe next to the communist, but in 1944, he was A-OK. Add some short music, very bad to hooey, and a small part of the journalists, and you have a film that must Philip Wylie ready to write. Boogaloo. Heavenly days, is another day to remind us that the devil has the best tunes.
