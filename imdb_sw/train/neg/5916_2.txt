The fastest motion of this film is probably intended to explain the director, to show how life was like growing as a village youth in China. However, I have found a combination of glacially "glamous" conspiracy and a general style of non-emerging writing that is totally alien, especially for western listeners. Sometimes I had trouble telling other parties away, as they were published from that distance. Two hours inside and I was really concerned. As a person who is not just interested in music but is also in history and culture of China (and through no guest to Chinese cinema), I couldn't cooperate with one character and found nothing to get my teeth into. It asks the question: If I didn't like it, who on earth would like? Give me Zhang Yimou, give me Chen Kaige. Give me the work of another Chinese director I have ever seen. This pole effort is not available at all. I would like to be sympathetic to see Chinese movies being judged against this logo.
