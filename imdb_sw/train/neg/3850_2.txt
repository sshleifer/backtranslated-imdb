I saw this film in SXSW and the attending director. Very few people came out, and the audience could insist on clapping at the end. Of the 60 or 70 movies I have seen in this concert, Frownland is among the worst. <br /> <br /> In 106 minutes, it's at least 95 minutes. You should look at the failure of the main character and stimulate contact experiments, for a long time. The same Grimaces, say the mouth, words and regular expressions and regular weapons - TUNA FUNA. <br /> <br /> One site compares this to Mike Leigh earlier. What medicines should you be about to make that statement? Since Frownland is a song of Captain Beefheart, maybe you would like to enjoy the Replica of the Mask Trout on the great circle of this film. Surprisingly, this has won a jury award at the festival. You can call the bet did not win the audience's award.
