Where do you get money to make a film like this? I mean, there is nothing liberating about this film. No known characters, the text is awesome, the pictures are lighter, the story circles between that bad version of Repo Man and west of nicklodeon and acting is impossible. For someone who looks at all kinds of films, good and bad, I must admit that this film is about the worst I have seen since the Eye People's attack after 50 years. , art but this film seems to appeal to no one. The story loses the mysterious destruction of a man who is a bad version of the Soul of the Soul, though he works more like a male vicubus without sex. The wicked should cooperate with good people in the city who cannot escape. Take from there as well, alas, it's the most beautiful place. My suggestion is that unless you are in bad mythology, writing amateur, having no sense of working and interesting, you will be better to serve by leaving this on the shelf when you are out of video rental.
