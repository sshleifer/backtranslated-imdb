This 1962 original movie editor of this book has a very good compliment and good performances and other good actors - however Scorsese goes toward the end of a serious deficit of the plot and the disgrace of the shyness that you had to look at me . DeNiro is a good actor, dedicated to doing all of his work, however he needs a focus on his talent, and this is not very much in the last five minutes of the film. Gregory Peck's comeo can be used but nothing more when Robert Michum always enjoys watching, even with a few lines like this. Nick Nolte returns to better performance than Lorenzo's fat but is not the same as the "weeds" form. Joe Don Baker has good lines when Juliette Lewis again shows that the talent sometimes crosses the generation. <br /> <br /> Some nice points? The earliest brilliant (!), The first view of the Cody at the time of the prison intervention, the area where Cody is attacked by pop bats baseball, Sam Bowden's respect in full-fledged fear, Cody's outdoor quiet but unnerving prescence. <br /> worse? "Woman cleaning - but not true!" part. Cling to the lower hands of the car for a hundred miles at high speed. (Is there no speed swelling in the United States?) "He's dead - but not true!" The section and the earlier refugees are approaching. I can look again at nature, but I haven't been tempted to look for remake for four years since seeing it.
