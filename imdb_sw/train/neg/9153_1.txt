I have never published a review before, but I had to do it with this film! This film is very bad, I found myself trying to justify how bad it is to try to think of as kitsch or parody. But it's not. In fact, without independent BAD. This is a great test that comes to glory. Other viewers have shown many films, so I will try to repeat these, but I encourage you to see this film. In that I was speechless, because of lack of faith, or walking on the floor in wonders. I have never been very happy to watch movies in years. In fact, I'll try to find all my friends to see that's the kind of movie that needs to be divided. My favorite places: - While Arthur's text is going to go - little boy (his play was not possible) - Nudity free (director / lead actor only had to get a nude shot) - a preacher's office and as much as the crayon of Christ - Of course, the most popular wedding event and palm trees and earrings (what work of the story does this work?)? - The fight against the former wife and Ben to get his possession - a comprehensive series where Arthur kills the preacher; he seems to be burning with this very measuring match - Yes, religious-fanatic and hairy hair and WeHo fashions - And, my favorite, the use of Joplin's "The Entertainer" as the opening voice and "Canon's Pachebel in D Major "like a fast sound! - The list continues with - CAN NEED !!!
