Director Sidney J. Furie has created a Hollow Point modern sophisticated scenario that is challenging and surprises the audience. Sidney J. Furie tries to ask a question of what is happening to the common concerns of traditional 'conspiracy' and 'reputation' when you remove the 'motivation' and 'cause'. <br /> <br /> Results cause me to say that my opinion on it could not get any higher. <br /> <br /> One and a half stars. <br /> <br /> P.S. Nothing in this movie makes any sense, law enforcement agents are flat out of the uneven and organized criminals full of evil.
