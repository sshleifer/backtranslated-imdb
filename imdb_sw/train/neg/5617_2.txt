This documentary film is based on the infallibility of the evidence, where Brian Flemming, perhaps intentionally, cannot mention important evidence on the contrary. Perhaps his most important errors are one of the first: His claims about the lack of Paul's testimony about Jesus Christ did not matter, as: ** the existence of certain beliefs recorded in Paul's letters. This teaching says that many of Jesus' claims about it have already been made in the belief of possible faith within a few years of death and resurrection of Christ. ** The testimony of the early Christians can not only be canceled as fantasy. Certainly there were many who claimed to be the Messiah at that time, but it was one of them who remained: Jesus. Why? Because it would have been pride for anyone to believe Christ was the Messiah, and to die for those beliefs, if they knew that he was not resurrected. ** Even though the Gospels are written more freely, we are still talking about the accounts of Jesus recorded in the lives of others who had eyewitness evidence that would explain the accuracy in these Gospels. And there is evidence that the Gospels were written very early. What I say is that Flemming's document is a piece of self-reliant and independent work that puts the different points of view with proof of serving his argument against the Christian. Do not show poor diagnosis.
