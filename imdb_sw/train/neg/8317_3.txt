For films about this killer is amazing amazing. Nothing is happening and even when things do not reflect any real interest or interest. The role is good from two guides, Cassetti especially provides good performance to combine the point with the ignorance of Succo but all others form what they need. The problem is that there is poor text and direction and the fact that if the true story is not interesting, Succo is not a unique character, it is not popular or exciting. This type of film usually tries to produce tension or understanding or anger and this produces anything but a feeling of regret that you have lost your time looking.
