Five passengers at the bus station say their horrible dreams are waiting to pick them up. But there are more than these dreams than facing the eye? Lucky me, five bad movies at one price!

In fact, I even stopped the broadcast, since they were a better deal than the main entertainment. And the end is the last mistake. Yes, nothing has happened. If just the same can say the day I put my VCR to record these cobblers
