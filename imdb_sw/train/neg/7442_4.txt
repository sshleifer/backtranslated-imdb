Sorry, this movie didn't just intimidate me. It was so amazing when I saw the possibility and that, all of that, fell along the way. Children! Father! Introduction! He had so much power and ziltch! zero, nada! I've heard all before. Scary! No! I can only fear myself, here where I'm sitting, than they could in the movie. What? Are there people who write that statistics that women should be very angry? Huh? This movie was quite at all. Or at least it would have had a director / author who was injured to do the job. We can have good music that they could add to the tension too, if someone had worked hard. What do I want to know why they get money? Just give me and save each hassle. Stopped? ... No where we are left
