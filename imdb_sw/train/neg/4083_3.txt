I saw this movie when it was released, and my demolition was stuck with all these years. This is the reason: <br /> <br /> Greenaway's goal seems to be taking pictures of literature in Tempest and making it real. If the character would say, "my heart takes the airplane," we should be shown a real human heart, and the wings of a dove connected, to break on the screen. This process makes some packages better, but ultimately it's a simple exercise. And it becomes boring bad. <br /> <br /> I'm not afraid the other viewers found in this movie, but it's worth knowing that not everyone in the audience was brought.
