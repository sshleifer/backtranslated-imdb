This is a very sad movie. True. Nothing happens in this film. Document is bad !!! I think they just missed the first 15 pages up to 90 pages. They failed. Now in the third week only runs Antwerp and Brussels at 22h45 or something. In the past we have had very good movies in Belgium, like Daens. Shades are wasting your time. Maybe you can run on the theater after seeing a real movie. If you have seen 10 minutes of Shades, you have seen all. It was announced the death of local radio and TV. I hope it will disappear in Shades soon.
