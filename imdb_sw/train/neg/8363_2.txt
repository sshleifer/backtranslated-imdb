I paid 2 instead of 1 because I think "Wongo Women's Wongo" is worse. This is the exercise of patience. It's like having your teeth cleaned and bad tooth. There is no plot. No logic. Certainly there is no acting (although the shark has a quality conversation). We don't give up anything. We don't know where the people got. It is always amazing how such things are opened. I agree with the previous author that it is not so bad. I know. It's almost 90 minutes long and which will fill up a great space on DVD collection. It's like paperweight. Or bad painting buys for the sale of hungry artists. It covers the crack in the wall.
