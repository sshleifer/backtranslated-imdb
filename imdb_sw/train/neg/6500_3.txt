Look, I have poor if half of the world takes guilt for this, but life is mixing. I don't need to look at it that way. I'm dancing Anthony Hopkins, a lot of time. I even looked at Fracture, and I knew it would be a bunch of Quentin filtering. But this is not smoothly, and not bold - even if it is very much. Well-produced films have reason to be reduced and rapid change, not "oh, but it's a real translation" excuse. This will make your head hurt. It's a fast moving picture to take you anywhere. I still love AH, and I will give him another chance, but if it's time to look at bad ideas on the screen, skip this.
