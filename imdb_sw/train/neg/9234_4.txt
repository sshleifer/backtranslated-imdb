Remade today, this film would be very creepy, very exciting of dark comedy. The crawling, losing, and false network and effectiveness are given the 1948 magazine of the innocent. Drake plays with a player, an amazing man, a pathetic mix and a watchful, Grant affected, angry and unaware. <br /> <br /> Very fast; I have not been able to watch the ethnic romances and the same suspension since unbelief. <br /> <br />
