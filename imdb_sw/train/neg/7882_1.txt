After stopping with a movie shop to find something to watch, we made a mistake about this. It seemed attractive to the summary, at least, so we tried it. And here's the kicker: the first 20 minutes is interesting! It's really enjoyable! Oh, wait, you said recently. The place where the bats are there, the movie takes a disgusting evolution as the basis for the washing of the Christian's basic brain. Not quite sure what happens, but I think the author of the screenplay sought God somewhere there, he has completed writing this script, and had no time to edit because he had a KKK meeting to have his friends from Westboro Church and his hood 'T clean. <br /> <br /> Can they put warnings on this? I refuse to support this religious idiocy. Periods like video games have screening systems, movies need a sign type: maybe a small cross on the bottom corner to show us that the film will take the worst. Unless you share feelings with anything that comes with this story, and it will have your Bible opened in your hat when you look at this and plan how you will change your neighbors, don't waste your time. It's some of the worst junk that has come out for a long time, and religious religious nuts do not need any money.
