This movie went up with the "capital" "The opening part showed a promise. But the" promise "was broken shortly after the viewer learned where the plot was going. very much in the original film, it seems to be clear in this one. It was very obvious a guy in a low-cost plastic dress. (And by the way, who is the one who thinks "Morty" is one of the non-awesome names on the planet Earth? It's the same above with "Jimmy" or "Fred" when it comes to a terrible value. Or why not just name a wooden command of Henry-freakin-Kissinger. "Run, it's Dr Kissinger!" <br /> And then there is a place where the "hero" hits his father's stone and --- "sledgehammer?" can you think - "two-and-four?" one can develop. stick - a freakin branch worse than that, once the actors are leaving, the grave stone of the real, and, of course, gives them blood. There is also a natural American boy who lives with grandparents of the main character, but it seems, he has nothing but nature-maintenance He develops the fury of death, warns those who condemn, and even makes Morty's arm when it is destroyed at the time of the prank of children. With all his respect and compassion for Morty, does not Morty provides the hair of the mouse back? No. <br /> <br /> Movie is approaching, and eventually some people die in ways related to their worst (type) fears. This film is a real yawner. Do not rent.
