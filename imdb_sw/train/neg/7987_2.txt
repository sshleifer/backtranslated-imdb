I'm sure this was one of those "WOAH!" The attractions of 1982 when Epcot was opened, but now it's just silly. The message of the film is clich√©. Cycle-Vision is disturbed. And that final end song is grating. And I wish they would put chairs. After a very walk, all you want to do is sit down for a few minutes. And when you hear there is a film to see it is a very good sound! Do you enjoy sitting down, right? WRONG! You stand there for 18+ minutes standing against a little contempt. Disney should make the Maelstrom almost as the influence of proposed things and replace this lighter, unassigned film. Not FUN. Skip it. In fact, skip Canada completely unless you eat there. Go straight to England.
