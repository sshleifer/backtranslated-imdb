"Washington Square" is a combination of flat, interactive novel by Henry James. Indeed, the novel is very good, but far from the level of James technicians. Additionally, his simple, endless story seems unworthy to make it a film (though William Wyler, and his "Heiress", gave in 1949 a good version of the novel). However, the film gives us the full spirit of this work of the great American author. In the novel, Catherine heroine is shy, not very attractive and somewhat, but it is still a voice, a young woman intelligent, and not as naive as it may seem. His solidarity with his father is respectful and honorable, and there are no sides in it. With three quarters of the movie, Catherine (Jennifer Jason Leigh) just seems to have a sense of losing, the worst thing. In the last quarter, he suddenly (and wonderfully) becomes intelligent, knows his dignity as a woman, and all that. <br /> <br /> Director Agnieszka Holland has added two bad scenes to the story. The first, when the nervous child Catherine has, well, has trouble with her vesica. The second part, when we look back to the type of brazen brass, with prostitutes taking their customers behind the tent, and so forth. Nothing can be the most opposed to the spirit of the art of Henry James. It is so bad that the author was very respectful and even harmful to Victor's age. I despise anyone to get any brutality anywhere in thousands of pages of James' s great literature production. In fact I was particularly angry with these two events. Well, I know that the director needs sufficient freedom in the effectiveness of the novel screens. But if the director refuses or misunderstands the art of the author (here Henry James), I don't see the point of using his work to make a bad film. <br /> <br /> Acting is enough for the movie: poor and flat, despite the talent of Albert Finney and Maggie Smith. "Washington Square" is definitely unintended film.
