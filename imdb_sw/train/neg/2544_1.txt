Gung Ho was a good idea, however it was a lot to ask the audience of Americans to understand the US work force and foreign competition. In this movie the main character of hunting Stevenson (Michael Keaton) goes to Japan and convinces a Japanese car company to come to America and help his dying city in Pennslyvania. Two things come to you. Why does the Japanese company come to America to make cars when they do, and so well? Secondly, can anyone understand that US companies of all types go to third-world countries so that they have their products to escape the cost of American work? It makes the Power of the film then that the number of world cars would go to one of its top competitors (far from Germany) and put the plant there as untrue. Keaton was still in his comedy state at this time. But she provides a reliable performance evenly and can prove that she could go from playing and acting in a matter of seconds and still not embarrassing herself but Director Ron Howard can't put this to a TV movie that ends up being however because they should give an impossible story to be and the pleasure of ending politics and problems with Japanese and American relations without consideration. Gung Ho has a Happy Day and Laverne and Shirley feel like the producers of all television shows have made a film and then made a television version of this film which also gives the film a "lighter." Japanese manager likes to love American workers and feels he and other Japanese people can learn from Americans. Hao No.2 person Saito who thinks he does not like many Americans do not think so. I would like to give all Japanese characters like Saito than a soft goofball characters Japanese be. It would have made the film more interesting.
