This movie is not as bad as many Sci-Fi Channel movies. I have been seeing CGI gray blogs and special effects of amateur as close-ups of artificial blood that makes it very clear that blood is a syrup of strawberry or another different syrup. However, I thought that I found all possible lows on which the Sci-Fi Channel could hit. Then I saw this film. <br /> <br /> Think of a hand inside the sock which is glazed with vinegar? That's the main Alien sessions in this film. You can see open fingers in the rubbery puppets. The talking hand comes from the guts of the victims, and the Vampire who are on the Vampire Hunter team can talk to Sock's sticks in Transylvanian. How did the Immigration System learn Transylvanian? And not Transylvania in Romania? So should they not speak Romanian? Why does a small town have their own language? If you can stop your gag reflex and pass the socks to talk with your fingers to go straight into the guest heads; then you should deal with other guest vampires. There are "Leatherfaces" who like to wear the faces of their victims. Then there are those who just plain that all seem to have many face scars. Then there are the Fascist Workers and their boys who are human traffickers and they enter the colonies of space so they can destroy the Protection systems so that the Vampires of Space can attack. Finally, if you think all of the above is funny and worth laughing, you have to deal with the third level thrown TV Network refuses to create this team of heroes heroes who are always fighting between themselves. Why almost every movie of the Sci-Fi Channel uses the leading guides that are sad, unpleasant, dirty, or not quite worried? I found myself hoping to go around the soccer socks without winning.
