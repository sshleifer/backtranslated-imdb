I longed to love this, but it is ultimately a very poor and very popular film. Politics is a top spot, you'll have to destroy hell from the trickers but that's what it was designed to do. That alone gives me a reason to beat. <br /> <br /> The problem is, it looks like it was done for a quick REAL (like about a week). And it has a stupid fool about a singer, which seems to be far from the topic. Turiqistan is obviously Iraq, or Afghanistan, or any other country in America has f ** ked and since 50 years. Humor is a little dark (amputees dancing with the nature of the genre made by Tamerlane) but it is on the mark, especially with organizations entering the building ("democracy lite"!) However, as many satanic refusals, it seems to be heavier and to work. I think it faces many propaganda bs so they have to bludgeon on the head to make sure. Who knows. I would like more of the protective technique, wink - a bit of trick. But I am the only one. Even though I might look at it again, maybe I lost something. I hope "W" is more than a score.
