So it has come to this. Quickly, expensive cars that only 1% higher will ever run. Girls who are close to them in gearhead magazines. Second characters and name-name. Affordable appearance from people from niche culture. <br /> <br /> This is a garbage which Hollywood should provide. Don't do wrong; I like pointless flick and hot chicks like the second person. But please, the Braintrust corporation that will put these things please please, count ten, breathe, have a heart "Woooooosaaaaaah", then return twentyfive years and remember what made the movies enjoy once in a while? Then really do some movies such as again? <br /> <br /> I have nothing against poker, but all the pop-culture blast has enjoyed over the past five years is ridiculous. Everyone and their mother think Maverick them now (not that half of them even will get that memory). Some executive said, "Hey, what is the population you want to stop $ 9.50 out?" "I know, sir. The market of 18-35." "Ok, let's give them poker, girls, and fast cars." "A good idea, sir." Results? Films that I have seen one hundred nights at Spike TV, and more often than, star Dolph Lundgren. Do not understand me well; not a snob of the film. On top of the art starts as an English patient is not describing my boat, but the reproductive films that should not have been done directly with the DVD to eliminate my hell too. Will only the gearheads of young people have their modified engine with this, and I think those on the end of their IQ list will see this why it's: junkyard.
