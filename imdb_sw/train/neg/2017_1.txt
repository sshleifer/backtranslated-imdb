This plan is clear but banal, that is, a good wife and a rich man of a rich and powerful man has fling and hunkistiskist, then tries to cover it as psychological stalks and share him. But, what's going on from there is an improper fraud. Despite the resources available to ordinary couples who have money and influence, our personal heroine and heroine seem to have only one house, their lawyer and local police (who say they can do nothing) while they are fighting with doubts and fears. They do not have personal security personnel (just the concept of the security system that they work), household workers or characters, chauffeurs, etc.. However, the money for the recruitment of private nurses to take care of the hero when he was injured injuries to life, leaving the husband and wife alone with anxiety in their home. Our heroine is shown to have a brave shop with our hero, tycoon, makes it impossible and odd. The production is a problem for the audience who lost their time and this drivel and crime for having lost the talent of former actors Oliva Hussey and Don Murray (what did they think?). And, embarrassment to the Life TV by despising the minds of his listeners for this unusual offering.
