This movie looks like it can be entertaining and interesting from its details. But for me it was a bit allowed. Slowly and hard to follow and see what happens. It was as if the film manufacturer took the pieces of the film and threw them into the air and gave them spliced ​​together in any way they put it (of course not in the order of equity). Also, no results were made. I have examined several Korean films and I have found that a good part has been done well and needs to consider the part of the viewer, which is different from the typical Hollywood film. But this delivered me to the end. I saw the film for the second and third time and did nothing to me. I still don't know what the film manufacturer was trying to convey. If it is just showing the normal part of a person's life, I think he succeeded. But I looked for more. Needless to say, I can recommend this movie to anyone.
