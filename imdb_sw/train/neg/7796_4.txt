Wow, not just this film "a new tastes bad taste," but also a lesson in "realistic film decisions." Do not make a mistake, I appreciated the concept of 'Zombie '90: A serious illness,' at the same time a person must realize when a movie is caused. If you have missed the story, the 'Zombie' 90 'plan deals with the government of a chemical carrying poisonous chemicals that take place in the desert, causing chemical burst, and converting locals into a watch of zombies. Another thing you know, the zombies are on the city eating people living, while the look-goofy doctor and the government agent are trying to identify the disease that causes these people to curse - so the name of "Extensive Disease." From then on, everything we see is zombies have a day of the field everywhere - nothing but something that is so common and missing and the buttons with the endless bucket of guts and gore. Since this is a German film, the film had to be translated into English and when it fits on the feed frenzies of the zombies, the sounds are hilarious and entertaining. If the UnratedX user is mentioned * SPOILER * * SPOILER * * SPOILER *, there is a scene in the film that crosses the line between what is acceptable and unacceptable, so the place where the woman, who has taken her newborn baby, is strangled around her wheel and some dude and horde of zombies comes from anywhere and attack. Zombie one takes the baby and breaks it into pieces, eating its ingredients as you hear the baby crying. Come on, that's a new lesson in bad taste REALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL. I tell you, anger.
