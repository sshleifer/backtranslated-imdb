I just got this film ... Was it music? no .. but there were songs played and played in it ... <br /> <br /> It was a good game. Who / Who Gold Gold is a good actor. I was struggling to stay awake through this full movie. The message on racism and "tax" for students who died during the uprosing of the student is noted. But if this recreation was very bad and if the film's fashion was much worse. Watch out for yourself, but I just loved it
