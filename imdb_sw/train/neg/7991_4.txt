Color for the story and the effectiveness acting in a certain color - and the moments that are very strange and very sensitive. It makes it possible to beat the beautiful transition of the girl to an adult, and is deeply involved in and inventively with the cultural cultural experience of the main family. Unfortunately this essence of a good movie is suddenly shut down and a very destructive plot that can incorporate a religious conflict, a crisis on the road construction project, sexual life of secondary and even higher actors , a mysterious person who lives in the forest, a bunch of color-colored people, at least three different meals, difficult for the local church politics, and continuing on. And all of this did not include a real plot, which is about hope, dream, and pain of the two girls (and all their families) during their lifetime. I had trembled when I realized that the whole thing was supposed to be done during the summer (and that many movies reached 1.5 hours!) Finally the movie is melodramatic, every plot is predictable, major life-changing events occur and then it's forgotten about 10 minutes later. .. and some of these events are very poor. Most surprisingly the fact that one of the perpetrators has been involved in a horrible crime (in "downhill") and then it has been completely forgiven by the entire event ever since. Similarly, the second character is brought only to die for a few minutes later and give another "effort". It is all quite mechanical, to the end that you are actively engaged in all (well not all, those who the movie thinks you care about.)
