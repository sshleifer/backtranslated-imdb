Rumor has that when NASA Technical Experts on this film were asked to put a reliable image, they laughed for several hours. After all, unless you are a politician or a workmaker, you cannot enter the shuttle. Additionally, Camp (Cadet) Camp is located in Alabama, not Florida. The truth is everyone in the world will win a fortune and a billion dollars before the events shown on this film have been made. This film had children's meaning, and it had to be written by one, because they do not know many obstacles and requirements for access to the KSC / CCAFS. This is the most inappropriate film of all time, and it was well worth it.
