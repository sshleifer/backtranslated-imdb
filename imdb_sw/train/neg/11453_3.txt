This film is one of the worst movies I have seen. I hate these Napoleon Dynamite restrictions. Dealing with people who are worried already have learned. Do something new at once. All these new comedies are just bad. And come from SNL Andy Samberg ready for the lead role yet. I hope he can go back from this bad film. And Is the behavior of Arnetts will be quite bad. Hey Have you read the script. The program is actually written more. Now tell me if this is wonderful. (this is the movie) The father of Rod Kimble's Frank dies and the family needs $ 50,000 to pay heart surgery so Rod makes a big jump to raise money to Frank. Just so that Rod could beat Frank in fighting and confirming his glory. Yes this movie, you tell me, you would be spending $ 7.00 to see this piece! Only 3/10 of fearful!
