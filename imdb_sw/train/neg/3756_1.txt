In fact it's a bad film. My daughter rented because she, well, is idiot. But again, I must be an idiot also because I looked at anything! Pastors were with geeks of high school who think they are going. The only place they will go is to return to the waiting tables on Luby's. All I could think of when I was looking at this "gem" was how it was found. I mean, some of the "photo reporter" really thought that this column was clean, original and profitable. Then some money and money believed in the script so much that he decided to abolish more money and lies of ignorance that he would go back on. The traders were thrown, the places were beaten, pretenders were hired, computer leaders from the School of Graphic's Al Collins School were brought by this turd began to take the form. It is obvious that tons of things I hated about this argument but one thing that drove the craziest was the use of music. Every minute of this flick was hit. There was no single break in music. And sometimes you were more confused than talk, not that you did it when you lost a key point or anything. After the expiration, we decided to look at the Mystic River. It was like driving a VW Diesel's Rabbit of 1980 then switch BMW 740il. You can't find two other movies against quality.
