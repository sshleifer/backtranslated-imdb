Its Evil is MOVIE OF PERFECT for film students ... learn how not to make a film! Let's see what they did on this flick? The worst mix of music The worst publication Publisher notes The worst of the script SEARCH USE THE GAMES The worst worst The worst task The worst outlook The worst scenarios The worst layout Poorly bad The bad look. If this "film" was gone black and white, ... it would still be wrong. All events are dark (people's lights are called "black"), often, the music mark has opened the same dialogue, which was the same because no one has ever spoken two sentences without standing for long. The "bad" Robot was a hilarious ... what was it? Jazz play? Oh ... I think it was supposed to walk tactically or something. I have certainly struck the fears within the hearts ... of poor editors. And, how do you limit the amount of litter? Not possible. Tools are litter, no matter how you put it. How did anyone get this every day? Underneath it below - I can't stand up to watch groups over 15 minutes, it was very bad ... but I saw something else (for the rest of losing) just to see if it has any good part in it. NOPE! YES! <br /> <br /> A perfect example of how to make flick ... you must see for every bad movie student!
