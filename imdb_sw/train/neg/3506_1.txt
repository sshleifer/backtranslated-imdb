I can quickly see all the positive comments and say this can be a good show. especially bother me on the show. What bothers me is that people look at this and think it is funny. <br /> Basically the plot is simple ... it's about women who are hurt, engaged, demolished (Sarah Silvermen) to find a way to everyday life. In fact almost every joke has been done or is a racist. <br /> <br /> Sarah also likes to sing. on many things. <br /> <br /> If you would like to see the women of the fire put everyone down and down make th em feel like crap at the same time farting and say crap on each race then this show is for you.
