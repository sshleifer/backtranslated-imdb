Ben Masters, (Kyd Thomas), "Dream Lover", '86 has a kind of Mike Hammer character, a personal eye who performs any old work with buck and never misses out all the sexy curves of good gals. Kyd makes one big mistake when he leaves Morgan Fairchild, (Laura Cassidy / Eva Bomberg), "Arizona Summer", '73 from getting beaten and raped. Kyd takes Laura home to her pad and when it rises, she is out on her patio to eat her eggs with orange juice and pretend to be well at home. By the way, Kyd lay in his bed with Laura slept on the bed for this particular place. Laura is mixed with all types of hood and there are some hot cases between Kyd and Laura. All they have said and done, this is a beautiful picture and I bought a DVD for only 1.50 dollars and I've found it!
