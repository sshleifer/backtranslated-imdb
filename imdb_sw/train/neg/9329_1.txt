One of the worst movies I saw. My only idea was: "How can I get my money from the Hollywood video". This is not the value of four dollars, or any dollar. I think it was an attempt to stop Mexican movies, or Vin Diesel, but failed to do so. <br /> <br /> Acting was bad, I felt sorry for the actors who could not find something better to do with their time. The story was ridiculous. We were calling before the actors, it was so predictable. The Mexican model of the woman who led was promising, worse than cartoon. <br /> <br /> Delete it.
