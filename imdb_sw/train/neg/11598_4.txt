As you look back on another evil evil dream as Freddy's revenge, you should give them credit to try something new. And although Baby Dream is more enjoyable offers absolutely no new to series. Yes, there is a death of creativity as usual, as a child being part of a comic book and faces a "Super Freddy" but even such incidents are not used for all their abilities and pieces without Freddy is just boring. <br /> <br /> Show the official death of scariness for succession. Freddy seems to have a comedic relief now ... but why? <br /> <br /> My Test: 4/10
