What is interesting is that acting; not bad, not enough. It was blind, special effects or lines were one mistake for this failure. They stood alone were not too bad, but put together was a bad argument. The summary was seen for a long time and decreased with the specific effects that appear to speed up the movie together, but it has failed completely. The great offender of this disaster was placed on special effects. Do not believe, they were cold. Appleby was not the best choice for this effort. Although they may have all had to choose from a bit of recognition for the fan. An experienced host can bring something to that place, like Appleby did not. Scfi puts real-quality movies, it's so bad that this has failed too much.
