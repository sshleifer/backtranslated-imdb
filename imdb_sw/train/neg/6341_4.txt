The East Palace, the Western Palace reminded me of a certain amount of detective, and Frank Sinatra in the role of the police, and William Windom is a boy. It is a continuous film in China, I think, but it also develops the theory of male sex: a lot is made by Chinese stories that men take female roles. The movie focuses on a powerful man who wants to dominate and hurt the guy's eyes. He takes the garden without fear - he hopes to be put into the station's station. And that actually happens. Then he tells the officer his entire story of life when under suffering pain: made for the squat for a period of time, taken in hand, accursed. This is the gay man wants, and, quite plainly, a homosexual is a challenge of the picture of the man as a male. Stories about the life of a homosexual (which include change) can be tolerant, but when he begins to describe the ancient Chinese stories and a great job, the movie becomes inconsiderate. It becomes a cry of sympathy for Chinese gay, who just want to fulfill the traditional role in Chinese society. Sorry, I can't include.
