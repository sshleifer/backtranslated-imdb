They often say that movies cannot be the same as the original book. In fact, in this case, not only the movie is not "good" as a book, but it is insulting to the book. I would like to see Milan Kundera's novel than the "something" that the director can call "offset." Every good philosophy that asks "is better to bear a heavy burden on your shoulders, or to deal with the impatient gentleness of that?" is set aside, and instead, all movies are involved with Daniel Day Lewis' (I can't tell Tomas) the sexual adventures of his dumb wife, his grandmother, and his other girls. Fran√ßois Truffaut said: The bad directors make bad movies. Don't waste your time and money. Read the book instead, it is very important.
