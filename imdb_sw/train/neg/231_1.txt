This starts off the worst, what it is with three women acting as simpering junior high school wussies sitting around giggling with their gin, cigarettes not having a chocolate caramel treat for the one who says the best 'man' story, and then becomes worse - = - alert spoiler = - = what with Andie's fall of a young player player who is used to be his pupil when he was 14 (there is a headmistress of English school, you believe or not), just to have him destroyed due to his bitch - from hell 'partner'. ..and then from there, it's essentially unwatchable claptrap: he forgives his 'friend' and has a player's love baby tool and 3 women end up as they start, drink more gin and smoking more blah blah blah. Andie's character throws caramel chocolates in the street, in just a weak attempt is a sign of growth. Mercy.
