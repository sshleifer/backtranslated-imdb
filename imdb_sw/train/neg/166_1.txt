Equally first, I didn't sit down to look at the Prime Minister's "Star Trek" Series to see a cowboy around in space. this is how the normal part of the business makes the job / knight / game that gets a look at it. <br /> <br /> 2 sends a transfer into the nebula and transferring the spoiled ... <br /> <br /> to all the events I have seen, all problems occur because of Archer's error. Oh and have you seen a preview of one place showing Archer and T'pol kissing?!?!?!?!?! I had planned to look at that period but after I had completely rejected the business and turned on the TV completely. Come! This is a star journey !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> Also what was the banana slug? In one place, Hoshi had a slug of bananas but had to leave behind for some stupid reason. Well good, dumb little bring you a pet slug into place but nothing. Well that's what I thought until they left it on the desert planet !!!!! BANANA SLUG can't stop at the festival !!!!!!!!!!!! Do these authors are dumb / doves / any ways, just say if Business is on HAI to see IT !!!!!
