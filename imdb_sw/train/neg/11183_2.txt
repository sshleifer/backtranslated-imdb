"People I know" is a group that no one takes care of and no one cares - despite the efforts of a talented throwing game. Pacino offers his usual journey of power like Eli Wurman, an agent of the old-old former life of moral degradation. But unlike Michael Corleone, it is impossible to have an emotional investment in this character, its problem, or its destiny. <br /> <br /> The film shows Eli's preparations for the benefit of political independence, when he was corrupted by a client (Ryan O'Neal, good in the bottom section) of the recent "dirt dead" - in this case a TV player who has been in contact with the wrong people. Tea Leoni brings its ability to the traditional star in this role of helping, although again, the script does not give him a lot of work. As Eli's son-in-law, Kim Basinger can ask for mercy despite improper mechanism. <br /> <br /> This movie is for those who like to watch Pacino to beat his items, and enjoy other princes. Unfortunately, between the script and the direction, "People I know" are very effective. So give him a little wind, and a quick trip to the DVD. Imagine yourself warned.
