See it last night at the Midnight Slam Festival of Monde film in Montreal. What a desire. This movie is more obviously rated by IMD fans. Acting was only but ordinary. Redirecting does not bring anything new or interesting. The program doesn't matter very much: the movies are all about those university groups and the game they play and they make a prank (7eventy 5ive). And above that, you can predict the end of the film in the first five minutes. If you like prank phones and slasher and the axis that makes you jump once or twice during the entire movie, you can love it. If you don't, this movie is not recommended.
