Unfortunately it must agree with the suspect written by halopes. <br /> <br /> For a short movie film, clothing, set, sound, editing and everything else is very good. This may seem strange at first but I was told that technical staff working on this job had specialists, so quality is expected. The problem, as usual, lies in the story itself. <br /> <br /> Something is, not really a story. To tell a story (or in the case of a movie, SHARIA story) you need a plot and conflict. You need things that happen to the protagonist: events. These events occur because the protagonist wants something and, for some reason, can not find. Tim Watcher has no problems or goals. He is a kind of an unusual institution that looks at mankind. That's right. So what we are here is a clean display. Instead of being shown the story, we just learned things about Tim Timer individual. Of course, based on the special timing of Tim Watcher and the short period of film, it is difficult to give enough history about it so that the film station is being sent to the top voice. In this case it is used in the worst possible sense that is to report that otherwise we will never collect. In fact, if it is not for VO we think the character was just a kooky old man looking around. Make the situation worse VO also spells out on the screen! The photos we have been shown are just a decoration of the text we listen to. I could say that this short film could make a good video for a band or something, but because the images don't get 'T stand alone they can't say so. What was left is worth as a measure of technical capacity of employees (not surprising, but it's good) but it does not appeal to pleasing, pleasing, exciting or, at least, showing the story.
