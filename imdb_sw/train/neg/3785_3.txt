You said as the true authenticity of boiling. Stories are not worse than any gangster group, but never ever mix this film with The Godfather I or II, or Goodfellas. Not in one league. But what makes the film ever painful to watch is all Italian Americans turning around to stop the bad gangsta's worst situation. Pacino would have been good if they could have called him. I was expecting to see Abrahams and Loggia, but their steenky forcing to destroy the fun. <br /> <br /> Ah well, the script is not too hot either. Don Corleone would do so disappearing five minutes after meeting him, exciting and beating back back at all times.
