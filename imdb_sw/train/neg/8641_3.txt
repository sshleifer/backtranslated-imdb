Grand Central Murder (1942) Dir: S. Sylvan Simon <br /> <br /> Production: MGM <br /> <br /> This 'B' secret was only one of five films released in 1942 by Simon as a director. Surely he could have another Red Skelton film or two for his schedule! However, Grand Central Murder is an infinite printing of Thin Man's films, namely, charm, and chemistry of heads. We are dealing with a thin plot of paper that cannot help in its 73 minutes, bad habits and fatigue. Van Heflin and Virginia Gray play Nick with Nora Char, er, and Butch Custer. He is a PI and he is his wife and a sleeping partner. They are participating in the "beautiful" flag for each other. See? It is quite different. Heflin is alone here who denotes great things and better, though he is very close to being a jerk in this. Gray Virginia was in Another Bad Man, but again, I would like to insist, the FILIA IS ONLY GOD, no master. And if we start to think that this film is not quite suitable as another film (say, THI MAN) we like the truth, Sam Levene pops up as a shooting spider who is a kind of dim and should be Van Heflin subtly directing him towards all the necessary direction. Hmmm. Quickly, 'murder' is the player of Mida King, who likes to do business on rich people until he sees even the richest. He is played by Patricia Dane, who is like C-version of Hedy Lamarr, even opening his mouth and turning to F. There are all the people of the wacky suspects, both with their motivation to seek the dead. There are a variety of races, newsletters to talk hard, pigs, former boyfriend, and shady impresario movies (Tom Conway, here closed with the name of 'Frankie Ciro'). Roman Bohnen has a nervous type, jittery, something I believe can do before. Millard Mitchell has an idiot caller who, with a gag that will never stop, cannot stop thinking about the ass of the donkey waiting for him once the case is closed (yes, Millard Mitchell, swordsman). Finally, by breaking the story completely, something that we have never seen before, all suspects have gathered in one place where they say their stories (like flashhocks) to investigate, such as Rocky takes an overview of the mind, until finally the guilty person is forced to freeze over. confession. <br /> <br /> On the actual picture being dud, I naively thought to go in that there could be a couple of real 1942 era era era, but alas, no. There is only one short shot at first. Thank you for anything, Grand Central Murder. So, considering, sisie is a formulaic, but Heflin was the same. <br /> <br /> * 4 out of 4
