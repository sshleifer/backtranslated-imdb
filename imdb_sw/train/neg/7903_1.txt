I think I watched this film, but do not read it, since I have been lying down to look at it if it did not "hold on my excitement". At least I know I look enough to know I can't look at it again soon. Or forever. <br /> <br /> Jeez, talk about blind ... In fact they are lame. Quite completely. It cannot even appeal to the age of six. In fact he had no significant value. Zilch. Nada. Just shlock turned to a dreck. Quests? That was supposed to be a comedy? The coulda misled me-ee-ee ...! Now, if the guests were insatiably bad as in the movie "Critters", we could have a human character to do something a little more profound than to be very worried ... like screaming and screaming and running for their lives so they could not be eaten so the story could be the most exciting thing to look at the dry color. <br /> <br /> Don't worry this look. It's not worth the effort. You can find something more interesting to do. If you look at the color is dry. Or fall asleep.
