"Cement" is a bad movie about a bad mistake (Penn) with a bad attitude and bad habits that has a bad person in a bad way to its stones in a quick cement drying. When we are waiting for the concrete to dry and the film will recognize what it is, we go back to time without rhyme or reason so we can look at the events leading up to cement something. The junk spinning spinning in general, "Cement" faces a lack of stories, abnormal implementation, and that many differs from film flaws. there is no reason to care. Time killer for the bed of the best problem. (D +)
