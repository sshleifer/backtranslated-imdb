My first attempt to watch this ended in 8 minutes, almost after the TV report, which I couldn't handle. It went about like this: <br /> <br /> Author 1: Hmm, there is a pyramid in our heavens. Author 2: I think it's a stranger. * Silently * Author 1: In other news ... A few days later I looked at the end, and not as much as I thought, but there are serious problems with this. Almost half of the plot can be left easily. And the other half should be extended to describe the story of history or something. What is the detective, the people of eugenic, and the creatures that are organized for a short time by Horus? More exciting was the monopoly area. "We are all powerful" God ", who have lived for many years, and all the games in the series we can play for monopoly." Monopoly? Monopoly ?! Even Erich von Dainiken looks similar, compared to that. <br /> <br /> The other half is very missing. What did our protagonist do to find himself cryo-frozen? Why was there no great event when he was given in the end? Did he have those powerful followers, remember? What happened to ordinary people? What is about the boy who is hiding? What did the blue girl look like? What with his eyes? Let me go. Look at the same, more or less, if you ignore the God of Egypt to look like walking and rotweiller heads.
