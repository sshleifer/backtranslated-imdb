It is important to be acknowledged by the lack of logic or common sense and those who have "gray issues" will agree that this film does not work. Problems were set for leadership, choice and lack of detail in the character building. Comedy word was a very difficult thing to say when I expect to laugh when these words are being used. Let's look at the problems in the direction / script. All brothers and sisters in the mid-30's seem to be well organized. They meet a perfect visitor in the garden and the character of Heather Graham goes to her and asks the new questions that even a half-man will be driving another way or at least shouting to a police officer. Then he may walk up and give stupid information and fall for him. Then after one day they all came out with him and he loved him and decides to marry in Vegas for a week? Is there anyone who feels stupid? She comes out with thousands of women and meets this one who says about the 10 words we see on the screen and wants to marry her. Not only did he not have chemistry not just meaning. Certainly it is a romantic comedy and I want to believe it may, but the direction made it quite flat. Now Heather has a head on the heels with him and when Heather Graham and Bridget Moynahan (very unknown character) kiss or more to the point was kiss kiss forever that chemistry could be there. I found it inappropriate and unacceptable and many times Heather can't act to think the truth is Heather was clearly a bad person for this role. This was Sue Kramer beginning as a director and to me it was just too much for him to chew. It would take many tricks to do this film work and IMHO can be done by the best writers and give us a leadership.
