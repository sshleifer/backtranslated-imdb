I had gone with the original _Cruel.We are going along with the plot and staying true to my famous characters. However, this film was, in my opinion, a combination of documents resembling the line of the same story and no choice of clear behavior. I didn't care about what happened to any of them. The power of the original story (Les Liasons, not CI) is their partners and partners, not the events themselves. I was not clear until I read the IMDB that this movie meant to be prequel, especially since the title includes the number "2," I expected the good, but then I decided that it must be a piece of friend. Most of all, I must say that this movie will read it, to me at least, as the soft version of the Les Liasons. I was not interested.
