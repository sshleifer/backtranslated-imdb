If the number of Nasties Video has never been reduced, this bunch of trash climbed up my list of "rental" when I saw it was available. The column involves a model of the model or something taken and taken into the jungle that will be made for compensation by the idiots staff. The other finds work to bring him back and has been given a money bag to use as a business chip, though he returns with a girl and all the money, gets a big cut. He has brought a helicopter and experiment with him and, wow, that pilot is one of the worst actors! In fact, they are all horrible and dubbing will make you cry. After stealing into the jungle, we learn that it is almost a cannibal worship which the goddess of the earth loses the wood as King King of human beings wants people of the tribe to destroy and eat. Now, this man is a naked boy and some evil evil ever, ping-pong balls for the eyes and that's pretty much. His spells and laments are a constant feature of sound, and I found myself screaming at those places. Oh, I forgot to miss the normal weaknesses? This is the main reason for this film was banned, although there is one special area, next to the second second, where god visits a girl and draws out, but it is not the reason for liberation for fans of the year. Also, Jess Franco goes beyond the normal T and A and shows the closest of the female organs, and, sadly, the male too. So, if you want "right" because of exploitation, you have found it. <br /> <br /> I can't recommend this waste to anyone. It's not even a bad movie bad. It is just a trash caused by a sensation that is only a fan of Video that is visible and even then, if you make your way through the list, open this to the end. If you look at the first, you can get the idea that this is normal for the list, which certainly isn't true.
