don't expect too much from this film. In many ways this film is similar to a film on which Doris Day began in 1956, the name, Julie. In this film Doris, who was a runaway runner, hostess, those days, gave us the trick of air after her derange husband, played with Louis Jordan and struck the captain. He did the most beautiful, more persuasive, than Kim Ojah, who took control of 747 and managed to put it without great support from the control tower. I know a little about 747 aircraft, I use it to be a flight attendant. As I said, you don't expect too much from this film, it was done on a cheap budget. Manufacturers were cheaper to use the plane and the name of the aircraft on it. Sea is the same name that some movies have used. Just writing on this plane was the name of the company that made the flight.
