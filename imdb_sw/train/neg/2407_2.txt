I watched it today, I am fascinated by all the stars and parts because I have enjoyed many other films. However, this is one to avoid. There is a lot of bad events where promotions are not in between, the challenges of the initial challenge, for example. The incidents of fighting the locals are on good if you remember in the old black and white films of Tarzan, you know where the spear comes out through the air cuts and cameras for dead male children lying on the floor with his foot. Is that a quick death? There are also some unnecessary incidents that are not connected to the plot, such as the little girl saved by collecting flowers. Poor soil facilities have been badly hurt. If you see this crack film which inch at 5kph is at the display. Somehow someone can get into David Mccullum and take him. His time had no time to leave, as when obelisk in the city was falling, the natural nature of the world taking the 2nd step on the left, but nobody shouted and fell. I just give this 2 because of Ekland. And why does Mccullums sound stutter as the movie continues?
