One of the non-contemporary movies of the 1940s, an unprecedented house of music and star Kay Kyser. Kyer, the leader of the orchestra and the radio star (and the ever-ever-growing university group), was a predecessor to Spike Jones, changed his guests and voluntarily supported his team of players. She was hired to play a birthday in a big house, a type of toxic darts imported from Africa tied to the wall. Shindig is faced with an angry judge, a horrible professor, a horrible swami, lots of women, and a bad joke to fill three pictures of Bob Hope. These songs (by Jimmy McHugh and Johnny Mercer) are not something to be proud of, and no more Kyser than bravery, yukking it and spoon-indoor-indoor devices that return to 1940 years back ten years. * from ****
