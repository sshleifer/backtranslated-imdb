Macy, Ullman and Sutherland were better as usual. Ritter was not bad either. His name is as common as usual. It can be a good movie. For evil conspiracy was angry. It was quite predictable, itself and terrible. <br /> <br /> From the first 15 minutes, the remaining movie was installed as children's color through numbers. The characters were pieces of the cut card. There was nothing new or interesting to say and that completely reduced acting, which was compassionate. <br /> <br /> Finally, the bad recipe was not a victim. Especially with the "precocious" line from the child, which was not quite possible. Again, it's just acting that prevented the lowest score.
