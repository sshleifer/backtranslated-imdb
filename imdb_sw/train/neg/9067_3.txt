Although I had some hopes for this film, especially since I love Jason Segel's (Freaks & Geeks, very) act, I must say it was one of the worst films I saw in the recent memory (Loser and Dr T and Women also on the list that). Yes, there was a short time to laugh, although movies would be very good. The cluster was not bad - scandal artists cheat their way through college to reach their matches when they discover with someone who has a suggestion to them. The problem is that all the characters were not seen, that I didn't care about any of them. The player's player (played with talented Jason Schwartzman) was the same psychopath that's not to look at him - he was not shocked in a surprising or interesting way, he was just a lost man, who was really dangerous and not happy to enjoy. The editing of the film was difficult to follow - it continued to cut between fantasy and reality and often was not clear what it was. Just two or three of the gang scams were actually shown, you just had to take the belief that they were actually scandal artists - to show their plans would have made the film better. The known story of love was extraordinary and unusual, in fact it was written wrong and unsupported and directed. I would like to continue with the shortcomings of the film, but you get the idea. It's not worth renting $ 4 or gas takes to run and from the movie store to rent!
