It is probably my only DVD - but I can't recommend that anyone tries to look at this picture on DVD. I had to turn the volume on my TV to the highest level, in order to hear 80 percent of the conversation. Some talking still remained under hearing. If you are from Scotland, you may have a chance, although it is small. <br /> <br /> People's voices are switched off with almost all sounds, including deleting the package, legs, even smoking. To the extent that it turns up to the extent that sounds can be heard, I can prove that at least one of your neighbors will call the police when the area has changed enormous circumstances, such as disco. And that you will hurt to dive into the village to bring it back. <br /> <br /> There is art and there is art, even in the field of mixing sounds. But this effort, during the war, could achieve international standards that are considered angry. After half an hour, I left, without seeing anything else that had redeemed it in the picture, either.
