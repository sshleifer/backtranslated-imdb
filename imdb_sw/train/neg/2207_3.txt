Hammerhead is a mix between a mad scientist and a variety of movie shark killers. In the slightest beat, Jeffrey Combs has a mad scientist described earlier who develops a human shark / hammerhead. Hardly, this is really his son, who has turned into this monster to prevent him from dying from cancer. Or something. The group of partners are invited to the island of privacy. They end up being used as shark bait or shark mate. For an unknown reason, the head of IT has been brought as part of this team. Who knows why? Luckily, he returns to be wise, as much more, the hero of Ramboesque. I work on the concept that he learned how to handle the gun as part of his work in the first line of the line. A typical day for this person of IT involves adjusting the connectivity of someone's network followed by calling the gun down the gun-defeating the perpetrators. Or maybe the phone to fix someone's PC should be done between the physical and hybrids of humanitarian-shark? However, he is wonderful and saves the day. Even finds a girl. The shark man is a sour animal but it is okay, I think, judging and harming the overall effects in this film. And the movie continues to good speed. It is full of hokum of course but if you buy a film called Hammerhead and expect to be a hard drum on emotional conflicts that this person has turned into a fish to kill, then you actually have no one to blame but yourself. Like, there are guns, gore, girls and maybe even explosive helicopters. It's garbage but it's not as bad as others can say.
