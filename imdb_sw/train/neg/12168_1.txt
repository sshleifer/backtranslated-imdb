This movie was bad since the beginning. The only purpose of the cinema was that Angela wanted to get the calculation of the body. Acting was terrible. The murder was done very much. As Ally stuck under the toilet I think it was in the left cabin. But at the end of the movie comes with Molly and another person is in the cabin you see Ally so Angela must have gone to find him. The place I had was was when the black girl and Angela were in the cabin and Angela took the guitar string and chose her. One was awesome to act with two why you just don't turn to a bitch punch?!?! Then when Molly gets chased by Angela if you have a neighbor why not just turn and beat him? So it's stupid. This film was followed ...
