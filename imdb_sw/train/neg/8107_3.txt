This film is completely boring. There is a snippets of the naked body being beaten around in an attempt to keep an eye viewer but not succeeded. The best thing about the movie is Lena Olin - she does a good job of caring for the character, but the Day-Lewis buttons over her lines. Kaufman obviously had no idea how to make this film. Barriers to attack between domestic issues / domestic marriages and political disputes are the same. Character behavior changes without definition. It's wrong.
