This movie was very bad for the existence of Steven Seagal. Or if I should say Steven So-light! If before Seagal is too good or too foolish to write again his own lines, leaving someone to imitate his voice for shots where sound is needed to be beaten. A few films before this had done so, but I don't think to this rate! In order to be honest film looks very good, the script can use a certain function but the parts of this film looks like a real movie! Of course, all told, this film is very bad. <br /> <br /> It would be better without Seagal who has become a cartoon of himself. Don't bother. Anything on the buck for this is so great! I really think this is the end time for me and the Seagal film. What is taking me long to realize this?
