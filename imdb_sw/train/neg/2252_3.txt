So I had heard from a few people that this film brought tears to the theater. When I was looking for the first time I was looking for another beautiful Barbra Streisand film of love; Something like We Were. In fact I was wrong. Chemistry among the two main characters, Esther Hoffman and John Howard, was not there, and so it was impossible to connect with the characters. There was nothing romantic about it. Streisand's behavior fell on a drug smoker who could not write one mark without making me hit the fast button. At one time her character finds her husband sleeping with another woman and forgives her about five minutes later. There is nothing romantic about the rock of death and the woman who cannot be seen until she dies. The parts of the movie seemed to continue, and I kept asking myself when you were finished. John Howard's death was predicting. There was a very clear example of his unstable behavior in the movie, and when he died I felt no feeling. It was not a terrible accident, it was basically a boy. Never mention in all the film I was concerned with his beard. Only parts of this movie are suitable for Streisand songs. End of the film when he sings "For One More Watching You / Watching Now Now" was my reason for giving this 3/10 film. These 7 minutes were the only part of the film that I felt other emotions except anger and anger.
