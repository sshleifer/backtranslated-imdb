I didn't like this film for many reasons. Within the first ten minutes of the film, I became very disappointed and I have concluded that if this movie would save itself the salon itself, for me at least, it would have to be out of the big hole that had been. Unfortunately, that didn't happen. Two pieces of the movie for me were seeing Jane Fonda and Felicity Huffman. I don't know enough about Lindsey Lohan's work to be interested in what she would bring to the film. Later, I felt desperate and for all three even though there was a "time" in each of their exhibitions. I think that each of them will get "time" they were very hard work due to the fact that there was a surprising lack of development of character and the real estate. Although the plot is one of the most interesting, the entire film is well written, directed and edited to be the performance of anyone as an actor could suffer and have dirt. The irreversible way that was done by sexual harassment and insulting insults and insults in the small town of America, I think, is the two main reasons that this film has failed to score. If one auditor has identified and would like to agree, the film is not possible for the market due to the finished form. I testify that, or at least hope that (for the actor doing that) there are some real gems on the floor of the cutting room. Unfortunately for us but if it really is then administrators can take comfort in it and feel good about their credit talents and during such flop. And something else ... I liked once I could go to the American movie that included a sad but strange atmosphere like this film where the main characters were not far from / or without ignoring the country with pop cans, CDs and, as well as garbage!
