In a Woman with a Powerful Mabel goes spiritually, but I can see why she is going to heaven. If I lived the kind of life he lived with the family that I would go with also things. Everyone in his family has left their rock and not at all. He is always surrounded by people begging him and telling him what is best for himself and people who are not strong in the drawer. Start with one person next to him in his life, her husband, Nick, is the youngest. He always asks her at her home to tell her how to live her life and stop acting like she is. Sometimes she works for a long time in her work and is not there to help her when she needs help. One person in his life that must be there for him never exists and if it is, he just does more feel. He relies on him for help and always goes to him first when he feels he is doing wrong and does nothing to help him. When he comes home from all the hospital he is doing is tell him how to act, instead of comforting him, he just asks and tells him what to do. Some great people in his life are his parents. His parents have nothing in his life for him. Mabel basically runs their lives because they are afraid to stand up and stand up. At last he even asks his father to stand up and does not know, and when he gets he does anything. They have nothing to help Mabel restore or prevent him from going because they have nothing for his time. The only person who tries to do something for him is Nick's mother. Nick's mother refuses to have Mabel done. They don't want Nick to do so and he has a doctor he has done. It seems that everyone is against Mabel and they feel that after his dedication it is a good idea because then they won't have to deal with it anymore. They all want to live their own lives and do something for Mabel unless they ask him and make him feel like he does something wrong when he is not really. That is why he went to madness, and why he had to make a sacrifice, it was all the fault of his family.
