The movie deserves 2/10. 1.5 stars for a girl, (Sorry I am happy, I think a pretty girl is just showing the cinema), and 0.5 for the fact that it is shorter than Azumi 1. I watched Azumi 1 and 2 in 1 sitting. I was surprised myself to be able to stay that way. <br /> <br /> Allow to talk about more movie features. Girl. Going Aya is good. That's all there is a whole salvage movie. The fact is, if the main character was male, I am sure that most people (including me) could not touch the movie altogether. <br /> <br /> Now sells talk on small points. First, it is a real Draggy, with lots and lots of regular votes. Nachi and Azumi displays continue to return. It looks more like a drama of a shot. Traditional Japanese blood likes to photograph, and this movie too. Second, the movie is non-realistic in the historical setting. I don't know inappropriate movies. But this film is like a bad way to show creativity, by throwing ninjas that make like bears and spiders webs, etc ... reminds me of Shinobi, though Shinobi is a movie that has a fantasy setting. Additionally, showing the "i-not-know" effect, the film director people dying and spraying (literally) round ... people who do not know their head were cut ... etc ... etc ... of these trophies show. It seems like the influence of anime has power in this film. It destroys the show too much. Third, not Azumi thinks to be a murderer. She looks more like a single person to me, just that she is a woman. I don't think you see murderers who are in the camps. The only time I saw that he did "the pastor" when he was killed Kiyomasa Kato at the end of Azumi 1. Finally, the plot was thin in both movies. It is a plot of a non-progressive line and surprise in any way.
