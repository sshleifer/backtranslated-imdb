Neither bad nor animals or Eddie Murphy had nothing to say. This movie is just bland. <br /> <br /> Children's movie? Well, if you're trying to send them, then maybe. It is only 90 minutes of animation of the eye of an animal for animals that are not funny. And the mouth-sync'ing makes the old Godzilla movies look carefully in comparison. At the same time, Eddie "Pluto Nash" Murphy drones up with the abolition of low delivery which is painful for experience. It seems, he tries to fix his old manic, but why? In short, all the magic and wonder of the original version of 1967 disappears in rethinking, or nothing. The city wants to disrupt other forest creatures and blame them for doing bad things. No, indeed. And Pluto Nash can be psychologically. Material items and stale jokes in an ineffective conclusion without surprise. <br /> <br /> Use the '67 movie. Or some ancient cartoons of Yogi Bear.
