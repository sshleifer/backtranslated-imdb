After enjoying the work of Mike Myers's original (Waynes World and Saturday Night Live) my expectations of 60 securities securities were very high. It was clear after the first minute that this was a practice of how to be as puerile and unfunny as possible. I am changing after ten minutes. I watched the other day the second time to see if I was right the first time. I ended it after ten minutes. I find it hard to believe how even a twelve-year-old boy could get this funny. The talk is heaven, Myers is a painful look (like Heather Graham) and a series of characters including Fat Bastard makes things worse. In addition to the pleasant and gentle head of the design of this psychedelic is one of the worst films I have ever seen. I recommend myself avoiding this as a blow, although many of my friends enjoyed it (perhaps they had been blinded at that time).
