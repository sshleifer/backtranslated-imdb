End of horrible - and I can't believe Moore spent a year coming up with it. The chaos of L. Ron Hubbard and Dianetitcs, which Hubbard claimed to write for just three weeks. This was really terrible enough for me to cancel my disks from the first 3.5 years. Now, the first 1.5 hours were full of action, although it is strange in the premise, and then it was damaged in a slow, painful, and sophomoric solution of the series. It does not believe that slowly and release that last hour was. Were we thinking more deeply? If I wanted a lesson in physical wealth, I would like to read Ishmael's Daniel Quinn. Of course you think 38K people will leave everything to "start new". The joy of casting of lost Kara, and Baltar and Sixth. Awesome throw Eve in Mitochondrial. It's very strange.
