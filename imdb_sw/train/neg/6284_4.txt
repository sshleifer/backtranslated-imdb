I liked the original Cluster for this film which has helped me to hunt but the problem I soon found was that a very good person knows what will happen within the first 20-30 minutes (twice will come back to the mirror and take everyone). <br /> <br /> No real loss (which is good), but the last of the reveal does not make much of the mind either (how is he being racked and sure to scare for the whole film, if it's a bad id from out of the mirror?) What is the most 'mirror' of the mirror when they first appeared and the blonde killings are also very effective, but ultimately this looks to be a movie looking for a story or script, insert the atmosphere on the sky and on the design of a terrible voice for 80-90 minutes does not wipe, actually reduces it completely.
