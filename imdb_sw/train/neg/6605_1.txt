Designed only by distracting (or convincing) anyone who respects the intelligent person. If the director's intention was to view the character of the title, then it would be the same, but I know that there is nothing like a Hollywood director who could give an experimental pro-Marxist move to the United States 60, especially not a film manufacturer from 70 years. There are a lot of idiotic discussions happening here, which sometimes I wondered if I wasn't looking at the comedy. You can't be guilty of thinking that this is satire? yes how the movie is shown. Spacek has been on its part of the Leftist films that bring me to a clear, unmistakable conclusion that hick redhead is one of the Hollywood's hottest hats. But, I mean, not all? Good boobs, but s ** t for intelligence.
