The only thing that you grow most often in my head when I write this review is, I will never get an hour and a half back !!! show that I'm not just blowing air, I'm going to compare movies on other triube movies of cube (cube and hypercube)! The cube was not great but it was original and which made technical errors! The hypercube as the goodwill lost the natural advantage but came to look very bright and even I liked to be beter than the cube (the story was better)! but a zero cube in comparison with true predecessors worth no sh * t! The complete lack of good fx, f * script c * d very and very serious acting can not mix well! Example: all the time during the film I was thinking it was too stupid if ... should happen and then it would happen, so it's not very natural! my advice: don't waste it and half I lost !!!!!!!! oh and i hope this film attack and burn !!!!!!!
