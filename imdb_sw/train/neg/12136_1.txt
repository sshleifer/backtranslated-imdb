I saw this movie t.v. this afternoon and I can't see how anyone can sit through this piece of rubbish. It's not quite funny and takes I.Q. your. less a few notches. I know this film is for children, but that doesn't mean writers should take their minds for space. I beta that the authors were sitting next to a big wooden table and thinking that a) The word "poop" corresponds to a great laughter. b) Baby foot four foot can dunk on the foot of the foot of the foot of the foot. c) Children should fight with weapons providers because young people will fall for anything and d) 3 months of karate training are all you need to beat what is called "ninjas" for swords. One good thing I can say about this film has the "gang" of the most powerful cities in the world that could not scare anyone. Perhaps the boys on MST3K can use this film to laugh good. Do not bother with this kind of breeze for the movie.
