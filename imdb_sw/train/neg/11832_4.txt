From Shrek Designers? .. Well, that's taken my mind. The creators of Shrek also made Madagascar. Madagascar was a good half as Shrek. And now Flushed Away is a good half as Madagascar. That means Flushed Away is not good. All animations and effects were very good but the movies were not. <br /> <br /> The story of this movie meant only children. It was not possible for adults to really love this flick. But there was a lot of jokes that are meant for adults. I bet children understands jokes. <br /> <br /> Although I go like this flick. I was completely broken. 4/10
