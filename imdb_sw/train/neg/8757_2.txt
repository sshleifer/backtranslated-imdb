Typically a film that is leading the trend in the UK's known music, is wrong on many of the boundaries that are concerned. Tommy fast? Honeycombs? The movie includes a song by Spencer Davis, two and Animals, and one on the film's life of Beatles making their live version of Twist and Shout (all 1:20). But all in all, the infinite display of British music in 1964. Oh, and Hermits Hermits.
