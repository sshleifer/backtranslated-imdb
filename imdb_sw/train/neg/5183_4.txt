This is the first of these "8 deaths" for which I have seen and certainly did not make me see any break ... although I have heard at least some of them are decent. I don't know, this was not terrible but it didn't do much for me. Your family's most unfriendly disease in the village series, mother and father died, the family sold the farm and moved to San Francisco (?) Where they continued to bring home lost sources at any time possible. The best part of this was a beautiful Goth sister, who undoubtedly invites a friend from a school that never gives. However, of course we have a butcher shop in the floor and so on and so on. This family is kind of a white-bread version of Sawyer Clan, they are bad and they do bad things but do not go to any soul. I see a lot of views from people who liked this, and I think I don't know what I missed, but I have found it very worried and I won't recommend it to anyone, in fact. 4 out of 10.
