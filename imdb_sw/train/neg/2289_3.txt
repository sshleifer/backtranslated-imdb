Sadly, Harry Harron decided to make a false account of Bettie's life to go with his own issues with men. As always in all his work, every male's main character is shown as weak, smoked, or misleading. In order to add his lies, he creates ideas and unrealities, according to Bettie Page himself. Bettie did not leave biz because she thought it was bad or morally or had religious issues (though she was born again in life, through the influence of her third husband - minister). He left, because he was 30 years old, his work was from anywhere and he felt he was losing his appearance. The terms of abuse and rape are unacceptable and rejected Bettie's words and are a pilot's claim that any woman who did what Bettie did should be affected by human beings. Harron cannot say that Bettie made his own clothes near all his trunk (not given by "fetishists"). Harron also does not know that Bunny Yeager, who made many stems of pictures of Bettie, also made many "naughty" stems and Bettie and was not a professional ethical pastor shown in the film. The only grace to save is Gretchen Mol very much like Bettie. Otherwise, there are other movies and more accurate documentation and loyalty to his life and people in it.
