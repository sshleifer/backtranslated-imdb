I can't believe that it's the worst movie I have seen in my life. I laughed several times. (probably because of ignorance) If someone gives me to see the movie again I would like. The plot was so bad, he didn't know it, and acting was so bad I couldn't even say if they were trying. The movie was a bad mark: F
