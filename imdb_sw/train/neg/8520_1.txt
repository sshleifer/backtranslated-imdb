I found that "Hamish Macbeth" was being adopted in the United States, I was very happy. So I was unfortunate to look at anything. I worship the books of M. C. Beaton about the Scottish Wonderful Surprise. The characters in the book are entertaining and well written. The energy that is responsible for mish-mash has never read one of the Beaton books. The only name "Hamish Macbeth" has nothing to do with the series. In addition to the lack of skilled characters, I see all of the sad sounds. It seems that executives feel they should shout their lines and shout for each other. If you love Hamish Macbeth of M. C. Beaton's player does not waste your time on this waste.
