I am using my way through the 50-year Chilling Collection Center and WITCHES (El Monte de las brujas) is something like a 17th film in the set. <br /> <br /> The movie had nothing to hold my thoughts at all. The plan was not connected. The discussion seemed to be made. Acting was bad. The characters were not worried. The best view is the beginning, and the angry woman who is sent to burn her seemingly brutal daughter. However, the only connectivity to this area is with the remaining film, it is a leading character, Mario, who has an eternal forever mustache. But, that's it. <br /> <br /> The movie is not recommended for any level. The music was also very strong. Lighting was very dark, so that some of the closest scenes almost completely black. It is really hard to see - what more can I say?
