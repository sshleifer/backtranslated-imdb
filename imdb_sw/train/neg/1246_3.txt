Spoilers I think. <br /> <br /> The most amazing final text destroys the entire movie. I can only get on it. And what is wrong with Mark Wahlberg's behavior? If I suddenly found myself falling on a windbound planet, I would all be, "AAAAhhhHH !!! Run for your life! But he is all like, "talking monkeys, right." That's a good jaded I'd like to say. He should run into foreign items regularly. Besides, this is the best work of Rick Baker yet. This film is a true covenant for how we have come to the monkey's flower field. 3/10.
