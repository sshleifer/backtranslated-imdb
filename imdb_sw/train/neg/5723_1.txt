Anyone who has said it is better than Hostel speaks perfect, I believe I'm not a fan of Hostel but this is just ridiculous. This is just a shot on the camcorder, directly on the DVD, under the thought of losing your time, I can't believe how many of these films exist and I still see one of the respect. In the 80 video video, movies and movie fears were made without budget but a good story and the burden of new ideas and more important heart and spirit of the director has something to say. Now they seem to be stuck out in an attempt to deceive people looking for Blockbuster to rent a copy, until people do not stop doing so I think these films will continue to appear. This film is very low in thought is just amazing how it has ever been done, acting is also awesome, the place is not quite realistic and the sound of the voice is so angry asking to ask for faith. This temporary damage has nothing to do with them, unless you are in an effort to compile a list of the worst movies. My best / worst part is when a female character shows a gun to a person and threatens to throw it away if they do not return it, you can see that it even covers a fingerprint with his finger to hold. Good joke.
