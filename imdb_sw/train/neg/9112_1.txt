Basically, the Cruel Intentions 2 is the Cruel Intentions 1, again, just done wrong. Stories are the same as the first (even some lines), and just a few exceptions. Cast unknown more, and definitely under the talent. Instead of cheating me and looking at me, I ended up hearing it dirty because it looks like a small picture. I don't know whether it is blameing some of the idiotic lines for participants or authors ... and I always feel to say that, because I know it's hard to do all ... but it was basically two- hours of losing my life. It is really amazing that movies are being made, and this is not different ... I don't believe they could make one third.
