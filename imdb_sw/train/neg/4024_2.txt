This movie is just awesome. Poor John Savage had to drop down this to be in another movie. He becomes a star as a kind of vampire which is not available which is to help a woman who looks like he has washed and thrown on the street that is a dancer on a local line club. He acid likes a drop of blood from another player who happens to be one of those few vampires as they are being removed from the floor of the room. Savage is then given by a short leader of this rare vampire breed that looks like a cross between 80 rock punk and one of Olsen twins and purple hair. This movie makes them both mad and dive Savage and play with midget and tattoo spiders on his head, also one of the rare. He pushes the Man of Elephant and Jimmy Durante and I just had to laugh. This gets only rediculas. And then the more specific effects that can come up with is Corri to throw its organs and pull out of his mouth. And you can tell that it's all fake. His son does not know what to do with his new moms identity and becomes more pest than the object of stability. I enjoy a beautiful vampire film, I believe I do but I have lost this one. Even photography reduces, inside and outside it has a camera that takes this way and that it tries to make it look like a vampires moving quickly to the camera to proceed and then the camera returns all sharply in the Savage area to chase Corri's son until he hides. Avoid this!
