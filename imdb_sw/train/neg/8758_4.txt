Not a movie, but a collection of oral presentations from acts that were part of the British invasion, which followed the powerful door of Beatles in the world of music. Some of these actions did not make a big blow on this side of the pool, but many of them did. Events are: Hermits of Herman, Billy J. Kramer and Dakotas, Peter and Gordon, Honeycombs, Youth Nashville, Animals, and of course, Beatles. It is a great pleasure to see these young people before they respect them and make them their actions.
