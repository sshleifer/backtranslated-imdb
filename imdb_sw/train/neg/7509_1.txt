"Why?" This simple question was on every New Yorker lips during the 12 months of fear that David Berkowitz was created in 1976-77. The same word will be the same question of surprise 22 when people come out of the "Summer Sam" exhibition. Director Spike Lee tries to create a story of the conversion packet of physiotherapist search for the celebration - who decked New York City for more than a year - exposing the exhibition and killings, demons within the head of Berkowitz and the confusion of manhunt's free NYPD. He presents the contemptible partners who hear themselves "dog-hunting" when they are living without love, respect and humanity - no difference with Berkowitz. Lee persuades the audience almost every chapter and "none of us is what we seem to be". Often the suspect of white coloring, Lee promotes discrimination by involving the area where Mira Sorvino, playing sandy sand (John Leguizamo), hopes to have oral sex with a black man "behind Cadillac's big black". The Italian Mafioso explains a black detective that the famous Willie Mays' back-back track was "lucky". Lee even makes sure to give them a racial racist woman's black race who says "I'm happy is a white man who killed all these white people because if it's a black man who killed all these white people - there will be a bigger race in The history of NYC. "Other than open shooting shores arrive at the disco (recall to shots from" Goodfellas "of Martin Scorcese or Orson Welles'" The Third Man "), this film has no soul, purpose or desire. He plays characters on a screen based on human merit. Although we do not know anything about the real victims of this horrible spree, Spike Lee seems to say New York City got what it deserved during the fearful season, boiling over the past two decades. "How can anyone destroy such havoc on his beloved city?" "How can a man show such hatred to his fellow?" <br /> <br /> What! Are these good questions for Berkowitz or Lee? You decide.
