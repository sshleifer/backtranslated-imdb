One of my best friends brought this film overnight and the words 'You want to watch the worst movie of any time?' I often enjoy good laughter in the flick bad and say yes. I expected your b-slasher size but this was more than B. This is a Z-slasher, down below. To open the low budget, the worst act, the bad electrical, no plot, the worst so-called 'special effects', shaky cameras and awesome sounds that make movies like the House of Wax looks like works to win Oscar. The only thing about it is 15 seconds of one of the characters to get nonsense - had very good tits. More than what I said during this film was along the lines of 'Wow this is really SO BAD', 'This is the worst movie' and 'I'm not enough drunk for this'. So in conclusion: don't waste your time (or money!).
