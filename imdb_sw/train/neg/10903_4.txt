Rob Schneider is the most popular reason for its movement, exhibition and exhibition "not human". This time he is a Beast. Marvin is a winner who tries to be a hero and one day, no one calls someone from an assault, so Marvin takes this case to save the injured person. But by his way to the crime scene, he blows with his car and gets really destroyed. He remembers what happens and in the second day of the day, his life was not the same when he saw that he had an animal nature. Of course, we got our female that our main character tries to reach but his experiments are not enough. He is played by Collen Haskell. No negative characters. Bad behavior, it is a fate if I could use this example. Marvin should know, how to be a normal person again. In its natural way, it helps him in certain situations. Schneider's performance is so-so. The movie is so unreal that gets stupid at some point but it's one of those movies, called fun no matter if I have written above. So look at monkey Rob Schneider's style but it is definitely not one of the best scholars or one of the best movies that Schneider looks inside. He is a great player but this is not his best movie.
