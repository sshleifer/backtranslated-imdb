No damage to the movie as well as a combination of poor script and poor patterns. This is the case with "Tomb of the mummy". Trends are trite and stale. Acting is mediocre. Even Kharis Chaney is weak compared to Tom Tyler in the "Hand of Mummy," and manufacturers are stupid enough to add pictures from the best prequel of Christy Cabanne and describe the weaknesses of their film! Universal realized how this movie was bad, and essentially it fell from the beginning two years later as "The Mummy's Ghost" and the best script and best director. The result was the best film in their "Mummy" film, although not anywhere near Karl Freund's 1932. The footage of Cabanne brings this film to 3. The "new" items are 2 better. Dick Foran and Wallace Ford were probably excited to see their characters striking so far that they would not look like this again!
