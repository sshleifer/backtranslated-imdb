Cornel Wilde and three dumbbells seek a sunken treasure in the southern Atlantic. <br /> <br /> Treasure hunters moved by Wilde to fight a group of popes with sneers cute on their starving faces. Wilde and her men are happy they should find a way to get out of the list so they can start digging the old Spanish galleon filled with gold bullion. When employees enter into the minimal sub-pumping, blowing, saying, and listening to Wilde's health tips with bitterness, 5 crazy prisoners climb the boat with difficult things. Now it is a war of wits as to who gets the treasure and who gets to see inside the abdomen of a shark looks like. Look at Wilde is in the shape of a particular dress with one thing that 'wearing' Prey Naked '10 years earlier and has remained in good condition. <br /> <br /> Made a budget of 75 cents.
