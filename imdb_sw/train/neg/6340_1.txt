This is the kind of movie I'm more afraid of. The arrogant and innocuous, gives a diagram of the colonial crisis so that the simplicity and indication represents all the people of Colombia. The exhibition is a polarization, from Grisales (its nude area is very sad), to Bejarano, to Fanny Mickey (who looks similar to Tim Burton's desire), to Díaz, who makes an effort to bring life to a single-dictated life , so cliched and very bad written all he left to work with is a mustache. Not to mention the end of bureous, fest gore so cheesy that would make Ed Wood cringe. It fails in all ways, movies, artistic leadership, clothing, decision making, editing, and more of all leading, Jorge Alí Triana has always been a famous filmmaker but at least his original films were polite. I can't say anything about this damage to money, except that I hope the Colombia film will learn a lesson about honesty, honesty and reliability from this expected experimental fiasco.
