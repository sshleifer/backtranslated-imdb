This is not the best news of Epic Tarzan. There was only one reason for this film. John Derek wanted to show his beautiful wife in the buff! Bo Derek in '10' was at least a movie of humor and there was a reason for magic and sex. This movie is not more than a smooth soft. If you are in it, well, then proceed quickly and beat others! This movie (like Bolero) was no longer a drive to Bo Derek to show his bad state. Certainly of course is a beautiful woman but her poster is more exciting than this movie! Richard Harris was an excellent actor; this was one of his few mistakes! don't waste your time on this film ... go buy book instead.
