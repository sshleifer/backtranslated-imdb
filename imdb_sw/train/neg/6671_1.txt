I felt that this film started well. Acting was a spot and I felt the nature of all actors, although the true family was not completely revealed. We did not have enough information for the father to really hear his pain for all his involvement or build for his hatred with Tobe. I mean in one place you see him praising it for density and in another area that almost takes his head. Another problem with the movie had been disclosed and lost all direction at the end, and I was begging to have it. Any movie that is too long, and the end of the pot should never get a single 7 or higher mark for acting. We look beyond the quality of film experience. In the case of this last film is bad I seriously interested in walking out of the theater. This film took me in and then just hit me.
