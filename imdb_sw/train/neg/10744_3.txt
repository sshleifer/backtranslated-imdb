In the first was a large mouse, but there were tomatoes and big chicken too. This, however, is just a great mouse of a mouse, a very good mouse and one growing little boy. This is about this young man who has grown up with a scientist who tries to help him so accidentally makes a big killer rat ... you know how it is. This film has some killings and its time, but I see it is similar to nature, I just enjoy different types in my live movies. That's not true ... I really like "The Ants Empire", maybe I don't care a big mouse. All in all the gold films instead of having the most common changes of events in this series of dreams are very strange. I can only recommend this.
