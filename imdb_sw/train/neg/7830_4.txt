So far dreams and Dreamscapes have been caused by despair. The first part, directed by Brian Henson, may not have been given a little in the way of telling the story or the wonders of the truth, but at least it was well-guided, emphasized, and appealed to, and performed by William Hurt and the special effects of the spectacular series mini. However, the second story in the series was terrible, and not a good way. Screenplay is bad, requiring intellectual characters, who are not able to act physically to promote conspiracy, and to have a decline in a permanent decline for unnecessary exhibitions. Acting has gone too far and is not good, and I felt more feeling for the cold-blooded killer in the first story than for the young couple in the second. The director used a million technique trying to try a spoon of stories, but for acting and writing acting, the final results looked like a movie film film's freshman film, and the camera action for themselves, and a bit in a conspiracy or tension. <br /> <br /> If a series of series goes on like this, I will stop. I look forward to William H. Macy, and hope he gets a good director and a film writer for his part. Until now the quality is not acceptable to predict any way.
