I had sooooo excited to see this film after reading this book this week. My 13-year-old son was expecting too. I hired and played down to enjoy the traditional holiday story brought to the screen. The boy, I was desperate. This film left the book more than it is forgiven. George C. Scott is an excellent actor but in this, it seemed that he was fully in character only about 20 percent of time. Sometimes he was completely flat. I know that this was done in '84, pre-CG effects, for the most part. But it seems to have the quality of B film, especially to meet Jacob Marley. The biggest desire was the fact that they left one of the most moving parts of the story: When the Christmas Day of Christmas takes Scrooge on a hurricane tour of the world, watching people in the worst situation still have light and Christmas love . <br /> <br /> I will admit that Mr. Scott did a good job with the "transformed" Scrooge end. That was a happy picture. I would like that Bob Cratchit is shown to be the youngest and hit down. And Tiny Tim ... oh even I start with the worst actors of children ...
