The only value in this film is to laugh at how it really is. and the conspiracy that makes your average middle-school correspondent good, and do something that is close, gets my score. one of the early star advertising where he was not pleased to be a real picky. The best effect of the movie has a man wearing a monster of a fantastic fake ball.
