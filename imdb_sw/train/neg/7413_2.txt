To finish watching, he can't say I was attracted to. It starts well, performances and atmosphere provides a welcome welcome as this type of film should be. But all ends when the first monster of the lord appears. It's not just informing them from the port of Truck, but they are malplaced in the movie. The robbers of Doomsday and leather jackets and stripes are 80. But there is no clear story about what is happening. The viewer is thrown on some lines for possible reasons, but the lines are not available and ending nothing except aggression. For all the money spent on this film, with an exciting start with other effects, I thought someone could take care of the best products. I wonder if Lori made this film to prove that their showcase clothes can be awesome (unless they have). So the movie gets praise for the image, I think the money had to go somewhere. But others are an embarrassing attempt from the rock band to make their scander on the top step.
