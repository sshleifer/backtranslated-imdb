What this movie makes well combines action with fear and comedy with a unique game in a unique way that attracts more visual impressions than the usual horror movie. Unfortunately with the story of the closure, exciting hollow, and the opposite events of this movie has been caused by confusion and not "the largest movie of the monster ever." Let's start with good things: comedy, act with special effects. From go-go, this film begins fast and cheeky. Part of the opening - the nature of the monster - is a campy and fast, respecting the season's 'environment' disaster that bears many other monsters. Adoption is fast, which was a welcome break from a long and regular time without opening the opening area from other monster flicks and allows the movie to fly directly into action. For 10 minutes you get 'why', 'where,' and 'how' of the animal and are ready for action. In this film is opening. <br /> <br /> After another short and beautiful series shooting characters are brought: a lazy son and his beautiful girl's pride, good grandfather, and an experienced sister (aunt) and, of course, monster. The characters are brought into the context for each other and their conflicts are obviously obvious, allowing the audience to feel them when the monster shows sudden damage in the river area where they live and work. Monster is a personal one that seems to be good: the visitor still knows - kinda like a dog and fish is being thrown out by squid. The effect of the creature is second to none and although it looks amazing it is reliable and no time in the movie you can 'see it attached. Even the monster movement was so bad, as the rottweiler increased and excited about the linoleum barrels of monster through the crowd, moving on surfaces, crushing and eating those in its path. While the way the monster faces family and the tragedy is still true during the bitterness, and you may feel the need to take revenge but from there outside the appeal of the movie begins to open. Following the beginning of the dynamite movie loses the goal and continues. Platform plans are brought, then abandoned, the characters change their position for no apparent reason, and the comedy interrogates in major conflicting mindset events, while visible obstacles and disappear as it appears to randomly. For comedy, I would like to say this: I have agreed that a lot of humor is probably culture. I don't know the Korean humor so that things might be lost in translating. However, as a great Asian study in college and as a man who lived in Japan for the last 5 years (still here) I would like to think I am more aware of the humor of Asia than ordinary whites. That being said there were many parts of the film that I understood were supposed to be funny, but, to me, they didn't. <br /> <br /> *********** SPOILER ************* For example: after an initial attack where a little girl lost family is at a disaster; everyone is mourning. The new character is brought - brothers - and tension is raised even more if it becomes apparent that the two brothers are not able to cross. They both begin to mourn for their loss and send to compete with each other about who is grieving. This competition is, on the basis, funny: two brothers who do not like each other even even compete in funerals - shows a pleasant state of family love in the comedy of Asia. Comedy craft-slap-stick shouting for family and physical mourning must be funny but, it seems really out of place in the environment of a little lost girl. ************** WITNESS ENDA ************** <br /> Then come to the holes of the plot. there are many points that bring to this film that has not been described, or, worse, are described and only confused to be proved weak and useless at the end. Obtaining an obstacle is not an obstacle to good behavior, but you expect a certain view of the nature. Instead viewers are restricted when fighting the peak when problems 'don't exist' anymore and no one gives signs that it was a problem to start. So I ask them: why not even bring to the first place? This was widespread through the film as the problems arose with new problems, and suddenly the movie world was filled with anti-resistance forces that were never solved. Of course, starting new and serious problems is a tried-tested story, but if the introduction of a new arc leads to someone else's exposure you might expect at least that the new arc gets full details. It's not in this film. Instead it was as if you had several stories, each described 20 percent of the way and, finally, the parts were not available to complete all of them. Again, I have admitted that a lot of this could be 'cultural.' Maybe her in the traditional Korean story of putting comedy into a catastrophe. Maybe it's a common story to go everywhere like a child who paint out the lines on each page, but never finish one. Perhaps it is okay to present a problem to develop a plot but then remove the problem randomly without any obvious or catharsis solution. Or maybe these are all the negative features of the wrong work and the bad dialogue spreads in a film that seems to have a better reputation than what was needed.
