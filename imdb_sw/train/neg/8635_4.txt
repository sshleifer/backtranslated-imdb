Surely this is not one of the best of Lucio Fulci to lose with any width of thought. The plan is very bad, the victim is killed and his spirit asks his daughter to know who has done it. But the biggest problem I have (rather than knowing who killed him in 10 minutes of watching the movie) was wondering why anyone should even care? The father comes as a great jerk for everyone who has found it (including the daughter he asks for help) which makes it difficult for anyone to take care of the killer. But no one looks at Flick Flick for a good storyline, doing so will be like watching porn for writing a wonderful script and acting. Usually its films are trying to compensate for this by adding many scenes of the year but even that does not exist in this film. If you are looking for a good ferry flick, see The Beyond.
