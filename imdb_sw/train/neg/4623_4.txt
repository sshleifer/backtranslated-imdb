If you haven't seen the gong TV series then you don't like this film completely, not knowing that this series makes this a great film. <br /> <br /> I offer 5 out of 10 because a few things make it so amusing which support makes its problems clear. It is a funny snapshot of the time that took place, at the end of the 1970s and early 1980s. 3) It is interesting to see Chuck (host) while not doing on the television personality. 4) You see many amazing people doing all kinds of weaknesses as you see on TV show. <br /> <br /> I'm not a list of bad things because there are many of them, but here are a few of the most popular people. <br /> 1) The Gong Movie Show is a lot of video videos that get tired of the film's length. 2) The story of the film is approaching the parts of the piece of the picture is very weak and basically done by one stage of the plot. 3) Chuck is actually a half-honored actor, but most of the participants are doing the most common way over the 1970s. . Watch 20 minutes at a time and not bad. But however it is not very good either. ;)
