Superdome is one of those movies that makes you wonder why it was done. All of the attributes cause a person trying to destroy the superbowl, and all attempts made to prevent them. How the work of Tom Selleck and Donna Mills managed to survive this is my most. However, the most exciting thing about it was not FOOTBALL IN IT AT ALL! Avoid this if possible.
