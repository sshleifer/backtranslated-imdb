Sorry to go against the flow but I thought this film was not real, stirring and very long. I was tired of looking at Gena Rowlands a long battle with himself and the trouble he had. Perhaps the film has a cinema value or represents an important step for the director but for the value of pure entertainment I would like to break it.
