The only events made me laugh when those with christopher walk into it (filmdirector madness) all the rest of the movie was just boring.in at first or so nothing happens. does the usual job of old duck old (yes!) into the girl at the door (where I saw this before?) who gets a guy. for a short time. really did not care what will happen to the main characters.if the true session fell in the building attempt to commit suicide movie may be the most interresting look.
