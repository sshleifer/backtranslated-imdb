I remember I saw this cartoon when I was 6 or 7. My grandfather took his video for free in stores. I remember it played. The plan is useless. I hated a fox that became a friend of Casper. He was so stupid! Casper cried his head as far as he could not find a friend. So? Get more! Only a good place and I don't want to hear it means - it's when the fox was hit and died at the end. I cut my head to pay for the payment because this cartoon hit a lot. The bad news is the resurrection that revives and becomes a spirit. I wish he would have died. I think I've given this video to someone because I hated it. It is not surprising that they were offering for free on the mall. If you have a child do not let them look at this. They probably agree with me that it takes.
