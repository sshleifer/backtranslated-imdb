Giving credit when necessary, only technicolor, clothing and sets are worth mentioning with respect. <br /> <br /> Certainly of course is the lowest step in the long work of BING CROSBY in Paramount. Script is about to be as bad as you can possibly imagine with Bing size or William Bendix nor Sir Cedric Hardwicke can do something about repairing. <br /> <br /> Bendix looks very foolish on the boy's page. With Rhonda Fleming the poor is responsible for the cost of the heroine needed to look good for Bing and another other but by fighting with lots of ballads that have not been moved in a loud voice might be for the event. It is very clear! Mark Twain's magic is not visible in any screen. The only crosby fans who can know can appreciate this films of the films that have been given a wrong direction. Even extra looks like it doesn't know what they should do. <br /> <br /> Combine up: Evil as a bowl of bowl. It does not recommend, even for children.
