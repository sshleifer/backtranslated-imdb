.... because if I were, I would have liked to be beaten on a cross on a wooden cross! I am still trying to determine the plot of this film - and I become "generous" that there is even a plot to start. As mentioned earlier, it is misnomer on the DVD cover that Richard Dreyfuss is a real star. It was difficult in the film. And if he really was "broken" as the back cover showed that he was, well, maybe because he said YES to be in this movie tragedy and could not happen! Movie seemed to focus on Jared Martin, and his role in the movie was supposed to exist, which was not very close, was not a great secret as the role of Gene Barry was - or was not. And speaking about the "big" ... anyone who had a sharp idea to connect Gene Barry in Humpty Dumpty's clothing, which showed his column literally pulled up to his chin, he must be judged at a difficult time to watch this severe movie. I would like to continue on how this film was bad, from the "unofficial" conversation of "actors" (consider Clutch Cargo), by horizontally skipping from location to location (again, being generous even calling pictures pictures "scenes"), for a lack of conspiracy .... However, if you have entered into a bad state of 70 years and if you are on the island of Michigan without anything but this film and a picture box with a child of cats, I recommend have a good bottle of wine before you start this amazing movie because you will be glad you can't remember the next day!
