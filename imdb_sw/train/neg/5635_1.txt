I also like David as an actor but I have lost a few hours of my life to really watch this film, I still believe I have failed to look at it completely. Is there a point of film?, And finally, well, Im glad I have never been paid to see that very bad piece of film excuse! I do not know without hunting the truth but it is David who married or saw a sharp actor in this film in real life, if so try to try his career, if that fear should be defeated. I will write this in hope I can make someone who doesn't watch this film, even if 1 person considers my opinion and decides that they would like to watch the painting I would feel I have done a good job in the world, if I had the same advice ...
