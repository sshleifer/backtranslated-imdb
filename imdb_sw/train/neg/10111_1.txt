Acting awesome, the line of bad story, makeup of cheesy, and this is the tip of the ice. I've never seen the worst movie in my life, 5 minutes in I decided to move forward to see if anything liberating will happen ... It didn't. (Apart from a good chest bullet) The film seems to be stored in the furniture store, and the same warehouse was used for at least 90% of the set. You can even see the red chair in different "places". When you make a film at least renting an office building and an apartment, it is not a warehouse that will address all your actress talk. (Note to producers) Renting a small office space and apartment for a month is much cheaper than a whole warehouse, and both are easier and more reliable. You will need your money back ... I lost $ 2.99 only to pay this tonight and I feel removed.
