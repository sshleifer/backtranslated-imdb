It was supposed to be the last Freddy film (and it was more than 10 years) - you think they would try to get a good film done. But they came to give us a worse series (and that says a lot). The plan is useless (I can't remember), all the main characters were few (really wanted them to die) and Freddy's wishes were worse than usual. The only thing far away from this was short (and funny) came by Johnny Depp (the first movie "Nightmare" was the first). I was also seeing on the playground was the last part (to restore Freddy's childhood) was in 3-D. Well - 3-D was a fade-faded color with an incoming picture and out of direction. Also three skulls that were supposed to be awesome (I think) had the opposite response from my audience. Everyone broke the laughing. It looks worse on TV in 2-D. The meaningless and stupid - too small. Skip this and see "Freddy vs Jason" again.
