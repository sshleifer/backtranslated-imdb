I really wanted to love the Pillow Book. The amazing story, the description of the impressive character, Ewan Macgregor in absolute absolute glory. Unfortunately, I hated every minute. Greenaway was very happy to present the film only, and not the advantages of the film. I will not enter Vivian Wu's work of destruction. You are corrupted by stories and windows 4 of teeny and advanced kalligraphy technology under the screen showing the music you play. It seems he lost sight of presenting a real story and developing a conspiracy, and incorporated into foo-foo decorations that have nothing to do with anything. It's a little like to present a picture of John Singer Sargeant in the shape of the Hallmark of the chintzy which says "GRANDMA LOVE ME!" in the great letters of the wind. This game seems to be the death of the director of director of director rather than what could be - wrong and horrible. In the hands another director (Jeunet? Coppola?), It can be a jewel. In the hands of Greenaway, it is best in the art of art art which also finds itself very sensitive.
