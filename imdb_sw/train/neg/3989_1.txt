Who in their right mind sing a song at the same time showing the emotional scene between two people? When Flipper is faced with his wife's offender in the closet, the song has been played and the sound content is as big as talk, so one can hear neither, to overcome any emotional impact that may have an area. The events of Annabella were hit by her father and her fists, lights and then the belt was a picture of the drawing as a wonderful. This whole movie is a cartoon, a great exception on whites is really amazing. Negotiations with black women after the flipper wife know that she hated the white woman - if it is a debate with a discussion of oxford, it's ridiculous. Widespread violence may be possible to endure, but the voice of sound and mixing sounds during this 'movie' is very much. It was a well-made movie. There are no basic tricks of the film's decision, soundtrack, editing and desperate attempts by the major actors trying to put this film. I was really sorry for Anthony Quinn, wondering why he had accepted the position in this flick - his appearance in this is painful. This is the first movie I saw with this director and it would be my last.
