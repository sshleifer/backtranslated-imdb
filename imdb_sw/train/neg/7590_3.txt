Good bodies, beautiful colors and function of the camera, good talk, banal plot. The prima donna name, Camilla, and the known flowers that appear frequently, remind us of the comparison of the plot from Dumas La Dame novel Camelas, movie Camille pointing Garbo and (I think) Robert Taylor, and last but not the lowest Verdi La opera Traviata. Beautiful women, very poor, non-community for one reason or another, loved, fragmented, reunited at the time of the death of tuberculosis in the last area ... One forgives banal squares and unhealthy foolish chat in opera , but why lose Hayak, Don Sutherland, a good translation of LA in the 30 years, the earthquake of the deus ex machina that kills another woman easily, and all the beauty on this unhappy turkey where no good sound?
