The geek of the killed high school makes a scarecrow that takes revenge on everyone. <br /> <br /> This movie heard me. It has a very good monster, it has a negative impact on low budget, at least but it can run the cycle of good and bad things. Half of the road I started to develop quickly and then go through the chapter on the DVD. <br /> <br /> Problems with this movie is a lot. First on the cast looks about thirty and still think that it is high school. You don't believe anything from getting as a result. The scarecrow, while looking great is not more than that. He says stupid fools and goes in a way more designed to be funny then scary. What? This is a comedy or movie horror? His problem that goes beyond one point on a lot of conversation and setup. It seems more to send on every basket than a terrible heart film. How I expect that the film has been made to a very few viewers in mind, the awesome fans who want to laugh in a variety rather than agree. <br /> <br /> With a beautiful monster looking this is a film to avoid. Even if you take it to the business manager for less than five dollars, you pay too much. Avoid it.
