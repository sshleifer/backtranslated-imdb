Slackers as its name in this movie are three college friends Dave, Jeff and Sam (Devon Similar, Michael Maronna and Jason Segel respectively), who are approaching graduate from university without staying for a test of loyalty but completing efficiently. This goes on to the very end when it is not possible but the best character of the movie Nathan (Schwartzman) shows what they are going through. Nathan begins exciting to do with his dream girl as he keeps following that in a normal situation. The only problem is when the trio starts to work on it, Dave loves to love and beautiful and cheerful heart Angela (James King) Unfortunately, it's not a brilliant movie type. Schwartzman makes watching movies as simple as its performance is brilliant. The King's function is moderate, I think he was just employed to be close to his good look. Slackers are remembered for Pie's America with different directions. Jokes is not as deep as in the Pie of America. But not all used? I think this movie is a warning to filmmakers who come from nature. In general, a short time of smiley but a terrible movie in terms of act (except for Schwartzman) and subject. * from *****
