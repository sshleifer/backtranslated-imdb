- = has a spoiler from all previous versions and films = - <br /> <br /> I am a great fan of Notre Dame De Paris, also I read this booklet and I watched the movie today, at first I was hoping looking at a good film especially when I saw 6.3 IMDb point.first scenes were good but I actually wait, cinema scene directly from the book, but it was normal but when Esmeralda gringoire kisses I felt something was bad .. they don't even kiss in the book, even in music .. <br /> <br /> and there was a great gap for Esmeralda being judged by a witch, in the book teaches his goat how to answer the number of hours or write the word "phoebus". Waiting there was a phoebus were not there? in this film he is a junk army again, the designers made the love of Quasimodo show around and even canceled the love of Frollo ... but Notre Dame was frollo. His thoughts of his struggle between the love of God and the love of man in the film we get to find anything like what we have, another person who is very bad and kills people who fight with his thoughts .. and not mention phoebus, not to mention the love of frollo , not to mention jehan (brother of frollo) without naming the mother of Esmeralda (perhaps the same, the story of the story would have taken too much) even does not say the real story. and alchemy he tries to make gold ... he was stuck in science and religion) <br /> <br /> finally not looking at this movie, it's some kind of journalist version real, and if you look at it before reading book, god ... you should read reading immediately. <br /> <br /> This movie is worse than the hunchback of Notre Dame II animated movie, using your time and watch Notre Dame De Paris music .. said enough.
