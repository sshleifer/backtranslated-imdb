Watch this film in preview, and I can't stress enough how I thought this film was. From the beginning, the audience were wailing over the great push of Pacino. Poor Al look really, haggard really, and I can't decide if this was part of his role as a drug addict, or maybe he didn't get to sleep before coming to put. Worse than near Pacino, however, it is an excuse for harm to the plot. Earlier in the film we are given signs that Pacino's behavior is homosexual, and I am suspect that this is what the scribe had previously wanted. Later, however, we have to stop our discomfort and believe that both Tea Leoni and Kim Basinger (both sleep through limbs) lust after the elderly, half dead looking, destroying a person with an impulsive shock. The worst part was a plot of conspiracy, which had a corporate leadership which is not fully explained and we have never been concerned for a little. For this reason I would definitely return my final sentence, because of the possibility of repeating and editing, but you can ring for I can't pay a percentage to see this in the show.
