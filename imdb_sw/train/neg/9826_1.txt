I think this will be a great cinema for a true Christian in a Christian Christian planned, but for anyone with an open mind who believes in free voluntary, intelligent thinking, separation of the Church & State and GOOD Science Fiction is a sharp joke! <br /> <br /> There are other known actors who would need work or need to share their personal beliefs with all our partners. I liked this movie in the same way that I was accepted by the "Reefer Madness." This movie attempted to teach medical education in horrible ways in such a way that this film tries to teach "Christian" principles and the threat of hell and pain for other non-partisans of our world. I screamed and laughed and at the same time I was afraid to see how many people really believed that our society should return to the good 19th century!
