I entered this film and prospects, from the hype, that would be wise and reinforcing. Certainly nothing more promotional price for the band "Wilco." Instead we get a lot of votes and stretch on "process," an honorable and undefined model of band members who was chosen by a writer / song writer, to pronounce a declaration by a friend of a fallen member - for 18 years - saying "friendship was over," and this useless story about how one record label "hurt their feelings" by ignoring them, so that just a fake could get once 50 from other texts (oh, tension ... not ! They tried their best to make it look like it was a problem, but I think it was all smoke and mirrors to produce a catastrophe that was not there. This does not even focus on long-term instructions where we find many recent songs that have hit us completely without any stories, insights or even good works in movies. The test caused by emotional loyalty or a balanced view of life has made me ill looking. <br /> <br /> From the film, this band looks like a small group of youngsters who move around to find sounds they don't have to think they are some kind of carers for music art, which they definitely are not. And I thought the music was hit, and I couldn't even understand the lyrics from the style of the leading singer. It is worth 2/10.
