I started watching this film with great expectations. However, after an hour I left this movie as it just put a lot of questions without answers. This has already started in the opening sequence and became worse. Why are they covered in Hollander under the statue? Why is there a good Italian composer? Why did the wife of the farmer saved Hollander? Why did he, on being saved, not run for his life rather than start making love to the wife of the farmers? Why were farmers not saving Hollander when the farmer was not near? Why do these uneducated farmers do not know Italian? Why did the Italian player know about the gold of Hollanders? Why did he hide in the cesspool in the middle of the wealth of the bad farmers? These questions and much more came, and none of them seemed to be called in an acceptable way. So I think I am completely missing of this film, and I don't connect with stories in any way ....
