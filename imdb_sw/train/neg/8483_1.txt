I usually just write a review of movies that I have hated or liked. And, as you can say from the number of stars there, I didn't like you. At the moment, I think you've read about a plot or maybe even seen a movie, so I'll leave the summary. Let's break this, the pros and cons: <br /> <br /> Cons: Concept: The premise was established to be interesting. Using the theory of chaos as the theme was interesting. However, it was not very well done. I am wrong if I miss, but it seems to me that the theory of chaos was a non-fiction type. The event that appeared in the film was seen as unfortunate than anything. I think the Butterfly effect was represented by all "God (s) causes Tsunami to bring idols." Presentation comes out as much as anger however. Some people call this an intellectual, but it seems to be another film of the action. <br /> <br /> Story Story: Is it just me, or does it seem that Kamal just lost this to give him an excuse to play ten roles? The plan is made very well; Govind continued to lose more of the injuries in an unforeseen accident (his friend happens to combine the material with the bag he sent to India, the old woman comes just to throw it into the statue, half of just cast unexpectedly to meet at the hospital, and the case with just the image happened to get The combination with one which was the famous singer.) <br /> <br /> CGI: Oh god, CGI. It was worse than the special effects in 3 jaws, and those frozen. Once, I could describe the places that were being demolished. Even my ten-year-old cousin knows that underwater cars have not looked like that. Stunts: Yes, now the practical in the Tamil movies are not true, but the stunts in this have been bad and they actually despise you from the story. <br /> <br /> Make up: I must admit, they worked better than expected. I thought Kamal would be playing people with tons of the same tones, so two white fake boys and a Japanese boyfriend Aikido caught me. However, it was still very bad, I could easily understand who were wearing masks. Songs: Music was mixed and lost in many cases. <br /> <br /> Asin: His character was more likely in the movie. He had a great voice, he said, and he was concerned about the image. I really found myself wanting to die. Catch holes and frog Loggia: Let me do this straight: the laboratory monkey was able to pass the door to the password, but it's not enough enough to tell the difference between the chocolate bar and the apples with a deadly virus in it. And then, the former CIA executive who is after the external invitations are going to India. Instead of immediately following, she marches the first player of the pole. A famous Punjabi singer who has cancer checks in a small city hospital in the third world when she can get better treatment. Additionally, he is shot by hats. You think he would be killed, but instead, the magic of the magic has wiped his tumor. You read it in fact, BULLET has closed the tumor. <br /> <br /> Hate ... Naidu Character: It is possible the only part of the movie was its comedy.
