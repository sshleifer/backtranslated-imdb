Thanks to the BBC for this show. I was getting very poor, I hated to leave home, talk to new people and I had a great feeling that people hated me. However after looking at one part of the 4 non-Blondes my luck began to change. After 2 years I started to apply for a new job, wearing fashionable clothes and I actually saw talent. When the series ended I was running the sales department on the job, playing many women and often won the karaoke competition under my location. If you have a crisis and do not know where to turn then go to Poundland and exclude the DVD only 99p.
