There were good performances with Robin Williams and others but the movie was so bad and very disappointing compared to good views. I thought Sy could be a serial killer who kills people to death: bad clothes drive out victims near the food court, giving Oprah's opinion and reading his medical history until they ask him to beat them. I think the movie is very interesting for people who think visitors love their photos. I expect many retail workers want a break from customers.
