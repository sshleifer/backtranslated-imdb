One of the corner of the cinema corner of the budget takes a legendary story, of tribal stories and forming complete destruction. The Phantom Mall is not different from this rule. The scorer takes a Phantom's permanent story of Opera and puts it in the '80s' shopping mall. However, the goal of "Phantom" is now just to take revenge on those involved and delete his face and kill his family. Special effects produce good chuckle, especially when the parts of the body begin to appear in the plate from the yogurt. Pauly Shore has a small role that does not allow him to be as active as a person would expect, especially due to the fact that fifteen minutes of MTV's popularity has not yet arrived. If you are looking for a few good laughs at the cost of executives and staff of special effects, check out this flick out. Otherwise, keep looking for something else.
