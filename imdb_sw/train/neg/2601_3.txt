I just watched the movie for the first time. I wanted to look at it as I like Drew Barrymore and I wanted to see one of his first movies. Movie is about a girl (played with young and beautiful Drew Barrymore), who leaves NYC to LA to lose her soon. Shortly after moving to a boy who loves him, it becomes apparent that he has a bad role = doppelganger, who hates him. <br /> <br /> Movie is very poor and beautiful. Two dialogue and acting make the film inappropriate. Including is just something for fans of Drew Barrymore.
