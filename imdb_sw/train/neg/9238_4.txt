One-note comedy which is possible to keep modern dentist women women on the edge. The Department's storekeeper Betsy Drake likes the ideas of newborns and marriage, putting her trust on women's magazines until she spies well through the Bachelor sleek Cary Grant. Some of the films are written directly as a non-biased Drake tracks its string. I think the word "perky" is the sum of the way Drake to the role. She has a pleasant smile, but after 20 minutes to remember her teeth, I began to overturn. The role of Grant is essentially secondary and eliminates its normal flair. There is one area, however, that almost saves these good practice. Drake asks Grant not to follow following his speech to the women's room. Here his special way is clean enough to be true, and the producer has not found our star for that minute for 90 minutes, the film may have more than a nightmare girls dream, in 1948.
