Surprisingly where many of the theories of conspiracy and paranoid ideas about the UN, Israel, and international issues come out, do not look again. This is not a typical Hollywood film that depends on some biblical passage. Instead, this film was made by the company (Cloud Ten Pictures) and the political and religious agenda. As a film, the end result at times appears as part of the televangelism program (complete with family applications and light burst through the windows of the church when the strokes blow). For the most common audience, it may be difficult to believe, but many people believe these real things, as shown in the film. And that, maybe, makes the movie useful. You will probably not see a short view of the amazing views of the majority of your fellow citizens. So, if you see it, think of it as a social / cultural document. If you are all the savvy media, you don't need to warn about non-transfer experiments in propaganda and operating in the film.
