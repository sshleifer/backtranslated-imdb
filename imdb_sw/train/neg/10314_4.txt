As someone who likes to enjoy the events and was very impressed with this fascinating story, I had the prospect of entering this film but many obstacles have come in the way of good news that would have been. <br /> <br /> BAD - I am a fan of Robert Duvall and many characters he played, but his role here is one lighter as insurance cover. These discussions are stupid and pleasant Kathryn Harrold is a real-mouth trash. From what I have read, there were several directors turning this film, and that's very bad. You can say things are not the same as the story. I couldn't find "share" with the Treat Williams' view, either. He should be awesome, but he was not in this film. It is also a kind of sad comment that a young man committing a crime is some kind of "hero of the people," but I agree I lost the root to a boy, too. Not everything was stirred. I can't complain about the environment, from the green forests, of Oregon to the Arizona desert. I would like to see this film made again and done well, because it's a one-of-a-kind story.
