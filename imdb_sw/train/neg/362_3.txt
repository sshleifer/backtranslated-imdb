It's not confused with Madonna's film "The Best Best Thing", "The Big Big Thing" is a silly comedy, campy, off-wall on someone who desires to start a magazine called "Next Big Thing" which specializes in various artists and coming. Indie's low budget makes "Chuck and Buck" looks like a jewel. Broken by good acting, poor sets and high cost, etc., "... Thing" has found bad reviews and so far has been selected only for one fringe award. Go on this.
