As a gamer, I can say I like this film. Actually it is, I have the right to hate. I tried to look at it as open as possible, but when it reached down, it felt rather than just dismissing my social group. <br /> <br /> For me, there are several reasons why. <br /> <br> 1. The characters seem unusual. I have met many players, of all walks of life. I don't know anyone who acts like any other in the film. It's like the producers of films have taken the worst of the worst discrimination and put them all in 5 people. Most of the gamers are social people, and some live very much. It does not work. The style of mockumentary is not related to the issue of the film. The real documentation of gamers would work better. When it is a good look (I.E. Clean up), it's not very good. The talk feels forced, unusual. It also seems to lack the realities of the world. Gamers give, I will admit that, but we don't have Tourette disease. <br /> <br /> 4. Humor is missing. When personal humor is the core of my group and several other groups that I have met, this is less than a separation, and more like a toilet humor. Similarly, a large part of the gamer's humor is full of jokes and anecdotes, not to the toilet. Many of the gamers could walk and stop anyone who made the joke. <br /> <br /> 5. The biggest problem for me is basically: Accurate. I do not deny the law, but rather the dynamics. By and large, this film will be done with low-budget films Gamers and Gamers: Increasing Dorkness, all that shows players as real people play real game. The difference is, Gamers: The Movie offers a situation where you want to beat meaningless players against Gamers, where you can say something like: "Huh, I know someone like that ... Yep, it's obvious as Gary."
