Director Spike Lee is known for making films showing racism. In many films, as "What Is Right to Justice," many white people are all racist racists. In this film, tribal marriage is a matter, and racism is no longer a universal issue. <br /> <br /> What Lee does, however, once again show his quarrel against Christianity. It is astonishing two levels in the film world. If Lee or anyone else has ever produced this kind of bias against another group will be betrayed, but Christians? Hey, it's "open season" on them. Ossie Davis, the pastor in this film, motivates his son and then puts a sharp gun on his Bible. They look at it just as soon as you miss it. Hey, people, here is another Bible reader and watch what he's like! Lee does this kind of thing for every movie he does. <br /> <br /> Shows the same hatred when dealing with competing relationships. Who can insist and show racism as something wrong? However, Lee continues in this film as he has in his other films. His apparent pain towards white people helps the situation. It just adds fuel to the fire. Hey, Caller: start "doing the right thing" and leave your hatred in the closet. Better yet, "get more." This is very bad because the information could be made to a film that wants to think if it would be done in a transparent and intellectual way.
