I saw this film last night following many positive comments from many sources. I would like to explain that if you are not ready to try and work out who is always and what it means you hate this film. I'm still striving to understand the roles of administrators in this film, the film jumps from different stories and does not allow you to feel completely responsible for any roles. The political buff and those who love corruption in other world governments out there are probably very good, but for this film filmmaker it is a shock, very interesting place and you will leave the confused movie and anger that you paid the entrance fee. See if you're ready to focus on 100% over minutes every minute or politics interest you. don't see it, if you really like to watch the movie.
