I saw Dick Tracy and I thought it was terrible. Photography in urban history seems to be bad. Also famous characters also seemed powerful. Warren Beatty did not do a bad job like Dick Tracy but it was not one of his best performances. Madonna should only be a stick of singing. Glenne Headly did a good job in this film. I gave this movie only 2/10 because of an amazing acting with Al Pacino. It was not a high score in his career but still did a good job.
