Yes, where do I start my story? I went to this film tonight with a few friends without knowing more than the players in it, and that it had to be a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> I thought out within the first 20 minutes, it's a bad decision that I had made to go out to see this movie. Plot was crap, and so it was a script. The verse was awesome because people in the audience were amazed at the sound. <br /> <br /> Sent couldn't view more plastic. Even some cases seemed to have to be done very quickly ... as they pulled because there was no reason. Very bad editing. <br /> <br /> All in this movie all was a great waste of time and money. Boo.
