Okay, movies are good but I give 1 because the idea of ​​a computer virus that an organic virus is a fairy tale of pure fairy. This type of skin only adds to the horse-riding horse savvy moron that the computer virus is the same as the viral virus. First of all, the code of code with a number of 1 and 0s adds to the computer virus. Organic virus is more complex, although it is a small way. Although, it is considered as one simple form in the world, the viral viruses connect to your cells and connect to RNA, then change your RNA code. Tell me how such a thing can be processed from the track? Maybe radiation has an effect on the user string that turns your eyeballs into this virus? I could see it, but clearly, the author didn't think it.
