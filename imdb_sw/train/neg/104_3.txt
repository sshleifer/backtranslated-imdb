The way to a small town that comes out of the beaten path (but which looks openly around the highway), a female journalist runs on a strange visitor who agrees to transport her to her place. The mysterious man describes a pair of horrible stories linked to the area: in the first story, the male partner's plot to kill the woman's husband, but eventually gets worse when they are attacked by a zombie; and in the second story, a group of fighters are reduced to vacation when the undead defendant takes courage because his grave is concerned. <br /> Zombie Chronicles is an attempt by author Garrett Clancy and director Brad Sykes to create an anthology of a zombie? A good idea, but only two stories, falls to evil. And that's not the only way that this flick of the budget can not provide: acting is Lousy (with Joe Haggerty, as Ebenezer Jackson says the story, giving one of the most amazing exhibitions I saw); sites are not moved; The script is dreary; there is a sex area with zero dirt; and finish .... well, that you pray for faith. <br /> <br /> Be fair, some of the work of the Sykes creative cameras are effective (although the bad technique of hiring if the riding trails through the forest is tad supervised) by Joe Castro's the Gore is enthusiastic: the ear has stopped, the eyes of the eyes are taken out, the face is removed, the brain is beaten, and there is an improper damage. These positive ones are about making the film possible to carry, but show, Zombie Chronicle is not a walk in the park, even for the audience of the season's garbage season. I'm giving Zombie Chronicles 2/10, but generously generating my rating for 3 since I didn't see the film and 3D benefits (although I have a celebration of the fear that the extra dimension didn't make a big difference).
