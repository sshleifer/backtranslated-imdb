I will put this fast and sweet. Five girls leaving home from a football game decided to take a 'short cut' to lead them to the road caused by the forest. Of course there is nothing but good things do for them, and they come safely to their destination. Certainly, they don't. Recently they are chased by a heavy chick who has severe mental issues, and what is going on is 90 minutes of great weight. <br /> <br /> I hope you never see any of these actors in any movie anymore. Their cry, hearing the voice gives me a headache, and the script was written so well that it included a lot of words to repeat and shout no emotion. All in all, one of the worst flicks of fear I've seen ... and I've seen a lot.
