Movie is really very slow. There are some beautiful pictures but it can't exceed the fact that the movie is really inspiring. You see a lot of sex watermelons and sex when eating melon and maybe a little more. It may seem even interesting for someone but I believe I look at it for 2 hours is not quite fun. Although you laugh several times but it is not enough and it can be more desperate and disgusting than fun. In order to disrupt the director of the weight tries to put a few video clips on the film. They are the most amazing parts of maybe 50 years of age but it's hard to say well and they are trying to be very difficult to be very sad. Several times you have a feeling that the plot could turn into something, that the power area is made but at the end it somehow shift and so. In addition to the clips there is hardly any conversation to allow music. The director tries to be original and artistic at all costs. Personally I can't recommend a movie. I believe that art is something that shouldn't be boring. During the estimates there were both sides of the movie that interacted with my short review.
