Photos of the Republic come at the end of the game on "Werewolf" of Wascat type. The program has a reporter back to Paris after a long trip outside the country when he was afraid of jungle when he was in anarchy. He reaches a great reputation as his novel that resembles a good experiment is the best supplier. The French government wants to know if he found the secret documents, something that is more evident when the officer is killed by "catman". Judging indeed falls to the author when his lover has died. Disruptive things are returning to the bonds so the author does not know whether he is a killer or not. <br /> <br /> Exciting fun is very interesting to fully enjoy. There are a lot of music in the early and dead time when all things say in the middle and later parts. Acting is good and very good sets but there is a lot of people I know just to remember a murdered murderer, it's very interesting in this film. in spite of her short time (more than an hour) I think the reason that this film was not often seen on TV was that after 20 minutes you lose patience. As good as the talk is, I wished someone would do something. When it finally happened, in a fast moment, it was too late .. <br /> <br /> Take a pass.
