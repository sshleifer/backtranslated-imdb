Documents about immigrant migrants who make a false way to large mountains to get their cattle on the grass. Watching this silent, black and white feature, damaged by part of the Eastern music twink-twink fabric which was not used in the original exhibition, it's even duller than it seems. Interesting scenery falls on small black and white screens, and there is quite a failure to establish any kind of plot line. I loved Nanook North and March of the Penguins, but I despised this film, despite the similarity of the theme. Physical difficulty alone is not only interesting.
