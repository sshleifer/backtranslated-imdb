Let's cut and after: this film is Softcore naked pictures sold for civilians under the name that the label to decorate every penny from the American Pie nipples. Period. <br /> <br /> The whole plot (and that should imply that there is a whole lot of going around) is used as a car to show more audience boobs and sex events. <br /> <br /> If you are a boyfriend, and you are squeamish also buy real naked pictures, then this is a movie for you. Otherwise, the movie does not have much to offer even less. <br /> <br /> acting is a small par, developed character is almost non-existent, and the story is a knight nonsensical of honey, alcoholism and pranks (none of which are particularly memorable). <br /> <br /> Buy a real porn like that is what you want to see, and if not, go to watch beautiful movies. Animal House, Kids, or even the original American Pie is a great movie cinema, and they all contain chronic consumption of alcohol and honey. It's not how much, how to use it
