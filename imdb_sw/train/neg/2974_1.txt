I am a good boy, and I like to think of me as a kind of merit. And, I think so, I mean I'm trying to explore the film in a kind of context that dwells in it. If there is nothing else, it saves you from feeling like I must say very good things about people or films, which I don't like to do. <br /> <br /> The plan in this was clear, very productive values ​​below and set, uhm, simplistic. The acting was "good for playing high school" regularly. My feeling was this one day - please tell me it was. The worst of all, sex, during a large amount of time, was normal, reduced and, at least in my copy, "sound-top" which was inconsistent with action (weather and wonders during sleep in bed looking for a bra?). There was no "sharp" to them at all - there is nothing that explains or attracts, and with a rapid reduction. The vote is "1" then, with the following summary information: it would have been better if the club's filing equipment was expanded, and the rest of the film was reduced.
