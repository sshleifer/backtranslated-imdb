Special effects? Good. <br /> <br /> Script? Horror. There is no plot. No depth. There is no meaning. This film provided Superman as a worthless hero, a hero who has no archetype. In the first film, he represented America in Cold War. Here, he did not represent anything but Hulk. Of course, artists were interesting. Kevin Spacey was a good choice, among others. This does not yet solve the problem that this film did not have any detail. I can't see how anyone can come up with anything deserving from this film, while Superman was, and it is, every day created to be a meaningful hero in not just a person but also in people's minds. This was a real waste of money based on how this film could be taken. Only a few events: Lex Luthor can be a man of international organization, political domination, adultery, and continuing. He was just another body of goofball Hackman. Is / Superman? Why did he stand in this film? There is nothing else for "redeemer". <br /> <br /> Waiting until it comes to the dollar hall if you see.
