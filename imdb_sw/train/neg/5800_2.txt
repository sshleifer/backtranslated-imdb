As a film-awesome fan I am trying to look at all the important gifts of this kind, especially those who are my branded movies. And I can say that "The Power of Fear" (or "Vedma" as the Russian title) is one of the most weak films among them. First, it can not be intimidating even a small child, it goes slowly and so predictable that there is no chance of real fear. Speaking honestly, it is bad in all points: from the goofy plot (I do not know why Russian producers / director decided to change the classic story about the Ukrainian monopoly on some of the most modern modern America's and ignorance. is not recommended a bit and the work of terrible and cheesy actors. All actors including the leadership of Valeri Nikolayev and Yevgeniya Kryukova who are widely known in Russia seem like wooden dolls or something like that and it seems to me they were not worried about playing all the time, just spoke their English lines without any words. And last I don't understand why they expressed this flick in English and Russian actors? I think it was their bad side. At least they could release other American or English actors for leading areas to make them more appealing. So can I say about what is called the "little American town" which was shot in Estonia and looked like it. The only good time I got in the "Power of Fear" is the visual effect. They are better but instead of the Russian film. And the music is the same, at least it does not irritate me. That's why I give two stars. In general, if you want to see a good film awesome? don't waste your time and money on this stimulating flick. And if you are looking for something that says that the Russian fear I will advise you to get a copy of "Viy or Spirit of Evil". It is really a very strict movie due to the same novel as "Power of Fear" but much, much better.
