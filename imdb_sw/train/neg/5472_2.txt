I have always examined dinosaurs, and have always had one basic problem. <br /> <br /> Do not believe in weapons weapons. They don't just seem to be _told_ about them or something. Bullets _bounce_ off of dinosaurs! Perhaps it was because they died millions of years before the invention of weapons, and the laws of physics were only different at the same time ... Well, no. Come. If they are close enough to suit for today, they would have to be at risk (even subsonic) to lead projectiles. It's simple. Look, the most beautiful skin organisms in the world, alligators and crocodiles, are very dangerous for the basic fire of the gun. They are magic. You can blow round pistols through heavy scales on their backs. They will not take up weapons of arms or anything special. The smaller ones penetrate into them, they just don't like it. Otherwise (but not true) big bullets prefer because the challenge (as with most games) is to kill the animal with one shot, so it doesn't run. (Hunters feel that it is wrong to allow swindlers to run and die without paying.) <br /> <br /> Many animals, including animals, are easily beaten with weapons. Among the noise, and the pain of non-deadly wounds, many will leave. The difference is the big bears, which are not afraid that they are just angry with death wounds. The Cape basin appears to be very dangerous because it is known for payment during injury. We have seen the cape cows of cape cows to liberate the calf from the pride of the lion. The big cat will run if it can, but if it can't pay as a last deed. Where T.Rex will fit in this unknown scope. Their behavior has not been seen. For these chief animals, safe hunting is a matter of using a highly effective and powerful projectile, and / or using several of them quickly enough to respond to its payment. With T.Rex, of course, this could be a big problem. I have seen the T.Rex skull (one in the city museum) and carrying enough big guns that can be impossible. Detecting his neck with small flames can be the best way. Smaller pieces still remain - crumbly, they will not just beat because the animal is too big to kill easily! So we have Cortez and her men (this is the _before_ the Mexican popular campaign, apparently) separated by the Americans and planned for the pyramid. It seems that all these human sacrifices were attractive to the blood of T Rexes' blood that destroyed the continent on that day. Instead of cutting their hearts and feeding on the cemeteries, Cortez et spoke to the Azazecs by leaving them to hunt and kill them. Well, maybe they don't have M-16 as boys in a series of "Carnosaur", but the _do_s have pipes, sprouts, and sticks (big, made of wood) and swords. Maybe that's a little less than the forces of soldiers and full cars, but they have several boys and I'd be beta on them on dinosaur. O, wait, there's _cannon_, about 4-incher. That's just a ticket to destroy the Tyrannosaurus skull! So it sets a trap, with a group of men, rules, sticks placed on the rock, and the first T.Rex in it, using a very beautiful girl as a bait. Cortez says they will not have time to reload, so they will have to be closed until they can understand their goal. T.Rex completely refuses their volley fire flintlock, and we see all the crossbow bolt _and_golf cannon _bounce_ off! Forget. End of trust. The rainbow line would conquer Cortez's weapons, and the 4 "ball of cannons can penetrate the corner of the wooden ship! This also would have been _certainly_ through the way of hide, rock, or skull of any animal that could walk this earth. "ball of cannon?) And here's T.Rex, still standing, even even bleeding. So Cortez appeals to the river, where it falls into the sticks, which (I think by magic) penetrates and kills. Yaaay, the sticks set! Dinos cannot be completely shot - they can put a second eye with a pistol. This removes it, so it does not mean whether to carry or a pig, at least on the movie. Kill the second dinosaur with a bomb - derived from a gourda filled with weapons and stone stones. My money would still be on the principle. It is an improved work to focus on all the guns of the gun in one direction - towards the goal. Bomb is the most powerful use of. The [_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ]al_t] bomb has a steel metal with an explosion with a high pressure. (Imagine: a pipe bomb against the firecracker.) A firearm's gun is going to go only POOF. (I believe in one.)
