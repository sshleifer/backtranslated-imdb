This was the third remake of DOING AND ENIEMY AFTER MARKETING (1995) and AGNISAKSHI (1996) <br /> <br /> AGNISAKSHI was the only one that worked and was the best film <br /> <br /> DARAAR is headed by Abbas Mustan who failed the experiment in their attempt here <br /> <br /> The story was good but the handling was not good and the heroine was also powerful and peak was also condemned. br>> Rishi comes back to its role of the YAANA (which is also a SWTE remake) and seems to be too fat to lead and it is similar to Juhi when it is a great attempt at Arbaaz in its beginning and can manage many events to attract the audience. but his voice was awesome Johny is too great
