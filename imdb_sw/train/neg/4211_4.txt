About 4 years ago, I loved this film. I would like to watch it again and again. But now ... I don't. Actually, I think this movie would be good for Secrets of Mystery Secret 3000. It has a group of powerful participants (Macaulay Culkin, Christopher Lloyd, Patrick Stewart, Whoopi Goldberg), and a good plot plot. My favorite part is when Culkin rides his bike and comes to the gang with a group member says, "Hey, Tyler! Where's goin?" MOON? "Also look at the usual line," What! You have a feeling in your fingers? "On the other hand, it is better than" Good Son ".
