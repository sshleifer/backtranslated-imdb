Interesting idea for the film, all show the last dragon in the world and show the struggle he and the evil man have together. At an early age, Einoni was injured in the heart, so Bowen (Dennis Quaid) took him to the black master who gave him half his heart. Now Einoni (David Thewlis) is now a selfish and evil king. Meanwhile, Bowen uses a new friend Draco Dragon (mentioned by Mr. Sean Connery) to get a reward for "dragons". But because Einon has half the hearing of Draco, both feel pain in one of them hurts, or killed. He also includes Pete Postlethwaite as Gilbert's Glockenspur, Jason Isaacs as Lord Felton, Julie Christie as Queen Aislinn and John Gielgud as King Arthur. Selected for Oscar for Best Visual Effects.
