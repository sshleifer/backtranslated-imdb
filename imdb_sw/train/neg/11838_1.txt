If your idea of ​​entertainment looks at pictures of people walking with cars (you see a woman passing under the front wheel, going out if the car goes ahead of him before going down the back wheel - and they show twice if you have lost the first time) then this is your document. Of course I didn't have to look again at that very bad piece of voyeurism, but that was enough for me. Maybe others are better. <br /> <br /> I wonder how long you will take on television networks to start showing slush movies. Perhaps the game shows you according to personal filtering can be good. I already know that there are people worrying in the world and that bad things happen. I don't need to see a confirmation on TV that pretends to be entertainment.
