Now I have checked all four Bo Derek cars led by her husband, John; all of it is quite horrible, of course, but this is certainly holes. Featuring a common plot of flimsy, bad scripting? and director, usually? and act, not to mention the freeous weaknesses and stars, it deals with losing the greatest husband Anthony Quinn (he admits his suicide shot by saying he was always admired Hemingway !!) but who keeps watching and talking to him. In fact, he wants to return to another body, younger? But he really does only in the very last area! Derek is as good as always, and still plays na (ve (!) ?? especially during the middle part of the soil that has been taken by the killer employed in the spa. Quinn, too, is more common than life (read: hammy) here, but this makes it easy to become its nadir; instead, for a lot of time, he works behind a piece of plastic shiny (perhaps it shows that he was in some kind of song)! 'His position', then, is a clear viewer who does not have a talent of talent or even personality. Also mentioned in the healing of the Hollywood Don Murray veterans (as the best business consultant and friend of Bo Quinn) and Julie Newmar (as guardian angel of Quinn after life)? with the amazing appearance of billions of Donald Trump (who perhaps needed this at its start ')! It also goes without saying that John Derek was the author of the movie on the film, that the last features are full of non-(and corny) expressions of gratitude to many people who have asked for help, and that GHOSTS can't make IT swept the board in the Razzie Prize. 1990s!
