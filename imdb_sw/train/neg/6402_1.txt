When I saw this film, in 1979, it was the first movie I had walked in the middle. There is nothing worse than the comedy which is lost to being funny, and this is missing every time (although I can't talk for the last 25 minutes of the movie). There was nothing original about any skim. When I am interested in the racy of the racy where appropriate, these skits were unwanted. The main thing was that this film was announced as "the first movie of Robin William", embarking on its new features found in the "Mork and Mindy" series. However, his role was so small that you can't watch him on the screen.
