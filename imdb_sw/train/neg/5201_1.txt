Myth looks before, but it doesn't matter if you can think doing the correct storyboard. It is clear that the director has not used his work on the story. In this regard, the camera spent too much time to consider which is not compatible with the message of the film. Funniest is, however, if you are looking at a web site, you can read that it was for the purpose the director has chosen to make a film with bad camera alarms. Because it reminds us of hunting. But I've never heard of hunting and ivory corners ;-) It will have 1 star because the story is the same. It is a pity that Ti West, has not spent much time studying his story. It's like the film was more important than programs. Because you have a camera doesn't mean you should make the film once ... come. Everyone can make a film, but not all will be very good. So the advice to Ti West is: stop and write what you want. Use your time to start preparing and not photograph until everything is on the storyboard. Certainly you have the ability and desire - so do not hurt your talents.
