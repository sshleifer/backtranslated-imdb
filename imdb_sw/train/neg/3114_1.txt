Trying to compare or represent this "swill" if anything "Hitchcockian" is an out-n-out attempt to mislead Hitchcock fans to lose $ 7 on this film ... The weakest to do the weak story. <br /> <br /> No real doubts, no thrills. You're waiting all through the weaknesses of this film for a lot of money or even any money ... You are bound to think, what she was that all over. <br /> <br /> And please, enough to move to make a "live life" HIP and a political correct !! ... I can't recommend this to anyone ... Should I mention how weak the act is? Williams worked better as Peter Pan and "Mork". But these had many innocent cases .................
