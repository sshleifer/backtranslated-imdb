I would be following these films for a very long time so maybe perhaps very little. I think both Gillian Anderson and Danny Dyer are good at what they are doing and liked to see what Dan Reed could come up with but unfortunately did not work for me. The problem lies in the fact that the film is not good to understand what type falls into and so it fails to play in the drama, panic and exciting things because instead of focusing on one of them and doing it a bit of jack all business with no master. <br /> <br /> Columns (such as many retaliation films) are simple, couples meet and go out, something bad happens and revenge is a simple formula and one that most directors have done specialize over the years. Of course in this case it is like Dan Reed thought, "It would be good to make one of these retaliatory films that go deeper into showing the humanitarian side more of all the characters and getting into their mental state in more detail. .. "Okay! There are also a few important things missing, in this type of film there is a wide range of warning types. Not doing this or this may happen an element that adds tension but there is nothing of this kind here. It just happens, then nothing happens for an hour, then something interesting is done and then it is over. .. I would like to say next time it should be connected to the form of a film that he does instead of trying to be very clever and he will have the best film on the hands.
