Well that's 90 minutes of my life I won't leave. This film makes the TV show of "Tea California" looks like "Welcome To". Acting was bad and the story impossible. You can't even start on the original band in front of this story, crippled songs, see etc .. You had to believe that they were one of the most hot bands in the country, and not enough in the world to accept it. The guitar appears to be a heroin user, not that I blame him, if I was close to the putrid band and stale songs and wooden action I would also be putting on horses. <br /> <br /> music too far, avoid this at all costs.
