Unfortunately the movie is more concerned with providing a social definition on a true event, but they do not have valid legitimate balls that happened. The constant view of how violent video games are not blame (I get the feeling Ben Coccio is a bright gamer), or how the media and music completely without influence is a clear message (we even get a laughable scene of two boys flaming their cd all, talk about the trick!), but the movies leave just because of its 'fiction'. You have tried well. It is his main idea of ​​reducing the media's influence, but how do we know children who are planned and implemented school bullets are not affected by the media? or video games? We can't, and we love this film because again these kids are quite smart enough to stop the media, still dumb enough to burn the Nazi logo down? haha somehow don't think so. <br /> <br /> The films of the film you on the head with its normal family show, are almost doing a disservice to think that there was no big mistake in the family power of children who have gone out and beat their school counterparts. Why everyone is so involved in making criminals appear "normal", when they are clear? A false manifestation and a lie.
