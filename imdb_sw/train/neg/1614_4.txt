The second half of Steven Soderbergh's bio revolutionary on Che Guevara deals with its final sales campaign of Bolivia's revolution. In order to maintain the face of Che Soderbergh he easily escapes the massacres of mass killings led after the revolution in Cuba and the folly of his Congo adventure ("This is the history of failure" writes in the journal of his Congolese journal) focusing on Che. an attempt to support the awakening of the government in Bolivia. It can be a tragedy and the last act of Guevara. What has criticized the first chapter follows the chapter here as Soderbergh reduces its film by crawling to learn the beatific face of Guevara to reconsider again as James Dean in the East Eden and Bernicio Del Toro. The problem is Guevara has a few successes in finding converts and soon finds himself hungry friends shouting the dark heart of the Jungle Jungle. Unlike Werner Herzog in a very beautiful, Aguirre, God's wrath Soderbergh fails to use the possibilities of the jungle to increase the lack of prisons. He seems to be more concerned with putting the head of Che on his head than exploring the fear of putting fear on the end of the dead. There is one time in Herzogiki where Che sits hard to shout and scream to get it but the general argument of Soderbergh is installed on a flat, poorly and poorly. <br /> <br /> In his two movies Soderbergh shows he is clearly Che Chepipie and because his goal is still myopic and thin. He spends a lot of time building his building with Che and very little in developing his relationship with key players in his saga, especially Fidel Castro. Doing the worst things he does with a slow and tender approach that is not available for fire. One would think he was full of Eisenstein and Vertov enough to realize that significant changes have been made better with the emerging style.
