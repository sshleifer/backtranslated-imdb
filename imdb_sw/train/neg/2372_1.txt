Unimaginably ignorant, demolition and simplicity closed to "Nightmare on Elm Street" -series! Part 6 is not appropriate to look like the director Rachel Talalay deliberately wanted to turn the Cluster of Wes Craven to the first in one of the worst and wrong shocks. This is not just getting worse in the "Elm Street" saga; It is also one of the most embarrassing films made and is faced with fans of that kind! The story is dumb, characteristic of the character is ridiculous, the structure is all bright and ?? most of all? special effects and appearances resemble images of Tom & Jerry cartoons. Systems that Freddy Krueger is killed by its victims are insufficient and very poor. What? We had to be sad when Freddy beat Jabber turned Breckin Meyer into a video game with a pogo-tied around the walls of the house? The story takes us back to Springwood and it seems that Freddy suddenly has a daughter in the middle. Would you like to mention that in one of its original adventures, but no? There is only one young servant in Springwood and Krueger who uses her to find a relationship with her lost daughter for a long time. Another reason why this last phase is very bad is a very poor structure. Doe's boyfriend John is described as a leading habit but then suddenly dies and the plot continues towards two adults! What is it: Freddy Krueger, who spent five whole films without killing anything but young, finally beaten by two adults wearing 3D glasses! Sort as a whole cell damage, isn't it? In addition to I'm concerned, "Nightmare on Elm Street" has always been consistently overrated but, so far, even the weak entries there are at least some redemption features. "Freddy's dead", however, is quite simple and no one should waste his precious time to look at it.
