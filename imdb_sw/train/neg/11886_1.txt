Look at Josh Kornbluth 'act' in this movie to remind me of my class of TV production, where 'not' was an opportunity to prove how they didn't like it! <br /> <br /> RIGHT is a word that comes to mind when I try to connect this witty comedy. Jokes are sophomoric and telegraphed. Delivery is very serious. OUCH !!!!!!! Writing is just a dorkish. It's similar to Bob Saget's show. Watching this film is as painful as watching an hour and a half long Saturday night (after Belushi). <br /> <br /> I hated this film and I want my money back!
