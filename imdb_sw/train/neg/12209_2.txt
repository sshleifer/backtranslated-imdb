Years ago, when I was a poor boy, my good friend and my brother had all the policy that the person taking the movie should pay. And, when I never pay to see some of the crap they sent me, I couldn't resist a free trip to the cinema! That's how I came to see the trophies as the second movie of Conan and never never try! Now, though this is a bad movie, it is in the entertainment areas to watch - in the brain type of die. And, technically stunts and camera functions are good, so this raises my rating all the way to 2! Why is the film so bad? Similarly, unlike the first Rambo film, this is not worth the plot, Rambo himself says only about 3 words (except grunts and crying), there is a “needless and empty” love and movies is one big ( stupid) special effects. And what special effect of special effects. When 12383499143743701 shot with missiles rambo, there is no effect on it and almost every shot or arrow Rambo stem hits its mark! And, when bad people use AK-47, helicopters and missiles, in all other cases Rambo had a bow and arrows and what looked like nuclear-powered tips! The place where one bad person shot and slows down and with one of these smoked arrows is especially for the dumb audience! It was very amazing in UHF watching Weird Al. Plus, HOT SHOTS, PART OF DEUX also makes music type - not just a stupid event. All-for-all, the movie is dumb and useless, it's almost as independent!
