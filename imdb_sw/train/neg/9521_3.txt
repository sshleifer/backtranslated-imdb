This movie has received lots of votes recently during the day in HBO or Cinemax. The reason is that they think people will be willing to compare with Leonardo DiCaprio / Tom Hanks of the same name. The only reason to see it is to attract Matt Lattanzi. Yum! Although I must say Matt was more than a long time in the tooth to play high school. If she was a woman, they could make her a high school mother! (Is it just me, or his daughter begins to look like Shelley Duvall?) Oh, conspiracy - who cares? The normal size of the boy was played by adults.
