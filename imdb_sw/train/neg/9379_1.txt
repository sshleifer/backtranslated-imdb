This movie. . . I don't know. Why would they take such a character as Pippi Longstocking and cast Tami Erin's unique without charmless, I would never know you. Why will they spend money on the leadership of art and some non-negative effects, then do not be confused with good planning, I will never know you. Why sets and dress is sometimes in the past, and sometimes it is not surprising, why you ordered so many bad songs, why the script does not mean anything (even for silly, children's children's film). . . . what did they think? There is nothing about this movie as appropriate. Each part is a name (and always wrong,) every sound effect is a little bad, every edit is in the wrong place, every performance is bad in some way. It helps to create the right atmosphere, despite all the problems, but it is not available for the magic that is the creation of Astrid Lindgren.
