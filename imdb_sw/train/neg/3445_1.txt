When Kevin's little boat gets his uncle's grandfather as a gift, he invites five friends to the island of Catalina on the weekend. During the trip, they drink, drink and play games, and each of them tells her great fears. Later Kevin enters the open sea, the engine stops, and haunted and killed their deepest fears. Yesterday, my wife, son, daughter and three other friends joined the "Haunted Banda" on DVD. For less than 30 minutes of running, the group stopped looking at this disturbing and interesting piece, and we decided to see another film. Later, I decided to look at other parts of the flick to see how bad and would be better to go to bed. The story of confusion has a cinema movie and camera function, and a cast that might learn that actors and film actors and eventually this film seems to be a bad school project. The awesome and careful screenplay shows the deviation of ignorance at the end, in fact the perfect mess that has made me misunderstood what story. What? The girl was dirty and traveled alone in the boat, thinking about all the situation with friends of thinking? If it is true, does their friend again in the last fruits of her madness? Voting for me is one. Title (Brazil): "Viagem Para a Morte" ("Death Trip")
