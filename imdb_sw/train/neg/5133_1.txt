I had no real hope for this film and I am happy. Even if I expected to be bad I would be disappointed. <br /> <br /> Where to start? First, I think 15% of the movie included photographs of the stationary scarecrows in the field of dark jungle. I get it. There scarecrows. I think the head "Scarecrows" was enough. Secondly, it is not a great thing about the events and events of paranormal. Are there so many times that I was left to WTF? Third, the movie takes seriously. I am on the B movie and blood buckets, women's, and unnecessary violence which is the result of a simple psychopath or an old curse. But these movies often know that they are B movies and even do it, like Snow Snow (hilarious Scandanavian zombie flick) or Evil Evil 2. But this movie looks unknown to its crapdom. <br /> <br /> Finally, there must be more blood and / or dirt. Yes, I said. If you're going to have a movie of fear of disaster, do and kill. And if you will have one girl with fire and one of the fire, one of them needs to show the boob on the bottom. So, as you summarize, skip "Scarecrows" and just stone yourself in the eye. You will love me.
