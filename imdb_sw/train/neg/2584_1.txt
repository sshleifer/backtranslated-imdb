So, American Pie: Beta House is a 6th movie of the American Pie in a series. Although, you really don't have any connection with the first American movies Pie unless some of the characters should be related to the characters in the original trilogy and Eugene Levy is in it (can not that person get the best gigs?). <br /> <br /> There is very little to praise this movie over. No joke of funny. Acting is painful to watch, especially the girl "south" which looks more like pretending to Canada's British woman pretending to be a hill using the word "ya'll." This movie makes me feel like idiot like that. Why don't I use a university where no one goes to class (but everyone gets a good class), girls take their clothes to the public, everyone has unprotected sex with sexually transmitted diseases and sexually transmitted diseases, and you can strengthen every family picture the girl without his thoughts? True, this series has fallen to porn-softcore levels. Maybe for the next, they finally stop and hire Ron Jeremy to be a guest. I am sure they can only close the series by making his uncle's Stifler behavior once removed or something like that.
