If this book remained faithful to the book then we can only assume that the author did not know history. Mark Anthony never died of the injuries that were made in the war as shown. He died of fear of suicide and yet, he asked his servant to do for him. The slave decided to kill himself instead. In the real story Mark Anthony was embarrassed by the power of the slave and decided to beat him. But even in Mark Mark's death he had failed and failed his attempt to commit suicide. He cried for Cleopatra and was sent to him, with blood. He caught his trash on the rope and Mark Anthony died later. If you want history you don't see this film. If you want romantic input then you will probably enjoy it!
