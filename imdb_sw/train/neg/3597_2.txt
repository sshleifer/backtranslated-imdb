Yes, there is, another deficit in my account. Two, really! First of all, though I would like to think of myself knowing something about the use of 70 euros and its many donors, I have never heard of Joseph W. Sarno before. This is a boy who has made more than seventy movies and devotional worship and I've never seen one! How? Why? What happened here? Secondly, and even more, when you think you have found a new source of hymns that are hidden, the most popular and so-called "Catholic" film turns into an unpleasant and offensive film. In fact, lesbians of vampire diaries form small, insignificant forms, but some are scared in horrible situations and feelings of ignorance (like José Larraz '"Vampyres" or "Dark Daughters" of Harry Kümmel). Joseph Sarno's film has nothing to offer, except a large amount of freeous dirt and even becomes boring rather quickly. The events take place in the old secret fortress, hidden in the German mountains, where the last five centuries lived bad and bloody baronessi. His faithful students are still giving us a dance party in the catacombs of the castle, which are made up of penis-shaped candles? AUCH, hoping to revive the baroness anytime right now. Suddenly (don't even know how) the cage is full of female and female visitors, so even more craftsmanship. The taste and entertaining sound, but the "Devil's Plaything" has a great number of mechanisms where nothing happens and where non-face-to-face is not sustainable! Sarno is not able to build a focus or create a Gothic state (or perhaps he was not worried) and the ability of the actors to refrain from standing in front of the top camera and pulling the real face. Please make your approval: no matter how hard you are trying to see all the lesbian-vampire movies of 70 years, this is not worth the money! Even the repertoires of Jess Franco and Jean Rollin are pure art compared to this dud.
