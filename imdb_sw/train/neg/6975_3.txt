Oh God, it's a wonderful movie! It is cheerful with the special effects of fake (the organ is played by one person in crippled dress) and a stupid plot. I have never seen desperate characters like in this junk (these dumb children or pregnant woman and her husband and many more). For each, this is a great entertainment if you get drunk. Do I get drunk? I don't think so ...
