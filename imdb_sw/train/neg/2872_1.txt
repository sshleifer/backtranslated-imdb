That's far beyond the horror / thriller the worst I saw in my 29 years. If someone gives you this free of charge tell NO. This film makes you a dumber person to know you watched it. The program is not the worst part of this movie .... its work, functional camera, lights, and sound. there is nothing to love about this film. anyone who paid it to have this film has now been broken. I hope the director has never received green for another movie. In his defense this film was made quickly to try to commit to the actual capture of the BTK killer but I have seen a weekly movie that looks like Oscar winners compared to this.
