Watch Marlen Brando on the screens is like watching the details of the technicians of the strict technicians in a piece of mahogany. Brando's work is the only thing that makes this movie look. The program is interesting and inappropriate (not comic). Some great actors appear to be desperate to give the perpetrators of some humanity ... these characters have the humanity of the rainbow. Everything on the technical side of this film is bad or very clear. The director hits the freezing and shots-shots on the impunity. Common music is a cartoonish and damages any of the major effects. It's not something I look at in the movie, but even the wardrobe dress was off. The respected Brando could not focus on the evil scars they had. I have heard this film called "David Lynch-esquire" and "funny funny" ... not. David Lynch's films are due to bad design - this film had no creativity. And do not confuse folly and folly.
