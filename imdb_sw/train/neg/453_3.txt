Ok, first is good: The performance of Cher and the cinema shows. Although I am not a fan fan, she gives the best performance and its part was well written. Movie shows were done well and they had a sense of love. The rest: the narrow side, the Nicholas Cage performance, and the unsuspecting and unsuspecting attempt to reveal the family of Italy and America from New York. First, every time Cage opened his mouth and I whistled. I don't know what kind of feeling he was trying to use. I honestly not, certainly did not have any New York or Italian feelings I heard. It was quite surreal. And not because I am wrong, the sound was heard in my ears. And I love Nicholas Cage in other exhibitions. Second, and this is unique, but I have a Italiano relationship, friends and friends in New York City, and I've actually got more to laugh and feel more happy in thanking the Italian family family for far away from this released movie. And that would be a very good night at home. What to allow.
