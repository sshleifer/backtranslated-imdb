I was fortunate to read the book before seeing the movie. It was an epic adolescent, a dream of past summer, a great potential of indie film or a great drama drama. Somehow went into the hands of a hack, who made clear the view of Boogie Nights and Rushmore without learning anything. Script loses the meat of the book for forced emotional and gags under the face. I feel uncomfortable for executives, since the characters in the book were rich and textured, but cut down the shameful reputation in the film. Mason Gamble is good when given the opportunity, like Dylan Baker, but the remaining bones of the story seem to be bad after a special school. Poor people = GOOD, Rich Rich = BAD. Even though it is close to looking at the southern California coast where Gary Sinise climbs its trailer which means to pass the bay in Delaware. <br /> <br /> It is a good book, but it's a shy shock for the first Mills Goodloe director. <br /> <br /> K.
