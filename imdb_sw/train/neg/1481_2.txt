What? What did they use all their money to pay for porno or what? The sound effects, the music behind and the general editing were so bad you would think of 12-year-old children want to be made a film. Most of the acting was good to consider the script ... "innocent virgin" played his part very well. <br /> <br /> Sports looks realistic and this really can be a very flick flick with the right brain behind the wheel ... but, unfortunately for all involved, it isn't. <br /> <br /> Turn left made better than this movie and those guys didn 't even have any money! The good thing I did not rent the movie yourself!
