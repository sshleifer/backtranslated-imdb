The front minute began, I knew we were in trouble! Cluster is laughable for the best. The story line was even worse, if possible. Acting was hard and artists gave a sense of skill. You expect more from Slater, Reid and Dorff. Balls were released as from the robot. And I have the poor, I like Reid but he was not sure as an archaeologist. Slater and Dorff took a lousy film to try and solve their events. <br /> <br /> Progress was removed through the entire film. The creatures were not bad, but they were not good either. Under the bottom, I want nine minutes of my life back. They can put money, but give me a time! What is it.
