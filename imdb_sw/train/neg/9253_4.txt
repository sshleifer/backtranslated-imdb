If I had not read his name on the DVD cover, I could never accuse that this old gushy and old music was made by someone closely associated with France New Wave. In fact, the film is so far away from that, that I wonder if back in the 50s and 60s, the authors of the New Writers will be completely reluctant to this kind of film - it's so ... so ... non-fiction. And, it seems to have little connection with many of his previous films. This is not a bad thing - just a very strange thing. I also found an incredible part of the reputation of some observers who gave this film - especially when there is so much better French music out there. The songs on this film were not very interesting and all the characters seemed to be bland and worried. If I had to see another rich person who was worried about how hard to be rich or to get a good price to sell on designer clothes, I'd go puke. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that as American music, not every French music is gold. This film is not another "Les parapluies de Cherbourg" (UMBRELLAS OF CHERBOURG or "Huit Femmes" (WANA TIME) and despite the presence of Audrey Tautou, I can't see many reasons to suggest that anything except something strange.
