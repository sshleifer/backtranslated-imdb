It is difficult to make impartial judgments in this film that had a lot of effect on me for a while. This is undoubtedly the worst film of exploitation. I was unfortunate to see this film for the first time in my youth, I will never forget you. I thought it was a very fun film made. I saw again earlier this year and I was scared again. <br /> <br /> I'm not a zealot or someone to say what others should and shouldn't see but I made a big mistake in a way that something like horrible as rape took place in this film. I like small movies but this is very bad. Rental Rus Myer instead.
