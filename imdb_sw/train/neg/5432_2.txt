The war is tightening ... His victims, hanging on a nearby fence, sit there without doing anything when we get into every thought for a long series. However, Noel Coward's name is the only one you see during the credit, everything that is a movie in it is because of Konda. And for technical terms, it is very good. David Lean just enjoys films from getting-go. There are many times when Coward talks take a second seat and a visual mind Lean takes the middle step. Try the soldiers leaving the ship near the end, and the whole area; tracking lead to the songs of singing, where we are in the house where the bomb is hit. Noel Coward is one of the worst actors I've ever seen. He is quite timber, not expressing feelings, character or humanity. You can see in his eyes that he does not really listen to what another executive says, he just waiting to finish so that he can run out of his own line. <br /> <br /> 7/10. <Br /> <br /> His posts, times of repetition, and posts are increasingly stories: no main story is going on, just giving general insight to characters. Still, its interesting film worth an hour - and a good start for Konda. That is not a very complicated or interactive film, and its propaganda film is obvious, but it is also a reflection of Lean restructuring skills - all about the pieces put together.
