If this is supposed to have a black experience, I would like to go out to the front or back door. One boy's mother one day sees two teaspoons walking and since then there is a low hill for him. Angela Bassett, one of the lights in this film, plays her religious mother, on the protection. With his anger on how his life has turned, in the middle of the picture, he decides to actually accept this. He allows his friends to come in and suddenly it is good to use abuse as long as not in front of children. <br /> <br /> This is a sad state of rap gangster. You knew where this film was dreaming. I was very laughing at the last time, when Bassett accompanied the baby's son to bury, says that when his life was cut for 24 years, he had become a man. What man? He was a convicted criminal, he wrote a very bad rap music and a constant humiliation, and despised the society. The area in the classroom that she tells the teacher that as a sanitation worker, receives more than a teacher is a perfect example of what is going on in our schools. Perfection and non-respect for the teacher. <br /> <br /> The east coast, the west coast rap rap group is never fully explained. All we see is a flaming gun. <br /> <br /> A horrible picture has nothing to prevent gang violence. What horrible examples are rap rapists and their inappropriate music. The African African Community should take courage in their own time. Who was the non-colored slope that showed Biggie? He made Rerun from the old television show to look thin by comparison. I know it was the streets of Bedford Stuyvesant which changed this little boy into the worst monster that he had. The worst situation when this is called a motion picture of motion.
