True, this is a lie, Shrek 3-D was actually the first movie of 3D. I bought it on DVD almost 3 years ago. Did not have Bug Life too? I think it was on Disneyworld on that tree, so I tell you before you go and use it as a logo. Also, Shrek 3D was a motion simulator in Universal Studios. They should still consider as a film, because it appeared on the "reminder" and you can buy it on DVD. The movie was good, at least a little fly were. I liked the IQ. I agree with the animaster, they did the work of God out of making a movie out of something that is an adventure out and back. I recommend to families and children.
