Okay, allow me a new word here: polyphobia: Fear of polyamorous relationships. This is another in a long line of movies that begins to attract viewers about some sort of third, just turn the dime and go all to preach on how it's so so important and just the moral to get monogamistic solutions. Only one in a thousand understands the joy of being able to love him more than one person, and this director is not one of them. Bleh. Mark my mark words: a few decades from now, polyphobia will be like a faux-pas big like a homophobia, but I think who was so close to realizing this? Right first: producers of this film. And many like that. Why not even make a kind of movie of pride and pride like this? Boasting itself to be quite clear on homosexuals, it completely denies the fact that we live in an age when one wife turns into a female wife, which also turns into a converter and polyamory. Open your eyes, please, please! <br /> <br /> This is a desperate, run-m-kill-flick. (But, I tell you, Heather Graham is a living breath.) <br /> 3 out of 10.
