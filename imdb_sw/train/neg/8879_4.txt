I think Cliff Robertson was certainly one of our best participants. She has a half classics for her credit. He does well here as a heavy, but the trend is very bad and reinforcing so troubling, it never gives a mark. The story begins well though it makes me see how he could trust his wife staring himself. She's still a good mugs and carries things together. Death is two. First of all, if we have to take the amount of characters who use walking from one room to another or one part of the house to another, it could eat up to a third of the movie. Adding to that, Robertson's character sat on the bed in the blue light, confused, which could add another chunk. I agree with those who said that half an hour they would make it very good, although it does not praise the film. The greatest need is only a proven plot that, when all is said and done, grows amazing questions. I do not put them in the ruin, but when it is finished, do not think too much. I can come up with ten-like without adding sweat. It would have been better if it had been a spirit story.
