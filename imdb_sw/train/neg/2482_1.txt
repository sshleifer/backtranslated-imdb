(Spoilers galore) This is a very bad film. First of all there is that person from the middle. I think he worked out to play super doting dads. It was the first time he tried to frighten his son by pretending to be a monster ... but then 10 minutes later they did again! And so it goes, this film goes real time. At one time, I began to think that a few days later, until I was reminded that the line of the story was just the next day ... in the morning yet! I'm not sure who these couples should be in real life. First of all they are presented as a couple of Manhattan Yuppie who grew up to have a child. But it carries the old Volvo car. These types have stopped driving Volvos decades ago. Today they run Error. But in 2002, I am sure they have not yet run Volvos. Well, then there is Wendigo. "The mysterious man of India" gives him a little magic boy of Wendigo image and tells him his powerful magic. Yes ... we still do the old Indian secrets. Just drive home, they pan in every Indian idol in their grip trap north of New York City. The American Indians are shown in an invisible way for many years in this film! O, and about Wendigo. Certainly not the reason for fear. Halai the father of a child who is the most horrible thing in the film ... he has just been killed by ordinary sand and hate with a high powered gun. Wendigo comes out at the end of the movie to retaliate a young man who killed his father ... oh, but to wait, it seemed early that Wendigo was of a kind of madness to the father, perhaps because he was killed a hippo ... so Wendigo must be happy that father he was killed ... but ... and so goes ... stealing, boring and nonsensical. There is no reason to watch this film completely.
