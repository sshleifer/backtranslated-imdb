This film is very awesome. Not only is it that traders only show the lowest of the Blues music, it is his personal and personal interest in the music that brings it to a film that makes watching and listening completely. The only view of the movie is the interview of a Swedish couple who had been considered by J.B. Lenoir and display their personal video pictures as well as tell stories. The introduction of the Wenders of the film's topic begins very far - describing the culture of the world (or indeed, the American culture) to travel in space, but it seems little on the theme such as amazing or amazing beauty of stories from 30s provides this movie like The only aid to sleep. Dialing. I expected more of him.
