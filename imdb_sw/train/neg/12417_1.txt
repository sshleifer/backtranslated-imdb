Any movie that starts with a cow cow is not very promising. Based on the discrimination of Kibbutz as it was 50 years ago, well I was there and not just like that. OK kibbutz everything had a small piece of something shown on the film (such as young people playing in the kitchen at night) but you can't show the whole kibbutz as full of all - we'll say - notorious. Kibbutz each had its own problems, but very difficult kibbutz had all. Israel's opinion was great. I still remember my youth in the garden of Eden called Emek (valley). Yes, and acting was also good, so you can see it is not black - just a bad picture - probably for purposes as well.
