(Spoiler included, others could say) <br /> <br /> This film is not possible to take seriously. In some places it is very foolish that I can not only help laugh at all. Try for a sequence where the stallone character jumps 20 meters and a full gear of climbing or (and this is really my favorite) eliminates the bad man by holding him on the stalactite. Yes, what supernatural power did he carry out to accomplish this? I dunno, but he certainly gives the truth to run for money.
