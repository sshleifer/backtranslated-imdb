Jane Eyre_ is one of the greatest novels in English and the author of this picture should read it. I hate when the authors use Spark's notes for what the novel is about. This film cannot focus if you have read the book. In the 'red room' is very popular and I wonder why they are bothering it. In the book 'red room' is a shadow for the whole story and all of Jane's life. Helen Burns is treated very badly on the movie I am sure she was happy to die and leave early. In the book he is one of the compelling characters and was not a red head. The whole Christian theme disappears in his life with all the film. Are you interested and leave this movie and read stories like Charlotte Bronte told with knowledge.
