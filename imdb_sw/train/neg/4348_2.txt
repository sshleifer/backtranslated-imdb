This was just a terrible movie. It hurt me to look at it. Almost every step was not interrupted in the film environment, the act was very serious (P.Diddy was the best actor who says something about the movie) and usually the plan is predictable. Some of the links on Carlito's route were the same, for example his dream one day moving to Carribien, but in general were weak. The love of opinion in my opinion was bad but it is impossible. Anyways I had no expectations before watching movies and I think you might say even these expectations have not been met. I feel for Jay Hernandez because he is a good actor (Lights of Friday). He is lucky though because I am sure there will be too many people watching this film. I usually give the movie a good score if it increases my mind however I will go ahead and give these two stars. Good luck in the future. And that's how I enjoyed Carlito's Way.
