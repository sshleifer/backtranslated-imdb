As expected, the Mazursky film produced in the 70 years would have been against the culture, being sympathetic to the hippies - and having many hippies in it - and, typically, are children against children (for example Mexican territory, when Sutherland will cause a customs officer to respect a little and then accuse him of the release of his burden because he (Sutherland) has long hair). The left side of the left leg would get my nerves I had never prepared before; Sutherland says to her family and friends about the film's films of her next film, and many of these ideas are about whites or Indians (they don't need to say, will be welcomed with open arms in today's Hollywood). One of his thoughts about the film is about black rebellion in Beverly Hills - a war-race, so-to-talk, in the middle of L.A .. This is a non-meaning type that Mazursky thinks when writing texts for his movies. Fortunately, some of Sutherland's hippie friends laugh on this black-revolutionary basis, and the cause of the cause is not bad; A little later, a young Jewish man made an understanding of Sutherland making a film about "sexuality and black trouble", when the latter begins to talk about sex. Sometimes strange is when the old Sutherland daughter works on PC for action with her white school students, and all say: "We, the black people of the South African Republic ...". There is always a certain amount of fun when Hollywood makes a film about Hollywood - especially when Hollywood makes a film about Hollywood talking about Hollywood to make movies. Now, that's very, very engaging, really. Part by Fellini (play yourself) is more exciting than anger, though. Mazursky gives us children of natural flowers and combat Vietnam in the soup, and also enjoys the company's handphone, but it was / is as a major part of the "phony Hollywood" (lyrics from the same song in the surreal part of the war) like someone else any; I am sure that he, too, makes a small discussion in the Beverly Hills parties and likes when shaking hands of people who he or she does not like, but whose money he wants badly for the next (left foot) project. As for her hair: she has the worst hair I have seen for a long time (on the film or elsewhere); it is like a long-haired hair that a middle-aged accountant would have had if he had been growing for a long time. The film remains attractive despite its deficit, but it gives birth to little in the last three.
