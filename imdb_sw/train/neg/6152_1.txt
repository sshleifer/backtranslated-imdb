While most people say it is "the worst movie I ever seen", they say about it about any movie they did not like. However, about 700 movies I can remember to see this is one of the two that I walked away from personal feelings and anger. This is my first movie review, by the way, and I have registered with IMD just so that I can come to the evil of this film. I went to see when it was on the movie (I and my two friends were 3 out of 5 people there), and after 15 years I did not remember so many things, but my focus on leaving the hall is still open. <br /> <br /> --- alert observer â€” <br /> <br /> My, where to start.

Tap. First, the gags are so bad to take me time to understand that they were trying to be FUNNY, and that this was COMEDY.

The most extreme was the hokey and did not work so much that it had no failure to watch (he draws the whole cannibal family and the rakes laid on the sand, which stands in the style of Tom and Jerry when they appear). I am sure there's a lot, much more, but I'm willing to see it again for cleaning.
