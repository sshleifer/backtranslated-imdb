I entered to see the D-War on the blow and with a very low expectations. The movie has failed to meet them. Do not know the stories that are trustworthy - remember Fire Leadership? - but I expect to be in consistent. This film moves from right-hand applicants without enhancing the breath, all of which have been incorporated with special effects that are stored behind the LOTR or even Godzilla. A wonderful historic warrior from Korea, the ancient Caucasi Specialist and growing as deus ex machina in order to find innocent characters out of a recent mess. A special agent from the FBI who appears to be quite full of the old Korean celebration because of the best Fed's "co-ordination" - which has not been moved to this point. Lovers kiss him on the horse of the horse where someone says "I've never meant this to happen." The revival of the long-dead Koreans who "died as lovers of stars." The mystic issues, the forces of the robot soldiers (which are most suitable for Peter Jackson's text and the most common snakes in the fight for each time his chosen prey can achieve something that comes to break it. The talk is terrible, acting wood and the effect of all was, being honest, stimulating. However, for me during the crown was the end, after the end, when the music of the fast credit was - Arirang! This is like Akira Kurosawa fasting "Ran" with karaoke translation of My Way - and let me be clear that I am not equal to compare Shim and Kurosawa director. In short, fend for yourself, the collection of clich√©s and non-sequituurs of legends that they may reject in the sense of a widespread chain in the famous Koran culture but should not be worth the ticket for any great goer the movie - or even not a great movie goer. I would like to suggest that this is going through the movies and go directly to the video, but I don't even know that it is very important.
