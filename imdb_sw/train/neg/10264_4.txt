The New York family chief, Jane Gail (like Mary Barton), works with her younger sister Ethel Grandin (like Loma Barton) in the "Candy Smyrner Shop". After Mrs Grandin was taken by the traders in buying and selling women as prostitutes, Ms Gail and her boyfriend Matt Moore (like Larry Burke) should rescue the young woman who lived. "Traffic in Souls" has features that are difficult to support - do not do very well, and do not show anything much by having a "beauty" of a young woman who has been sexually abused by sex workers. Perhaps, it can be supported as a film related to the topic for the most common size (allegedly being ten, original). New York City area events are the main attraction, after all these years. The closure of prisoners behind bars is remembered, because nothing else seems to be able to make the camera go. (1/5/13) George Loane Tucker ~ Jane Gail, Matt Moore, Ethel Grandin
