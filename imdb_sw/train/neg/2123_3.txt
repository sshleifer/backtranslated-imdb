Go to UCSB and take several classes with an executive producer, Alison Anders. He is a good teacher and whatever he put his name, I thought it should be very good. This film as a selection at the Santa Barbara film was seen as a good option. <br /> <br /> When this movie included good shots and movies, the lack of stories and cooperation was completely removed and anything that tried to complete it. My main problem is that this was the first film of the person and you can say clearly. The worst and worst screens have stopped this film from far away. The sound of the song had a good music that gave the impression of the main characters dealing with the sadness that causes her departure and now to return to her place. I need to say that in spite of some of the best tricks of the film, the lack of storytelling and performance prevented it from being good.
