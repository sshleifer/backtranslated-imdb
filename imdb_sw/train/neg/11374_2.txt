I couldn't be associated with this film. Failed to associate me mentally, emotionally or positively. The discussion was too many and not opened. I could not connect and so care about any characters and I find it hard to find a lot that is positive to say about it. I have read that to understand better needs one to learn and some of the more obvious aspects of Catholic theology. I will admit that, as an atheist, I do not know a lot of good Catholic teachings, but I have also seen many films relating to religious issues that have touched them because their themes are still common to human nature and giving dependence on special skills or beliefs.
