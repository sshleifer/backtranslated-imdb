Columbo movies have been decreasing over the years, this year may have reached the bottom. Peter Falk provides an ineffective performance and comes on interesting to this movie. As is the case in this series, the protocols of the crime area are not heard so the possibility of extinction is always missing. Brenda Vaccaro looks at the face and stimulates the face of the pantomime and Andrew Stephens is a beautiful woman who does not know. (However, his despair was hoot!) The script had a number and its delivery delivery. It should never bring Columbo into the nineties, just leave only one or two of the fun of the clever, the best script and bright features.
