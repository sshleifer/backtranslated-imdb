I saw this film last night (about 102 minutes) and I don't know what put my seat. I think I only expected the film and Gere would have some value in it but eventually no value value came to the screen. The story is an unfavorable excuse to run on the bullet after being beaten and tortured. There is no character in the film that does anything like real life. "Cutting" style depends on the jump cuts, mini flashbacks and overprinting to give the weight to establish a lot of group of sadists running race for free for years and leader SURPRISE is "victim" of the killer killed. I don't see how Gere, Budha, involved in this stupid, sexually litter.
