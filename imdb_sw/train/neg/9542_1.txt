I don't know what else to say about this awesome movie that is not mentioned. Really I'm alone to be angry. I had to know better when I got the name of this movie that would be a horrible piece, but I loved the Battle Games so I screamed. I will live to be sad that my whole life decision. From the beginning when the people of the state explained that their top computer could decide who was a terrorist for how they played a video game I knew I was on a trip though the country-good-writing-forgot. A list of lines, very, very serious of conspiracy, negotiations, and acting it long I would like to fall IMDb if I wanted to put it. For those people who have said that they have seen movies worse than this please tell me. In fact I have a desire to see something that can be on this bunch of horses.
