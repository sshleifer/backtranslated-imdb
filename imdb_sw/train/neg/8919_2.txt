I first noticed this when taken as a proposal from my TiVo system. I love Danny Elfman and I think it might be interesting. On top of that, I am a fan of the work of Max Fleischer, and this started with a look and feel of his 30s cartoons. And both, I thought it would be my interest. I was wrong. Just a few minutes, and I had a quick button. I ran for 15 minutes, and I thought it was. Later, I read some reviews here and I found that I did not give them enough opportunities. I wrote again and watched it. There's 75 minutes of my life I don't know anymore. <br /> <br /> I can't believe no worse reviews. Personally, I think it's because it's hard to reach a low level of line view. How many ways to say this is a waste of time? The movie comes as though it was given by young children ready to convince the world and think they can breast, dirt, and poke joke. The characters are flat. The "Walking Alphabet" Community is blind, basically sounding, through A-E, blowing dirty "F", and then doesn't know where. The journey through the intestines to expect does not work for the first time, not only. In this board, the whole movie is what you would expect from someone trying to "out of South Park" Stone and Parker without the ability to decide what and not funny. This can be exciting if you're up. Otherwise, it isn't.
