Good Mr. Fox is a comedy based on the classic book Roald Dahl. Wes Anderson leads, and with respect takes a short book of the same name for a big screen in a full length of film. When I respect Anderson, a good talented man made it, the film seemed to be lost in his cunning spirit. Anderson seems to have left the story behind knowing that he is a talented person, and if this happened to be a bad film, it would be his first bad film. As you go to school and have your first bad day, this is the first bad day of Anderson in films, so I will let him be easy. I will agree to have a clever and good spirit, and animation is good, but the film becomes very difficult to enter, leaving the story behind and having random shots of random things happening. The characters are good, too. Jason Schwartzman's voice of Mr. Fox (George Clooney) son of smart ass, Ash, and especially cooperate. The film does not quite make it to the level of fear, but it is actually approaching and almost as it goes along. I'm sure Wes Anderson will return to the track with another amazing film when and where he decides to make another film, but for now, sorry, Wes Anderson, this film was a great disappointment.
