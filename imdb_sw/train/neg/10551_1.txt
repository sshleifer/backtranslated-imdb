Apparently, Man Mutilation is about the person who loses the ground of isolation as a way of dealing with his childhood crush. I use the word 'apparently' because without listening to the director of the director Andy Copp (which I did not have) or read on the film before watching, the audience will not know what it is about. br>> <br /> Gorehounds and fans of surveillance movies can be interesting to look at the person of Mutilation and promise some of the severe scenes and destroy the real video of life, but unless they also like to love headaches, experimental experimental experiments The art, they will get this real job to stay. <br /> <br /> The image of evil directed by the unpleasant sound, horrible music and incomprehensible discussion, this mental-numbing negative input is the perfect way to measure the purity of the person: if you still have all your marbles, you will change the trash and look at something of respect instead (I looked at anything, but I really know that I'm totally wishing it!).
