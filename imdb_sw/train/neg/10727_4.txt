The movie should only watch if you leave it after half an hour. It starts with a funny conversation in the bar and makes someone expect a beautiful, wonderful story to come. Well, I can tell you it won't come. It will be dropped for a minute on a movie that loses your patience with your embarrassing feelings for expanding administrators you might not be happy to witness. In an interview I heard that the director wanted to explain in this film the sense of losing that identity, according to him, many people in this world experience. I was surprised to hear that. Do I live in the same world that he lives? Indeed, many people move around in the same manner as I do and listen to the same music, but that doesn't make me feel like I lose my identity. Khrzhanosvky thinks, that we are not more than the clothes we wear and movies we look at? Am I a small player or is he? <br /> <br /> My vote: The good start of the movie saves you from getting 1, 4 best is my conclusion.
