This movie is not funny. It only takes D & D drawings and adds them. All major actors make less than 30k per year, all living with their parents, both lost social, and not lucky with women. The joke is terrible and unthinkable, such as two of the gamers are hit by black midget because one of them had a watch of KKK (it was her witch dress) and someone else had John Rocker's temperature (oh it's funny, she's The nerd so does not know about games). You can be a new school pupil to get anything amazing. Few traders have made a lot of pain, but it is very obvious very cheap to do. I feel sorry for Kelly LeBrock and Beverly D'Angelo. I think these are the only opportunities available for fires that lost most of them.
