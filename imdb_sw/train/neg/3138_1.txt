I see people writing about how this movie was great. It was awesome! Acting was small in time. It made a lot of money because the girl's girls went to the movie seven times because of Leonardo. Where did mad get money? However, I wanted to learn more about Titanic; why it rested, what was going through many people's ideas; maybe even a lot of plot. Does anyone discover that some people did not even put the ship because there was a fire on the board before it was extinguished? No, not every reason you see it is a rich young girl falling to a poor young man and he is naked (he made that korny junk at least saying that the movie was stupid?) The situation when they showed the water filled in the ship. It seemed like water! I think that this film made all these money and could not even make water from the sea look real? unknown ... <br /> <br /> Ohhh band played when the ship hit. Just ridiculous. This was the worst movie until Pearl Harbor was out of "Nothing to Do with the Department".
