As long as there is a 3D technology, (1950 I think) there was an animation made for it. I remember especially, the cartoon of Donald Duck and Chip and Dale in it. I did not remember the name at this time, but the plot was that Donald worked on the bus, was eating nuts and chips and Dale stole the nuts. This was made to look at 3d maybe 1960. If you had looked watching Meet the Robinsons in 3D in the cinema, showed this cartoon before the movie and describe the details of its nature. There is probably anywhere around 100 cartoons made viewed through 3D glasses. This claim was wrong because it is impossible to prove that it is not right. On top of this, this looks just like a bad movie.
