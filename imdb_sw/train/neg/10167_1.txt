This television movie goes to show that bad films exist. The only reason I saw this was covered in KTMA MST3K. It's a Super Bowl Superdome in New Orleans. However, no football is played and we see behind events that will look at something basically. With many stars in this film, it did not make any difference. I don't know why I watched this.
