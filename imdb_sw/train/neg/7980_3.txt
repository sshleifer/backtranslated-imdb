This comedy service, where Peter Marshall (Joanne Dru brother and future permanent host of Hollywood Miraba) and Tommy Noonan were hyped as 'new Lewis and Martin' is just a very embarrassing scare; A few random to see the gags installed, everyone is talking fast and no work at all - there is one scene where Noonan is throwing bombs in officers and politicians with anger; re five feet away, Noonan is throwing them in between, and the total response is that everyone flinches. <br /> <br /> In the middle of the awfulness leave only with the time to bring Julie Newmar, there are a few of the brightness: Marshall and Noonan to participate in a frequent cough discussion with argufying, and their summer is almost complete - it was obviously well-honed pair comics <br /> <br /> is not enough to store. This turkey, alas.
