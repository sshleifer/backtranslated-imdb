Linda Blair and David 'The Hoff' Hasselhoff: How can any attacker fear to refuse such treatments? <br /> <br /> Well, based on a lot of worry, and nonsensical first forty minutes or so, I would have 'said easily'; thanks, however, things make ultimately getting tad more entertainment and the introduction of several deaths, and for those lucky to get an odd copy, the loss of fraud also (unfortunately, my copy was planned for destruction to remove Such devices are wrong). Hoff stars like Gary, a photographer who goes with her beautiful leslie (Leslie Cumming) to go to a flight to a seemingly deserted island to take pictures for her recent project, a book on witches; at the time, he accused Gary also expects to try and treat the worst case of blue balls to eliminate Leslie's virginity. His nookie plans have been beaten, however, by the arrival of unwanted Freddie and Rose Brooks (Robert Champagne and Annie Ross), their pregnant daughter Jane (Blair), her son Tommy (Michael Manchester), a good architect nymphomaniac Linda Sullivan (Catherine Hickland), and agent of Jerry's property (Rick Farnsworth), who have come to inspect the island's hotel. After describing their unexpected presence on the island, Gary and Leslie are welcomed by new owners of the new property, and when a fierce storm occurs suddenly, causing damage to the continent, everyone agrees to spend the night in the old building. Unfortunately, without the new visitors of the hotel, the place is also home to the spirit of the evil witch (Hildegard Knef), who needs human sacrifice to make himself known. Directly, victims are given on a red vortex (which is guaranteed to give improper feelings), before they encounter a terrible fate. Nothing is so brilliant, and acting is angry (Manchester as Tommy is very bad, while Hasselhoff shows that it is one of the best artists, who talk a lot about others), but those viewers makes the first dreary period paid for at a very good time of the year: Rose has her lips sticking together, before being filtered in the fireplace; Jerry was crucified and burnt alive; Linda suffers from pigs and tied to swordfish (!!); Freddie's nerves reduce and spread to blood diseases; and Gary gets beaten back. Oh, and Leslie is raped by someone who has no lips and Blair gets (again).
