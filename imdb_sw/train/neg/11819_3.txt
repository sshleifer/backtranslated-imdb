Despite the unfortunate thinking itself to be (a) mind, (b) important and (c) interesting, fortunately this movie has on tender mercy. Script does not mean a bit, the whole idea of ​​a sado-eyeschistic relationship between the two main characters is very strange, and John Lydon shows us all, in the role of a single movie, why should not let out of music. Its performance is one and irritating one. The only positive thing that says is that Harvey Keitel can give a good turn. His bad lieutenant would later show how good actors can do, but with compassion his performance here is blocked.
