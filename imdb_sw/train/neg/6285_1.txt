Fear movie ?? really ?? Don't I believe how this movie was bad, what is the point of this film? The same movie around 1h and 30 min and 70 minutes the first time, is just the one around with this stupid look on his face after the crash .... it's not talking too much, even even too many steps. I tell you, 20 months ago it had a very small step. And it was still stupid ....... and last oh my god, I don't know where to start, and also end up with this stupid look on the face of this lol. do not mistaken I love Lena Headey, I think she is a good actor, but I don't know what you got into it to make this movie .. do not waste your time and look at it, because this film has no story, it doesn't act. specify how delayed this film goes and feels like you have watched it forever.
