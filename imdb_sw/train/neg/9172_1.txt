When I go to see a film about a zombie, I did not expect the show of Oscar, or write on the Godfather level, but I expect the executives at least not as they are trying to read their memory cards, and the dialogue that doesn't sound like it was closed 10 minutes before the actor read it on the camera. This movie was so bad, I actually got up and left around 25 minutes and I went closer and watched Cold Creek Manor, which was not very good either, but it seemed like Citizen Kane compared to this bunch of crap. On the other hand, the girls were so beautiful, perhaps the only thing that put me on my seat for more than 5 minutes, I actually left after someone was killed, nothing to hold my mind after that.
