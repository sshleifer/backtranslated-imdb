This movie is very bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Now that I've got that far, I feel better. This movie is poor from beginning to end. Stories are lame. Part 3-D is very serious. Freddy is on his character the worst cartoon. Thank you God killed him. And who will see the cameos of Roseanne and Tom Arnold? <br /> <br /> Only one thing in the movie is a little bit of backstory that we give up Freddy. We see that once he had a family, and we see him seeing his father, a alcoholic drinker (Alice Cooper). <br /> <br /> Other than that, all bad. There are quality practitioners here (Lisa Zane and Yaphet Kotto), and they do better, but the end result is very bad. An hour and a half I used to watch this film is an hour and a half I can't come back.
