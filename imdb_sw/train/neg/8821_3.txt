Why, oh, why didn't they learn? When you get good, simplicity of juicy abuse, use! Don't move around trying to get all of the depth and imagination; you just evolve to look foolish. <br /> <br /> The evil of Christmas is the story of Harry Stadling, who saw very little mother kissing (Daddy-wearing-as-) Santa Claus back when she was a child. So, in fact, Harry grows up on Christmas, and finally, when his deficit is too big, it swings, dressed like Santa, and surrounds the city providing children's centers for good little children, and killing anyone who sees them as bad. Simple / easy, and not a bad place to start. (After all, how many more of the holiday holidays were the same kind of schtick?) Unfortunately, this film wants to be more "Santa, Example of Serial killer" than "Night Night, Night Night". The third part of the film has used to write a slow but inevitable breakthrough for Harry, when I would be interested in purchasing the base when the opening names declined. You know the slasher film is in trouble when you find yourself urging the killer to develop and ready. Maybe Harry's clan would have been suppressed to the hands of a competent director, but alas, we have one named Lewis Jackson. It seems, this is his only film, and it shows. Step jumps from the area to the location, without introducing shots or clear comments of administrators to inform us where and who we see. Even once the film goes on, we still continue to be treated with great help of Harry's sympathy, security, and neurotic behavior. More restrictions than terrible, Christmas evil is one to avoid.
