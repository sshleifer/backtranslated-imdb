Shame that even a talented director, Desplechin, could not do a good performance from a talented actor, Phoenix, Esther Kahn they do not have a substance to achieve a clear and clear plan. In an attempt to fulfill the perimeter of the actor's cycle cycle, performance and presentation is also available and not implemented to draw any sympathy from the viewer. In a very long period of time, the devastation of Esther's battle is a very beautiful artwork and eliminates the storyline to be the worst form of evil performances. The content is not available and is not as good as Phoenix is ​​trying to implement Desplechin's instructions, just as Esther is trying to do. Never feel the impressive victory over Esther's pain, we do not feel the victory in Phoenix's talent.
