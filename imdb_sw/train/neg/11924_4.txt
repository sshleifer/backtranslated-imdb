RUN ... don't leave off this film !!!!! Thinking of very young children, this film will bring you tears. If the Gamera trail of the 90s raised the bar, this film has just dropped. It is slowly paced and the monster war is good, but it often appears. This time I had a dry standing on the cat's box. Only the worst offerings after a series of phenomenal 90. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS BEYOND POINT THIS !!!!!!!!!!! Here are the top 10 reasons for the Gamera fans of the 90 series will hate this film. This movie is a follow-up festival of a child trying to cope with the death of his mother and fear of losing baby Gamera by fighting after knowing his father died. <br /> <br /> 9. You see the entire camera for perhaps a minute at the beginning of the film. He gets his selected buttons with a few Gyaos and personal damage ??? He looks old and lethargic. Plus she doesn't see anything like any camera you ever saw. His suit seemed to be cheap and fled. <br /> <br /> 8. The little camera you see through all the movie looks like Pokemon. Great eyes and good ... will remind you Godzilla baby from Godzilla vs MechaGodzilla 2. The camera is now very good. This video has a fast track of NASCAR running at 3 hours of rain. I watched this film with other Gamera fans and no one was happy with how slowly this film went on. I've seen SUV full of fat people going on the road to moving faster. Like Godzilla: The Final Battle, this film had a little bit of time on the screen. The last war had much more, the truth, and the better fight though it was short. Children are responsible for the title. All the friends of the children and the poor writing were killed in the early Gamera series in the 1970s and repeat history in the 2000s. Very successful Gamera films have stopped feeling Sesame and going to dark places. Why return to the failed formula? This was a new trilogy and sales of bad tickets killed any hope of this story continue (thank God). <br /> <br /> 4. Gamera lost her interesting voice. Now it looks like Elephant and strep throat. This movie can generate a new Olympic event. Think of a restored race that involves sending very young children through harm. You must see unlimited understanding of this step. Where were the parents? Oo ... certainly send their children to the battlefield of kaiju. Specific effects were good, but small-for Gamera films. Legi and Iris had an excellent effect. The best effect was to show the size of the baby baby camera to fly. Not very interesting. This movie is not just for adults who are expecting. The director was involved in Power Rangers and shows. Comes as a cross between ET, Always: Sunset on Three Street and TMNT. Kudos if you know all references 3. <br /> <br /> Hire at best or watch once you purchase to complete the DVD series.
