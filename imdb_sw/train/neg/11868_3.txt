At first glance, this film has everything that is psychologically needed: a vampire story and a barrier "non-18", full of violence, drugs, gore, sex (including gender sex), some fanatics zealots and even the gay necrophiliac whip! But then, this film is a series of bad stories (so thin), the worst acting - with an English-ignorant English-style that makes you look at Monty Python's bad - bad music ('80 of hard rock), videotaping is bad, the last is a real shame ... Plus sexual events are ridiculous, gore is not very surprising. And those vampires show in the mirror, and you do not fear the day! You can get very disappointed, unless you see it as "Space Mutiny" or "Troll 2". I hope Bloodlust one day will reach less than 100, because that's the real place. I would say it could still be fun to watch, if you have enough friends and beer. <br /> <br>> 3/10
