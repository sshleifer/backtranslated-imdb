I thought that this film was very good. If you are looking for cheesey, you can love this. I, myself, don't care about the right amount of cheese, but this was ridiculous. The continuous filming and history was very weak. The only thing about entertainment this movie is the zombies of the day, but even that is not enough reason to see this.
