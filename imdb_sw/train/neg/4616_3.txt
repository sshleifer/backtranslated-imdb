This movie has never been good. Maybe it's just the effect and good behavior, acting, and leading that we've seen with The Sopranos, but I just watched Honz Prizzi for the first time, on DVD, alone. <br /> <br /> The experience of checking with the audience 24 years ago must be quite different, but you must say, I was angry at the end. It's not just his abuse, but the only idea that in this manner will be a satisfactory end. <br /> <br /> I enjoy a good shocker, but this seemed not a character ... Also, when was this time to put it? All vehicles were seen as in the 1960s, and still World Trade towers (completed in 1973) were clearly seen in many city scenes. Another way in which the film is old and worst is the only idea that a passenger can travel to the beach to the beach with a knife on his person. The mid-1980s listeners received this interesting and interesting film. Thirty years, reaching the last rights: only you can survive.
