Although in the beginning shows all the Stability in the West Line, this secret and superlative war fades far beyond its best modern. This shows the best fight that was fought, and the first and half hours devoted to love and good times. <br /> <br /> When we finally see a war, it's lame: The enemy plane jumps up? Dial down (for one shot). Sniper in the tree? Kill him before you get shot. The enemy soldiers in the forest? They are not worried, they offer themselves with pleasure. Ho-hum. <br /> <br /> Tepid, turgid, predictable ... <br /> <br />
