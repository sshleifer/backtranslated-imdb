What? This is the biggest movie I've ever seen? No. Is it worse? No. As a mother of four, it is good to look at something that was smooth and exciting. It was good, but it was good. <br /> <br /> I think that it certainly has some chance to improve, but it tried. I do not know if this film is most suitable for the abuse rate from another auditor. They don't care for Eva Longoria. I think he was better than this in Sentinel. I think movies are a matter of opinion. Vendors have a great responsibility if they hit or float. <br /> <br /> Maybe the cast was not done. Perhaps there were so many things going on. <br /> <br /> I wanted to talk to the average movie, not awesome. It can only be a flick of chick. Type of film like The Split-Up or French Kiss. My husband is still talking about those. :)
