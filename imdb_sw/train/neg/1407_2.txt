After Life is a miracle, I didn't expect much. It is hard to believe that these films were made by someone similar to Do you remember Dolly Bell, for example. Zavet is two hours of secret antics and no stories. Wild and humorous humor at the bottom of the ground seems to have been damaged in pathetic buffoonery here. It seems that Kusturica has been steadily declining since he began to make comedies of life, starting with Black Cat, White Cat, which I think was good, but already had some sign of a mental illness disorder. I liked his very early films, and this is why it is so desperate to see something like this. Let's hope that the next will be good.
