I'm really looking for this film if I write this. . . If the following comments "prove my lack of development as a real modern manufacturer," then be it. . . <br /> <br /> But. . . I thought (still thinking as I look now) that this film. . . making it gently, it is very, very standing. Again, very much. It looks like a true true pupil film made by someone with very little resources. . . and who did not pay much attention to detail. I don't want to go and continue with all the different ways that I find this film missing, but. . . well. . . I can't find (rememeber, I really believe that maybe it's ME that's an idiot here - it's not a film manufacturer - to not get "a piece of thinking mind"). . . I lost this for shock because the views were very appropriate. . Sheesh. . .
