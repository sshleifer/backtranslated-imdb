Where o where to begin to describe the deep destruction of the latest trial of Neil LaBute in film making? There are many types of film fans out there, but with a very sad and deep condition is Mr. Wonderful. You know Mr. wondering, aren't you? He is a colleague that no matter how stupid, blind, and without understanding the filming is, he says "Gee, I don't know why everyone hates it, I have found it cheerful." He is a kind of boy who finds the smell of a dog. Especially when he puts it in the shape of Hitler's mustache on his mouth and protests over the house that proclaims on the beauty of false science that shows well mounted on the mythology of Greek. She is also a young version of the Wicker Man was made. No one else could stand.
