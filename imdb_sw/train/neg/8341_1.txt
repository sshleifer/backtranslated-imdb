I love awesome movies. I can even know many cheese (dealing with them, 9 of the 10 most horrible films today are cheese), but this was just ridiculous. Poor actors, horrible text, characters and unbelievers (no actors of Meisner here!) And the general lack of body count. I would like SALVAGE 79 minutes of my life just disappeared. Of course the Crook brothers are called aptly. The only thing on the whole film was to look at Alicia Silverstone want-be punched in the face. How this EVER made for Sundance is quite competing with me. Most of the plot was quite untrue, even with the film's slasher standards. I mean, Come! Who could run to get the cheapest 10 seconds after the creepy boy just left them? Lame.
