Hi, It may be because it's not the main Theater or modern viewer of the film ... I think this movie is "Boring" and "Kibamba". I took this video because of Charles Bronson and the title ... but the boy is wasting time ... just looking at 2 guys sitting in the vault and talking ... <br /> <br /> Movie on this DVD was so "DARK" ... I had a hard time watching a movie of darn ... I realize it's a movie 1968 ... but they are put on a DVD then they should do some digital remastering. Also, I was quite surprised to look at these high points on the IMDb for this film ... as I said before I did not like modern like other people who said this film earlier.
