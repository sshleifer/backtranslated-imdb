I have seen recently in the Palm Springs International Film 2009. This is the beginning of the long guide of the former Dutch actor Monique van de Ven and according to my inquiry must be the last. I hate movies that are not so much available that you take away almost every area. This film immediately leaves your head straight. as a young photographer and his partner who works for an international aid organization is having a recreational vehicle through the regulated hills by the Taliban Afghanistan as they talk about their love when the rocket catches the truck before them. They come out of their car to look like Talliban fighters armed with rocket weapons, machine guns, guns, handguns and bombs to carry out all five people in the truck. Bob (Waldemar Torenstra) begins to take a picture of all of this when he is seen by one of the fighters who beat their grenade hand to kill his girlfriend. since they have a hand to hand a hand can not be more than 50 wards but still somehow gets away. Her girl is buffeted and takes a picture of the time of the grenade effect that kills him and winning awards as a year photographer for photography. Each area and situation in this film is as ridiculous as it opens. The following year Bob finds himself in the National Geographic work on the Dutch island where he meets Kathleen (Sophie Hilbrand) and jewelry in his under-traditional herbal medicine. Avoid this film. I would like to give them 4.0 out of 10.
