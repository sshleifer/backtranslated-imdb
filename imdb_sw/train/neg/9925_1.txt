This was on the 30th anniversary of the Saddles of Fire, of itself, but not. There was no place where I saw the name of Mel Brook here and I can guess, why she is so clever to be involved in this attempt. My way, who could get this funny. Surely there may be a contest competition but for me it was not just interesting, because it causes not funny. It's like the authors did not even try to be funny, just for money to be bound by strict Saddles. What? They expected this show to go for several seasons when they did this attempt? They went out, they didn't care. It was a quick cash cow that thanked God for no money. I think it's important for historical purposes only, or just to show how stupid and unresponsive Hollywood writers can be.
