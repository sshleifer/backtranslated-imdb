All I can say is that I am happy that I was making socks when I watched movies, or I would be very angry because I lost two hours of my life. Acting was bad, the plot was worse. There were cases that were meant to be bad that had my husband and I laugh loudly. I highly recommend this film for people who like to make their MST3K version.
