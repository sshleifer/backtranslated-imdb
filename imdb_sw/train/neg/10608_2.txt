I don't think any Van Damme movie will ever beat Universal's soldiers but you never know. This movie was good but not as good as 1. VD returns Luc & must see war again. Tries 2 b funny here but maybe it has a smirk value of chuckle. VD has a child this time from Ally W., good showed their pic. VD & Goldberg had a good fight. It was the end as 1 but not just good. VD works best in its work, like always-HELICOPTER KICK. However, the end should be long. However, it is worth seeing but it will not be on the original.
