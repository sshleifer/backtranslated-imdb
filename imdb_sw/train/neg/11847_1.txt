I am amazed at how bad this film is. If the pastiche of the past 20th century Hollywood Hollywood puts a new low - even back to modern contemporary or (gasp) Is Rock and I never thought I would like to see the films worse than those. & period. However, the purpose and results were similar to the problem. <br /> <br /> First there is a terrible horror: Eddie Izzard as CHAPLIN? Sorry? Peter, did you owe this man? Jennifer Tilly as Loulla Parsons? Kirsten Dunst as Marion Davies ??? Holy smoke, these people do not even try to capture the appearance or the sound of the time they are considered. <br /> <br /> Well, Image File was a good film, but this is a tragedy & some of the pictures of Bogdonovitch were not much better. I think attacking against Welles & Hitch & Ford dressed long ago. It is still good to invite TCM though.
