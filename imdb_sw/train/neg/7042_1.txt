This should be one of the worst movies made. Even with the movie biker, it's rock down. A small way involves a group of bicycles taking a small town (how original!) And the people of the city's fight to fight them. Why don't they call outside help? Who knows? Combat events are obviously fake. Adam West and Tina Louise are in it but they all have little to do and all look embarrassing to be there (understandable) this movie is in the trash pot!
