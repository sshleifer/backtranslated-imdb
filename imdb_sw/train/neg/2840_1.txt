Two former partners are sent to Japan to find the results of a genetic study with a videotape, which has been stolen by black ninjas at the beginning of the movie. First they should learn some ninja skills, because the "only ninja can hit the ninja." <br /> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> The killers of Sakura try to have fun-flick fun but they are very defeated. The whole movie is so poetry and predictable that it is difficult to say anything good about it: Same plot has been shown in different variations several times before, the characters are also very much offered, the direction is lighter and the script does not give anything surprising, even in the last area, which itself has decreased the value of the movie (trash). Even the ninja-flick-fan of 80, who understands the esthetic of litter movies, is difficult to get this film even though it is not very good. It does not give anything new to the viewer, nor to the level of the missiles or in the plot. Shurikens are cured by katana blowing, but not enough to guide the direction of the film means that you have to repeat the same number of fighting offs even the lost viewer after the first 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to recommend movies to anyone. Even the effectiveness of Franco Nero in "Enter Ninja" is located behind the Sakura-ninjas. Even in the film's level of knives does not have any balls and it is wasting time to try to find any major fighting events in this film: Nothing. For all, one of the ninja-flicks is useless, I've ever seen. It doesn't matter to curiosity. Believe me on this. It is about 10%.
