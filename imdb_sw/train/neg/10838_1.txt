The minute you fear 'art art' 1/10, you have people who come out with your blood, you don't know, half-ass, modern blood. I do not try and verify how I am not delicious to delight in mentioning all the art movies of the art I have loved or mentioned how I gave some of the "classic cult" 10/10. All I ask is that someone tells me something, purpose and message of this film. Here's how I can reflect on the film: The opening meeting of the three unrelated city-city stories indicating the incredible level of co-events. This is followed by (in short, to save the pain 3) the following - Children of children who die of lung cancer are trying to interact with her urine daughter, who may or may not be raped when she was a child, and who is beaten by an officer The striking police and relationship issues, when the star star star decides that they do not want to be a child of the failure of the child, eventually that has found another game of the game Merchants from 60 years, which we now see homosexual unemployed and bartender and braces and need money for 'oral surgery', when a sports producer, who dies to lung cancer, asks her male nurse to help she divorces a child who has wanted many years ago, and who has eventually become a humanitarian helper , even if the second producer of the Producer of the Producer was convicted of deceiving the deceased person; and oh, finally, it gets wet (you read correctly). And I listen to you for a long and insignificant time, for everyone who seems to be a runner who seems to fly with any sound or for another reason, perhaps, to ensure that the film passes 3 hours and is considered to be 'modern epic'. You probably think that I could do a better job of shortening the movie (and on the other hand not mixing) if I had written something bigger, maybe in a few sentences instead of just one ... Well, now you know how I feel.
