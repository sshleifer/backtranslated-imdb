This is a film about how people think women think about love. No woman tells you to meet one night of sex and to tell a story of love. <br /> <br /> Out of ten monologues I saw that only three we had any kind of truth rings to them. I continued to wait for the film to be better, and it did little, but never enough. This is a fascinating concept, and I continued to want it to be good, but never succeeded. Maybe if you really liked the story it would work.
