I love a good film of war and I fall in "being there, I have done that" society. So I would like to think my opinion is correct (IMHO). After watching this film on DVD I can safely say that it was a bunch of trash. There is no way I can recommend this film to you. <br /> <br /> Started with me screaming on TV saying "you can't do it" etc ... but recently I found that having a bit of work experience would be a barrier so I chilled a bit. But in the opening area when the wheel of the trailer fell I got a bad feeling that this film would be dud predictable ... I was right. There was no logic in EOD events. I only know that the army team had some of the most attacking patients ever at times of wire command or remote trigger. To a large extent I was left to stretch my head all the time. Then just when you think you know where the story goes to Humvee's boys have left themselves to the desert. One of the most important properties in the outdoor playground for jolly in certain SAS contractors. <br /> <br /> The sniper section was very interesting. It didn't make sense and made me to change it and then. Then they drove out for a long time they really tried my patience. It started with "Contact Right" and fall the hill quickly. If you had a feeling of Brit was shot but if you were part of the EOD team then you were suddenly a big shot and keeping a day. Then as you think it was about it was extended for a long period of time without adding anything to the story at all. You have left to look and ask why you haven't finished yet? Then we had a booze area where they just attacked with laughter. Another area where you just want to end. It didn't add anything to the film. <br /> <br /> Then as my life seemed to be lighter the main star went out of the wire to hunt someone down. This is the most ridiculous part I have ever seen. It rejected all the logic and ability to write a good storyline ... it was useless and bad. I still don't understand why they lost time on it. Then looking at the cock just through the road leading back to the camp I was blowing the floor with laughter. Scrapbooking: :) /> <br /> The sad reality is that this story is all about the show without actually determining what it wants to be. I thought it would be a stupid stupidity of EOD events but then went on to tangents trying to be different. But as hard as he tried, it just hurt me to die. All I wanted was the last. It was a rough collection of stupid events mixed in a group of scenes, stupid, action (ish). <br /> <br /> There is no way I can recommend this. Maybe my work experience has affected the fun but even the ignorant should realize this is not meant. The most stupid thing than this film is the highest level of IMDb ... which should work on the 24/7 office of the PR team's team that seem to use this site as a way to make everyone think it is good. Sorry people ... it's not just! It is not recommended ... will only promote it.
