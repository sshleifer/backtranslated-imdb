Despite having an exciting (and surprising) collection, NBTN is never available. There are explosives, hacking, suicide killings, including body parts, and all kinds of strange / horrible events, but are included with extended periods. Everyone in the movie looks tired. This is embarrassing because most of the series will be considered during this show. <br /> <br /> Add here the "right" Brit characters and you feel like you have fallen into Sherlock Movie of Holmes. <br /> <br /> Finally, the movie is very common. There are many opportunities for good shots in the country, or the shots of a man who has been beaten on the big bonfire, but the whole thing is unthinkable and inappropriate. <br /> <br /> Surely just for Lee and Cushing fans.
