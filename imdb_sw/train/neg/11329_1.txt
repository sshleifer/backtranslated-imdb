Elizabeth Taylor could never act and she was just her usual annoying, self-emerging in this film. This was before the volume of oil but still looked very short and had dumpy. The Hudson Rock was similar to Bick Benedict but it was the best actor who had more than William Holden's best. James Dean certainly confirmed that he knew how to delete his way through the movie. The whole film is very slow and it lasts a long time. All the workers were very young and humble and none of them were the most influential for making poor. Hudson appeared to be just ridiculous to be beaten out by Dean and Carroll Baker were clearly the same age. 0 /.
