I grew up scooby (kinda re-runs where it was) I hate scrappy, love daphne, and feel it is not perfect and out the whole group. But this is a sad, scooby doo is a secret to solve comedy - not quite a bad spy of anime jap. I love "what new", they had to give a daphne training at another time :( and try to lose * the joke of a great generation of drugs, but this "get a clue" is flat out of the crap and shouldn't have Scooby's name connected. even to do something blind with the theme of the theme. Now I'm going to watch my scooby doo DVD where you should wash the dirt of this new series from my eyes
