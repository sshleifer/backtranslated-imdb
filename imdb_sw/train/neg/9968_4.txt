As an old teacher (!) I must allow the intervention of many events - 'though I have kept looking at the end. I wonder why? (Silence, perhaps?) :-) <br /> <br /> The opening opening events hit me as a strange and uncovered mix. The program also, though there were good ideas - the aid of the aid teacher, for example - did not have enough scope in any direction for the 3-D development. <br /> <br /> Not one of Mr Nolte's best time. Like the little Mr Macchio, does he say so for * every movie * <br /> <br /> Plot with a aside aside complaint, hair styles alone was a nostalgic journey (like nausea). <br /> <br />
