This really should deserve "O" rating, or even ten negative. I watched this show for many years, and the show skipped the shark next to the 7th series. This section, however, is evidence that the show has jumped shark. It's writing is lazy, angry, defensive and even inappropriate even as garbage as Beavis and Butthead. It is possible to be ignorant and still be happy - Pirates of the Caribbean, Mummy, Monte Cristo Counter - all "fun" movies that should not be taken seriously. However, there is something like cunning as "this is the worst thing I have ever seen." And in fact, this is the worst part of Stargate I've ever seen. It is quite awesome, and this comes from a stargate man on his floor. <br /> <br /> He makes me want to sell my stargate periods, seriously.
