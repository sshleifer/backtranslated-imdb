I see that many people who think this film says the truth was not born before they were born (1969-1972), or not enough to know them. I think it's very easy to interview a historical event if you didn't live that way. I was a boy at Apollo, but I was old enough to understand what's going on. The whole world was followed for a month walk. Our families gathered around the TV to watch the launch. Newspaper headlines screamed soon - every day, from launch to landing, from month to month, through all means of spreading, in many languages. At school, some classes were deleted so that we could watch major events on TV. At Apollo 13 the world prayed and held his collective breath as men lost home at an uncertain condition. You can't go anywhere without someone asking what was the latest. The world was really one society. Now for a 30-year-old odd buffer after reality, it is easy to claim fraud because the world interest and interests have died. We are left with the history of our history, and anyone can claim that history is correct and try to "prove" to a false group and the fact that you have made when you completely ignore the lack of evidence that shows otherwise - not to mention the evidence that he lives in the spirit and memories of those who lived through these wonderful and wonderful days.
