had a good bits of poetry but it's really just an art-fartsy throw-together with no direction or resolution. How do these people get through the film school? Who gives them money to make this trick? it would be much more, a good actor to lead, and I always like Fairuza Balk, but come up, a rock-looking view just to quickly get nothing exhausted, and certainly not good film. The director needs to go and live a good long life and not return to the camera until they have something to say. this is like a throwing-of-the-wall art of making decisions, just juxtapose a group of hard pictures and hope hoping hope like hell that poetry is happening. which can work, if the director has any kind of vision, or has a brain who knows when the possibilities exist, but here's just a chance to fill, without results. I felt during a sluggish coming before knocking, and he was shouting "you lazy bastard" on the screen when the estimates went out.
