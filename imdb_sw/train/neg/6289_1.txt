This is the best player and the worst comedy I ever seen. Each area is a worthy cringe with two leading administrators - Corey and Danny are soo annoying. Corey is dumb and non-naive and should never hear Danny's false promises. Neve Campbell and killer from the Community Community are the only features of liberation in this non-film attempt. Danny (Dean Paras) appears in the last three years and the girl tries to sleep - Corey looks like she still has a college. <br /> Here in Australia, this film is called Too Smooth; there is nothing that causes this film at all. 1/10 Avoid
