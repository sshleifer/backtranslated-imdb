I saw this movie in New York City. I was waiting for the next morning, so it was 2 or 3 in the morning. It was rainy, and didn't want to wait on PORT AUTHORTY. So I went to the street and saw the worst film of my life. It was so bad, that I chose to stay and see the whole movie, I haven't seen anything wrong since. That year was 69, so call me. I just stayed because I couldn't do it .........
