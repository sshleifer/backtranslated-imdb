At the first right, we are brought to the world where they arewolves and framed. The program in the film made sense; The television writer examines this and tries to erase the truth. He ends up killing many of them including his girlfriend who is one. Then he shows the world that they are changing on a live TV. Special effects were only interesting in the first movie and are not available more in this. If the change or bad puppets or cheesy graphics display superpowers. <br /> <br /> The plot line is not all bad; they should kill the leader of waswolves for some reason. This will not destroy all thewwts and actually does not end the threat from the waswolves as ... just love to kill him. I think there was a reason for clouds for this but actually disappeared in the film. After the film "finished" we have a 10-minute movie of the film we watched and every other area is one of the female's female whistle has come out on her breasts while her port of Devo-esquire attracts many people . The only thing that makes this film even to be seen is Christopher Lee.
