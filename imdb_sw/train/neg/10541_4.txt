I wrote a few notes here on the First Power, Lou Lambada Diamond Phillips' 1990s killers, yuppie hell ... 1) Lou Diamond Phillips was recently charged with beating his wife and can be used in prison. I only hope that he can get to Armani prison to go in style and: One of the smell of this film sees his detective police wearing an attractive $ 4500 dress, a silk suite of $ 7300, and see Los Angeles $ 3500 / month College of loft pad and interior design with Mies Van Der Roeh. 2) The Tracey Phillips woman has a reddish purple skin, which comes in red hair which looks apparently woven, and an amazing breast planned in the second half of the film and the silk-maker that is sadly retains its place on its torso even when he was being prepared for a sacrifice to Satan. No doubt after the 1970s our killers of demons emphasized their victims before removing them, although there is something to say about a little departure. For the last 10 minutes of all the movie that I could think of what her breast would probably look like. <br /> 3) Psychocs Professional living in Los Angeles can afford $ 4,000,000 condos for Mullholland Drive towards Los Angeles for views that would make Brad Pitt decide that he was against. In fact, the condom used in this film looks similar to the same visible in the MULLHOLLAND DR David David Lynch, which at least had a good sense of making a condom participating in the successful film director. The only professional Psychics I met out of this film is now serving a prison sentence for wire fraud. <br /> 4) I forgot his name but man in this movie is amazing, and "What's going on", Buddy Boy? " The line could be the best words to be ignored by the film since "THANKS FOR RIDE, LADY !!" from CREEPSHOW 2. <br /> 5) Under the big cities of big cities there are large acidic measuring cups that will explode into huge fire if a person gives us a lightweight Zippo in it, that is the main reason for all water plants has no sign of smoking on them even though the idea of ​​smoking on the water is dangerous. water and lightweight that can leak and be inserted into clothes, the idea of ​​carrying one in your Gucci soccer bag of $ 7300 gets me as more dangerous. <br /> <br /> 6) Stunts in this movie are amazing to say The least, and one of the fun things to watch is still yourself that you are not looking at the computer helped special effects but stuntpeople real life risk and foot contribute to the movie's latest BOMB data from for critics during the opening. 7) The filmmakers always encourage: This is a boy who has hit Luciferian's efforts with power, but instead of using it to do something useful like pretending to be rich or to lead fashion models to engage in free sex with him, rather it has women bag and drove out of people's rooms. Referring to which here is an immortal man, he can fly, and he can put into it the bodies of other people - but he still begs Lou Louise Phillips and fistfight the most common at the conclusion of the film, but has no good intention to stay Arnold Schwartzeneggar or Apollo Creed to ensure that he succeeds. <br /> <br /> And continue with ... To be viewed in the company of carefully selected friends while drinking beer. You will be happy for a long time if you refuse to decline the weight. <br /> <br /> 4/10
