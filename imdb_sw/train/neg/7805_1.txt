The first actress of the actress is usually something that one can afford - it is often the first job where the lack of film experience for everyone involved shows, and this film is not different. <br /> <br /> But worse than that, even with 1982 rates are so bad, it's funny hysterically. Completely published in the Chicago area on a clear budget, most of the acting and cast whole are hard, wood, and cartoonish - cross between playing high school and a bad sports hall. From the nearest traffic often exhaust the discussion, and the discussion is very serious, very broadly in a way that comes out and forced rather than natural and organic. Exhibitions appear and appear, and even though the characters pass through for years, neither children nor adults do not find them at all. I believe it is possible to make a Christian film suitable for a large, non-secular audience, but often the creators of these films focus on 'Messages' or in this case, their own biological relationships for the project that good values The film production is cast aside. (I am sure it is not unfortunate that the main character has the same name as producer / director / editor - with a beaten member.) Luckily, Michael Madsen was more attractive - and reliable - to look at his next films. His work is certainly not built on a film like this.
