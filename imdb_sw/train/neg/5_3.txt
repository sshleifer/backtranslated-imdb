I have been skimmed through the movie but just enough to look at the field was over. To tell you the truth was horrible to me and in a certain place he had no meaning. The only reason I watched this film was first to see CHACE CRAWFORD !!! She is very bright, but in this movie her hair was amazing. But it's still hot. However, despite how CHACE of the fire, it was not done for the film. I think the plot is not bad but what has sent me is the fact that they say like every sentence. What? It is difficult to describe your anger without saying F at any time? The collision was angry with all the flashy, the camera trembled something he gave me a head. All of them, although the plot was the same, I have found the film to be productive and very high. That's why I just hit on the photo and CHACE in it. LOL Anyways, it is not worth the lease unless your fan of die-counseling member was beaten as I was. Oh, cast was Fire. Girls were HOT !!! But CHACE is BEST !!
