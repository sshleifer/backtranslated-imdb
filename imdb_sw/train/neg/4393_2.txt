I didn't like to return to Frosty with this. The two films are wonderful and unencrypted. The voice could be made but Frosty turns worse than this because the net snowman triggered. Frosty's winterwonder land was good and so it was originally to stimulate the heart Drama. The only thing on this film was Frosty girl of snow was the same as the classic 60s and funny line as they were talking about things that were not true and then Frosty walks with a humming window, defending whatever she was doing but everything else was written badly and very badly and I never found a plot. I saw the DVD cover on the library about 2 or 3 years ago and the art seemed very bad so I did not get it up this year because the back images have been seen a little bit but I played this film. It was the worst trouble of artists such as DVD and it was just awesome on what's going on. I watched this night and found that I slept on the whole thing (Waiting I always do it when I look at something when I go to sleep) But this movie was boring in general <br /> <br /> Total rating: Grade -C <br> /> <br /> This is like another special holiday to abolish badly in the return of frosty with this. This is a bad bone of 4 as Home only 4 well I thought that the movie was the same but the house alone 3 was good. But it's just a bad house only 3 and 4 people hate like this. My sister did not look for the same amount because she came into my room to see 2 and a half minutes, she left as "I hate animation!" I agree with him as returning to the Frosty of 3. Very bad!
