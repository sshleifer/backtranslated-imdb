If at least the violence and death had a purpose of the story to justify their inclusion but the script was not only incomprehensible and stupid. It didn't go anywhere, the story did not continue. It was a group of scenes that were uncertain and the end of stupid was done as saying. "End * beep * you my opponents and my few defenders to look at my trash." I do not give, a masked murderer who did not have his prison in jail, prison rape that you thought would be guarding the killer of a brutal killer and killed by him and anything else? there is no clarity, no penalty, the very bad habit of the copi squad that was losing the actor like Pare, who did not try to release the man killed by his soldiers, kidnapped a child, woman and dog and sent them to you to watch on the video. Cops who for an unknown reason all walked away from the dark and themselves (self) in his farm house at night as a group of young unsuspecting characters being executed directly as a militant group, and no one else hears hearing them die in one dark after another and continue to walk because no one is killed by his side. The group of real life events of natural animals for the first time because there is no explanation or explanation, was recalled, was looking at the wedding, was to please her ... what was it? Nope Boll just thought to throw in the disturbing animal lovers. Then you can believe the psychological path to allow his family to go if he commits suicide ... more, the stupid fool who has never seen in the film. I'm trying for why I don't try to hate his work. I am trying to find some reason to explain the art of fearful writers but these things ... clean. What is Boll doing again? I hope to know them because I know so many eligible people who can't expect to get a budget too often to make their movies. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a really boll to look for him the best "Postal" was the same right.
