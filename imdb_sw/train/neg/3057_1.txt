While "Santa Claus Winning Martians" is often referred to as one of the worst films made, the Mexican film made in 1959 is "making the SCCM" looks like "It's a Wonderful Life." You need to ask yourself what people who did this film were thinking about; they probably meant that it is the third example of the world about capitalist desires and open use. And. . . They were not very good. The production company made an even more amazing version of the "Little Hood Riding Hood" which is the inspiration of the wolf and our heroine has an abstract idea of ​​pedophilia. (Perhaps this was an inspiration of "Freeway.") Return to "Santa Claus": instead of the North Pole, Jolly Old Saint Nicholas stays satellite in geosynchronous world orbit (shades of "MST3K"); instead of elves his fingers are made by children chosen from all over the world; and had a modern spy equipment to detect only children who are naughty and beautiful. The result is like an outdoor sweater of Orwellian. It's enough to stop Christmas forever. This film and other Mexican children's films were known in English and are widely distributed in the United States in the early 1960s; it is not surprising for sixty years it was a difficult time in American history. Boomers children who have had to endure these "family" films as children will have a strong desire to return to the revolution.
