It is a very good production, can give one dream with headaches. It is an unsightly combination of live action with a bad motion of motion-motion. It's wonderful, but it's not a kind of fun, a wonderful journey that anyone can expect. It is cold, non-human, unpleasant, heartwarming, even an interesting kind of weird. There is no reason to watch this film. After all, Disney did a wonderful job with source material. And Hall-Cosgrove made the most attractive things and a stop motion. Marvelous, this is a French production. Therefore, it reiterates the stereotypes that the French do not have to be intimidating.
