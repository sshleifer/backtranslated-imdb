I saw that this is a total destruction of time, effort and money. I know Disney always reflects the lack of creativity when making the film "automatic-video" - but adjusting the original plot of the original "new look" is at all low ... soon they will just re- give original movies and new animation and new songs and call it "a new version of all the movies we love." Nathan Lane returns to his amazing position of Timon again. Timon and Pumbaa live animals from the original world "King of the Lion" begins the story of the story to tell us the original story how it really is ... as they see it. <br /> <br /> Of course Timon is now a legendary hero, yadda yadda yadda, blah blah blah. Sound talents are amazing for video content, but again, it was the last time you remember Matthew Broderick, Whoopi Goldberg or Nathan Lane to be in any of the real commercial substances? In general if you loved nature you would like this. It is insulting because it is right for children and adults alike. And that's about the summary it up.
