Only redemption was a small part of Larry Miller. It seemed that the movie was trying very hard to be "Something About Mary," but I had never had that film and it has not yet decreased to that level. Paul who was playing Paul was good, but Selma Blair was stuck in the ignorance of his Cruel abilities. James Brolin was good, but his father Paul seemed like he was trying very hard to be Randy Quaid character from the National Lampoon's Vacation movie.
