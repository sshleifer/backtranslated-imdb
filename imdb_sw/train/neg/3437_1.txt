I saw this film yesterday. I must accept, it was not my cup of tea. Although it should be a terrible movie of its kind. But when I was looking at this, I thought. 'This movie is not good at all.' Where did two of them go where they left the girls behind? Where did the shark come from? <br /> <br /> All these things in this film somehow did not add. I felt like these filmmakers had lost time and money on a film that was closed so sharp. <br /> <br /> I have seen many awesome movies in my time, but this is one of the worst worst of flicks I've seen. At the end of the film, I told myself that I could not look at it again. Count it on this! 0 out of 10!
