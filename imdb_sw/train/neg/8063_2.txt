I anticipated various movies of Sci-fi and exciting forms during the summer but I was desperate for this film. While other people were leaving the film, I decided to stay, just laugh together with the rest of the movie movie in acting, lack of doubt, the end of ignorance and hard to follow the story line. I found myself almost as confused as the main character in the film. The only way of liberation of the film was the sound of the voice. This is one of the star star films that do later. By going back, I could not even rent this, then only pay more than 5 dollars to see.
