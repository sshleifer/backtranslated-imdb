"Steve" (Chris Hoffman) collects a group from high school for reunification in the cabin area where Wes's cock twin lost. When they were there, the human being had a human shape (reminded me of a lot of Gillman from CREATURE FROM BLACK LAGOON) waiting in the desert when choosing the best time to take each one. Biker, Ellen Ripley-time female bad goats, Kat (Chase Masterson) has a military underground striker he tries to experiment, while also serves as a safe place from something on the blood rampage. Kat knows more than he tells (he also lost a child), but there is another desire for the majority of the group's not knowing. This creature can only be more human than they realize .. and the old identity can give light on only one deception that has hidden since the death of Wes. Kat has a key of many secrets that open as a group approaches the cabin. Thank you, much of the film stays away from a flying creature in the air when we see also hazy screen when we look through its eyes. Film has Dawson's Creek kind of melodramatics which often prevents any real tension that requires you to build in a little monster movie. The direction is very bland leading to improper experience rather than encouraging. Casting rather than unhappy life. Pretty Maggie Grace (Fake remake) can be just a draw for this film.
