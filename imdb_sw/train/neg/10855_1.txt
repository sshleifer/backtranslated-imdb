Surely this is one comedy I'm not likely to forget for a while. <br /> <br /> Isn't it common to pull a comment on this movie: it's so small that no one would look at it, but if it happens, it's a kind of popularity in p2p sharing networks like Kazaa, and so this production The clock you need to be exposed to. What is it then? Well, of course not a real comedy; instead, it focuses on as a flick of fear - "the goal" to be the most important word here. Script is an odd and incompatible mess, special effects are special because they are particularly concerned, and if acting, well, let's just say that if this was a play for me at primary school, my teachers could have started crying for our talent. In fact I realize that this is a very low budget film and that in those cases a person should decrease the expectations of a person, certainly as things like special effects are concerned. Also, although I am a big fan of fear, I know that these movies are only rare places to watch interesting texts and acting acting. <br /> <br /> But still. <Br /> <br /> B-movies have other features of liberation due to lack of money, like humor. Just laughing at the Cradle for the horror of lies in ridiculous displays. If you can find humor in it - and I could have done for the first 20 minutes or so, a little step by step after that - then that would be the only thing that the film will give. Oh, that's two or three pairs of breast. <br /> <br /> Woohoo, it's exciting. For this information, however, it does not attempt to achieve anything: victims use drugs and / or are involved in serious crimes. Lesson: Look, innocent boys and girls, because one day you will be paid for what you did. <br /> <br /> I rest my case. <br /> <br />, all for all, a bit of sex, the amount of drugs, but quite zero rock 'n roll. <br /> <br /> I tested this 1 out of 10, but it would go to 0 if I could. Or maybe I don't want: it is worth 1 for spelling executives correctly in names. I mean, that's something, sure?
