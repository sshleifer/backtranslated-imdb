I realize several Ben Stiller movies come out or will come out this year, but maybe he should insist on quality, not much. I was troubled by what the film vendors thought they liked to comedy in "Came Polly." Stertick continues to get bitter. Certainly he has a comic talent, but he needs to either get another schtick or take a break, get the material that is really funny. Because his movies come from the pain of the evil. It is a complete chemistry between Stiller and Jennifer Aniston, which is a shame because she is a good, intelligent and good actress. For a long time making more movies like "Beautiful Girl" (where she is bright) and down as "Came Polly," she will have a job that she could brag. Aniston tries to conquer the contraceptive devices that he works, but it is a terrible job for any actor. Except for a short time by Alec Baldwin, as the master of Reuben Stan, and Philip Seymour Hoffman, as the best Friend of Reuben, there is nothing surprising in this bad film. Other helpful links, including Debra Messing as Lisa and Hank Azaria as Claude, are very angry. Azaria's inspiration is not just stupid, not absolutely necessary. <br /> <br /> Column "Joint Come Polly" certainly showed a promise. Unfortunately, it needed a writer who could make it a good comedy, instead of this shade, bad, excuse excuse for comedy.
