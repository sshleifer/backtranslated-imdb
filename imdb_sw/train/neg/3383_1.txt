I first saw the music in the Denver Center for the Art Gallery and was very intelligent, surprising and had an amazing development of the plot and discussions that I liked more than many music that I have seen in action. The interesting thing is that you never found the face of Zach. He was always in the dark but his presence was strong and guided the direction of the whole production. When I heard it they were making a film from them, waiting for a bated breath, but when I watched the film version I was very distressed and I felt suspected. The film does not have an impressive effect on the production of life and did not make it close to every character. Personally, I would like to see a live version of it again and if it should be raised again, I would like to recommend it wholeheartedly to go your way to see it. It will be one of the most memorable experiences you enjoy.
