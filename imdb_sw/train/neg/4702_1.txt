I love this film. I hate the show. I hate almost everything about it. it's so angry and stupid. everyone saying that nat and alex Wolff are heroes in the world of music and that they will be great. What kind of bandages do you make? !!! !!!!!!! nat and alex will go live if hobo or end like Jane Hudson from "Something happened to Baby Jane?". I could only get even 20 minutes of this, just 30 seconds of show, and I could live about half an hour of 'Band War'. How anyone can enjoy these in the audience on the Kid Choir Award, has no clue. The day before the film on Nick, many of the young girls in Nick (Jamie Spears, Emma Roberts, Lindsey Shaw, etc.) were shown in a business that affects children with intelligence and the dead about how naturally and alex wolff. first, they had no deception, and second of all, nat and alex perhaps hurt them or paid them a lot of money to say so and a persuasive voice, because I don't see how anyone can get this show / entertainment movies. The music is very bad. The singing of nat looks like a patient, dying at the crack. alex is the worst character of the movie / TV show EVER. she is not funny, she is annoying, she is really weird, and she thinks she is hot and knows everything about girls. The luck of this man as he can stand. you know this show is fake when you know that some characters (in real life) even exist !! Jesse character is actually played by Nat and Alex's cousse Draper (must have a budget problem). Their father is not one, married to Polly Draper, but he does not appear on the show, making it appear to be Wolff's mother. Rosalina does not exist. His name is Allie DiMeco. I will tell you, Brother Naked will have a deep sh ** when "fans" they know the whole thing has been done. 0/10
