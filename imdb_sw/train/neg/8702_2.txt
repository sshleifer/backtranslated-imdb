This is one of the most unfamiliar movies I ever had! I had to have this hope, after seeing the first two, but I continue to get into these types of movies and the idea of ​​"maybe they did it this time". Nope - even close. Where do I start? Does it include special effects ... To give you an idea of ​​what goes through the SFX in this film, when one soldier shot on "Raptor" as it passes down the hallway. Even in the second half of the screen, the viewer can see that it is the only person who has a tail that seems to be tied to him as he moves along. Bad bad bad. <br /> <br /> What about acting? If so, you can call it. There is one character which, I think, should be from the south. However, after living in the south for six years now, I have never heard this way of speaking. Perhaps he has some kind of disability - the inability to talk normally. I am glad that the behavior is not worth anything that needs to be that feeling - so there was no reason for the actor to try one. <br /> <br /> What! About the program? It is very important - Refugees fleeing, people with guns should evict them. I start to wonder why dinosaurs in these movies seem to get into the nearest system of tunnels ... they could stay out hunting prey? Oh well, at least they have a good feeling of very little appearance in a movie that seems to be spinning them. <br /> <br /> Other things - Let's say you are in the building and you know that there is someone eating raptors running around in it. Would you decide to take the time to have an argument about who is - Army or Marine? And then decide to have a hand competition to compete to solve it? What about the idiotic idea that they should track raptors - Divide up into two groups. Didn't watch any awesome movies (Or at least part of Scooby Doo)? In short, this is one of the dumber movies out there. Don't waste unless you want to rub your way through the movie.
