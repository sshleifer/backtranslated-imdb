I was amazed at the truth and alone in the darkness. It was so bad, I couldn't believe what I was seeing. There are no characters, only a few walking around and killed. The level of character development was to give each character a name and function, and that's about it. There was no real plot, and no characters seemed to have any incentive. In fact, many practical events started just for themselves, coming from anywhere and tracking techno technology. As I watched this film I kept asking "Where does this happen? What is happening?" Acting was the quality of the high school ceremony, and the delivery of tough wood, as though the actors were reading from the memory cards without understanding their lines. Their problem of giving the lines was made more obvious by the bad design of the voice. ADR looks like written in the open room. Pastors were taking care of the apparent touch of their mark, looking around the robotic in their movement. Therefore, these non-manual automatons have been reviewed through a series of unintended and mixed events, often without the benefits of transition events. They were here, now there. This was happening, now it happens. Typical events with little rhyme or reason. I was so happy to see it. Certainly not worth nine bucks though.
