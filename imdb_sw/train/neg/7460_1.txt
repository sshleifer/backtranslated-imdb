Corky Romano should be one of the jaws of dropping jaw and "terrible comedy" that have been made. <br /> <br /> While sometimes wondering Chris Kattan who removed a very good performance in the hilarious 'Undercover' character his character in Corky is stupid and so unacceptable - which is embarrassing since the premise is a good idea. They were bad when they reached the 3rd page on the script.
