The first ten minutes of "Watching" describe the direction of this film takes. Lenny (Ryan Merriman) is a 14-year-old boy who lived in New York in '50 years. He has a strong desire to see two people having sex. What? Who are the best people he has in mind? Yes, his mother and grandfather are true! How pleasing. Unfortunately for Lenny, she is caught up before seeing anything and sent for the summer to stay with her uncle and his uncle's wife. Lenny's second plan is to see his uncle and his wife to have sex. However, the wife is pregnant and they do not sleep together. Then Lenny makes a new friend. She and her friend spend most of their time around the girls. They have a little club where all they do is sit around talking about sex. The problem is ... it is not done in a non-flawless, beautiful way. This type of markup may work in the film as "Children" (1995) but in this film it just looks corrupted. Gretchen Mol has been completely destroyed here as Hedy, an old bra style that becomes something of Lenny's physical desires. Jason Alexander needs to stay away from the chairman of the possible director. "For Better or worse" (1996) was bad and now this. What is it. 1/10
