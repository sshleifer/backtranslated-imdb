Millie is an array. He has a wealthy brother named Maitland and a child. Then he takes him to deceive and separate him ... but he allows him to take care of the child he loves to love. Then at the beginning of the 1930s, he would have the right to a female partner and child support but enables an amazing boy to easily ... without help ... what sap! Later, when he has a partner and life looks very good, it turns out to be also a fraudulent! Wow, do you? He has difficulty picking men. As a result of this bad relationship, Millie changes. Now she is a wild party girl - doing everything she can to control herself from her hard fortune. Suddenly, many years pass. Millie's daughter who left early in the film is now 17 and the odd fashions have not changed a bit. An old friend of Millie (yes, another evil person!) Now she pretends to be a friend of a daughter, but she has good designs on her. Millie has promised that if she touches the girl, she will kill him. Take a guess of the wild what happens next! Overall, the film is a aggressive and unusual - such as "Madam X" but much, much anticipated. Millie's constant motivation and actions seem to have little meaning. And, the film seems to have a little bit of everything that was hit in it - as long as it proves the idea that all people are pigs. Usually but not very good.
