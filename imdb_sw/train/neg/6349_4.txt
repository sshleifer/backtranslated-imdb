Woo Allen has done some of the most elite ever and I will seriously consider that Annie Hall is the biggest movie ever but if I think too much about it I'll think of one or two that is better, but it will be hard. She has had some very bad but not bad films like Manhattan Murder Mystery and Sweet and Lowdown but she has never had a bad film like Melinda and Melinda. Not quite exhausted and so insufficient, his films are gifts and hilarious but how did this happen, still our good old Woody? This plan encompasses four friends who have dinner together. Two play authors and one of them says a wonderful story that happened to his friend. It is about a young woman who burst into an dinner party unexpectedly. We can't hear break because playing two starts to start discussing whether it could make the best comedy or problem. Rather we begin to see two aspects of perspective. All the center on this woman named Melinda who has both problems with drugs and with her former husband. In the tragedy he is a former family friend who after attempting suicide decided to show to his old friends the best door for no apparent reason. Comedy is about Melida who stumbles at the dinner party after 28 sleeps. They all go to the wild wind of incidents that are not appropriate to make or unite together, or make you laugh once or twice. There are some good performances with Radha Mitchell and Will Ferrell but they can't achieve together on their own. They did not give up more than many films this year.
