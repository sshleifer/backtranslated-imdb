Now, it's going to be some kind of picture if I've started with a little over the head, so I'll try on that. First, this movie makes me wonder why children do stupid things like walking around in the laboratory and breaking the bottle. Then I realized, this is a message with a message, the message is to beat children and things like this will not happen. Things like you ask? Items like a huge monster of growing insects causing a bit of violence before they die in the usual "kill monster directly" fashion. Now, as promised ... The Blue Monkey ... does not have a deep blue inside or any Simian of any kind. Now it's snot if I was hit or anything. The picture on the lid had a big bug / crab / idiot / something before hunting other nurses shouting. The squad came out but I wanted the apes! just because they enjoyed MONEY A few of the before (drinking half of Cask's and Creame's mind) I had a feeling of more than 80 tomatoes. If you like snow fibers or blue elements this film is not for you. If you would like bugs and good reasons for hitting children, this tax.
