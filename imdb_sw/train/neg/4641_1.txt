Sometimes they are proud of films .... those who often cause when people (even talented people) are together with good intentions to produce film and for any reason it turns into a catastrophe. Film as "Attack of Death Tomatoes", "The 9th Order from Outdoor websites", "Manos-Hands of Fate", and "Heavenly Heavens", etc.. So, when I heard that this film, "Attic Rachel", it was taken by many people to be one of the worst films of the decade, usually I had just seen. <br /> <br /> Boy, I am sad that the decision. This movie is the worst .... it's so bad that it is not recommended as a bad bad movie. Acting, cinematic, script, etc. is worse than the budget budget under budget: the voice is quite awesome, "conspiracy" completely unknown, "acting" is laughable .... it's a complete waste of everyone time and money. For the film's porno film has porn breaks the monotony, while this dream of ignorance has a guy to wipe the rotten apple, and the "hatter's" tea party. <br /> <br /> Lighting does not exist. Many "incidents" are happening in half or full darkness, which is also possible. "Author-director" (I use the words freely), David Tybor, tries to get kinky and incidents of slavery ... but the result will be laughable, if they were not so pathetic. There is some ignorance, but the quality of the worst situation that works as a gender barrier. I could continue forever and not do justice for all the mistakes and failures of real loss for the film. <br /> <br /> For the love of God, try to fall by train. I know that with (or maybe because of) my negative views, you can still be tempted to see if this piece of rubbish is as bad as I claim to be .... but I believe on this .... it's even worse than I said, and you will be quite impressed (at cost, you lose your money by buying or leasing).
