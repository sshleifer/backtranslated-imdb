The first in the series was brilliant, easily one of the best Horror films of all time. This is the worst. When I was down to look at this, I was thinking that the fourth and fifth was, this would be good after this terrible. The boy was wrong. Very wrong. When I was looking for the first ten minutes, I was tempted to wipe it out, but I thought no, maybe it would help. Not only did it. It is not just a fascinating film itself, it does not require another series, because the second (fourth and fifth) has already been awesome! Also, how can you return to Freddy? The acting in it was TERRIBLE, the line of the story was predictable and planned and was also guilty of it as well. The way Springwood made was very bad. Don't respect the very first. To add this thing, the whole thing has been seen to be top-up. Some people say that this film was "fun". This film is not "very interesting". Since when did Freddy Krueger think that "funny"? I would call it the funnily sharks. This film should be a Horror film, not a comedy. If Freddy had a daughter, did it not come as it was first? The latter was also just stupid and cheesy, especially like all others. This completely destroys the cell and the first one. It looks just over. The error that Wes Craven has created is a good thing at first, but it has to be cut down because of the trash on the bin. It should not be difficult even to make this film. Then any of the other sequels, except the third. The third is only one of the most respectable among all sequels. If this was a DVD itself and not a part of Nightmare at the Elm Street DVD that I found, I would like to delete it when I got it. Summary: Unforgettable and poor trial on the other hand. <br /> <br /> - MOCKERY full of first film <br /> <br /> Please, don't waste your time on this improper junk.
