Cheap and manipulative. This film has no heart. It also has a good discussion, non-faith and a story of pride, or rather it does not exist. It just happens worse in the stupid effort of moving some kind of emotion from senseless and non-threatening emotions! & HEDGEHOG !!!! What? How many films can be beaten? Hedgehog, by the way, provided the most interesting and affordable performance in this half-minute minute. If you have been considering watching this film, do not do it. Sorry but I can't find one feature of redemption on this film. It is a symbol of the great ZERO, fat and me. Especially for small wetters of Dogma. Yawneroony! <br /> <br /> However, if you liked Playing In Darkness ... <br /> <br />
