!!!!! Support enough !!!!! You think the story involving Archie Gray Owl - an Englishman signing as a red Indian - will have a huge amount of humor involved. In fact I say the only way to treat a film like this where a good person with a permanent public is treating it as a comedy. However Richard Attenborough does something similar to the crime by making GAY OWL great drama. Such a bad, he also made a very bad film. Pierce Brosnan do not have the required charisma for the role of the title and a romantic piece between Gray Owl and Pony (beaten by Annie Gaupeau of the same wooden) does not have any kind of screen chemistry. But be fair to give them not helped by the script that fails to show Archie as chappy cheeky he is to cheat everyone in believing he is American origin. The producers and screens have made a big mistake of having a movie center around Archie's problem with English - that's why I wrote "probable talent" not really revealed until the end of the film that the head of the head is English, but it is obvious everyone who watched this film knew that before that there was no surprise. I agree with everyone that the environment is interesting and has an ecological message that is not a new concept. Theodore Roosevelt is the first founder of the 20th century if it is really told. And also must be remembered that except SOYLENT GREEN (AND maybe TWO TWO if you want to write as having a green message) that there is no really a great film environment. In fact, most of the original conventional films are exclusively breastfeeding and include OWL of GRAY, a film that was not a big problem in finding a distributor
