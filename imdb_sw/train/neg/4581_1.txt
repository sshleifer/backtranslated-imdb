A fascinating attempt to use science to justify a new religion / philosophy. The two have nothing to do with each other and a lot of what it says about Quantum physics in this mess is quite clear. <br /> <br /> Examples? Theory theory helps the idea of ​​the eastern religions that the truth is deception. How? Well, in the world of subatomic, you can never predict the particle area at a certain time. You can only give the direction to be directly on one spot at the same time. Also, the observation act appears to affect the event. Powerful cells can pass the barriers. All this, so far, is correct. But then they say that this means that if you really believe that you can walk through the wall, you can do it. This is full of poppycock. Instead, the theory says that at our level, it is possible for you to walk through the wall, but it is only by chance and you are not connected to faith. You should also continue to walk into the wall for ever having even a far distance to pass the wall, the worst situation is so astronomical. This is just one example of how they mislead science. But more exciting is a story involving a happy photographer, played by Marlee Maitlan. About half of the photo is so confused that it doesn't understand. Something to do with evil ideas that lead to addiction and hate. There may be some truth in it, but Quantum physics has nothing to do with it. <br /> <br /> More, string theory is something new to fire in today's physics. Instead of wasting your time with this dreck, I give you a lease world of prestige, an amazing series made by NOVA on PBS which gives you a history of physics from Newton and influential for Ed Witten and M Theory in just 3 hours. The quantum experts are described there very well if you want to know without the fake of the metaphysical efficiency.
