I need to say - her stinker! (I gave the score 2) <br /> <br /> Look at you if you are experiencing sleep. There is a lot to chew the environment and strengthen it, but it doesn't otherwise happen in this movie. There is no doubt, no secret, horrible secrets revealed, no real threat to the well-being of the heroine. A little disagreement, raising a little bit - that's very good. The secret is not something that cannot happen to anyone - the last "secret" revealed in the film is quite possible for that action. The plan, as it is, involves a young woman named Imani (Meg Tilly), who is an artist, who is employed to draw a series of mural panels in a big house house in a big house with a very old woman, who was the widow, and the growing relationship of the mother / daughter-old woman longed for her. It turns out the daughter of an old woman, Cassandra, is dead. You can succeed all pieces pieces together. Even an incredible experience that the heroine feels is not going to go until you are so afraid of his safety more than a second or two. Why he still lives nearly years after Cassandra's death is a good question. There is also a question of the fact that in this great house there is only one servant, a faithful shepherd who seems to do everything - cooking, cleaning, serving food, answering door, etc.. Everything just seems to lock the door - for that's the only explanation of how one of the characters goes to the room where Faith is. Nothing you will be able to accept your weapons, and focus on the edge of your seat, because there is no "gravity" of the tension in this film - just bland, pathetic revelations that are regularly sold. <br /> <br />
