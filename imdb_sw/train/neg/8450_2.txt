What happens to ITV Friday. First, "Loss Gemma" is just a very bad television game that I have seen in years, and now "Perfect Parents" are perfect shambles from beginning to end. Anyone responsible for sending this shadow should receive P45 for special delivery. It is in the Drama / Thrillers many, the need to suspend certain levels of faith is necessary so that the plot line can develop, but the "Perfect Parents" took this to a new level, I stopped many faiths at the end of this nonsense I felt I had and power fed on the load of a "magic mushroom", it was like the authors decided to make and create a "Drama for a number" involving major issues - Religion, Education, Rumors, Mwoga, Kill, Paedophillia was the only problem as Eric Morecambe said during Playing the piano, "I play all the tips well, not just must indeed". For your Secondary Doctors, I beg you to try to read a few more books on script development than "Write a document for Dummies". From the script of ignorance and a great lack of tension in the direction, Acting was very important, not the act of the actors such as cast was a high score. But I advise that all participants involved in this piece of pole game should teach their agents sometimes the Postman tries to provide a script from the Department of Drama, make sure the mail letter is closed by closing!
