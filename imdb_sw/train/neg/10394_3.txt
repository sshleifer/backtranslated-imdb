For Knightly and O'Tool as it leads, this film had a good chance, and for McCallum as a bad person after Knightly, maybe some tension. But they threw all into the frill of the silly evening and then later with the remains of the battle of the maudlin. It was really true, a beautiful country of English and sea or not. One number of numbers was to throw Knightly so early in the film, when he could play one person over many years, rather than choosing someone of ten years to play part. They lacked all opportunities to have serious conflicts between the cast, and instead of being ridiculed for simple and cost-effective elements.
