Oh my, where to start ... this film was very bad. Writing was bad, the act was bad, special effects were bad. I think the only good thing about this movie is that it made me laugh! I had a funny movie but certainly didn't get it! I thought it would be good enough since I was not picky. I watched many awesome movies. In fact, it is my goal to see all the terrible movies, no matter how bad they may be. One time in the film I made a comment about the "blood of blood blood" and in special features they admit that it was Karo syrup (the name of the grain of syrup ...) Movie had all the necessary items for a terrible movie (blood, dirt, A brutal killer, a stupid step, but it was just completely missing anything to actually make it beautiful. The author should take some classes or just give!
