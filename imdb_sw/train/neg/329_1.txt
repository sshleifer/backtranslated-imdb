First: I bought it in a video store. Second: I looked at it. Third: It was boring. Fourth: It was not funny. Five: Many of the antics were lame. And last, but not the least: Not just a bad movie, it's a general fiasco. <br /> <br /> I am a great fan of Adam Sandler despite this desperate and forgotten film. I am sorry because it was his first movie. Even if you're a great fan of Adam Sandler, don't bother to watch this film. Instead, just take a video, get a yacht, and throw it on the board.
