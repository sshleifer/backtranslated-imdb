I joined this site to see the views that people can do about all these films. I was not even interested in the second. All characters were one-dimensional. They lost every topic they thought to hope for something else. I would bet (and hope) that everyone involved in Teachers looks back and shy. There are many executives here but you will never know. Thank God God did not destroy the work of Morgan Freeman or Judd Hirsh or Nick Nolte's work or the works of Laura Dern. There was no vision, no work of love here, just a terrible missions. BTW I don't think the author has ever put foot in real school.
