Not possible! This film gets 7 out of 0f 10. This should be one of the worst films I have seen in years. not just that work was very bad, the storyline (if you could call it) was very bad. Giving everyone knows what will happen within the first 5 minutes. That is not a bad thing if you can attract the audience when leading up to that time. That, however, is not. No action, no emphasis, even even sparks between 2 leading actors. Unfortunately it's wasting my time, and certainly losing my money. <br /> <br /> and 2 of just to try
