It can be destructive. I say so, but anyone who knows that this reading can think every field has turned right from the beginning. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie I liked. I did not hate you through other movies that calm your mind, but they all also felt predictable about its position at the right end of happiness. There were funny bits when making sure, but few were original. At least you didn't go to the gutter. Christina Applegate looks clean, and Ben Affleck works hard. Their events together are the only true redemption. Everyone else is a cutout card, including, surprising, James Gandolfini, who must do this as grace to the person. <br /> <br /> For all, it's free, but not inspiring, 90 minutes.
