I missed the beginning but I saw more. A friend found it on a DVD in a cheap room on FYE. <br /> <br /> All skits are very short, and yet many of them are still too long. Many of them, they seem to have forgotten to have something interesting! Most gender / gender / sex "sex" that lives in it, skits according to exhibitions, or skits that use color words for people. I try to remember anything I thought was strange in it, and I have trouble .... The Vision Network's Tunnel is a lipsticked mouth and eyeball in it. The mouth opens and closes the eye as a eyelid. The type of creepy. <br /> <br /> What desires. Many of the executives continued with good things, and this fortune was not prevented by the bomb.
