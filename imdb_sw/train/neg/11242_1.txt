I saw this film last month with a preview of sneak and I came out. It was very good. In a very trying process, they worked and made a fun film. I was shocked because I felt all the participants made decisive decisions in the past so this could not be too far from the mark - but, I was wrong. I was hoping to give you an interview at the end of the movie so I could tell them not to take this film. I was lost by a free preview feature, but it was a waste of my time - and, usually, I was very easy to hate. It tried to be creative and creative with shots, ideas and pictures, but because they gave us many ideas at once, failed. I don't usually choose about movies and I usually don't need to show my opinion about movies, but I was warning all people not to look at it. I registered on IMD just to tell you all
