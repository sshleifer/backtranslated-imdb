This movie should be selected for a new type: Full Mess! Except for a few bottles and one or two seconds of a year, this film is a complete waste of time. Call it "Campy" does not even cut. "Campy" means fun which this movie was not. You use the first half of the movie to think "Its to get better, right?". Rightly, it makes, at the end of the end where he finally explained who "team / sister" is what the team is and want but at that time, you can't take care of it because you have spent the second half of the movie wondering exactly what made Mr. Onorati and Mrs. Pacula should make anyone away from this by rejecting the bad film. <br /> <br />
