I am a great fan of Western but this one .... whew, what stinker! I think what opened me next to the bat was a inane dialog. I think I could write a better conversation than this when I was in the eighth grade. And poor actors! Due to this shocking conversation, none of them looked at you to look at anything except ignorance. True, I don't. Some of these are better than what you get in Ed Wood's film. <br /> <br /> The greatest tragedy is Sterling Hayden. It might have been a "big star" in this film which if you called B-West, you would like to make it a reputation on it. This is what is called B-minus West perhaps. Mr. Sterling Hayden, who appeared sometimes with Joan Crawford, Bette Davis, Frank Sinatra, and many other talents. For him to appear in this poor car must be something that he tried to decline throughout his life. Something else that you hear about this film is all men who look like they were not wearing a week and all their faces are greasy. I know in the West people were not well decorated but for this person is a movie that makes you just want to go 'EWWWW!' True, this is a Western crummy. Denver Pyle also had to live directly, especially after being seen in the West much too much. Bad, bad movie.
