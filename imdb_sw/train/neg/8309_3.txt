Certainly none of the old critics, many of whom praise the film for its accuracy, have been studying the biography of Louis Pasteur. In addition to good behavior - he was a stupid politician and hosting a "military military" who allowed France to be involved in a horrible battle, was not a stupid fool shown here. He had an intellectual interest in science, and as many others in the 19th century saw the future because of the improvements that he brought. After leaving Pasteur, he was his PATRON, he built a laboratory and gave him all the resources that he needed his research. When the laboratory was built, Pasteur became very sick. As a government official, deciding that it was wasting money to build a laboratory for someone who would soon die, he ordered the work to be suspended by his own authority. When the king heard this, his anger prompted the bureaucracy to be more likely to walk, and the work began again. The king himself visited Pasteur to comfort him and assure him that he would find his laboratory. The king would often bring the members of his court to please Pasteur's projects, and it was obvious to everyone that Pasteur was one of the great things of kings. nothing, and he was giving them work away from his previous experience. Pasteur, a very quick man, was opposed to this, but Napoleon could say that he had full faith in it, and Pasteur despite his surprise, always came through. They always had a close and friendly relationship, and after the King was overthrown, Pasteur refused to say a bad word about him, thanking until the end of his life. a daughter with a child, and Pasteur offering her principles to get a doctor, never did happen. Part about anthrax and rabies, which he was famous, is generally correct, but the idea that anthrax attempt has raised him from attention so that fame is a lie. He was known and honored at the time of his appearance.
