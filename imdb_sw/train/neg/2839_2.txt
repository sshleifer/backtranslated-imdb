One of these films is my favorite. It's not good any, but it's nice to laugh. The discussion can be very strange and inappropriate (for example, "Manji, can we ask you a few questions?" "Certainly." Make sure you look at Brock, a white white man who beat the main characters. She has only two lines, but she is one of the best people in the film!
