A common story of fear about a luxury building in Brooklyn that hides the gates of hell. It is remembered by the "Planner" of Polanski (released a year before "Sentinel"), but it is far from the film film film polish in any case possible. "Planner" was very worried, while "Servant" is not entirely. It is the most amazing thing from this film is cast: it is full of great movie titles of America (Burguess, Gardner, Wallach), former actors who make food (I think). <br /> <br /> Decision: not entertainment. My rate: 4/10
