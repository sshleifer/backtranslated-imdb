This film seems to be a series of movies that have been taken by the same subject in the past. Let the future viewer predict before that "Art Heist" does not add anything to that kind. Director Bryan Goeres has no explanation for what to do with the film. William Baldwin continues to appear in the film, and in fact, someone is wondering if he has a great agent, or is that directors and producers love the most common goofy look, have been suggested by this unusual hair he games in his many movies. The only beautiful movie that has been seen, is "Squid and Whale", where he speaks only two lines, or three. Ellen Pompeo, his leading wife, is not better; there is no chemistry between Ms Pompeo and Mr. Baldwin <br /> <br /> movie to appear for the risk of the viewer.
