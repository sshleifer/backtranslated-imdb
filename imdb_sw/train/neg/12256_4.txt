O God, I must have seen this when I had only 11 or twelve, (don't ask how) I was small, but I wasn't stupid. Anyone can see that this is a bad, ugly, grossly, unreliable and very stupid film. I have seen the most shocking results in Disneyland, I have seen the best performances in the school of play, and I have found the most interesting crocodile in the zoo, where they have nothing but to stay in the water, blowing the children blowing glass The story is put in northern Australia. Few of the proud, trying new games of water, scoring water filled with shark. Soon it becomes apparent that the most dangerous thing is in the water. After learning what they have, they find the help of a middle-aged grizzly fisherman, who wants to kill a pet to take revenge on his family's food. I think I've seen every film of crocodiles made last fifteen years, the best is Lake Placid, and the worst that is its good. The Blood chapter would be the second crossing of croc I think, with the Great and Crocodile playing back. The Saltwater River of Australia is one of the most dangerous creatures there, resulting in more than a hundred wounds or deaths every year. Films like blood Surf however are not just the destruction of the bad image of the creature, but the good hour and half the life of the viewer. Unless you really want to see, try Surf blood.
