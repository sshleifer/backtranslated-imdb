=== small attackers === <br /> I, like many others, a great fan of Jerry Bruckheimer. So when I saw all the beautiful posters set before, and the trailer coming before MI: 2, the prospects increased. Production of Jerry Bruckheimer. Large cars. Nic Cage and clean from Oscar- Angelina Jolie. What could go wrong? Much. <br /> <br /> Script is not funny (which really tries to be hard to be) nor exciting. Puts into a black man who makes regular jokes of color about himself and Wooh-haa !! you got comedy? I don't think so. The excitement is not out of the picture. First of all (and this is often explained) there are no sympathetic characters who cares about who is being killed? If you can stomach stomach that psychology will kill the brother of Nic unless he steals 50 cars for 4 days, another thing you know is that Kip (brother) is walking with Nic street again. Is this excited? Think. Then comes the most well-of love between Nic and Angelina. In fact he seems to be bored to say all the lines of stupid to Nic. 'Do you have a girl?' 'What! Do you see anyone? ' 'What caused it?' etc. Then there is only one left hope: the car chases. They are sad to say the least, because the trailer made it look like it was full, and there was only one. One very tall, facing the movement of a delightful camera. I really had trouble following the action. <br /> <br /> So is the movie's action? excited? romantic comedy? - there is no need to decide, just avoid this terrible mess. I will give 3 stars out of 10, and I feel like being generous.
