This is clear that the future change of Jules Verne's "Wonderful Island". Voice editing is very bad. You hear a conversation about setting and you hear sounds written on the recording at the same time! This is an amateur film and actors from Boston and beaten near New Hampshire. For those living in New Engalnd and who reads these comments will be defeated by the capital W. this film is full of errors. You get to hear the voice of the director to give directions and give instructions to the actor. "Right now stand up." As for other characters. There is this man who speaks to his mind rather than his voice and the blue stranger. The old elder speaks in a deep voice. When he screams or screams when he fights you you hear the actor's voice. For special effects, man! This was the original work of Brett Piper right in a loud voice! Creatures are good but animation is jerky. Really jerky. Sort as Karl Zeman animation in JOURNEY START AND TIME (1955). Special effects are thinking. Call music is good. Below, this film makes EQUINOX or PLANET OF DINOSAURS looks like Epic Ray Harryhausen. Do you know the wonderful PLANET was a home movie and was on a budget strap of shoes? You must look for filmmakers who want.
