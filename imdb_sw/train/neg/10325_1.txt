This series is getting worse and worse. Written badly and just plain not funny! The premise is excellent, but the author's knowledge shines. By trying hard to hurt anyone who is abusing everyone. Now in the second season, the cast of desperation has stopped their hands on, and refusing to consider it, smug, "Oh, silly you" style acting that comes with no script laugh. They blow their eyes and shake their heads to each other as if to say, not we zany? What? Not funny? Yes, it is not true. Gum disease is not painful. Not surprisingly, by the discrimination of the Corner Gas, generally Christians avoid the TV in Canada. Come to the CBC you think our guide to showcase the best Canadian talent. Pull the plug into this amateur mess.
