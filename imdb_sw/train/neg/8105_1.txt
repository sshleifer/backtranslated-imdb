Harsh, yes, but I call 'em as I see' em. I saw this at the end of 80 years, and it was one of the most horrible films, which I have forced to see. Yes / movies / Yes, movies show that it is very good. Czech settings are really amazing. The political situation is interesting, but unlike the stories of "past history" (for example _Dr Zhivago_ (qv)), this has failed to make politics suitable for stories, or even interesting. <br /> <br /> Of course, Olin and Binoche are good. But this film manages to make even "erotic events" plodding and slower. I am sure if I would like to read the book, the story would have made more sense. However, life is very short to use at any time over this.
