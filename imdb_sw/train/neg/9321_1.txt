I lost this film about 4-5 years ago and once I was desperate. I wanted to see a flick of a b-blick film, but it ended with a matter of milk with my eyes. Acting was the same as watching the grass. I found it better to work in the softcore film ... The idea that the killer of things comes from anywhere was struck by emotions. What? This was a terrible movie? <br /> <br /> The value of this film production, was more interesting. There was no guilt. It seemed like a high school student got a new video camera for Christmas. The plan was on the place, if it was. If you are bored looking for a bad movie of fear of hiring, skip this. There are the best b-movies out there.
