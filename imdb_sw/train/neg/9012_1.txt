Yesterday I saw the Flyboys film and my boyfriend told me it was the worst movie he had ever seen ... Since I thought it was very good and I had also thought - the movie was the worst movie I had ever seen and this was the only film that came to mind. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately it was a few years since I saw it but I remember the terrible misfortune Dean Cain as the army of the cocky army (good boy Cain does not make a very good cocky). A wonderful program with a CGI helicopter would probably be cheaper to hire a chopper than to hire some of the CGI people to do so, but I think it's that they saw a chopper as a free sample for a certain CGI program or a son of the producer liked to play with his new computer. And what does it look like? Anger. And when the dragon makes a charge through the wheels of trouble then it re-uses the shots directly - it seems to be very cheap. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie - it's really bad ...
