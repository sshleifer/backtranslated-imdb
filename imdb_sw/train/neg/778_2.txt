What does Ireland do for filmmakers who are looking to represent the country in a pejorative way? The film begins as a primer for film students on the cliches of Irish film: unfaithful priests, bouncing before the hands, square squares of the city, bicycles and mountains of the country for the intervention of anodyne music. Quickly, however, it becomes clear that the main theme of the film is Big Daddy-O of the Islamic Fascination rate - religious conflict. It deals with a Protestant woman who wants to decide where the Catholic-born child is education, which may seem to be enough to want, though not a 'Wexford District of 50 who lives. Instead of taking them to Catholic school, she decides to go to Belfast, then Scotland, where there are a few more cliche restored. While there, his father (who looks like Eritrea as George Lucas) and their home are beaten, which comes very back. I can't give the end, not because I think people should go to see this film, but because it is not very good. One of the problems with the film is the main character: we have to sympathize with him but finish instead to ask him to get life. Villagers are presented as bigots who hate should stand up, but hurt your children seems an improper way to go about it. In addition, it takes a load that drastically reduces when you try to draw an analogue with the current Northern Ireland peace process: a woman is told by her lawyer that "must put conditions" for her return. The film is allegedly based on true story but it is a theme that has been largely taken into thinking, and using under hackneyed settings, past.
