We saw this on the shelf of the local video store, saw "Coppola" in credit and was happy. That's the only time that this film brought any interest. I can never work as an exciting film test that failed to fail, or a great film attempt that failed miserably. In general, the whole production was considered extraordinary. The voice was especially scary, especially in the events that were thrown on the small bar; The discussion was related to the part was impossible. Very disappointed.
