Well to see why the creators of the Scary Movie felt that it was very easy to destroy these 'teen slasher' movies. They are a very unpredictable principle. And if Valentine was released a year or earlier, I am sure they could make this film too - that's if they got the original original equipment to identify it from the Rivers, I know what you did last season, and Urban Legends. Valentine offers something new for this type, except for a normal end than usual that actually leaves many places with an inevitable array. As always, a masked psychologist kills a group of beautiful young women, killing the friends of the main character, directly, usually on the top style. There is a lot of T&A displayed, no development of behavior, acting badly, and serious blood damage. What I can't stand up on these types of movies is that they pull out like 'what did they do? '. The thing is that they are not because the reason has been revealed once the killer has blocked, and explains the main character that his friend has now been killed. Usually something that has never been done during the film at any time (for example, the uncle's uncle's uncle's uncle chose his father's dog's dog). Everyone still remains alive in the film is 'suspect', but they are more 'red herrings' than suspects. As we all know this time the main character can escape and kills a psychologist who is unknown after opening the goal. Valentine was following this form next to the letter. *************** SPOILER !!!!!! (mini spoiler however) *************** In Valentine because it was not revealed, but more, left for you to think about given that the film did not finish completely in the usual 'slash' way. The issue is only partly resolved, and the goal of the leading killer may or may not have been completed by living blood and killing almost everyone. What? Should the killer want more, or did the demons have been beaten? Still did not make Valentine a good film, rather it just saved it from the bad as usual, which still does not count in volume. For anyone who thinks to make another film beside these lines, please do not. The truth is very important, and it is difficult to see any realities from this kind.
