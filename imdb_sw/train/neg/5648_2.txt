Boston legal has turned its tail and dominated by the door of the barn and the pig pig has formed! When this show started from around the fourth season it was an exciting attack on the legal system that all actors seem to be proud of being shown. It was amazing, different, and to some extent. The displayed characters were accepted by the actual level in their pictures. Sexual views and activities were reduced and laughed. Julie Bowen was as good as in another series she participated but is now provided at the lowest level of the sexual media programs and abuse. Julie is an excellent actor and needs a more solid platform than this "production". Rene Adjurdubois It is the best actor who has from the days of "Benson" for this production held himself in the field of entertainment, always showing humor and respect for acting production. Captain Kirk "is". Funny and humorous is Candace Bergan and is interested for its continued in this production and is a good actress. James Spader, there is no doubt in his ability to act, however he has to come back to his XXX nature as "Crash" as he has a great talent and direction in that direction. We pray that this series should be done as it is and is starting to smell!
