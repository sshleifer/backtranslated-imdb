It was a very bad movie. It will eat your heart out when you look. I ask you: don't look at this film! You will hate losing 1,5 hours of your life! It's not like other movies that are so bad that you can watch them and enjoy ... this film is interesting if ... there is nothing interesting like this film. You will hate it after watching this film to the end. And you will hate that you did not listen to me. <br /> <br /> I hate it. I suffered and watched this film to the end. Now forgive me, I will shoot myself. I've seen it all. <br /> <br /> Please. Read this very carefully. Don't watch this film. <br /> <br /> Please!
