Now, I have just come to this just because of curiosity and I was going to look - in the same way that you look at a car accident ... <br /> <br /> I am grateful for the fact it is spoof, but that should not stop me from rejecting God's leadership -say, act and talk. To a large extent, this was compared to one of the poorest movies I saw - it looks more like a part of the story from the Cryptkeeper, and the poor man there .............. The right - few complaints (1) time when the doctor had a heart attack before the monster (we cannot see the monster attack, so we think his heart attack), the army then focuses on shells, shells, bullets on the hippo - which were feet from the doctor - however the doctor was not bought by missile any and still alive (2) an army attack from around the yard yard, and we see a fire-used - geez, these things have no more than 30 meters! (3) When a leader tries to take a professor, the soldiers go to the classroom and fire into the ceiling; monster drops baby, and the soldier does not try to shoot the monster ??? come on! (4) monster looks like something out of Power Rangers! (5) there is one area where five "good" people (priest, girl, doctor, writer and child) all seem surprised and we get the effect (with hand lines for the mouth) one after the other - so nature! (6) commonly runs off, occasionally (7) generally refuses to try electricity and does not listen (8) acting is bad (9) What do I mention the suit suit suit monster? (10) that godless music, never stop!
