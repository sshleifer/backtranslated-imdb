Okay, therefore, someone, somewhere, a few years ago, thought it would be a good idea to make a 3D IMAX film about an outlet from Apollo 11 and a month. So they did. Somebody, somewhere, was idiot. I want to give a professional biography of their homework on devices. As far as I could say, rocket and launch equipment were hard. The overall picture was very good - the rocket launch gave me energy, as a good rocket launch is always done (My popular jumping car-car gearhead still running power) and 3D was very good. CG was not the quality of Pixar, but it was generally good. The rivers had been stored for a long time, with some half-60-minute characters hit by color (hippie flies, African-American flies and big afros and black shades, etc.) and magugots looked more like leaves and children's heads ( although they made a loud noise of sand. These authors certainly did not do their homework, depending on the offensive and old clich√©s (60 gender politics including many female, non-colored, bad Russians, jumping fat who just want to eat, bridge-double level) -How humor). In a film aimed at IMAX, they had a good chance to enter some of the educational content about physics and space travel - they could not find their own physics (zero-g in Lunar Module during the burning? PLEASE). read original radio lessons between Houston and inventors, all of which are in the public domain; instead they wrote their own discussion, which looks like decorate. But we loved magogots. So they get a point and half to missiles and dirt. Uh, yay. 1.5 / 5.
