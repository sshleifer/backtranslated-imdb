It doesn't matter how you look at this film, it's just bad. <br /> <br /> If you look at it as a panic, then it is an unpopular movie and the creatures have hand puppets. If you look like a comedy, then you'll see a lot of humor falls flat and it's just blind. If it is a partner you will be surprised why a boy will stay with B ** ch! If you look at it as an act you can't pull to a white hero. <br /> <br /> If you see this film fails to give anything away from entertainment. As mentioned that monsters are definitely puppets and this film was another attempt in the kind of Gremlins movie. This however has the worst monsters of that kind. The traders seemed to be good, and so the staff, they even had the cover from Munchies seemed better than these. The characters in this film are not available. Hero is a security guard, his girl always complains, they have a tramp friend who has a jerk military partner, and another friend who is spaz. At one time in a movie hero and a military youth fight with rakes ... this movie is just absolutely stupid. I like the event when they are in the club club (which is obviously not the club, but the most possible dinner) and the hero tells the waitress that none of them.
