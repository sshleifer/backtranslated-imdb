Walerian Borowczyks La Bete (1975) was definitely received in a different way: Some were surprised, others were shocked and others thanked the courage. I have not yet thought too much, and I am tired and cannot stop wondering why to show unusual, non-existent images that do not try around around the main themes are considered to be an intellectual journey. What is this movie? Grow sex for a woman? I have seen a good film on this issue, but this is not one of them. What? One experiment can show the sex of a girl's growth without at least trying to identify him as a person not only as a story story for a dream (in nude) of animals. Where there are no characters, no study of behavior. A woman suffering from an animal was not a young man, a girl is having sex with a black player (it is also known as an animal)? What? Is the film about religion? If we need less material than a priest without work, character and charisma, but with a strong desire for two young boys. Is it about sex? Feeling of a movie model prevents any true sexual inquiry, especially if the actual investigation requires real characters. So there is no real life here. Some historical animals and two priests talk about sexual sin. Suitable for university essays on topics? I don't think so. <br /> <br /> Is it about sex? Is it on anything? I don't know. I just know to show a gun that is looking for is not making a film film. Dealing with the topic should be more meaningful to show its parties and the head. So walk the controversy. Do not be afraid of violence, dirt, ejaculations, ignorance and things. I am not. See if you look at any other story and you can find out that this is not good enough, it should not be good, not working, not well written (similar, some pictures are very good, and the main character is a very beautiful girl). in a slow way of cheating will make a story of mind. Not suitable. It makes it boring.
