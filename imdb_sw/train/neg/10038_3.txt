The film doesn't style, i mean the original style. everything appears copying including action, first show in movies, songs, dialogue, etc. etc. Yes, there are original buttons, if the start of the car is shown by UP **** and a few seconds later begins to fall The hill and the number MH ****. That was one in many movie items: Anything good in the film? yes, for fan art, if any, Kareena in bikini. For wakshay fans, his conversation with stunts of action. That's it. nothing else. Therefore, look at your own risk and don't charge the director or executives. The director is already mad and actors, I feel sorry for them.
