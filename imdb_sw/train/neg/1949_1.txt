Animation looks like it was done in 30 seconds, and it looks more like caricatures instead of characters. I have been a fan of Scooby Doo since the series started in 1969. I did not think much of Scooby Doo animation, (I am talking about Serial TV, not the full movie movies.), But some of them were pretty cool, and I like many people found Scrappy Doo be angry, but this series is a garbage cleaner. Once I saw the animation, and heard the characters, (and I use the word freely) say, I am wrong. Also, Mystery Inc., it was a team, and without all the collaborators, it looks just like opening a box of chocolates in order to find someone already ate the best, and the only thing that remains is those who don't want to. What Scooby Doo was better than this. If you have a Scooby Doo TV series, include the things that made the series enduring for a long time. The entire scope of the characters, and the quality animation. They need to put this back under the rock from where it came.
