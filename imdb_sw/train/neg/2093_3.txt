If you like this opera's soap is for you, just as I am worried it doesn't work for me and after watching 3 sessions I can no longer look at it. It is boring and slow and by showing that the time line is close to 100,000+ years ago if you have mounted on the battlestar galactica schedule of arrival here on the world they seem to have all the same things around the age of 100,000 years old Chevy vans drive down the streets with people A look at the age of 100,000 name the famous brand LCD TV sets. It may also be similar to all parts of the set together and on the show, there are many modern issues involved without stopping, I think they could do a better job around these issues and yes battlestar galactica had similar issues but not as close as bad. If the price as shown is not the same as BSG it was poor before it?
