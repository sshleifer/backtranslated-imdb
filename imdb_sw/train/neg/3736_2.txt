This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Robin Williams went into a place like a pig would get into a trap, however his performance was kind. Kurt Russell had more faith but it was still bad. The plan was highly recommended and all exercises were awesome. The only thing that this film was going to was was a trailer, which was exploited within 90 minutes of my life that would have been well used to try to lie behind my head. <br /> <br /> What! grace and burn this film if you have. If not, we are glad you do not.
