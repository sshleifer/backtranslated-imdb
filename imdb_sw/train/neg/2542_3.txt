... not that all Disney movies are garbage. <br /> <br /> However, I saw the "Legend of Boggy Creek" first and quite love film. When I heard it had 2 sequels, I was happy. I finally got a copy of this and watched it one night. I don't see how they can make a se-Gated liquel for a terrible film. The original is a movie / document about Monster's Fauke, and can be afraid of anyone. "Return" is for children and should not be looked at by anyone. I did not remember the plot very well, for it is a whole time since I watched it and I will not look at it again, but ... It's about these hunters who come to the city and are going to look for a bigfoot kill. Three young children come out of the house to stop. Great surprise comes through. Hunters are injured, saved by children. Then they all hide in the boat with the main piece of tarp and try to wait out of the storm. Then suddenly, Bigfoot comes and does something sick. I don't want to destroy the end of any yas, but it's not scary. Well ....
