I usually didn't look for 'GI Jane' without the choice. I was more or less forced to watch this film on both sides of my female female. GI Jane loses her loyalty once to try to convince the viewer that it is likely to be real, which is not really. The result of this is that the story becomes locked directly with obstacles, preventing the amount of humor (which does not exist) or action action action, and soon becomes very serious. So the film becomes very bad and predictable. 'GI Jane' fails where other effective films are successful, because because films such as James Bond, Dirty Harry and others are much bigger than life, but they never declare that otherwise. They are running, and therefore it's entertaining. 'GI Jane' tries to be real and fails. This is a very disappointing film from Ridley Scott, with an unpredictable story, doing an unreliable job, and the only reason I give 2/10 instead of 1/10 is for technical work.
