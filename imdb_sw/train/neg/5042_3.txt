The main complaints and films are the fact that I can't tell whom. There is no racial discrimination, but these Masai seem to be the same! I can describe some stories, but these feelings about as far as they go. The signs of people are not hidden, if it's a mystery I would like to care for. Instead it was not far from the ASAP screen. <br /> <br /> Tons of wide shots and non-emotional faces take this movie. Heck is boring, not just I don't know these people, but they're just sitting. <br /> <br /> Production is a typical Chinese John Woo, bad video and damaged scenes. This looks just better than the "Full Time" of Andy Lau (which was a great movie.) You would think of a good budget that at least made it like 90 years of Hollywood. I didn't know the Chinese had these beatnik art.
