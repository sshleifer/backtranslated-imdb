If someone wants to make a movie, really bad, "The lost Kingdom of the Kingdom" actually places a plot to measure the depth of evil. <br /> <br /> Start with pseudo-Chewbacca next to the main character ... Some poor poor in the white costume of "furry" which looks like it had been sent together from pieces of carpeting. Work your way slowly, bitterly, through more non-special effects that completely deny the viewer from suspension of unbelief. Add the jnome of the garden (for the event). With the second idea, skip the movie completely and get something to do for an hour and a half.
