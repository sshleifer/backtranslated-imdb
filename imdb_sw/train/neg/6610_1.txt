This film should not be viewed as being a flop. Ram Gopal Verma first wanted to make this a remake of the movie bollywood classic "Sholay", but after the problems with the original creators decided to proceed with the project and ... I think I leave a good part of the movie (acting, script, songs, music, comedy, The point etc.) out and shoot the movie just because it already happen to hire employees. The problem of money, wasting time. After making movies like Rangeela, Satya, and the Company he drew Coppola (Godfather) over us; What would you think of RGV? Anyway, the story is, though hard to follow, is close to the old sholay. Ajay Devgan plays Heero (Beeru, sholay) and Ajay, a new player on the play Ajay (Jay, sholay). All the "bad but good" friends help the copo catch the first person first. Later in the film, the retirement offender now employs them as personal security and protects them from the very hands of the most wanted Bubith played by Amitabh Bachan. If you watch the sound movies, they are the winning win. There I saved you only precious hours of your life!
