Here's what happened: <br /> <br /> 1) The BBC3 header needs to make plans aimed at different audiences with BBC1 and BBC2 to keep the license and work. 2) Lenny Henry offers his friends unwilling to go. <br /> 3/3) The BBC3 head is stirring, ignoring the fact that they are not worried. Worst of all, it is against racism, as all actors play up to evil. If a white man did this kind of thing, there would be excitement! <br /> <br /> Wish.
