I saw this movie with low expectations and was not disappointed. Its so bad is really funny in a very good way to cotton. Gael is awesome, I mean he can't act, the period. He has to stop now, for work is obviously not his thing. The director should be embarrassed to put his name on something of stupidity. I have never written comments on IMD, but this movie was very bad I felt forced to do so. If you get a chance to see this film, not 0/10 if there were 0
