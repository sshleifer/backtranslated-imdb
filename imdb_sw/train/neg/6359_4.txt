Wo all Allen, while being better, has one of the most severe pens around. He can make an instant investigation and close close to the punch line as no other. However, while on his worst movies he can go to hell. Unfortunately, "Melinda and Melinda" has this slow from opening closed. Introducing is one of his most exciting ideas for a while. Four friends live in a restaurant talking about the essence of life is a comedy or drama. To help deal with the problem, one person explains the beginning of the story and asks two other men while talking (one comic player, another is a popular player) if the story is comedy or a problem. Two men then continue the story and the movie shows stories that are happening. Now, when I first heard about this film, my understanding is that they say the same story, kind (comedy or game) just change and how to look at it. Now that would be interesting. However, the stories share the same element with a number of side issues. They are a completely different story with the big difference of the plot. The ceremony is very complex and engages that it can only work as an independent. If this was a step, then it failed because these features prevent the audience from feeling any investment in any characters. Comedy is a story that has a time of success, but it is still short and short. Farrell is obviously meant to be the position of Woody, but he could play this character by more faith without adding woody stutters and tick-hands. Woo is better to be Woody. When someone else tries, they don't play character, they are an example of a well-known actor. This kind of thing stimulates the audience out of the story. My Woody Allen movies are my favorite to get out of the little memory in the spirit than I entered. This has made me love to get my money back.
