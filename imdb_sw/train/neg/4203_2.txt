What starts as a very clever farce on a certain security monitoring company returns, almost immediately, in a mysterious and deadly secret. David Arquette and Stanley Tucci the greatest struggle to make the problem appear, but some things are not just human. What is, for example, causes Gale to turn suddenly from a mother's sweet figure on drinking at home of Tommy's parents? Why Heinrich, though legitimate to have a sleezebag, wants to destroy a business that lives his life, by stealing and possibly killing his customers? Why is a wise Tommy who believes that Heinrich can be a murderer (based entirely on a dream), and even if that was reliable, why can't he go to the police? And why did Gale not make a bell when it came home, especially after telling Howie about it? Of course, all these events are important for conspiracy (and I spend too long, very freely) opened. And it can be forgiving if it caused even a little bit of comedy. But everything, from Howie's description of his rape date, with the accuracy of the coroner of Gale, until the last "shock" of Gale and Howie is still dead, is much more dirty than anything else. looking at the box showing that my views are "demolished", but nothing more I or anyone else can do to destroy that thing that has already stopped up to heaven.
