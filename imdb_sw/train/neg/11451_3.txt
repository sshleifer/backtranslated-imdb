Indeed, friends, bad buff of the movie is expected to watch all kinds of movie, as bad as good, and this movie has put me to test. I won't handle words. This movie was bad. The story was bad. Acting was bad. Sissy Spacek very strange did not have anything to make this film better. In fact I wondered why I even tolerated this rotten movie? Why did I waste my time and money on something that I thought would be bad? The answer is, of course, that I am a buff movie and therefore can not avoid what otherwise should be avoided. I can't waste your time explaining what was wrong with this amateur film, except to say that the quality of acting was, put it gently, down. The bad buff of the movie may want to take on the role of watching this film. Otherwise. stay at home, don't waste your time, read a book, take on a job or have a good sandwich.
