I am surprised to discover the amount of fans this show has. I have not told them that friends were, usually 'sitcom' average, and not as others did. Let's look, if not for the cast of Courtney Cox Arquette, David Schwimmer, Matthew Perry, Lisa Kudrow, Jennifer Aniston and Matt Le Blanc, then who knows if this show would have continued as long as it has done. I am very doubtful that. Although as the series went on, friends continued to be more predictable, lame and better that I had little worry about the characters â€” most of them in the history of the TV - or of their difficulty, or who had sex with him. And it turned out to be a pleasure in the first four season for regular funny. And even when all of this was an A-list of Hollywood actors from the film world, I still didn't worry about writing. The recording of Friends started that I lost interest in this show from the sixth season and as the end, well was predicted to say at least. What has been heard though this was the ten season, when some of my proposed exhibitions were found only for three seasons, and finally canceled and taken to the air for good. The time you should be rushing fast when the time you want you want a great salary. Actually, as the series decreased, it was a big show than the actors themselves, not another way. When it was in 2004, I was very tied to see behind this sitcom. Now, there is a conversation of friends to meet again to show up on our TV screen recently. And yet, for one I did not expect anything.
