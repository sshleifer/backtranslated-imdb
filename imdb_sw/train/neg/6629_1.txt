If you have seen Sholay of 1975, don't watch this film. If you haven't seen Sholay of 1975, Go to GOD. But don't look at this film. This movie has all the links that might have gone wrong with removing Sholay's remake. Amitabh 'Babban' Bachchan has the role of psychological man for the best (perhaps only 40 hours of reel that should not be burnt). If you remove all the film and just watch amitabh play around with his character, it would be worth an hour. But as Insp. Narsimha, Mohanlal does not justify his talent. Ajay Devgan (Heero) is very common and the only reason I think, gave Prashant Raj in Raj's role is because he resembles Amitabh's youth days. Sushmita Sen runs well, with grace and make-up. But the award for "WORST work and any responsibility until date" must go to Nesha Kothari. He can destroy his job at such levels that even a high school game would be more than his performance. If you have a human enemy, take him to this film. :)
