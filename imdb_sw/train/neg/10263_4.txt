Yes, the South Star has a good reputation for forgetting which is singing for that heavy crooner Matt Monro. It is pretty much louder with this blind hit featured, by George Segal and Ursula Andress as an adventurous couple in search of big diamonds. Add to Harry Andrews (with amazing inspiration, not less) walking in the ostrich, tons of wildlife stock photography, and photography easily and badly for Raoul Coutard, and you are experiencing improper damage through Senegal's forest.
