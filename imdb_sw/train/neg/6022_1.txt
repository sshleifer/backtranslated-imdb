I've been exhausted by the people using God's name to maintain their own great perspective on the world. Yes, I do not exclude the idea of ​​Armageddon, or the coming of the rebels of Christ, I dismiss the idea that only some people who live a good life (They seem to be white Christian children) will go to Heaven, while we all have to suffer through the hell of the earthly world , just because we couldn't afford it. God can be a judge, but I don't think He will measure every level of goodness. Give the creator some loan.
