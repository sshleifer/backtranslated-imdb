I wonder how many comments on this show are about how "real" is. Maybe I'm not part of the same world because if Veronica Mars is anything, it's up in a great way. Kicking is to chew the environment with enthusiasm and plots with holes you can drive through. That's not what I call it real. <br /> <br /> It is hard at its desire to be "useful" which shows just how to cut off from reality Rob Thomas and his staff. Overall, I've got to be better than snooze-fest and for much worse than a little slower. Kristen Bell looks like he can be a good actor, but it's hard to say with the above style show all.
