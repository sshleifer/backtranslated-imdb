First, the character of the head is not the main character of the movie. He is the leader of the worship leader. Migizaji who shows Igor believed that the loud shouting, laughing hysterically, and having a smiling smile while discovering your eyes would be the best way to torment people. Igor also had a horrible habit of shouting (because he never said it) in a loud voice. He would also say idiotic one-liners. For example, when a religious leader kills one of his followers and a buzz newspaper, Igor saw it, he says "Paul! No Paul! Why do you do that?" I could refuse him clean! In another area Igor tells the victim that he will have 'get his surgical tools because now, it was his time to work.' In addition to the worst acting, the end had no meaning because when the story creates a little steam that has towards the peak, which is Igor to find the head of the head of the head to the head and some of his prestigious friends are killed, shows up again and again to kill them good people 'remained. The movie does not give an explanation of this, just tell the viewer that Igor escaped from a mental hospital. What ??? Below does not waste your time watching this film. I wish I could come back when I lost this look.
