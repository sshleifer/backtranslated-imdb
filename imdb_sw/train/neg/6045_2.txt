This is an interesting idea has gone. The hidden meaning in art is left as a sign and a killer of seemingly exciting, but the implementation of "Anamorph" slows down and without interest. There is no other way to describe the film except boring. The symptoms of death are the only fascinating part of "Anamorph". Everything combining is interesting. Willem Dafoe gives reliable performance as a follower, but has little to do with the script set to limit. Many actors are lost, including Peter Stormare as an artist, James Rebhorn as police chief, Paul Lazar as a medical observer, and especially Deborah Harry, who has been shown behind a DVD trial, but still has a few lines to go through the door burst. Not recommended. - MERK
