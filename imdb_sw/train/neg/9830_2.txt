I'm afraid that you will find that a large number of people weighing this movie as 10 are very Christians. I am not. If you are looking for a Christian film, I recommend this film. If you are looking for a good general film, I'm afraid you will need to go somewhere else. I was angry with the characters, and their bad behavior. The premise of the cinema is that moral doctrine without teaching that it was Jesus who is the basis of the moral is not the right one. One part shows the main character telling the boy that it is wrong to steal, and then the habit continues to say that it was Jesus who taught us this. I see that anger: do we believe that "stealing" came from Jesus? I think he wrote the Ten Commandments? And theft was accepted before that? I removed the movie from Netflix. I had to recognize the nature of the film from the comments. Oh well.
