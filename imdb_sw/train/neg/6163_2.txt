Hooper It's Not Love, Not Fasting, It's not romantic and doesn't know. No real drama. You would think that the film about the world's greatest player will have another game, there was an attempt but it wasn't found to be real. There is no Characteristics, no lessons learned, not even though the actors were really happy, they just tried to act like they were happy. There is no reason to check unless you like to watch Burt and want to see Sally regularly. Prancer horse was beautiful and did what she had to do. In fact Prancer was the best actor in this film. Smoky and Bandit was a very enjoyable movie that I was ready to love Hooper. This movie turned into a real disappointment and waste of time
