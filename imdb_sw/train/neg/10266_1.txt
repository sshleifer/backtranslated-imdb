1 looked at 11/07/2004 - 1 out of 10 (Dir-Jon Keeyes): Over the top of the renewal of 70 claim that panic flicks like Friday 13 (1 versions thru ?? ??). I can't think of a great deliverance here except (or can I imagine anything?) Stories around a group of ignorant people listening to a radio program a year after other children were killed in the forest as 'honor' for this, allegedly. But, behold, and behold, one of the ignorant people, has a relationship with the true event because his sister was one of those who were killed (again, how stupid he could even be part of this). Guess what? The murderer is no more and we have been removed from the beginning who is (so any secret). And above all this, where 'cops' and why someone calls them. I can't believe that this film was sponsored by man and made. You would think that now the people of America will be judged less, at least in their movie experience, but not so with the film manufacturer.
