This film is like "Flashdance", you know that the flick dance with Jennifer Beals. The film is probably the most interesting film I have seen since it was not bad even enough to be funny. "G.I. Jane" is better than that film, but that doesn't say much. Here Demi Moore jumps so much and there is a high music and we see seeing fighting with everything, but certainly not very involved. I think the idea behind the film is interesting, but the script is also a clich√©d and Ridley Scott can't do anything about it. Well, as I said ... It's better than "Flashdance" ... (4/10)
