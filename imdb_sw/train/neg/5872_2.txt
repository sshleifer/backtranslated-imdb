I saw this for Gary Busey and Fred Williamson thought they were a friend cops. They are only Busey in the opening area and no longer show up to 40 minutes on the film. Although every area in it is amazing. Especially when he hides himself as a blind hobo. <br /> <br /> What's amazing about this movie is a plot. In the film Fred Williamson tries to find out who is moving and killing telephone sex workers. When one I think that's its Busey. But it turns me to just the right part. Busey is not a killer, but he calls and abuses women on the phone. Why? I don't know. In any way he is connected to the killer, he does only with the kicks I think.
