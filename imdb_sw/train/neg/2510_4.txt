This television film says the story of Frannie extrovert suddenly return Silk Hope to visit friends and family, but do not know the death of her mother. Her sister runs a family home, but she is willing to sell and move with her new husband. Frannie emphasizes the idea, and promises to keep the heirloom family as it was, to get a job and maintain responsibility. <br /> <br /> Comes a nice Ruben and two will soon fall in love (as you do), and it's from this point that I kind of lost interest .... <br /> <br /> Farrah Fawcett than just blonde hair and looks, he can show a very interesting character when he put his thoughts - and certainly proved here with some of his earlier efforts like Fence and Small Sacrifice - good performance from the Angel's story of Charlie. Silk Hope is a type of film that never gives away from its cheap and television pictures, and you know there was a limit to the budget, but it's not a very bad film made. Good things come; you just have to find them.
