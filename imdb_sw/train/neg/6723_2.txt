The beauty of Charlotte's death and evil edge makes the cold of the movie than would otherwise. The story is very bad and Charlotte's behavior dies in such a foolish way, that you wonder if this is the end they thought for this film. I would like someone to say that the other end is there, but I'm afraid it is not good. On the other side of this passage, I would say that they didn't do very well; although the blame should be placed on the poor script.This movie reminds me of the 2 hour Rush where Zhang Ziyi dies in a mysterious way, since he was the only stolen show during the entire movie. I could give this film 2/5
