In contrast to another inspector, I think this is the same-written, especially the most false, because great ideas are needed; and did well, because there were no other characters who would share the purpose of these two-minute-plus, monologue done well. But I am not only welcome to a sincere celebration, of pride. Everyone has a story to tell and some are more interesting than others. Everyone has problems and some are more intense than others. These are only ten stories, not very atypical and problems, showing how the life of any person (or part of it) is a film food. Then again, I think the wrong of real TV shows, too. So, if that's your pocket, you can love this. It is the kind of things that can do well for the phone and / or the rumor of the Internet; but completely without other action-than-words. And, although each of the speakers is a woman, I will leave this gender.
