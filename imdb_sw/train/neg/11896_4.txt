Before I started, I _love_ Eddie Izzard. I think he's one of the funniest position around today. It may mean that I am getting into this very high expectations, but I have not seen just Eddie funny in this ringing. I think the main problem is Eddie trying very hard to be Eddie. Everyone knows him as a very comic, and we all love him for it. But in the circle, he seems to be going more in a more sense of funny, and quite lost in places. A lot of topics that covers he has covered before - I even think I realized a few jokes of recycled there. Buying a DVD you will see behind the scenes watching Eddie's visit (interesting in places, but not very funny), and the French version of one of its displays. Staff will enjoy seeing Eddie in different languages, but the comedy with a head is not very funny. <br /> <br /> If you're a Eddie fan you have done this already or you're going to buy whatever I say. If you just go, buy glory or wear to kill - you won't lose heart. For Circle, maybe you will.
