Watch the scenes for ... Group Of Aliens Aliens Go On Earth Eat the crash land on the planet's prehistoric animals instead where each eat physcedelic mushrooms and take a retarded action. With pictures from the "Planet of Dinosuars" and this awesome joke is just one. The acting is also killing, and this time is not as bad as "Chickboxer" (what movie can be?) This is still pretty great repugnant things. It is 90 minutes running when it feels like ever and it is likely that curse life so make yourself a great grace and just keep on, skip this crappy film, there's nothing to look at here. <br /> <br /> The film makers try to sell this turd as MST3K style make fun of the film made a decade before, and work in moderation is still something that watchable though, Ariauna Albright is hot, but Lilith Stabs has a good voice unattractive chat. <br /> <br /> My bridge: D- <br /> <br /> Additional DVD: Joke Views, 17 Behind the scenes featurette; 7 minutes In the black color element; Jessica Mills reports; Gallery of yet; with the original trailer
