O dear, it's a terrible movie. Production was cheaper and worse ... Remember the shot from "Natural", where the lightning flashes the tree (leaving the burning stems) that Roy Hobbs makes the bat from? Well, the producers of the film used the same area to establish the area where the tree branch has entered the house. I wonder if they were paid to use the pictures from The Natural, or did they believe that no one could watch the film could lift it? <br /> <br /> Then at the end where they tried to leave the truck. Such on acting in the cabin. <br /> <br /> A very bad film, very bad film.
