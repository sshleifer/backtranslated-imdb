It is similar to a horrible film about a good urban family involved with the death of their parents and "something" in an apartment that they continue to raise people when they remove the street. Of course there is more so then but to say more would be spells. <br /> <br /> For me this has not come just as it tries to have two ways like a family drama and fear film. The film is making a great effort to walk between these two types but it seems more likely to fall anywhere if it is amazing, something that has never been. It is not appropriate that the last revelation did not arise then "oh", like "Oh thats it?". Maybe if I didn't look at most of these awesome movies recently this could be better or could be just looked since I did not compare it to the volume. <br /> <br /> I'd like to take a pita
