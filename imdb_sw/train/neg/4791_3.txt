* Merchants * have never read again if you haven't seen this film! The tall man takes Mike, while Reggie and the young Tim spend most of the movies that tried to bring him back, and not end up as slaves on the "Red Planet" of Tall Man. This silly finds: trio of thieves in the nose red hearse were just for comic relief, and chick black karate (can not remember his name) was very angry I could not wait to see if the Long Man killed his character. He puts it close to look like it would be Tim's character, who comes at the end and is finally a hero, but ... it doesn't work in that way. At the end of this story Liz has been cut off by the head of the killer, Mike gets a silver field planted in his skull, residents get Reggie and a few children to get Tim, and no one is left to leave the tall man. A good person is successful - now how surprisingly fail at the end? <br /> <br /> This was done in 1993 and has not been stored until '95, and at the end of this was the last time, and though it is desperate and anticlimactic it was also the end and suitable for this very good series. But the fourth shifts to this end and does not add anything new but worse, and even worse and more finished nonsensical ... <br /> <br /> * 1/2 out of ****
