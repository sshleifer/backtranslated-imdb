You can't expect a film like this to be good, and not. It's not a budget, a terrific movie of a zombie zombie held by a cameras visible with an infinite hand ... and it's hilarious. The characters have never worked before and shows in their terrible hilarious studies. There is no visible plot. A small plan that I could find was seen that the government's attempt escaped and a zombie group appears to be threatening several families. The effects of the year are true of many patients I have ever seen. It seems that the effects of people attacked the shop's shop for all parts of the body, and many events involve zombies to remind people and eat their organs. It is a lively and ignoring film, and it's about as bad as you can find according to any film. <br /> <br /> My rating: BOMB / ****. 90 months.
