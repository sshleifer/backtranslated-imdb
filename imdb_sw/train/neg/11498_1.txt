Gadar is an example of one of the most popular audio tracks available. Directed by Anil Sharma, who prefers to make a time-related movie offers a garbage movie. The songs were boring and not the song you want to listen to in your car, the full amount. Sunny Deol is famous for making daft films, where he beat 100 bad people alone. He even hits the iron gate (Indian) and cut off a moving car (Teesri Aankh). I can give 50 other examples of embarrassment to Sunny Deol. But I'm sure many people know this already. Sunny provides a pleasant performance again to repeat the same type of role. The boy claims that he is fighting his countryside, using violence. Amisha Patel is hands under dead sexy and wonderful body that I would like to hit the bone. But even he could not save the film as a tragedy. Instead of wearing a sexy dress as he usually does, in this film he does not. Perhaps he was playing Islamic, but he does not act like one in the film. In general, this is a poor show all the way, I am sure it will appeal to other people, who would like to see a sound actor blowing 100 guys. Give me a break.
