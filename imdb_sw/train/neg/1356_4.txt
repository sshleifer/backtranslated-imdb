I first and totally and confidently disagree with the user who calls this "spoof". Crispin Glover is very bad about his film. He himself created a film on the investigation I saw in Chicago. He had worked for the film for years and is the first in planned trilogy. "What is it?" is a Crispin Glover attempt in the art of the film of those she idolizes with Herzog, Lynch etc. <br /> <br /> I had heard the rumors of this film "Epic porno movie and every low-syndrome cast directed by crispin glover". When finally came out i watched the trailer on-line and read the summary and I was foam in the mouth and expect. ... I went to chicago to see it and it was a great disappointment. If you took out goofy sh * t, as well as grandmother's cigarette pot, and dolls play, she would be left with something better, but only after 10 minutes long. Just look at the trailer, have fun, and stop it. There are some amazing pictures and fantastic juxtapositions and words, but its lack of focus is similar to desire.
