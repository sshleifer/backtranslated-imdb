I was in China in this film. I choose the name of the screen Sheeba Alahani because I was an example at that time in Italy and could not pronounce my real name correctly, so I choose Sheeba and then added Alahani since it was similar to Alloan. <br /> <br /> I've never done a step before (and shows), but it was very fun for the film. They gave me "lessons to do" every morning (which was not important). They said my voice (thank you goodness) <br /> <br /> David and Peter were a blast on the set, full of good humor and joke. This film has not been taken seriously, it was tax writing according to local information. <br /> <br /> I give 1 because I have a sense of humor, but 10 for fun I was "doing" in it.
