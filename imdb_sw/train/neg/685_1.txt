My wife and I thought that this was used by the director, the film would have been at least a look. We were missing. In fact, we left on it after 45 minutes. The idea that Crawford, Young and Tone is Britain but to say to the accents of the US was, for me, it is impossible to pass - hard to believe this is England when nobody speaks for British emphasis. There is a zero chemistry between Crawford and anyone, and give a preliminary view, the idea that Cooper and Crawford are announcing directly to their love for each other without any reason is interesting. There is no reason to care about any characters, that's why we went through the fabric. I found it hard to believe that Hawks inspired this, because no characters spoke to the trademark of Hawksian bribes. So you save your time, and break this.
