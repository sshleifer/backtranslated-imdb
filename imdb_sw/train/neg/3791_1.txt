I can't vote on this because I won't look at the garbage from these people. They got my money with another movie (Mr. Jingles) and I swore that it would never happen again. I feel it is my civic responsibility to help people stay away from this waste. Go to the sessions on this film and read where the members used are trying to act as they see the film for the first time. One boy responds to himself ... using the same name! There are shillings on the forum which says it's good like Shawshank Redemption and Citizen Kane ... Even close (without way). If this is a company's 2 movie, it should be better than the first. That means that the movie 3 should be much better. Not so, I have seen it. All I want to know is how you distribute this waste by using the same names at all times. Have fun with friends and make a film on the weekend is good ... but don't try to sell the market that garbage!
