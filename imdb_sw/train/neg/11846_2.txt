After watching this film I complained to my local movies on the sound quality of the voice or as the sound system of the movie could be bad. For at least the first half of the film is very difficult to understand what a person is saying because of the history of 20 music and the sound of voice sounds. I was ready to blame the movie equipment but it was not - he was the Director. I was told the issue of my complaint was an important part of making a film. Music and sounds had to be corrupted in order to create a very negative impact on the film. Nowadays, directors will go to many lengths to make their film unique. Unfortunately, no matter where or how you see the film the sound will be the same. So, apart from the bad historical context of this film (which you can do for yourself elsewhere) the sound of the voice distracting themselves is a good reason to give this film a miss. You'll only have the improper damage of sound sounds and certainly not meow of cats.
