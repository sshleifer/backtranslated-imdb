I wasn't very optimistic when I went to see this. After Mst3king run out of JasonX and other friends though, I was hoping for the same experience here. Unfortunately the movie separated itself very seriously. Do I care about Jason's problems? Sorry no. There are 13 village movies that cover that however. At the end of the day, he is the main killer of the undead, I can't get to be kind. <br /> <br /> Freddy was a very interesting feature of the movie and the invention and what is not, but unfortunately they were few and middle and end of the film, was dropped in the worst part of the death of celebrity death ... not just funny. <br /> <br />
