Oh, brother. The only reason for this angry film avoids getting the "bomb" from me is because it is a great historical film like the first Three Stooges (when they are not alone and still adorned by Ted Healy which is not very suitable). But even if a long-time fan of Stooges I would like to say that the little Moe, Larry and Curly are used here as the last three guardians of Mr. Healy's assistant. They do not emerge quickly through the film and their secret and off-off images become more powerful as the characters of the most powerful cartoon are trying to be exciting. <br /> <br /> Most of this toothache is involved with Jack Pearl for free access to the buttons from the audience as a person who imitates Baron Munchausen (here is a good example of humor rate: "I resist!" "Why?" Coffee reasons! "). His sidekick is no other than Jimmy Durante less, but even schnoz himself is bearing.
