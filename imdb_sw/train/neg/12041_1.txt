Well, it started? This is one of the worst films I've ever had to pay for good money to see. I won't say about the story itself, it's a wonderful classic, but here it feels like a soap opera. Starting with, acting, except for Eric Bana, is the quality of soap opera. I've been a fan of Brad Pitt, but here every actor on Bold and Good is embarrassed. The camera action does not help, either. How it goes on it when he thinks, just takes me away from Brooke Forrester's day in the laboratory! Peter O'Toole has had a bad plastic surgery, or very much needed. In any way, it looks more like Linda Evans than Linda Evans! And to finish my opinion, Diane Kruger is a beautiful girl, but she certainly isn't Helen of Troy. Peterson should rather choose the Saffron Burrows for the role, since Elizabeth Taylor will be rather miscast for now.
