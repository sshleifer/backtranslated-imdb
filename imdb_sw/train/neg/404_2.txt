Shortly after seeing this film I questioned the intellectual capacity of every actor and actor who accepted the role. Elizabeth Shue is a respected actor, why would he accept such an opportunity to consider? I must give credit when the loan is issued, though. Some time in the movie were not known and instead of transfixing, but they were not made for the odds of Kevin Bacon, Sebastian Caine. I will not recommend this film to anyone, man or woman, who has any kind of self-respect for the account.
