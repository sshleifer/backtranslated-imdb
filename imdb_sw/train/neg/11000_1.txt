Words cannot describe how completely this movie is. It is a series of random parts, unwanted on everything from the gray-headed Batman to the young man he finds with a dead woman (NOT aWAY). Any interesting thing about the Comedy Underground Movie looks at Joey Buttafuoco, the best actor in this film. Also, it is rated NC-17, shunning away the only people who can endure.
