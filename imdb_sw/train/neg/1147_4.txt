This film is the history of F.B.I. as the Knott Farm of Berry is to the west. An attack on the Federal Intelligence Agency's anti-crime intelligence. The heavy hoover of Hoover (had any other type?) It shows every time with executives of script-read quality quality, cheesy sets, sound effects cheap and 101. Lights. , the film puts every c-lister known in the middle of the fifth and nary hint of irone or humor, from the 'Amazon jungle' to 'back to the yard' barbear, everything reeks of sound action and back ball. Even guns are canned and ordinary. I think Mervyn Leroy was eaten every night. Except for a few (very few) outside setup shots, there is nothing here to note more of curio.
