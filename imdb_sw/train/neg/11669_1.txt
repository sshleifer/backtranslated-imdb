I think it's nice and trendy to see wonderful things in the absolute weakness of the film like this. Despite the shortage of other Hollywood films, we can relax and enjoy a non-explosive, non-existent language, and one language. Minimalism has its place, and can be very effective when used properly. However, this film is not one of those events. <br /> <br /> Take long events without conversation with dreary, beautiful surroundings. I am sure that they should hold on to the meaning and great understanding, because the included message is placed on discrimination. Acting is poor ... bland and pedestrian ... and shows one of the worst events in history (late film, if you can stay up to the end). The beauty is a ravine, and the last final sequence of the girl walking through the unhappy beach is like a pleasant tooth. I would like to call this without thinking, but if the film did not create any kind of peak ... even even on "erotic events" without being realistic. I am sure that there was a script employed during photography, but in the amount of conversations, I think it would have been written on the fabric fabric. Basically, this film does not provide anything for interest or surprising ... no good news, no extraordinary insight, no celebration to see, no excitement. Besides two or three moments, this film is losing two hours of film and a dreary film.
