I am a great fan of Stephen King. I loved Man Running. So I was very excited that someone had made his film. And when the local network showed the film, I was in heaven. I was already ready for a happy night! The first indicator of being something was wrong when I saw that someone had healed Arnold Schwarzenegger. I can only believe that someone who has obtained the film's fullness of runnin 'a' shootin 'can play a part of the most subtle, as described in the book. I still believed that this would be a good film, however. Who knows, perhaps Arnold had hidden talents? Well, he didn't. Recently I realized that the only reason that he had even cast was because the man had written again the whole story to make up the fightin 'a' shootin '. Yup, it was an ordinary film of Arnold: the hero has done wrong, the hero solves problems by changing his powerful muscles and terrifying everyone and the hero finds the girl. <br /> <br /> I was surprised. This is not a book that says all the time. I know that books cannot be closed on the actual screen, but this has never been a link to the book. Stephen King should openly curse any relationship with the film and he should have refused to use the title Man Race for this disgrace of film. I can't say many times, but this film was BAD. If I wasn't at home to watch, I'd like to beat rotten tomatoes on the screen. Once again: bad. (Remember that I used a 'man' too. I did it because I am sure many people are embarrassed to do this job and I don't want to give them even more embarrassment by calling the name here)
