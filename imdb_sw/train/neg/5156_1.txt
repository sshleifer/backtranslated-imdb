"Laughter is a state of mind" says the tag, and I'm trying to comment on Barry Levinson. What? Would he be thinking when doing "Toys"? As he watched the summer, he saw a fantasy of success, wonderful? If so, then he works on a different plane than me. This is a pleasant image, one of which design production is 90% of the object (and even the color of the cartoon is greedy). Robin Williams and (especially specifically) Joan Cusack are abused as a brother and sister of mogul toy who have declined as owners of the factory when their father dies. There is nothing exciting (satirical or slapstick-wise) shown here. It's very safe, bad, and one of the biggest "big" movies made. NO STARS from ****
