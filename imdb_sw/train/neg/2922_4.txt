Take young people, good people, put them in a foreign place, stick to a small minority, two leading people to get romance after a few breathing events, create many breathing items, then do fun work for everyone (over three or four who are killed, of course) That is the classic (successful) structure of the Harlequin Romance. It's not good but then it's not too bad, like many pocket books. And things in Budapest are very interesting, even if they do not use an old train station (created by Gustave Eifel) or show the city's hot dams.
