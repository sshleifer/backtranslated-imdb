I didn't watch the entire film. I couldn't watch the entire film. I left the DVD after watching half an hour and suggesting anyone thinks to look out for themselves before taking the disc out of the case. <br /> <br /> I love all the sad mafia movies and comic but Corky Romano can only be described as an awesome attempt on mafia comedy. The problem is Corky Romano just tries to find the audience laughing, conspiracy seems to be the reason for moving Chris Kattan (Corky) from one location to another. Corky himself is actively involved with no fraud or deception - all his strange ways come as it was found - Chris Kattan is obviously 'acting' rather than taking responsibility - it finds you out of the story. Each area is predictable, 'comedic event' that will appear on the set is definitely just every place will be brought. In the competition such as Mr. Bean caused by the head attitude is strange because you can feel the pressure of the characters and the original event and the situation in which the character ends is not telegraphed. Corky however makes sense that he tries to deliberately on a desperate attempt from the audience. If Chris had not played the guest's behavior (who does not really know the other characters in the movie) and whose character is not quite known (except for trying to try) and comedy events could not be predicted and released - all jokes appeared also known) this film could be seen. But not so. Don't look at it.
