Timberlake performance almost made you attack the screen. It was not bad, I just think the role of journalists was inappropriate for him. LL Cool J played the usual role of the record, the hardest person, the worst around. I don't think the burst of a smile in the whole movie, even when it is proposed to his girlfriend. Morgan Freeman very much took the entire movie. He had other incredible events that are the top part of the film. <br /> <br /> Kevin Spacey was not good or bad was just "there". <br /> <br /> Overall is bad movie. a bad plot. many evil or evil roles for executives.
