First, I'd say that I'm a fan of Chris Rock. I like his other movies, but this film is like my summary. The biggest sack of crap ever. At the beginning, Chris Rock has a favorite player who gets a step in the Apollo Building. As he was going home from the gig, climbing his BIKE he finds this woman likes and beaten by a truck. After a short time, he chooses the body of the former, white, and selfish owner. Then, she dresses as an Outkast musical group while trying to restore the scene from the original where she comes as Jockey. Second, he returns to Apollo, and tries to be a player who tried to be in his previous body and began to lose white people and try to be black. Do you get my drift? This movie is so bad it tries to be hard to be like natural and in the process comes out to look like a crap sack. Just take my advice, don't even watch this movie.
