I tell you that this was the worst films of priyadarshan (giving the best cone that was also the leader of the leader), it does not have a specific story and only focuses on the body shown by the actors and the other form of comedy. I think priyadarshan is often repeating in his flicks of delightful as govinda and David dhavan had done in the past after giving other good actors also drove their listeners. So it would be good for him to reflect more on the script and try different differences in his direction. Give us more than herbs and malamal every week instead of giving duds like garam!
