I am a great fan of Nicolas Cage and I didn't think he could work on a film like this. I couldn't believe another inspection and I thought it shouldn't be bad to look at it at least once ... but believe me, it is. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen an old movie. but why they want to restore the film like this. The very basic idea of ​​a good movie is a must have a very intelligent script or should be very graphic. This film does not exist under any of these and still remains dumb. I continued to watch a movie that would look attractive at some point, but it is not good. <br /> <br /> So this film is great no for all fans of Horror films and also for Cage fans. You may show on television.
