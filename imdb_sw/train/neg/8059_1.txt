This film refers to a very young girl, Cassie, (Melissa Sagemiller) who leaves her family with heads off to become a Freshman college. One night Cassie and her friends decided to go to a wild party with a lot of drinking and playing with Cassie is riding with her boyfriend who she likes but never told her she loved him. If Cassie was driving a car, the car was stopped in the middle of the road and she could not avoid accidents and as a result there was a shortage of life with her partner. Cassie feels emotional and has a dream that causes her to talk about her boyfriend coming back and meets men who are trying to kill her and trying to find out who her real friends are, who wants to die and live here all the worries. Cassie dreams she is having made love for her boyfriend after she dies and sees another guy in her bed and is told she was wanting to have sex. This is a way out film, and not very good at all.
