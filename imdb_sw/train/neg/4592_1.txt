This movie has got me angry. I longed to beat the "scientists" and the invisible film during the period. Very, very painful to stay. Sophomoric and worries in the worst way. The good news about brain work / chemistry and quantum theory is lost in a new horse-shaped sea. The worst offenders were Ramtha and Joseph Dispenza. Mr. Dispenza tells us that many people lead a life of independence and clearly shows that he, on the other hand, lives on a high flight. Even the thoughts and attitudes that I agree with are based on a very burdensome, powerful, bold, and evangelist who I felt a desire to give. I think what made me angry, the fact that they have taken what is the best of the scientific ideas that have been proven and destroyed them by their hokum age. Much of it is a false basis for using the theory of quantum theory to the great world. For precisely, the drama and Marlee Matlin are derived from amateur and clich√© ridden. I'll take people instead of the best scientific research of Bill Bryson: "A Brief History Nearly Everything." There is so much amazing about life and the world in real science established.
