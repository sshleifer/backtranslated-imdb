This movie should be one of the worst I have ever seen on DVD! The story line could have been used if the film had more money and authors who would forbid untrustworthy events and diseases that I strongly warn parents on .... But the line of the story is like enough code. If there was something like a film-manufacturer's car it would have increased from it. I have reminded many of the quicks that have been put out of the 1960s, insufficient writing and writing. The only wise characters in the whole movie are bartender and beaver. All parts of the film, can be made easily by middle school children. I am giving this film a 1 mark if it's really bad and leaving my whole family with a sense of being deceived. My Advice-Do Not Look!
