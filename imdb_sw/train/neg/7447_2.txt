I started reading "Lorna Doone" 20 years ago and loved it altogether! It is a historic historical romance set in the 1600s when the western country was a journey of several days from London to the law and command was very difficult to implement. Unfortunately, this version of the book takes several liberties and stories and it was sad for my opinion. The values ​​and productivity of the production are the same but the way in which the story was depicted was terrible. Why does television change do so? Why do they think that thousands of book fans would like to change the story? One of the great secrets of life !!! The BBC carried out the best version which was television at Christmas in the early 1990s that I still try to track the copy! Take my advice, read the book and don't bother with this regular edition!
