Frank Sinatra, a former good and confused soldier, who lives hard and drinks hard, who returns to the town of Midwestern and reunited with his widowed brother Arthur Kennedy, was now beaten by an unloved wife of the daughter of head. Frank is involved with Dean Martin's gambling, who has not been taught as a flooze Shirley MacLaine, and he has some run by law, but what he wants to do is write and sit down with a beautiful woman. The most flexible version, with the role of MacLaine that emerges with the 'color' and the most disgraceful (drinking for it 'After You Gone' is a feature of the film, and is well-known). Director Vincente Minnelli guides them in a straightforward style, but he is an amazing and amazing spirit and many of the major events are flat or bulk. The picture seems to be very beautiful on a large mirror, with a beautiful eye for details and composition, but the story with these characters are stuck in the mark. ** from ****
