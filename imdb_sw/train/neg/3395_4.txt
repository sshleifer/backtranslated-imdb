There is nothing in this film to love me. I thought the actors slept while they were doing. That's not the way back to Stanislofsky, that's a walk-through and saying lines, I'm afraid. Kidman's performance is sad. The story is, however, for the entertainment gently if you want to focus on the worst acting.
