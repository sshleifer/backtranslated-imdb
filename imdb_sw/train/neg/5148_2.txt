There is something very wrong with this picture, and start with a script which is obvious and common. Courtney Cox has a comic artist book who runs to a small desert town after being raped twice in the capital. He is immediately beaten by a local man who seems to be very stressed (Craig Sheffer), and who seems to try a three-dimensional standard of Mickey Rourke. D.B. Sweeny is a local police, who must be there to protect and serve. At the same time, the script makes the audience who is who is good husband? The logic comes out of the window after the first ten minutes and will never come back, and there are many unanswered questions than it should have been. If you think the "Blue Desert" can be saved by the wonderful Philip Baker Hall, you will be disappointed. Its part is useless, like the whole film. - MERK
