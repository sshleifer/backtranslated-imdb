As a person who has read the book, I can say that this is very poor for the big American star Gwyneth Paltrow. There are various reasons for this. First, Emma is very bad. Yes, he is wrong, and not the most simple person to love - but the viewer should not begin to despise him. Second, Mr Knightly sent. The freezing and despair in this version is more suitable for dealing with Bronte or Gaskell than Austen, and giving us all the situation "off". Third, Samantha Morton is a very powerful actor to get into Harriet's position; and why did he look like a patient? Harriet is supposed to be blonde and grow - not looking if she will go away from spending in the next area. Fourth, the pattern is covered with cutting scenes. At the end, when Emma decides she likes Mr Knightly, it comes as it is very bad because this story has not been shown enough and done in all films. Five, what's going on, in particular, and Mrs. Elton's emphasis? He went from sound as an American actor trying to stop his inspiration at first, through half of the US going half, then returning to English at the end. Finally, this was collected last. The book and the great version of the film has ended with the wedding of Emma and Mr Knightly. This edition strikes after the wedding announcement does not really show us the celebration. For all, an unintelligent attempt. Read the book or rent of the Paltrow version instead
