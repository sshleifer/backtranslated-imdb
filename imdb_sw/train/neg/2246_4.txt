I've never seen the original version of 1954 by Judy Garland, so don't have a way to compare. Also, it has been several years, but I've found this story not available or its romance was not interesting. Movie tells a story of two lovers whose music work has come in different ways. John Norman Howard is a lost star, missing a rock on descending, introducing romance and a new sense of talent singing, Esther Hoffman. His great achievements serve to emphasize his decline. Leaders, Kris Kristofferson and Barbra Streisand, eligible for their responsibilities, but neither their chemistry nor plot did not leave many marks with me. The film seems to me for one feature, the Streisand beautiful translation of the Oscar 'Evergreen winning song. In fact, he has a strong and delightful voice.
