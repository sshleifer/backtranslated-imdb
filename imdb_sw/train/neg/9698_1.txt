There are many talented filmmakers in Germany now. No one is associated with this "film". <br /> <br /> Why does the world make investors money into something like this? You can have 10 beautiful films and this budget waste! It's not fun having seven men riding around like newborns, pretending to be funny. It's funny though it is a film producer (who happens to be an old elder group) plays a young boy. <br /> <br /> The movie is filled with the time that cries for the title of the title "You are supposed to laugh now!" It's hard to believe that this trick should be comedy. <br /> <br /> Many people really stand and left 30 minutes in the movie. I had to do it rather than waste my time ... <br /> <br /> Pain!
