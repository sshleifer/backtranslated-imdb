Much of the "Over Body Body" is so bad that I was throwing my seat out of disgrace for the characters. <br /> <br /> Eva Longoria proves that she can not make a film in this awesome comedy love, and more, that she doesn't even even during comedic. He is a sandy and angry as a soul who returns to the world to keep psychic of cooking from his beloved widow. Pastor plays with Paul Rudd, drippy and charmless, while psychic is played by Lake Bell, bringing any movie anemic energy has. I felt so much to Bell, as he seemed to be able to comic and he was working more time for the job. Unfortunately, he is on an unsuccessful work of making any film that shows Jason Biggs deserving, and he is dragged down by all others thrown as Leo DiCaprio at the end of "Titanic." "Over His Body Body" really pi ** took me away, because of his laziness and a great lack of effort. I began to think about all the interesting projects that can't earn money because a lot of money is spent on the bland craft like this. Hardly, Does Hollywood think movies like this is good enough? What? Where do fools think that the public is where? Bridge: F
