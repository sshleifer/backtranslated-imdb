It is hard to believe that this is the good of Henry Fool. It is hard to believe that the director and actors were involved in both movies. When Henry Fool is delighted, wise, interesting, Fay Grim is slow, attractive, and does not get anywhere. Where do you go? I'm broken. It is 10 years since I saw Henry Fool and many conversations and its events are still clear in my memory. Fay Grim is a painful watch. This is not the case of executives, who are good (Parker Posey) or bigger (Jeff Goldblum) - the blame is entirely dependent on the conspiracy, dialogue, and even some images (low budget is not excuse). Great desire. Sorry, I could not pay attention to the plot, I was very tired, so I was desperate ... if you enjoyed this you might not enjoy Henry Fool very much ... these two movies are absolutely nothing to do with each other ... there is no progress in The characters ... are all the deception to influence the fans of Henry Fool to watch the same series. What do I do now - Henry in a particular prison with Taliban?
