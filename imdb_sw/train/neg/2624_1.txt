Say this stinks of the film would despise skunks. As another advertiser says, this film insults anyone more than 7 years old (it is, in particular, for gay). It's bad - and not "very bad is funny" kind of way either - it's just plain bad. No, I must say: IT STINKS! (skunks of pole). From the opening names of the last names there are more than 10 seconds of this suitable movie to open your eyes. "The plot" is not available, the attribute did not exist, acting is the highest intervention "see I'm funny!" and so it continues. The fragments are placed (if they are alright) and are badly damaged, they are all very bad in front of the music and perhaps, I do not remember to think of the music you break (away from songs). <br /> <br /> Be fair to the creators, they place their cards on the table very quickly: opening credit includes the head "Also star Ertha Kitt as the voice of Betty meteor" (since as a meteor in the matter turns never say anything but making frequent laughter may be standing by Ms. Kitt from his record) and the second line of the movie makes something like: "... and scientists have found a new truth about Uranus rings." Uranus - " Anus your "geddit? geddit? huh? huh? Your Anus? Humor is true that it is cheap. It says amazing things about the "comedies" of that time because it was fully allowed for the hero deliberately shooting dead people on the street but not saying "sh * t" in a loud voice. <br /> <br /> I paid fifty pence (about $ 1,00) for this film in the sale. I feel purchased.
