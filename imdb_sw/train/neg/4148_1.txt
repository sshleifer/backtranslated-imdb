I took this movie with the intention of getting a bad movie zombie. But I had no idea that I was getting into. I started the movie and recently been pulled into a world of pain and suffering to see. I will finally know what hell is. It's this movie. For ever. This movie has no value. It didn't even have a plot. There was a progress in every area but there is no general definition why something happens. Instead of watching this film I give you a combination of close to oil and try with as many bullets as it can. You will find that the result will be better than this film. Do not even look at it. Not even seeing it is bad. I beg you. If you look at it, then it means winning.
