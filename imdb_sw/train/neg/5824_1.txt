I thought it would be at least to be very good. It was slow, discreet, and interesting. I almost sleep. There are decent songs, but there is this song at the end which is the only person he calls "Yaowwww!" when a person blows frequently on a wooden object. That said, there are some good songs, but it's not worth seeing this movie over. Go to itunes (have albums), make sure, and choose good. Half movie is a young man who makes tea. Well, that's a little salt. But you will see what I mean if you see it. That said: Don't see!
