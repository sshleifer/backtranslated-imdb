What made the idea of ​​seeing this film very interesting is the hope that it will live for the beauty of Charlotte Bronte's original classic story. I was shocked to see that this film, which was seen to be written or made very fast, had no qualifications that made the original novel. Many of the top characters among the main characters, Jane Eyre and Mr. Rochester, seemed to be lost on the screenplay or left on the floor of the cutting room. He also had no personal feelings for Jane Eyre, which makes him suffer for his trouble and win over all. Genesis Jane Eyre was a hero. The woman in this movie was not found to have a lot to win, including one of the largest parts of the story when Jane runs away with Thornfield and Mr. Rochester. His efforts to find food and lodging, his shame for begging for food, the threat of freezing to death in the cold, all from a distance to someone who loved him, in my opinion, the painful part of the story which was just left out of this film. The character of the head was dry and unacceptable. The story was bad and for those who did not read the book, I cannot imagine that this story will be very interesting. Screenplay and Instructions did not make a bit like any credit to the classic story.
