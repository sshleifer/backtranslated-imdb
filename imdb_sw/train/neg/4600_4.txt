Read all these comments on here about how this is a very good movie. Jeez, this movie was predictable and very beautiful. Acting was less than average, especially with Mckenna. I have never seen more exciting attempts to make someone "badass" on the film. O man, this film was a stop. I also read this place could be a tribal ritual. I know there are supporters of the director, but this film was just a piece of film. <br /> <br /> Script was blind, in many places acting was crippled, this movie was seamless. <Br /> <br /> O and pray for someone who was cheers. He looks very bad. <br /> <br /> The best actor in this film is probably a guy in the office position, and was only in this film for 8 minutes.
