Now don't be wrong. If you need an overview of everything that was wrong and the history of human civilization as well as the most inexpensive way to humanity, which is better to turn than a player to a pop culture doctor? If you need a healthy dose of all solid, good reason why religion is removed is important then turn to Sagan or Dawkins, not BILL MAHER for God (?)! That's a good step by itself. Maher rejects our religious history as a sense of emotional nervousness easily ignoring how his whole community, art and science has raised in it. In this film, he relies heavily on his bold and transparent skills to do his thing while trying to see erudite and wisdom. Unfortunately, his mind is not on the job. Maher makes us laugh but obviously not a bright bulb in the box. For example, he responds to the respondent (and I use this word freely as it was clear "all of the" ambushees ") to prove that Jesus' existence is a historical fact and" no, not "followed by a long-term look for a show of contempt The subject of the subject (the most disturbing device in this film) The problem is that the man was right and Maher was dead in his confirmation that Jesus was mentioned only in what he considers to be a historic gospel-suspect. I think Mr. Maher has never read modern history But people will join this pseudo document as they do the false works of other mental things like Michael Moore, and they will sound loudly and guffaw (they actually did with my display). The two, however, that the braying of the loudest and the mule occurred during approximately 70% of the time emerging that the film is dedicated to anti-Christian tirade while listening to it Aji lost a total of 10% of the voluntary symbolism of the Peace Religion described itself. Hmmm. In addition, the opposition of Islam is destructive to the listeners of hip and freedom or are afraid to laugh. Very much, any way.
