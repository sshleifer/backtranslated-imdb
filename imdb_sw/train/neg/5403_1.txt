I've given this film just one star because it was impossible to be down. <br /> <br /> Scientists have created a form to expand any creatures. In their laboratory (run under storage at L.A), it creates T-Rex. The group of industrial investigators breaks the formula and the remainder of the film is one endless leg of expulsion. In fact T-Rex (fake ball) is released and begins to wipe the cast. It has an amazing ability within 2 or 3 feet of someone without them to recognize and then occasionally bites their head. One member throws away in a police car and uses the remainder of the film to drive regardless of the city. He has a very intelligent mind that can not even make a radio. He never makes any attempt to drive at a station or a donut shop and it seems to lose without despair. T-Rex is damaged in the city, there are gun wars and buildings (surprise card) ringing, but one police car, or army, or any other visible person. Such activity should be a normal part of Los Angeles. We can only hope that the client is not available.
