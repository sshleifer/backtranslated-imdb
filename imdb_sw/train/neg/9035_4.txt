Born in the 1960s I looked at the "weekly movies of the week" in the early 70s and loved the most popular movies that were displayed frequently including "Farm Crowhaven", "Bad Ronald", "Satan's School for Girls", Kolchak Night Stalker ", etc., but this is just plain silence. This is obviously the author tries to strengthen Manson's horrible murder since the last few years. The stars of Dennis Weaver's film "McCloud" and "Duel" fame as a father who takes his family camp on the beach. The family meets some hippies who for some reason decides to threaten the family. The reason for this is never explained, and the state of Weaver's pacifistic is difficult to swallow. For God, call the police, hit their hell or something, don't stay on it. Acting is very good, impossible story, etc.. Susan Dey looks beautiful in bikini but that's about it. Ignore this if it appears on TV.
