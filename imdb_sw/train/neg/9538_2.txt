When I saw the business for this, I was seeing it. Now, forgive me, but it's been a long time since I found that I don't remember how it went. It is worth saying, the film I saw did not match the "film" that they bought. I was tired, angry, and frustrated with this movie. And if it wasn't bad, they had to wipe it even more with reggae bad music. Not music to put the mood for a terrible movie, eh mon? I think if you haven't seen a business (or trailer, I think) you can think this is some of the hot stuff. For my money, business was the best way.
