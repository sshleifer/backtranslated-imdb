This is the worst in the world of the movie. Once again it doesn't work since. The murderer still kills for fun. But this time he kills people who make films about what happened in the first movie. Which means that it's a stupid movie forever. <br /> <br /> Don't look at this. If you value one hour of value during this film then don't look at it. You will need to ask the director and someone alongside you that has made it. Because it is not just combining nature makes the fear, action, and crime. Do not let your children see this. A child, a young child or a young boy, this film has the same effect on people.
