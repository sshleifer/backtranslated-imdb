David David Lynch, an old and old man who was taken to South Park, gives us the distress of the clich√©s in the middle of urban middle-class families. The father is a monster of leather which has three teeth and a rounded circular hole that describes the horrible voices of horror, the son and the mother are very scared, living creatures that are terrorist through way of life. The number of senseless characters is brought into the series. <br /> <br /> Lynch is unknown to its comedies (for example, on air, the Wild's in Heart), and I am very unhappy with the comedies in general. However, there were several events in Dumbland that made me cry out loud. There are some of the artistic models of animation - where Lynch brings many kinds of responses to its characters in the form of an opposite picture of the opposite (which is not completely different in Dumbland). I believe Lynch was trying to give his audience a direct player, if they are concerned, with animation here. Surprisingly, he chose to follow the latest stages of ultra-low-brow humor (ie many Farrell films) while adding social aspects of basketball and basketball events and great humor. While the mixture doesn't work very well here, it's not something like Lynchian. <br /> <br /> Should see with Lynch fans.
