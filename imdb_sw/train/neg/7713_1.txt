I knew this film thought it was so bad, so I went into it with that prospect. I found that it was so bad it was a murderous killing. The theme of the white theme is funny for 10 seconds, until you realize there is nothing wrong about it except its quality of intentional denial. Seeing objects planted by tomatoes is about 30 seconds. There is no cunning or amazing thing about the film except for the premise. It can develop a 3-4-minute sketch, but this is not just a feature film with any stretch of thought.
