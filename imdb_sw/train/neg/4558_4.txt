In fact, I was disappointed in the "deadline." Good strength of the head and Powerful Attraction, but I don't think it is released. What was it? Interested in the main character of reuniting with its Native roots? Or, more likely, it was his need to overcome his fear of death. But, he was not placed as a man who has lived his life with fear - it seems like his life had gone well, but since the doomsday is approaching it must now begin to worry. I did not come to buy. At the same time, the characters assisted in the film did not seem to have the requirements that are connected to the above story. They were all doing their thing, doing the same with the main character. Also, what was considered as a "curse" seemed more like unfortunate. Who is the family member? Why? When? Finally, why didn't he plan to stay in his home all day on his birthday? That is my opposition, but I liked the shots of Seattle, the movie is good, acting it was good when not better.
