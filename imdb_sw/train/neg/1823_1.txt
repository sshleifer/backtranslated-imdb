Jack Black's character, Tim Dingman, "Dreamer" with envy, gets rich and successful in the idea of ​​the spray of "Vapoorize" which is pulled into a doggie elephant, makes poo disappear. For a short time I was hoping that Vapoorize was a real product so I could beat it on this "stinker" film and make it disappear into thin air too. Though envy is not the worst film I have seen in the last 12 months (that goes to Cat in Hat), it does not get second second honor. It is not funny, not sad, nothing. "Stinkeroo" real !! !!!!! 0.2 out of 10!
