this is a typical Indian garbage which looks like a cinema, as the Indians can boast that we have a great cinema, even though it is even worse. <br /> How other poor countries have films and real characters who oppose their community views and we just keep pushing the trash. watch Russia, Iran, China and South America, watch the talented films they have and we get a crap like Kisna! <br /> <br /> Find real people, it is not surprising that the international community generally laughs movies.
