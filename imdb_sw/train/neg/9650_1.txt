Maaan, where do I start with this bad movie of the movie. Bad bad news say. I don't know the director was thinking when he made this film. Namaste London was a very enjoyable movie to be honest. Even the voice of sound was good. But in this .... my good ... for the film that should be of music .... The songs are soooo bad. AR Rahman must be a music director. From two key actors the best works would be done by the director. Even though the first half takes, the last 30 hours of the movie are the same. Exhibitions from Salman and Ajay save the movie from being a general catastrophe. <br /> <br /> Check if you have nothing better to do. The last good movie from sound i look (and I look at their load) is Dev D and Wake Up Sid.
