This movie is not suitable for the beaten film. The discussion is flat, filled with the lines caused by cliche and released by amateur actors who seem to read the script for the first time. Choppy, shaky, the style of the film is the cheap imitation of "Tap" style visual effect. The characters don't even do as a normal person. For example, a character who looks for his twin sister in his home runs his way through the front door, surrounds all the house of fear and crying and even calls his sister's name to see if she is at home. When? You would think she had just buried her sister instead of looking for her. Too many ways for his childhood. Most of the many pieces that are needed are the most common signs of an amateur director. In fact it is funny to look at the many shots of a woman driving her car down the road, on the road, near this corner, up here, over there, oh the side view, now the front view. Already ready. You would think you are watching TV for Solaris! Movie terrible. 0 out of 100. I feel sorry for anyone who spent money to make this film or watch it.
