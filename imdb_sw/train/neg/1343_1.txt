We bought this film from a shop called Poundland. We were looking for more inspiration as we bought the film without Accepting Big. We expected this film to be very powerful so we could make it and put it on the tube. KILEKA, this was amazing. BORING is a great word that comes to mind. Bad effects and script is not enough to look at. The woman's body seems to have been struck at a good time in a horrible attempt to keep the viewer interested. However, it makes you wonder, do you? Did they budget to make him remove his clothes? If so, I would like to ask for feedback! It looks like a private film, the shots are not intertwined with each other and the function of the camera is an amateur that makes our remakes of bad movies look professional. I can't believe that this is sold as a commodity. <br /> <br /> ITI is BORING and UGLY look. The characters are bad and there is no degree of profession about it. No words to describe how terrible.
