I would like to have 20 root roots than passing this film again. Prince of Annoying, Myles Berkowitz, has lost nearly two hours of my life with this pisudo-cold piece. The only exciting thing in this mess is Mr. Samaha who has rejected off the patter camera about tits and ass. Berkowitz takes a great idea and finds it in the dust. It's a choppy and badly done, with a definite attempt to make it appear to be secular or pleasant. It is not. I rarely feel that the film was a waste of films (or tape), but this succeeds in that difference. If the date recommends watching this film, use it.
