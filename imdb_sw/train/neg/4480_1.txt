I would like to start by saying that I did not watch this film for the first time with great expectations. It was suggested to me by a friend who has a great taste in movies, and "MTV" was hit on the front cover so I didn't have much expectation. I was expecting it to be a tearful player, very big but at least effective. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> First, I would like to start that I have never read the book or look at other versions of the movie. <br /> <br /> Acting is my main gripe and film. For God is AWFUL. The greatest girl is pretty mediocre, but compared with the rest of her cast is Maryl Streep. The main "Hero", Heath, is very clear. He can sing beautiful clich√©d songs, but that's about it. His work broke at the time of "sad" for the worst in the points that I started just in laughter. Isabel's girl was very beautiful, and the brother was just a flat character played by an actor who could not show any emotion. And when he tried it, it failed so much. Neil Patrick Harris was a good actor alone, playing Edward, although it was obvious that the trend was bad because even he did not live according to what I saw him doing. Oh, and the father wasn't half bad for my memory, but he was in the movie for a small amount of time I can't remember. The story itself was not very good. Decrease more than you can imagine. Predictable story (Until the end, which I did not really understand). WHEN the characters are not real to them ... It is generally not interesting or compelling, there is nothing that we have never done before it is done properly, and nothing is worth looking here. <br /> <br /> Finally you think that tears. It didn't do anything like that. In the end is not quite complete, almost feels like after considering. In fact, I had to ask my friends WHY THE END HAS BEEN HAPPENED, who told me I must look on my face of "Waiting, what were they saying? Never a good sign. Editing may be the worst I have seen, although I understand that fade-ins-fade-outs are made because this was originally for TV, but that's not the real reason. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is just waste. I am a good man, I cried during the two pieces of the Simpsons. I haven't cried for this trick, even close. True, this film is not suitable for your time. If you want to see the eyes look elsewhere.
