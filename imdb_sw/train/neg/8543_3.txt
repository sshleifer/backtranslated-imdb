I agree, I had to hurry up with this uninstalled DVD after 30 minutes - nothing happened, and everyone described the "plot." But anyone has mentioned the opening area - the knife's knife is beaten by the wig and standing on the grass in the front yard! I think the child who was cruel did it, I never made it clear. Really open a trippy. <br /> <br /> I would like this to be better written or thought film, because what we were left with like a good daft and movies that doesn't mean a movie "clever", is just a film that was misused. I would like to see a cleaner version and if there is any image missing, I'd like to see if it helps. Otherwise, this is an unusual odd film that is best if it is sent out quickly!
