I paid this movie because it is not just because its gay theme but the idea of ​​playing a role had attracted me. I was surprised that it was a shot in San Francisco since I lived near the SF. And in fact it was good to see the shots of the Castro district (though the castro to me is more attractive to male gay than the woman). But beyond that I can recommend this movie. The characters have not developed for me to take care of and eventually began to reach "playing" "I was already bored out of my mind." And the role of playing the game I saw was embarrassing to look. Acting leaves something to want. Without saying I did not finish the film. I would like to fly this.
