Lauren Bacall and Charles Boyer do not get the correct chemistry here in this film in 1945. There is a good story here about Axis trying to get coal to use for the upcoming war. Unfortunately, this part of the story is not emphasized. Instead, we are faced with the Boyer's claim. By the way, Bacall is like Britain like Vladimir Putin. The real work of kudos goes to the former Oscar winner Katina Paxinou. As was the case with his unforgettable Pilar in 1943 Oscar winner, "For Nani Searching," Paxinou again has a Spanish revolution but this time he is a two-time winner of the pro-Franco group. He is a very bad character here, in particular, when he drives a 14-year-old child out of the window. He believed that Boyer had given the child a valuable equipment to hide.
