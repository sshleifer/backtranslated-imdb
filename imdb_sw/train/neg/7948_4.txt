"The seventh sign" lends a lot from the "baby of Rosemary" and "omen" (in fact combines these two stories). Even his name remembers Bergman "the seventh seal". However, it begins well, with everything scattered around the world, and parallel, a conspiracy of a separate-difference with Moore's husband trying to save the poor boy (who killed his parents who were brothers and sisters) from the death penalty. when, all Christian and Jewish religions are called rescue (even a Jew of Wandering is associated), which makes the verses sometimes surprisingly (you have ever gone to Sunday school but they taught me that God was love!). The IMHO area, is a brief discussion between the priest John Heard-who does not seem to take things seriously, the worst was not given the most important part because his back work is very valuable - and a little Jew. <br /> <br> Demi Moore probably registered the same desire as former husband Bruce Willis: saving the world.
