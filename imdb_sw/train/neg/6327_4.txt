I thought this film would be better then it was. It seemed like a spoon of a rich spy, and began to remind me of Pleasantvil, but this film came short. <br /> <br /> The plan is only for ignorance. The KGB and the Soviet Union in Russia have begun to spy school to instruct their spies how to act as Americans, but the city that they have put in it for training is just a little, so it gets two rows from the US for ingredients up. I don't know, but this looks just out there. It gets an unusual truth when next to anyone in this Russian city speaks with Russian emphasis. Someone has come to the job of stealing. <br /> <br /> Also, for this comedy is a painful pain. There is one, two advertising ads, and not something to sing and play on. The last film will be likely to sleep. And, like a spinning punch, this film is very suitable for the US making me sick. The movie continues to speak often, the US is God and Russia is the devil. This is a kind of desperate campaign against the Japanese in World War 2. It is a film that makes everyone think that the United States is full of itself. <br /> <br /> This gets 4 out of 10, and I'm kind of. It should get one, but the dance area was amazing, but again it has been cut off for a long time to be true.
