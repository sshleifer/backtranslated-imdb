I have a high level of endurance for the crap, so I looked forward to this. Not discouraged. Apparently according to the old Carmilla of Sheridan Le Fanu, it follows the father and daughter hunting the female vampire who, incidentally, happens with them. Then we have Santa Claus (or Great, if he likes to be called here) runs the random zombies. Did I mention there was a zombie outbreak? The dead return to life but no one seems to be very worried. We have the zombies of the construction worker, the zombies of soldiers and the school zombies of StTrinian. It seems that Santa Claus is looking for his daughter who has turned into a vampire. Wait there vampires, the girl is in a steep park and Carmilla is her nurse, or is she? Zombies are back with the madness of Santa. Sex, I love vampires and I love zombies but I especially like sex sex. Nothing like cunnilingus was done to get the juices that turn out. Where will we see Vampires fighting zombies? What? He is a vampire or he is a lunatic? Or both? Is Carmilla a sexy vampire sexy lesbian or nurse? More than cunnilingus, you will not have enough cunnilingus. Here come the St.Trinian zombies. Chainsaw time! Sex more lesbians then zombies kills and eating vampires. I think the zombies won, or they? Plot? Who needs a plot when you get lesbian vampires and school zombies? And cunnilingus?
