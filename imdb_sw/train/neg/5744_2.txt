This movie was bad, just put it. It was too bad to register with IMDb to warn you about its risks. <br /> <br /> I am an expert on the fear of hate, for se. I have watched "Redneck Zombies", "Women's Psychological House", "Party Massacre II" and many others. I know my schlock. And I know this film catches. The third picture of the film includes people who are scared from one side of the screen to the other. When they do not run, they are spouting not sequitur lines, without feeling or motivation. When executives start to accept, the trend falls to pieces. There were shots under the angle-jarring; I thought Leif Jonker had a trip to the foot. He used the so-called "Leif Maneuver" several times: namely, to eliminate something of interest as an amateur. It seems that the film workers could not get up early enough of the sun film, so they were made to the sun ... and played for reverse. For this lazy direction, you are attracted to the last gory area. The only thing you can think is that the last five minutes were made before the first and thirty minutes. <br /> <br /> If you want a good film, bad "Riki-Oh" or basic "Died Live." If you're a buff of schlock, and you're looking for a challenge, make "dark" go. It 's a' movie- <br /> <br /> Vampire: Diest time!
