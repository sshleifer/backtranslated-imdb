This was the worst movie I ever saw Billy Zane. I understand that this film was mainly showing new advisers, who did well for adults, but above all, movies were not trusted. For all weapons, you would think the police would intervene. Even the coins that the worm in Sean was stupid. Sean's way recognizes the coin is a bug, it was not true. It looks like this film was hit together quickly. Bad work. Get the best author. <br /> <br /> Counting until the end did not agree with anything. It took a long time to fight. And it's unfortunate that every time Billy would hit Sean, he could be out of bullets. Once, I can believe, but not twice. Of course, Billy's behavior was goofy. It was stupid when Sean moved her out at the end. It was like a comedy. Bad! Bad! Bad!
