This movie was bad. I could stay awake that way. I can't see this film again if I was paid. The so-called fear of events in it was increadable predictable and more played. There was nothing about this film that would make it original or worth $ 7.50 I paid to see it. Don't go see it, don't rent it, don't read about it online because of any of these things will be the perfect waste of your time. Sarah Michelle Geller gave a destructive performance and must see her own shame by losing her good name and this movie. Shame on your Sarah to be associated with this awesome, awesome film. Modern scary, no need to see it.
