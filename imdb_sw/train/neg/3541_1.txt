What we have here is a film about how to find money and revenge can weaken your soul ... or something like that. Guy Ritchie, a well-known director for his kind of gangster, laughs more than he can chew with this. Its use of modern film films to tackle the individual's self-indulgent theme and swallow his pride, being good to his enemy & giving all his money falls flat on his face. When Jason Statham's behavior does not fear Ray Liotta, it seems to run Liotta enough things to hit his head off at the last location. Why? Basically you can not set up as a character of Liotta, who may have entered his center in life by showing a kind of non-violent character seen in the film, then just dismissing suicide for anything more than a smile of kindness on the face of Statham's behavior. Before anyone starts to say that I'm missing the point ... I'm not. Do I get it right? Opt out of the rich effort and you will find true happiness and inner peace. Be good to your enemy and this will confuse him in personal destruction. This seems to be the essence of the movie and this itself is not a bad foundation for the story, although it is not the original. The problem is that Ritchie just don't have the skills as a film manufacturer to pick up. When even Guy Ritchie is aware of this, he is tired of the story and begins to enter the red dirt: The situation where Statham is hit by the car - Why? Playing certain events like an amazing color animation ... why, why? <br /> <br /> There are many threads and unwanted questions left at the end of the film you can get all of 2001-ish about it and try to make them out, or just accept that no response & viewer will interpret things in their own way. I myself? I was very tired and the voice of the glory of the film I didn't care. In fact the damage could not come so fast that I did not have to stay through this psychological trick. <br /> <br /> Losing two hours of my life.
