In Lit. The class we just finished the book, Hatchet, and this movie is not like the book. (1) Brian never ate worms in the book. (2) did not know the name of the experiment. (3) His mother was cheating her father in a car that is not in the forest that anyone can see. (4) A woman who loves and does not have black hair, has a blonde. Now for non-fictional films: (1) A thirteen-year-old man cannot blow his fist through a window on one punch. And for the act, the child who played Brian was an awesome actress. However, I believe that the environment was surprising, although I am very skeptical of the director even reading the book. This game is good if you haven't read the Hatchet book, and Gary Paulsen, but if you have, then start a complaint letter to the director.
