"Cut" is a film about film filmmakers. It is very much in the form of "Laughter", surprisingly, self-fearful expression which, for me at least, falls because of all its sounds, it is still just a horrible movie of horror, similar to its films. But it is not without his gifts. Well, one charm however. Molly Ringwald was as strange as an American American actor who loved every minute of working with an Australian amateur film staff. He was very persuasive to try to believe it was not an act, although everyone involved with "Kata" said he was good to work with. :-) Overall, any area of ​​lobby, moving or photography was great. Everyone else, however, pretended to be equal to many timber. However, "Cut" has some laughing, a few buckets of some (some of these are amazing gruesome), and finally it is just another bad horrible film.
