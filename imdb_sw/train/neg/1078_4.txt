A lawyer left by Rick Magruder (Branagh) is drunk from a party that deals with his company one night and has a meeting with a woman named Mallory Doss (Davidtz), who was a party servant and apparently lost his car. Rick runs a woman at her home and there she finds that her car is already standing there, apparently by her father, Dixon Doss (Duvall). Rick and Mallory walk into the house being charged about the situation when Mallory would not defend themselves before Rick, and then spend the night with him. <br /> Rick wakes up in the morning and Mallory meets him a day later, asking him to make a suit against his father because of his dangerous behavior. Rick, who is very excited to Mallory and is ready to do anything for him, succeeds because Dixon was tested and sent to prison, but when he was opened by his friends in the area, Rick finds himself in trouble, trying to protect himself and his children from the dangers he knew brought life.
