It's a waste of time and money! My laughter and I saw this film - after seeing the preview and imagine "it can be funny". WRONG! This movie is almost 90 minutes too high. Vendors are locked in an invalid script and cannot enter. Jokes are weak and tired, and even see Wilson naked back can redeem any part of this film. Special effects ..... not. Half I was expected to see connecting with the standing wires in its flying events. And when the effects of people can fail to run faster than the speed-of-fighting or fighting events, they were covered everything with a vortex of swirling screens caused - which hid the worst effects. Wilson's sidekick was an excuse for a man and Wilson did not have a chemistry with either an or an office worker. Sex scenes was not sexy and funny scenes was not funny. I think I expected too much from these actors. There were no sympathetic characters, so I ended up taking care of the jumping on any of them. The only memorable performances were children who played Bedlam and G-Girl as young - at least they had a certain chemistry. In general, the super stinko movie - I can not even recommend if the lease - would still lose money!
