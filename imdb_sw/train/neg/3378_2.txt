When this film was released I had seen the Chorus Line on a 4-step stage, and I was looking forward to a long-term production of a story story. My wife and I were hours before the box office opened the day when the film was released. It was not just a disappointment, it was kick in the stomach. <br /> <br /> First, the story was "transferred out," to say, by linking the scenes not in the theater barriers. Those that are closed are a large part of the meaning and the result of the story. The second & third together (make your own command): one of the original songs, and the number of drums, was removed; The song that was not in the production stage was added. Say what? I'm confused! The only reason I gave this film 2 star instead of 1 is my reputation for talent and hard work of artists. Now I have seen the Chorus Line on the 6th step, and I won't see you six times before you die. It is well written, with amazing music, and true stories of the heart. If you want to see music that includes a large "animal animal" search, I recommend all Jazz. If you want to see the Chorus Line story, look at the step.
