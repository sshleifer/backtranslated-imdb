This movie deserves more than 1. But I give one because most fan-frick boys have given 10 and cause it to get a rating that will take over the top 100 list. Its stupid stupid worship and many fan of fricken fans are ridiculous. These are the types that may still laugh at Chuck Norris and still say "I am rick james b!" No matter what age or you have found. I'm afraid to hear "I'm tired of the MFn snakes in this MFn flight" from now on people trying to be funny. Its conspiracy crappy crap acting etc. Its the best movie bad movie, but still gotta accept its bad movie <br /> <br /> Waiting for Marine star John Cena if you want to see a real movie
