This film did not follow the story line of the film. All the interesting features in the book were not even on the film. They finished making it the "middle" of the Disney movie "crush" story between Meg and Calvin. It was so bad that Hillary Duff played that part, or one of the likes. This movie was nothing more than an insult to the mind and the epistle of the book. I can't believe that Disney can leave and make such a basic efficiency. If you have ever read the book, I think you agree that it can easily be made to the movie "Lord of Rings" alike. This movie should never be able to use the name of Wrinkle in Time. It's done wrong.
