Let me be clear about this movie. I did not watch this film because of the plot, it looks for the sex scenes of saucy. To say, this film is so very bad god I flip between the pure joy of seeing the divine body of Traci (Mandy Schaffer) and cringing my eyeballs for the plot of the plot. Spoiler Alert The first area of ​​the movie has already been stuck. When both finished, they showed what they had done ... and the woman built a WOMEN OF SHE IN SHE. What kind of screwball director who would do this kind of mistake? And in another area, Traci gets beating his teacher's teacher and stabbing him with a ship, and then swimming away, and no one city police accused immediately. I mean HELLOOOOO? IN GLOVE IN SHE? HIS HONESTY EVERYTHING EVERYTHING GOD! After this, it becomes worse, every time Mandy is near, there is a "effect" of the sound-sounding effect that looks like a cat in hissy fit. It is also a real pity Rosanna Arquette is in this film. I feel real sorry for him to have a star in this small budget less soft-porn no brainer. Same goes to Jürgen Prochnow, who is also unfortunate to the stars in this film. All in all, 2/10.
