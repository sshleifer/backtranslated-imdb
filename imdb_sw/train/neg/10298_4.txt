Lynne Ramsey makes photographs capture, and Samantha Morton can mention feelings and signs. It is therefore drag to discover its talent lost on this lovely, courageous lark. Ramsey cannot bring Calla. His experiments are extremely arty and oblique. Regularly his camera stays on the long shots of the tough actress as if the Morton lost outlook could be characteristic. We are in the odor of the fun Warholian fun: for a film that has a minute of restraint on the bugs walking on the floor, you can imagine it can get round to make it its main character. But what if you talk too often? Without the novel interior, Morlo Callar is not a person. Little wonder Ramsey has Morton often causes. It said, the first ten minutes were made very much, beaten and edited as my hopes increased. To give the film a lot: it knows how to make a promise, if not how to put any.
