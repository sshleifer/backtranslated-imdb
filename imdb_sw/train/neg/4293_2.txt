"The rain player" released in 1956 - has many executives of his time. Katharine Hepburn, Bridges Lloyd, and Burt Lancaster to be the players of the code. Nor can they save this completely melodrama style. First of all, Hepburn is a horrible shock as a spinster shy - despite its beauty as an actor, even he can pull this. He is so strong to be as faithful as this small amount, and he was too old for that part. Lancaster on actions for extreme, and Earl Holliman is also a hammy way and comes far more like Jethro Clampett. The only bridges and Corey Wendell are believed to be growing on a little cast - but even they can just do it very much. It seems like the 1950s was when Katharine Hepburn wanted to spread his wings as an actor, and that's good. He just made a bad choice here. Fortunately for his fans (I have among them) he did not make many of them. In spite of a planned A list of good production standards, it does not work.
