I, like many people, saw this film on the theater when it first appeared in '97. It was less than a low-film film, certainly not "Catholic" that all these "Titanic" fanboys like to do it like. First, DiCaprio is an awesome actor regardless of how you look. People like him because of his looks. His work "skill" basically includes a lot of cheesy lines and try to act sexy. Secondly, the film itself had an amazing and simple plot: the girl loves the boy, the ship in the sink, many pictures of love afterwards. Anyone with IQ over 50 will see that this is not ingenious in any way. And not the original. With the director saw the need to bring it back to 3+ hours. I was able to strengthen within 1 hour barrier without losing any plot. In conclusion, "Titanic" is the most reserved movie to date. Why was so much attention and money is beyond me.
