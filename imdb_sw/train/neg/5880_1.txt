The movie begins slowly when we get to the movies we thought it looked good but after 5 hours we were out of our minds and wondered what kind of film we came to see, I don't like this film and would not recommend to anyone, the best part of the night was when the alarm and The lights come out because the project was broken because we thought we could go home. this should be one of the worst films that ever we had run or thought with many people in the real RAN movies out of the last doors because it was so garbage. I am surprised that no one has gone earlier than that. if you go and see you make sure you have something to do, you should continue to see it.
