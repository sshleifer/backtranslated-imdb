Release of Alejandro Amenabar of Abre los Ojos, but this time with a living mask, breathing as inspiration. With the good sound of English voice sounds, we are faced with Tom Cruise's performance, as usual, and depth of zero. Yes, the character is known for its persona, but usually we are given certain characteristics under that to hold our interests. His indoctrination call ignores any power of evil that may be between his character and Cruz or Diaz. There is a working exercise that involves using masks to free the actors in order to enhance their presentation of behavior with words and language meaning. Cruise is only emphasizing its pain as an actor. Can you see the original Amenabar of 1997 opened your eyes!
