How this film gets 6.7 rating is more than trust. It is worth nothing more than 2.0 and clearly should have a title of over 100 IMDb films of all time. The National Treasury is a hatred of national intelligence and yet another attack was committed to American and Hollywood viewers. Critics described holes of the plot can drive a 16-wheel drive through. <br /> <br /> I like this documentary to be good ... "Nicholas Cage is good." Come to the people, no wonder people around the world think Americans are stupid. This should be stupid, a terrible movie that I have ever seen. If you want to see a decent film this season, consider Kinsey, The Woodsman, Million Dollar Baby or Sideways. The National Treasury unfortunately received more publicity than these films. I bet many read this they have not even heard about them, since some have not yet released much. <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage is a bright actor - when he is in the right movies. Once I have got Cage to lose its strong talents in the worst films of mental intelligence like Con Air, Rock and Face-Off. When his talent has been used well as in Adaptation of Charlie Kaufman he is a wonderful actor. Underneath - I would like to feed my hand on a piece of wood than to have these feelings again.
