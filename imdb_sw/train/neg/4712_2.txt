This view is more likely, more serious, more than a generic bunch of generic I've seen in children's programs that actually succeeded. Leadership behavior, Johnny, when I understand that the baby stands, doesn't like it or even tolerated. Joke is lazy, crossing (ie, "Who!" He did not see that coming "gag." Come, that was not exciting at first, even not good) and lack of any kind of magic or inspiration. And finally ... it's very clear to look. While children are not very important for artistic talents, they still prefer eye candy. I can't stand watching the show, because by the way, style art is just ... total. Poor, in fact. Surprise just plain. <br /> <br /> I can't stand that this gets too much air. When I understand that feelings can be a little bit enough and I shouldn't have my hope on returning ... I miss the old cartoons. Bringing the Dexter's Laboratory, The Powerpuff Girls ... nothing but this trick. I think it's just thinking you want even. <br /> <br /> Just set, I advise you not to waste your time in this show. I believe that very good cartoons can be interested in adults, too. And this does not cut it.
