As a Kalamazoo woman who was happy with the city I was expecting to see this film. But, it's a problem! Although the values ​​and productivity of production are not bad, the script is bad, the plot is untrue, and the matter is troubling. The main message of this film is that women are nothing without men and children. I can't believe how regressive is in the attitude of women. What? The author lived under the rock? Although I enjoyed seeing my favorite city on the big screen, I will not show you this film for anyone. It's awesome. It is a shame to a city that is called after it.
