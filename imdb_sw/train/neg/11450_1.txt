I see an early preview of this movie and I hope to have time to edit in any way that they can improve on it before out of August 3. It's star Andy Samberg from Saturday Night Live as 'Fire' Rod Kimble. He has a young man in a small town who wants to be an interesting person like his late father. When we meet him, jumps a truck of letters on mo-ped, yes, mo-ped, and almost makes it. This will be worthy of 'Jackass' movie if you didn't trust trying to do it. Isla Fisher plays the little girl with the most mature-near door, Denise. He seems to be like Rod enough to join his 'crew'. Jorma Taccone (also SNL) has a half brother, Kevin, who writes stunts and camcorder. Sissy Spacek has a mother of Rod, Marie. He remarried Frank Powell, played by Ian McShane. Frank is a real tough guy who likes to beat Rod in some of the true class of drag. It is clear that Rod will not be able to get the honor of Frank until he kills him. We see Frank needs $ 50,000. The heartbeat and Rod determines to raise money just so that he can 'beat his ass' once he is healed, and manifests himself. The long fall down on the side of the mountain prompts Rod 'to go great' on one loss. Rod puts out to earn money for money to make stunts that would make you enter if you have seen it in real life. As a human-lighting lamp - on the birthday of children. There were those who had shown who could laugh more than stunts. While only hope and all the money is lost, together comes a sponsor who saves the day to get buses to 15 schools Rod wants to fly. Finds exclusive advertising rights and sets telephone lines to get input. Rod finds new clothes with a real motorcycle. The whole city is turning out and the world is coming in. Does he make a jump? What? Finding a girl? Do they raise $ 50k? What? Frank gets his ass beaten by Rod? Wait until this 90-minute movie comes out of the video to find out.
