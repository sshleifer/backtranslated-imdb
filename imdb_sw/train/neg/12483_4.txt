This kind of film as Conan's Barabarian, but for more sex, rape and murder. There is a conspiracy somewhere under this deception but the artists do not do a good job to show it, which is a shame because 'can' be a good story. Richard Hill gives a strong performance in the lead role, such as man - who sadly was not found in anything else to remember. Fighting chances are not too bad - I love the deathstalker method lets you take his sword to 'drink' the blood of its victims - and there is a lot of dirt and sex in order to reduce the overall level of worldwide. <br /> <br /> All in all, not good - but not necessarily bad ...
