Ted V. Mikel of the Dead Sea 2 is 103 minutes of an interesting movie swill. The program is a pretty mixed mix of casual business among people who crawl into a cat's food when cats, cats and dogs are looking for some of this cat's food. Looking at this film, I started looking for any kind of distortion, anything to assure myself that I was doing something else rather than losing my mind out. <br /> <br /> Several events persist for too long, as the characters take forever to do things simple. I have heard that Mr. Mikels does not like to use cuts in many times, fearing that they will confuse his audience. I don't know if this view is "avant-garde" or just "stupid." Try as I did, I did not pretend to be concerned about any characters in the massive cast, as well as the possibility of the old men who are factory keepers. Most of the cast is a group of talented people who are not worried to learn the words of "Grace Grace" before singing on the camera. Although the blame should probably go to inappropriate voice quality, since I have just heard about 80% of the talk while watching DVD. <br /> <br /> This is probably the worst movie to be killed. I have listened to the snippets of commentary, and Mr. Mikels comes as a wonderful old man, what was he doing doing this kind of garbage? I would like to hear the information from the elders who were forced to lie a shirt on the conveyor belt of the metal waiting to be down. Movies that I have suddenly disliked seem better. I congratulate the best music for Excalibur, and a solid Dawn of the Dead. I need to go do something, nothing. Don't see this film.
