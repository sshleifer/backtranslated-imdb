First of all, Zorie Barber (Zeke), can be one of the worst actors I've ever seen. As a character required to be a hip, a Village writer on military art and boasting to be wonderful, why is he so powerful, high, and terrible? Did he know anything about his behavior before starting the film? Is the director? Is not the military art that teaches discipline? Besides, this film lacks the purpose and joke of the paralysis and appearance-already caused by humor. Use in toilet? <i> Trainspotting. Confidential? Hmm. A quick list on Ridgemont High </ i>, <i> America's Pie </ i>, the list goes.... ... "and 30 seconds later Mia says" why is this your business? "Bad editing: at least five minutes of films are lost in NYC traffic shots. It is also impossible to believe that four male characters will be a group of powerful friends in any world. I can't comment on what makes everyone laugh, but if you like the bottom face, the basic humor of the bathroom and insults, by all means, enjoy. If you want something good but for those lines, see <i> Boomerang. If you want to solid what-goes to a romantic comedy, go to <i> Tao's Steve </ i. But anyone who thinks <i> missed </ i> is a wizard and a proper display of dating, well, I can't totally agree.
