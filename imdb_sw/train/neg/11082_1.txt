I know it's Gimmick's Power-Rangers and deals with children of 7 years old but in fact why they were taking it seriously with this movie? If they are going to write a plot with crayons, at least they have the skill to do it. It's kind of hilarious as you look at this. We have a common family filled with activated characters (father of war who lost his wife and claims himself to LOLOL), children of air-conditioning trying to be hard to fill stereotype but fail to act badly, and disgusting on a non-purpose film but filling The camera position. Interesting things! However, the real time comes closer to the end when the father-war and criminals-criminals are trying to work on the fight against the sword, but then they don't even know one of them know how (probably because there is no chance in the journalists' budget), so comes with this American type of gladiator to run into. LOL. <br /> <br /> 1/10 rating because they are trying to treat this seriously.
