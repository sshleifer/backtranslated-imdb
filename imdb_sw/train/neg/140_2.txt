Valentine is a bad movie. This is what I thought of: <br /> <br /> Acting: It's very bad. Katherine Heigl can't do it. Others were not good. <br /> <br /> Stories: The story was the same, but it could be further developed. This movie was able to become a great film, but failed. <br /> <br /> Music: Yes, some music was very good. <br /> <br /> Genesis: Not original. Name 'Paige Prescott' Identify Prescott? Underneath below: Don't see Valentine. It's a really stupid film. <br /> <br /> 1/10
