This movie is now my measurement that all other movies will be compared ... as it was, "it was as stupid as Revolver?" I was also in the audience of the Toronto Film Festival last night where a room filled with more than 2000 people came out quietly after having two minutes of chaos. Jason Stratham would have been extraordinary if he had a purpose. Within the first 10 minutes he gave Andre 3000 and Big Pussy (the name Soprano) that makes NO know all the time! Then there is a shot and then there is Ray Liotta wearing a shiny bikini, then there is some animation, Ray Liotta's honeycomb, lots of bullets, dental teeth, the gallery wants to be a demonstration and more of the shy Liotta has made every laugh. For I don't know quite the answer that he sought ... not 5 times however. Everyone in this movie thinks they are smarter than the average bear and Guy Ritchie thinks he is Yogi to carry the body. The story lines could not be found anywhere but reinforcing was out of sight! The only way this film could be bad is if Madonna herself was in it.
