Standing for his long-standing movie gets the way to come close to the 90th mark. Good sets are here and all that made the production of Hamer trademark, but Paris sank in the mist is a sign of impunity for destruction. The story is obvious and can be inserted into twelve words so there is nothing expected and nothing worth more than 5% of your attention is expected. <br /> <br /> Lead it as heavy as direct transfer from play game, administrators are more complicated as net data (ok this is a Hamer feature, sometimes it's better in the whole package). My conclusion: this movie is garbage, not worth the time I spend that evening. Eternal life is a boring thing and I should be hoping that boys who have a software program in Cinemath√®que will know better.
