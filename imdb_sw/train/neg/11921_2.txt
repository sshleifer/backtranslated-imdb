I can put this film up to 20 words or less. The way is also impossible to line the story with the possibility of being funny but instead falls flat on his face. See, 19 words, however, I never really shine this star with just one star but instead decided to beat the stars up to two stars due to the fact that Julie Bowen has a hot cigarette and provides enough eye candy to get the DVD out of the machine. to beat for M80. My advice, get $ 4.00 lease fees you would pay for this film and send me to the original before thanking you for saving you time and frustration for having to stay through the fall of this train, or you want to send me a $ 50.00 fee for replacement you would have been charged with Take your twelve gage to use this garbage as a shooting practice of skeet.
