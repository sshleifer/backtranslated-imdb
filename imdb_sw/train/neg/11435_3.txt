I would like to know more about this film when I used it. I would like to put it in my queue on the basis of Heather Graham and its powerful character as an actor (IMHO). While the parts of the movie were interesting, many films felt, changed, or otherwise throwed or could be predictable. Not to mention why ICK's most people think sibs were a couple ... I don't care how big a part of the story story which is, still felt a little, um, gross. And Charlie, for a theologian, certainly does not seem to be very well known and signals from others Homo sapiens. What was it about him (instead of his fire and common interest) that made Gray fall for him? This story would be more interesting and more detailed. Maximum - Molly Shannon (although I agree with an inspector who found him angry sometimes), a cabbie in drag, and a dance system (like Sam & Gray were many players, I would like to see more than that, as the bits that we were actually shown were good more than the remaining film). It can be better.
