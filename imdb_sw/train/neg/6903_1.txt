Probably New Elders The worse films ever made <br /> <br /> The joke They are not funny. Used from other movies and just corny open Acting is bad though there is a huge cast. Stories are not exciting & boring has more cheese then booths pizza cheese lovers pizza type like acting has been done 1,000 times before <br /> <br /> I watched this when it came to television but it was standing up to stand only 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> This movie takes over / <br /> Don't look at it, <br /> <br /> Get dry color instead
