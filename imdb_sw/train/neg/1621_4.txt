'Fox and Child' is a new film with French director Luc Jacquet, who brought us a winning Oscar's 'March of Penguins'. It focuses on a little girl (very surprised by Bertille Noël-Bruneau) and her friendship with a fox. There is a real time of measuring here; The dirt shouted loudly, lynx drives the dog through the snow-covered forests; The single area exactly when the fox is tortured with a pack of wolf is very strict and even terrible time. However, they do not have quite enough of them. <br /> <br /> Well beaten; The movie is very interesting. The appearance of the bubbly type of film is amazing. It is indeed a very lush production. The English version is reported by Kate Winslet, but a few conversations that have already been well known. Score is also fluffy too, or at least it to my liking; with a screenplay, during the trick, it seems to fly from one state to another, eventually it stops me almost baffled. <br /> <br /> When there are good values ​​in the heart of the film, and a rather quiet performance from Noël-Bruneau is quite good, the real star is a fox. At the very momentous focus is only around our young furry friend is very big. However, again, they do not have almost entirely.
