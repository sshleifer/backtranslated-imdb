We lost the DVD's a good western hope. The movie was good and appropriate events, but thought was very bad. Here are my problems with the film. <br /> <br /> In the first place, why did a bad person kill the owner of the mine? It is not true that is connected to the film except to make sure it was bad and hiding. <br /> <br /> The bank employee did very bad actions by convincing to employ employers to evict his employers. At least let us continue to think. No behavior was created for bank owners or bank employees. <br /> <br /> Too long too long in anything that happens. The worst column that Martin still had to see the judge after the group admitted to kill values. The more heaven that he confesses to the judge and the judge will not listen to Mr. sheriff. even more so ignorant that Martin had a rest of the string and string then sheriff takes him to gunpoint finally to return to his city and save his wife from the worst of the bank. Isn't it just to return after sending the group quickly to save the wife and catch the bad guy of the bank? Just send a judge to the document that the gang admitted before being killed in the election? !!! In general, it may be very sad and there is no point of film.
