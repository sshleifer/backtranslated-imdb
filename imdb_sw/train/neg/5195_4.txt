I had heard (and read) many good things about the weeds that I expected to get better in another series of cable (like Entourage, Sopranos or Mad Men) but slowly moved away from every piece I looked at from the first season. (did not do this to pass the first six events) \ t The negotiations should be forced, as the authors try the most difficult way to be clever and hip. It was a rare time when I was really laughing. <br /> <br /> The characters have never developed enough for me to care for them, they were selfish and unappealing. I liked to be added to a brother-in-law (who would have to be transferred to the Predator Capture) and the removal of the Quinn's daughter from the cast to the boarding school in Mexico was so unusual and photographed, I had to conclude the authors tested the integrity of the viewer . After the period I liked the characters below and could not pass many technical errors in the story line. Add to this I heard that the second season was not good, so I lost all inspiration to continue watching this play. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of good throwing and writing, I think that this show will be a challenge for you to love, unless of course you have been stoned and then soon you are all off.
