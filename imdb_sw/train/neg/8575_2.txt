****** SPOILERS ****** <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> </ > <br/> <br/> <br /, sporatically watchable haunted home spoof. Lugosi is a mystic whose sessions seem like an attempt to lure a fortune of heiress; Karloff is a pastor and Lorre is a professor who shows fake mediums, but it turns out that both of them are in a conspiracy with Lugosi. Of course, Kay Kyser and his 30-year-old band "old" children reveal the truth at the lowest possible humor on the way. It is not recommended for anyone but a strict terminator.
