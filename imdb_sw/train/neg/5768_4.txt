Well, I was glad to first download the open source film, just destroyed by demo radio. Animation is excellent, the combination of the mouth is bad, and you are going to watch the movie you expect to understand what's going on, just to realize what's going on. I don't feel the feeling for the characters, it's just a pity for the creators to waste their time. I have seen a short film and feeling twice during half! This can be a short film, if it had taken time to hire a real director. I am sure everyone in Blender is happy to show their programs and their ability to deliver, but sadness of the teen-story is what makes the movie.
