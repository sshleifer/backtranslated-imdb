I have felt a very long nonsense boring. The plan was full of breach, and acting was very bad that I had seen for a long time. To make it worse, camera cameras that used energy were used, normal music was awesome and opened discussion (probably not something bad then), and San Francisco shots looked like they had stolen one for one out of the video of the promotion of the tourist board. Oh, and the free sex area was not even half done well. Good lighting next time, please.
