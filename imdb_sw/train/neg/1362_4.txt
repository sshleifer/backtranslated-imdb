Maggie Smith and Peter Ustinov as a very unlikely couple of films. The film shows Ustinov's commitment to prison for surprising reasons. She persuades Robert Morley to leave her to assume her identity and start to run on a computer with a conventional company run by Karl Malden and Bob Newhart, other odd films. as he did in 1938 "Marie Antoinette." Probably, he needed to return to that kind. <br /> <br /> This film is the best choice. Eager to believe that the following year, Maggie Smith completely interpreted his ways and gave the Oscar victory in "Miss Jean Brodie". Smith is being made here to be a swollen head, but at the end of the film, he is a dress-up. The worst text did not go along with him.
