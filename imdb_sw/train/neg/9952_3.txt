It has been emailed to a friend who is in the film school about this flick. The thing to avoid when you do the actors who talk to those who are not in vain, is caused, trusted on the screens that ultimately have no feelings. If the film is a community-based attempt, these words are over-the-top that are very attractive to a film that has been built as a film and effectively enhances the enthusiasm. What? Is acting, or a script that is bad, or all? The protagonist is also unable to fail in the realization of social origin - with the kindness of English text and the Bible at the top or can produce as well as too much soliloquies during drinking? And how is the unstable, non-verbal and non-verbal nature of the words that can lure many women in a minute to meet? (I had to scream when one ass finally threw him out of the road, despite his shopping and defense booth) <br /> <br /> The viewer meets a careful text for ancient Greek books, Nostradamus and the Book of Revelation. The expected destruction of human beings, in the form of bar numbers printed on the forehead or right hands in biblical style, is given to a character that is open-to-open in its position as a guardian of empty space. This flick is written more and more - the melodrama button was inserted by the "philosophy" of the feet about human meaning, life, etc.. It is greedy, widespread and stimulating. <br /> <br /> There are some good English movies available with the same content as this film. "Nil for Mouth" is the most beautiful journey in the lives of individuals in such a society. Ditto for "In Warzone." And although comparison is not appropriate even, look at anything with Peter Greenaway, who can handle more discussion, characters and concerns.
