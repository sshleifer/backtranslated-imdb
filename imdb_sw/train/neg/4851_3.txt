see a team of bombers in Iraq to count down their time before going home. <br /> <br /> That itself seems to be boring. Every time a brief description happened to tell us how long they have come out, it just caused this film without a long plot to continue. fast and finish your time there so we can all return home. <br /> <br /> I must miss something. I am a great fan of war films if done well. This had a "head head". A film that was once shot very well, but the cinema does not prevent it from being so bad and useless. With a few bows of "cartridges from the gun" already prepared. they could save money and just get stock photographs from any other film with a gun in it. I did not have compassion for the great man in it, I was always hoping that his ignorance would make him die. In fact the film would have done much better if it had. <br /> <br /> Read some reviews and I seemed to feel that those in the arms did not like it, and everyone liked it. I've never been in power, and I'm with them. It is a shadow of defense. 3 stars are for movies.
