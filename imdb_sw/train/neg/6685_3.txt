Although the movie takes place at the University of Ivy League, it was actually beaten in Northern Arizona, especially at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff at the end of 1976. I participated in the theater department there, and much more in the film are members of the theater department. It is a wonderful place in this movie (if you know your Arizona geography) which shows several members riding a bike from university to ferry. We NAU'ers know that the campus and the island of Oak Creek Canyon is about 35 miles away, and when that trip descends, it would actually be impossible to climb a bike behind that road!
