Remember when Harrison Ford was a great star in Hollywood because it made great movies? Those days are feeling as far more memory and more. <br /> <br /> When "Hollywood killings" can not be horrible, it's an unusual and amazing movie of buddy fighters. It is a comedy which is not particularly exciting, and a movie of action that is not particularly exciting. The maximum scope of subplots cannot erase the weak genius between the story. Ford at least enjoys more than his last few projects, and has the ability to carry the film often. Hartnett is enough, but he and Ford are not exactly Newman and Redford as the chemistry is involved. All, "Hollywood killings" is an exciting reduction for a pleasant cause, but it is very difficult. Fua Ford, and not so.
