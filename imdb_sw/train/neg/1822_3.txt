Greetings again from the darkness. What happened to the great Barry Levinson? He described my two elements at all in "Avalon" and "Diner". He had some good movies too ("Rainman"), but always gave something of interest ... so far. I believe the worst thing you can tell about comedy is that it is boring. "Envy" is a boring translation. Never a big fan of a fresh "slap" stick and "Dumber", I was so surprised at this very bad movie film. There's probably 2 chuckles in the whole thing - if you can pay attention to the long term. The best part of the film is an ongoing gag of the title of the head and the sound of the sound of the same sound. If the film is written as a song, it would have enabled it. Rachel Weisz is a good actor and I know that they all want to do the comedy (even Julianne Moore), but the real world reflects one weakness. The SNL delegation beaten Amy Poehler is usually on her role as a trash park trailer turned out a princess. The film disaster is Jack Black and Ben Stiller. The first work goes together to highlight some promises, but after their chemistry is lost due to poor script. This document is like a lot of thought of Jack Black - not a bad idea, but no hope of success.
