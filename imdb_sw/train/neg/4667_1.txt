Dirty pieces, plot down, garbage loss of mind. It's not close to the best works of Greenaway. Avoid at all costs! The 'splitting' screens do not do anything more than combining, the film is very dark for a lot of time and 'art images' are building up. Nothing is going to suggest about this film; even the weakness is very strange, which you see is filling a large part of the film recently gets very boring. <br /> <br /> More, how anyone can say that the act of Ewen MacGregor is a brilliant than me. He showed more potential in the series of Star Wars, and that says something. I have never been defeated by the movie since I saw 'Darby O'Gill and Few People'!
