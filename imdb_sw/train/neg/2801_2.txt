After quasi-Gothic, the music video of each fruity, the movie begins with Cassidy singer killed himself. In a perfect world that would have been with the last document will continue. We don't live in that world. Non-discriminating band members decide to go to other clown to communicate with its dead cell. When I say clown, I mean a real clown. He tells them that they will all die through the spirit of Cassidy (the spirit has Dora, one of the girls of the band) We could not keep a little bit like all caused, dead, and horrible characters. Written by Adam Hackbarth (an extraordinary name that has been one), and guided by Corbin Timbrook (who after the Servant, and the blood tower, knows that he keeps doing summer), this movie continues to fight between The film and the need for a viewer to stay awake. It is not enough blood to please the ho-hounds, nor enough dirt to satisfy the pervs. This movie actually has nothing to recommend to anyone. <br /> <br /> My Bridge: F <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Amanda Carraway gets over <br /> <br /> Where she saw: Starz on Demand
