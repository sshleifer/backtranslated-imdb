This movie is becoming one of the most exclusive movies you have seen. However, this comes from the fact that you cannot make headlines or tails. It almost seems like a series of challenges that are set to decide whether you're not ready to walk out of the movie and give the money you just paid. If you do not want to feel guilty you will stay in this horrible film and develop a genuine sense of sympathy for the participants involved, they have seen every day better, but then you realize that they have been paid a little bit of money to do so and will be kind to you as you did for the film. I can't go up enough about this terrible movie, next to something that Ed Wood would do and in that case certainly would be its center. To get started you have to go through the dialogue that likes to see / hear, this should be five minutes long. On top of it has been reported, to suggest that the viewer cannot read. Then we meet Mr. Slater and the wind of the raging wind going on, it's like he just works to get the lines on the line of the poster of the film. Recently we meet Stephen Dorff, whom I enjoy most often and he struggles to get into this but eventually he does. Then comes the last insult, Tara Reid with the role of mind, oh help us! Tara Reid is not a very talented actor and somehow he gets a role in movies, in my opinion though he should be connected to the American pie movies. All in all you just want to see this when you leave the video, I know that I got lots, I mean to enable all of them to be honest here, sometimes comforting to Revel in the shortcomings of others.
