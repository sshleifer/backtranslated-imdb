I saw this movie the other night and I must honestly say it is one of the worst films I've ever seen. Acting is just, but the plot is totally ridiculous. The killer is born because of "all the energy produced by the film" and if the film has been hit by the killer when he dies? What is amazing? The characters were not continued to say the least ... for example, suddenly the person says "Don't you try to finish the film because your mother couldn't?" So should we go with this? We did not know that she was her daughter until half way through the film. Today he had no care for anyone, we do not know anything about the great people who survived but Ringwald's behavior was a whistle, the boy was placed when people died and Raffy wanted to be a director like his mother. Not really dive to find out who it is. The affair was running to get just the killings. The whole plot is very weak for my taste and I was very disappointed. Anyone who enjoyed this piece, needs to learn something or two about making a film. I don't believe anyone who agrees with the stars or even working on this picture. Not surprisingly, it was not terrible and it was cliche through the entire film. I found myself explaining what would happen before each area, which believes you were not so hard to do. It is a shame and I am very sad I have lost an hour and a half-looking aggressive. 1/10.
