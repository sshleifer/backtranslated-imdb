I am sick and exhausted with all these small growing products about how this film "hit". It's a fresh CG top-acted CRAP! Do not send Assassin, it is much better to beat hundreds of colorful, poisonous snakes on the Bird! The only reason people love this film because they feel they should. It's not "very bad is good" It's so bad I'd be poked in the eye with a sharp stick then being under this again. I was honestly it was COMEDY as AIRPLANE! A spoof! Am I wrong? It's all that "It comes, get!" Or Samuel A. Jackson welcomes "Snake on the plane!" Sorry, I am not available. It seems like a group of wimps gave the film more money to make more movies like Triple X and Die Hard If you spend money to watch the film in the company of those who bought William William's CD, they still live in their mother, and the smell of sweat plastics since the days that computers play online games and watch porn, then rush to the theater and ask for one (since I doubt that you have a girl) snakes ticket on a stupid-hell flight and movies like Full Metal Jacket, Pulp Fiction, True Romance, 12 Monkeys, Advocate, etc. There is no deception in looking at the beautiful movies.The real fall for western civilization.
