I am a great fan of the series of Largo Winch. This movie was my pain. I had to use the front fast not to fall asleep. It was boring! How can someone destroy this name very much? The story was the only thing. Staff were sh.t. They cannot live a role. The main actor (Tom ...) is null. See other roles of this actor. The events of the fighting were very strange and unacceptable, somehow did not follow the situation. As another consultant said a low-budget film and bad actors. Sometimes someone else can do something better from this head. French can do nothing good with a great film, like a guest 4. That was a little brrr, after a visitor 1,2,3.
