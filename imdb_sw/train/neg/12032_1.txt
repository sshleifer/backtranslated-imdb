This movie was bad. I had a very tough time to watch this all the way through. I did not get a point of film. What was this movie? The sound of the sound was bad, acting was bad and the story was not recommended. Two main characters in the movie were very boring and their conversation was uninteresting. There was no chemistry among members sent. I don't really know this, but I think most of the participants were first. Movie can be reduced to an hour and a half without losing the plot. That shows how many free images that are useless in the film. I would rather take root roots during two hours of the movie. I want back two hours! If you want to look good, a wonderful movie that is friendly family and made by a group of mormons, see Napoleon Dynamite instead.
