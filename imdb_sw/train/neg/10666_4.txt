I am a great 1930 movie fan and I will look at anything that I see in Turner Classic movies that are new for me. So I shot out, after all it's a great Harold Lloyd who won the Chaplin as a great film player. I have watched Lloyd's silent films of the Chaplins but I must say I am a great fan of Chaplin. However this film fell to my flat because I did not finish it. I can understand why his voice work was too small, he didn't have very good tools to work with. After seeing Chaplin, Abbott and Costello, Three Stooges, Martin and Lewis, The Marx Brothers, and Laurel and Hardy do boxing spoons (or violence in general), this is very forgetful. I was interested in looking at Adolphe Menjou as I enjoyed so much in the Ways of Glory but his role here also did nothing special for me. Maybe they should enter into boxing early because at least half of the film (at least it seemed to be the way) is before they get the ring. I can tell you there is a lot of Lloyd fans here and this will not be a popular review but I must get this rate compared to what was there at that time, 4 out of 10. someone else again, very flat. For an alternative to anyone who loved recently or looks at the most unknown comedies generally I recommend "second Kelly" made a few years earlier, another no one being a comedy boxer and Patsy Kelly and in helping Charles Charles Chase. These are shown at the Turner Classic movie center.
