It is usually surprising Fred Olen Ray about the cyborg female farmer (Teagan) commissioned by Warden Jan-Michael Vincent to find and carry out a visitor who fled Ross Hagen who has made a world course. Recently Forest Forest Physician John Phillip Law will have to protect a group of juvenile religious children who have been led by Richard Wiley who fled Hagen and his RV on a journey to leave the awry camp. Recently the cyborg will be cleared away from its hand laser burning one doctor of the doctor (Robert Quarry's popularity of Count Yorga-Vampire) showing that no one will stand in that way to restore the secret of the offender, whose collar is a tracking device which reduces his body. The law finds a partner in Leo Gordon, an old man of War Vietnam and also a weapon that was beaten in his cabin. It is probably deliberately done badly, this shows what fans of "rancid movies" wish for ... effects, act, and premise. At least, the film has PJ Soles for some eye candy .. even in '89, he was totally smokin '. Guns that laser certainly are funny..it can be burned some houses still when Cyborg stem in the Law is barely leaves a mark on the expelled area.
