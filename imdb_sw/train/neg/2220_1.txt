What is hell in your mind? This film takes! Every minute I had to get more and more bored. I tried to look at the last because I hope nothing at all will happen! But instead, I was amazed at how difficult it was to be treated ... What is this story about this "bogeyman" of blood? What? How do you not die? He is a man of blood for God! The only boy who killed his sister without ignorance 15 years ago. Then? Staying in a psychiatric hospital made him immortal? This film is interesting to stupid ... It is a must of silliness. I am going to sell it now to a stupid person who will understand this romantic film.
