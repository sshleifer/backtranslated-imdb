SCHIZOPHRENIAC: WHORE MANGLER is another example of what happens when you find a group of uncomfortable people together to make the "bad" film terrible. Any kind of acting, production, storyline, FX, etc ... go out the window for an effort to create "value shock". Now don't feel - I think I am a "shock" film, and sleazier / gorier / nastier best - but it's still good to see other talent for talent from a child involved in the film. <br /> <br /> SCHIZOPHRENIAC tells the life of Harry Russo - show-freed-show-show who takes the command to kill from his soccer dummy, Rubberneck. He goes on a few of the killers and other people, and screams out how much he hates "hoo-uhs" (that's "whores" for those who don't talk New York-ase ...) and how he wants to put them in the ass. There are a few cases of weak necrophilia, very little, and some dirt mixing little things - but nothing has never been seen in the best film ... <br /> <br /> The only thing of redemption that I can get to this lost movie is many (no matter what?) Crying for a hilari is appropriate from our great man, Harry. He goes-and-on-to-on about wanting to kill everyone and making it in the ass, and it becomes realistic over time. In fact, I'm almost tempted to believe that there is some kind of homo-erotic sound on this film, and talking all the donkeys and the regular shots of Harry riding around his dongin hang out. With all the trust, the joker is the most nekkid in this film then the tiny T-and-A (and some of the front, with a good measure). SCHIZOPHRENIAC is amusing to gently look at 1 hour, but I can only suggest this to those who want to say that they watched the film called SCHIZOPHRENIAC: THE WHORE MANGLER. Be honest - head, for far - it's the best thing about this garbage ... Help 3.5 / 10
