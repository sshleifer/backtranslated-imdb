I know that movies don't need a real glass, but this has got my nerves. It perpetuates discriminatory discrimination about "psychological problems" and mental illness. The phenomenon of "psychological mother" has been done many times before (and usually done well) and much of the plot is all too far away. Acting was not intimidating but nothing to accuse him. One view: I am a long fan of the General Hospital and it was a trip to see one of the most common GH functions, Jon Lindstrom. Anything else, if you stop part of the physiological text, in the same way a person should stop the facts / judgment when watching the many movies, then this film can be tolerant. If you have nothing good to do with lower levels. Sorry I lost my time to look at it.
