Okay, I checked the original French version. But I can't imagine this being better with lower heads. All say that this is a very interesting movie I have seen for a long time. There are almost no features of redemption for this film. That's why I can't understand all the good ideas. It can be true for some but some real stories are better left without visibility. <br /> <br /> I usually like slow movies paced as long as you serve the purpose of the movie. Solaris of Tarkovsky is very slowly paced but allows introspection and puts the mood of the film for example. But in this case, the film is closed only for unintentional conversations that can tell us a little about the characters. None of them could recognize or take care of. In many cases I found myself thinking: "What will they do?" Acting was very bad. It is not by the way of the way. But it seems none of the actors concerned about their characters and they all seemed like they wanted to be elsewhere in many cases. This may be because of unlocked conversations given to them. Also all the flow of the movie felt quite well. Go from one location to another. It looks like this is just written (wrong) but it has not been guided. This is one of the few films that I can say did not show any responses from any events. There is no insistence, no fear, no expectation, no sadness, no identification, no stimulation to mind, no interest that is eternal. A perfect example of what I call is to resist the film.
