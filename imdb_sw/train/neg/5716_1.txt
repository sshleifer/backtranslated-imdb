This movie is not suitable for the next few minutes I will use it, but I know many people, like me, rely on IMDb.com to help decide on the film. For this reason alone, I write this. "Live Feed" is like the Asian version of "The Incredible Torture Show" (aka "Freking Blood Freking Freaks") http://www.imdb .com / title / tt0077247 /. Abuse, destruction, murder, destruction ... indeed, all is here with a third-grade script, acting pathetic, and failure of the experimental black comedy. <br /> <br /> The film takes place in China, but everyone speaks English. There are a lot of girls in films who are shocked by filtering dogs on the market, but they are interested in sex by entering a porno house. One of the gal who is desperate and dirty in the bedroom after a while is having a friend of his friend (how he came in even though it might be just a matter of all this film.) The movie is too bad, even for the movie B. Even if you would like to download it free of charge, it would be a shame for your hard drive.
