Movies about dinosaurs can be entertaining. So you can movies of Whoopi Goldberg. But Ninio and Dinosaurs? <br /> <br /> After 20 minutes of "Theodore Rex", I came to one conclusion: this movie is bad. Evil, evil, evil and offender because of the audience. There is nothing wrong with the accident; this is the same as the torture room. First of all, Whoopi does not make good movies to work (see "Beauty Beauty" if you think I am lying), but the creators of the film provide a 't service - he is a serious mistake here, again. Do you see a member of a million soldier decreases this week? Well, here's one million and one, pal. <br /> <br /> Do you like the interesting, humanitarian dinosaurs since the Spielberg TV shows about them? Not bad, here's another and he is a soldier, too! You are one of those people who hate car expulsion, shoot-outs, talk sloppy, futuristic FX and see talented people (Goldberg, Mueller- Stahl, Roundtree) is stuck in a movie that looks like writing tax ? Write a BIG tax? <br /> <br /> With this reading all the way to the end. You are trying hard. Hard. <br /> <br /> No star, not one. And if they are making the "Theodore Rex" direction, Hollywood deserves to be attacked by a whole-sized ball of dinosaurs.
