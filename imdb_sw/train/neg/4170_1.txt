This is a flat out unknown. If there is a story here somewhere, it is deeply buried under the horrible characters and the work of the paper camera which is indiscernible. There is a group of vampire hunters who move around to do their thing, and vampires that kill them have little aliens in them. They hit their heads out and talk like Gonzales Speedy. If you can think the blood and gore covers a guest cover of a sock visitor screaming like a cowboy cow dancing with a herd of cattle, well, that's what you get here. These people are great, worried, cruel, and just very angry. Then there are some people who are fighting against humanity, who stand next to the position of their CGI to be so incredible that it is impossible to take. These people make Hillary Clinton appear as a dependent of the right wing in comparison. They are friends with some vampires, or something ... cares. <br /> <br /> Then there is a camera function. Remember how everyone hated the crawl-a-minute string from the recent Rolleball remake? People who made this film lovers. There's enough here for three real video crappy of MTV. <br /> <br /> Nuff said. This thing explodes. In contrast, Dracula 3000 is the main task.
