This actually does not match the Castle of Cagliostro. Lupine is not interesting or wacky or not. The theme and music are not fixed by the plot is not just interesting. The only thing appropriate for this is 'dirt' (only in the percentage version) provided by Fujiko. It helped spice some terrible events. CoC had a terrific villain and set up a movie for some pieces of keeping tips. The parts of TSoTG are not very clear or relevant. <br /> <br /> Zenigata, Goemon and Jigen even provide good entertainment at this time. It's like they were just filling the contract responsibility for appearance. <br /> <br /> The DVD is in full shape and sound of Dolby Stereo. It has an extra bonus amount, including completely trailers. But one wonderful thing. There is no image option on the disc or timecode shown on the player immediately inserted. Although you can still jump to the next location number using a remote area.
