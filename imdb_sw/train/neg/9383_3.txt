BAD MOVIE ... and I mean BAD BAD ... That plot is predictable, and it is EALLY cheesy, innovative war with dance scenes at a time is the only reason I do not give one movie, except that ... this defines a film that may refuse to fail watch ..... I feel when watching the film, the idea behind the film was of one kind of interesting .. .. cracking bumpkins country for blah blah blah, but I feel it could be at least a little better if just not so cheesy, very much badly resembles the idea for the screen, I think. Plot is possible sometimes, the play can I say when, it's very good, to fight the drums of dance was good ..... If you just hit the movie and watch the dance events and create your own conversation maybe it can be 5. lol
