As the summary says you have made the most ridiculous views I have ever heard in RPG. Do you think so much that they were gay? What? Lost? If you are going to be safe your best friend and someone decides the good of his heart to help you then you are in serious debt to that person. Lavitz was a good man and always helped each other to make them closer as friends. They were gay lovers as you hate. And let you know this game has been fixed during middle time. Back, women made food only when they were fighting. Do you know your history? Do you know how long it took women to be accepted in the army for the present day? This game has many realities even though you also slow down to make it, and you really need to damp the solid proof rather than the basic ignorance of your wrong action to interpret the story.
