Become an independent film with a great fan of Edward D. Wood Jr. I bought this document to believe that this would ultimately put a record on how gif Wood and brilliant Ed Wood was true. I found it to be bothered, confused, competing with a painful bitterness. Where people remember Ed Wood Jr., in fact people remember the second parent of the boy with the duct tape who knew someone in the Tisa External Program? It looks like that, that moment there is a new preference in Ed Wood, these people come from "Wood" work! Just take the meaning of spirited swipes to someone who actually gave them a chance when nobody else! After 50 years I would suggest that many of these people should allow the fact that they did not earn 75 dollars they were promised! Ed Wood was a creative film man who knew how to enjoy it. In fact he was ALL lived. You can watch when you see Ed movies, but somehow you know that you laugh with him, and not at AT. But, I block ... Back to the existing movie. If you're expecting a film on Edward D. Wood Jr., you can't find it here. If you want a film about former cranky actors, this is a film for you!
