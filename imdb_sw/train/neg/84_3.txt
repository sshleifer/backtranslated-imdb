As a child I thought the weapon that the killer used was cool, however I was a child and so I was dumb. Even as a dumb child though the conspiracy film was stupid and it was stirring when the killer was not using his knife to kill people. What surprises me is that the movie has cast a solid in it. It is a script that they have read when they agree that in this film as indeed it is boring and the only way to show the light saber to a very small degree. Sometimes work is unknown and the end is quite chaotic. The entire film seems to turn around with visitors with one weapon. The program has two children and some dude have a guest meet, years later and there seems to be a return as it was in the mix. Dead animals and what they should be investigated and for some reason, one dude gets the weapon of the visitors and continues to use it to the best killings. Hardly, you have to wonder why this film was made, if you were going to have a killer with good deaths, if you were going to have visitors to meet more than a strange thing of vortex, and if you're going to have a light saber then call yourself a star star.
