Daphne Zuniga is the only light that shines in this slasher of sleep, and light shines quickly. If it is not his, other reasons to check this. Five college students are signed to prepare an old dorm for its demolition date. Problems arise automatically when a respectful person asks without sleep, and the group is short for a few people. Then, the killer is free. I really wanted to say I would enjoy this. It had the right to start, or maybe that was just Daphne Zuniga in it. The film is very slow, and almost as quiet as a library. Most of the acting are less than average, and when the "point-of-view" is a very old story. Christopher Young's famous filmmaker such as "Hellraiser" and "Entrapment" scored this, in a frequent refusal that was ideal for TV film. Still, it seems to be higher than the movie suited. So, more than the Young and Zuniga, this beat down the barrel.
