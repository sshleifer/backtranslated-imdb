... but certainly not right. The former Preston Sturges director tries to experience the effects of the movie in telling his stories, and creating characters and variations of varying degrees, and writing a cunning and sometimes unintentional dialogue. (It is not surprising that the movie of the brother of Coen 'next will be a cult to Sturges.) The main problem is that the plot is not all the way yet; it is not surprising, the loss of unexpected conspiracy and sudden change of luck that they look at the audience. The slogan of coffee is a lousy affair ringing, and the latter is quite predictable. Frank Capra does this much better. <br /> <br /> If you are new to Preston Sturges, see "These Eve" or "Sullivan Travel" or "Miracle of Morgan Morgan" first. If you've seen this already, then go ahead and look at this.
