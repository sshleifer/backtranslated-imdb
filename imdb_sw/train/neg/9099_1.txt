This review also has a spoiler of the first movie - so if you haven't seen any movies and want but do not want supervisors, please do not read this review! <br /> <br /> This time the movie should be on a Christian meeting with Kathryn for the first time, the movie is a poor copy of the first Ukrainian Experiments. The actors showing Christian Chris Phillippe and Sarah Michelle Gellar of Kathryn are very poor. Nor can they overcome the bitter feelings, which the original owners did. It is surprising that some of the discussions were identification - not between a Christian and Kathryn, but if you are listening closely you will find out. There is also a difference in the plot - if this was actually the first Christian meeting with Kathryn, then why is it that the Christian loved the girl at the end of the movie? He was thought to love for the first time in the first movie (with the characteristics of Reese Witherspoon). <br /> <br /> Also, linking and photography / "You can be an example" view at the end was completely paralyzed and didn't add anything. In general, this film was a waste of time. I can't believe they made hostile tips 3.
