I saw this "hot" movie when it came out in 1986. It had a X mark for a short sex-related area but played in the most popular movies (it was a film "art"). It seems to be the first film to show a respected actor in an open sex area. I saw it a boring story about a young high school boy (Federico Pitzalis) in love (understandable) and an old woman (Maruschka Detmers). As mentioned before Detmers are very good and good body but also gave a very good performance. Pitzalis was (making it gently) poor poor. It is not surprising never to make another movie. However, despite sexual immorality (which describes but it is very short), this is a slow moving story that has misled me. Good acting and Detmers only helped with some point. Often I was looking to look for me to wait patiently for the end. If there was no sequence this film would have forgotten long ago. Dull and slow. You can fly this.
