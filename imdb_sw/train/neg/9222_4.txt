I love the love of sexy and sci-fi movies of sixty-six years of it because of the performance of the actors seen in them. They found women of sexiest being in these films and did not matter if they could do (Remember "Candy"?). Because I was disappointed with this film because it was not nostalgic enough. The story here has a European film called "Dragonfly" made by the expelled director. So producers decide to allow a movie boy (Jeremy Davies) to complete the picture. They are a very beautiful woman in a film who plays a joke but she is difficult in it. Film is written and led by Roman Coppola who uses some of his fathers to use from his early days to insert it into the script. I would like the film would be a worship of the original film. They can have many watos and actors who seemed in them. There is one actor in this film who was famous from the sixties and the law of John Phillip (Barbarella). Gerard Depardieu, Giancarlo Giannini and Dean Stockwell also seem. I think I will continue to wait for the director to do a good service for sixty years. If anyone reads this, "Make it as sexy as possible"! I'll wait!
