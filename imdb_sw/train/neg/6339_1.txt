All David Prior movies are awesome on all errors: bad writing, bad acting, bad movies, no budgets (the director of the director is beaten as male leader). But they all have a wonderful entertainment because of their unnecessary hilarity. Nearly every "David" plan before the "film" (if I like to call it) is exactly the same. All American orders of the US war against the Communists. But unlike the other tropical colds, such as Dawn Red, the Prior movies are true because of their high and high buildings. The best part of Jungle Assault is the area where Becker (or was another dude?) Is called by Great Mitchell for the top secret message in South America. The funniest line in the film is provided, the effect of "this is my partner, I have taught him well". WHAT. Have you taught your partner? And this seems to be their solution to avoid eviction. <br /> <br /> If you can find these gems in a video used anywhere, JUAWE. All are funny and even funnier after a few beer. Watch them with a group of your friends for real MST3K experience. Up to now my friends and I have been able to get the victory of Night Wars and Aerobicide aka "Killer Workout". But one of the most recommended of them is the Last Error, and Robert Z'dar is the most watchful.
