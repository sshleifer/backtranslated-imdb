This was a perfect desire. Acting is not bad, but the production was very bad at times I felt I needed to reinforce, but I did it sadly and I was able to finish the embarrassment for the entire poor movie. Its okay. if you're o.k. and the stadiums and do not worry about watching a movie that is not available Whitman. If you want an interesting story of lies go to it.
