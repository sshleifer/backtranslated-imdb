After losing a few hours looking at this and 80 percent of the time at the very unbelievable, I can give this garbage of Turkey's annual award, no problem. Saying the plot was impossible is reduced significantly. In fact I have lost words to describe this victory. It is not just the most active and completely free of any nature (this kind of thing has been done better in several 'wound' injuries) but acting was bad. For those who pay to see this, I hope to get your money, for those who have been paid to pay for this, I hope to give them money. Believe me many people there are new releases out there which are a lot, better. Go see.
