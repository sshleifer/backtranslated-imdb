Included Sukari and Bobby Lee face dudes who are losing out on shopping one day and returning to a secret island that the girls boldly tell of the strikes they visited when they were ten years old and lucky. All of the most interesting films that are very good for the first girls to visit this island have to fight with a weak family. This is very big done by everyone involved with the fact that I started hearing bad for Hank Worden poor who really deserved more. As much as I did not like "Barracuda" (that's a single DVD) I must admit that this film makes it looks like Citizen Kane. Eye Candy: one pair of tits (they may be Kirsten Baker) <br /> <br /> My bridge: F <br /> Extra Sky Sky: Ads yield for various car food; and Trailers for "Bonnie's Kids" (shows dirt), "Girls of the Center", "The wife of part time" (characteristic of dirt), "Death of Psychic", "Eaten Alive". The DVD also comes with "Barracuda" of 1978
