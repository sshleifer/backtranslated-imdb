"Freddy's dead" did the most sensible thing that can do after the fifth film. It started from the beginning. Indeed, this "last film" on the saga is quiet but at least it's original. Some of these images are even taking a breath. And the story of Freddy's son (Lisa Zane) who returns to the city toward her bad father is unique. Overall, movies are nothing but other cartoon made children in the theater. It has a group of good actors (Zane, Yaphet Kotto, and Lezlie Deane) who are essentially silent and walking around like sheep ready for slaughter. It's one-sided, it's a trick of magic, and, at the end, it's nothing but entertainment, children's entertainment. <br /> <br />
