As a game, this is a very strange satire of Catholic church, and theft and the central character that is so surprising we should strengthen even when he begins to kill his allies (one of them made a serious mistake to admit that he did not sin since his last confession, so he feels he sends him directly to heaven. <br /> <br /> That's just one example of how far out of reality play goes, and by doing so believe the theater world, it works. The fact of the fact has grown rarely works on the film, and certainly does not provide here. br>> <br /> Search for the production of a rather replacement step, you can not be discouraged.
