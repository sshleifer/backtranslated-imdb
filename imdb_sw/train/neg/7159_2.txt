I thought I would never get a horrible movie as bad as the "Return of the Chainsaw massacre of Texas", but this film competes with it. <br /> <br /> I'm not sleeping while watching a movie, but I did it 15 minutes after Trance started. I woke up, and started looking at italian. Why did I have that reputation? All the film was tortured, I must use it quickly to look at it completely. I can't stand why one of my all-time partners (MR. WALKEN) can do this. I think that made him a director to be grace, or had a need for money, because the film after the film he does, he destroys himself; and quickly ... <br /> <br /> What is it about the movie? not fear, stupid conspiracy, the characters are bad (but I liked it very much played by Jared Harris), the effects are very poor, the lack of death & blood, etc.; in three words, has anything. And I mean it. Can't stand how the director can make a film like this. However, when I was more disappointed when I saw you on the video cover, that the film was released by "Stephen King", I think I can never submit this trick, no? (I rented in Argentina). I have not recommended for a million years. <br /> <br /> I tested this movie with 2 out of 10.
