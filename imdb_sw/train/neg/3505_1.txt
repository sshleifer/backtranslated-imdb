Comedy Central has a tendency to put many plans at the time-Chappelle's Show, The Daily Show, Colbert's Report, and then there are some people who love or hate-Stella, Dr. Katz. Then there are some exhibitions that have their defenders but it is very obvious- Mencia, and now, Sarah Silverman. <br /> <br /> This show depends on the fact that Silverman is self-centered, which can be funny (Colbert Report) but it can be awesome (Mind of Mencia). It should shock anyone who I believe that the end is the case. This view is a parody of the sitcom and the community, the mysterious program loses itself in its ignorance and not just funny. The woman has been doing comedy often because it is not something that is normal. We don't need 25 minutes. When the criminals are armed with a button, they lose appeal - we saw it in Jay and Silent Bob Strike back, except the women were declining, and the whole area was extraordinary, making it better. But the best comparison for this show is Stella, unless Stella was the most subtle, which was the funny funny comedy. It was better to act, and I think, a little more than a wonderful wonder. <br /> <br /> Maybe some technological facts are very bad (I am very doubtful of the most important but don't fight the fan's response) for this show is the amount of advertising on it, very awesome ads via multiple programs besides advertising for other apps. Many people wonder why Sarah Silverman has a job, and some still have pain when the best shows have been deleted. This period should never pass the experimental test. Norm's return showed more promises, but this show makes more. And apart from the critics to be correct, many things have been seeing their situation growing very much. Finally I watched, Britney Spears gets good reviews too. Take a comparison however you want because the person will surely judge me as a psychologist on the IMD for not interested in this show.
