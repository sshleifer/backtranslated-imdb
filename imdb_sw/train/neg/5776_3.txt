The evil acting, the worst accents of the south, the unusual cinema, the bad script ... I expected this film at a recent film festival and I had a great heart after seeing it. It has the name of the quote / unquote name, but doesn't get it. This is undoubtedly the negative and unpopular story that is told. Don't worry
