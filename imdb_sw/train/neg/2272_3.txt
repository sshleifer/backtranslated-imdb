I am not an ordinary viewer of Springer, but I look at her show for light and I think the show is fine pleasure pleasure and a good way to kill at some point. Naturally, I will watch this film expects to see "Jerry Springer Uncensored." The first thing, Jerry looks at twenty minutes of film time. Another hour and twenty minutes you use to create this pseudo-farce about trailer-trash, envy, chaos and deception. Jaime Pressley (who seems to be hot as HELLLL) is a slut of trailer-trash who sleeps with his second father (casual-looking, chain-smoking, alcoholism Michael Dudikoff who eventually loses from his hero action persona). Mother gets information about it, they get into a fight, they want to make it on "Jerry" show (that's okay, no Springer). And then we have a parallel story with a couple of Africa and America. They take on the "Jerry" show. Anime hits. Blah, blah, freakin 'blah! We've never been this BORRRINGG! I was wondering why the Springer of Hell has millions of fans, but none of them watched his movie. Well, now it's definitely obvious! If you love him or love him, you will hate this movie! How can I explain? It is a general aggression of motion picture (if you call it). It has been severely damaged, and events that have not merged, and after a period of time the plot is completely lost and just on the map! Just think of the possible opera opera that is converted to comic horse. It usually laughs. <br /> <br /> My good story is just a girl's hot girl. That's dangerous if it gets. Do not do the wrong, the risk of the area, but look at the overall film comparing the material on the Springer software - this ugly horse seems to be very clean. My logo: 3 (out of 10)
