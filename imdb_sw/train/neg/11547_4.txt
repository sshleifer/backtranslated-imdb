what kind of sh * t this? Power Rangers vs Freddy? It was visible and beautiful as the first film at the beginning but from the place where the characters get a lot of power in their dreams, it started to be babies. Sh * t this would be compared to PG or PG-13 instead of R. I expected to see a lot of maturity but it was only 1/3 of the film. Others are for young children. Plus is very focused on Christianity. I know Freddy's spirit but there are many religions that have different ways to fight demons. Why does it always need to be Christianity? This is the total German and filled with the quality of white / western men. Don't look at this, show young children who love power rangers.
