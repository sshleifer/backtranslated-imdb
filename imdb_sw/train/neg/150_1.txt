This is a joke, nothing wrong with having a low budget, but this is a laugh, if you want to look at classics, Freaks of Tod Browning, survivors of Dracula and Frankenstein, Monster Undying, Ernest Thesiger, Paul Wegener's Golem and Passenger train , you can't compare it, you give it a bad name, a bad act, bad screens etc. A lot of money wage and free time, they have looked at many movies, they were like scared I was always happy, really not saying and saying, they have nothing to say that please don't work look at something so daft, please understand
