I am going to the movie to be interested. There is nothing to entertain about this film. From beginning to end, there is no resurrection from gray, grinding the reality of this woman's life. It's straightforward, without a change of emotions. I remained to the end only because I believed that things should be better. They do not, and I don't think I am the only one, as evidenced by many mourners around the movie as the film came from sympathy. To show social loyalty is not an honest crime, but to persuade your audience to mourn is not the way to win public compassion. Awesome film.
