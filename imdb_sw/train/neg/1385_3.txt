"Hap Hap", or "Black Mask" (in English) was a desperation. I was told that it was a kind of "Japanese version of Matrix". Think of my problem. The movie was bad or the sound was not very good with the film. Another thing is that the discussion was very bad. There were fewer ideas set out in the English version of this film and it just appeals to a "useless" type of type. Not a film I would like to see again.
