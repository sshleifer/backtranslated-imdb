As we all know Hollywood enjoys changing historical events around our comfort, and 44 minutes is one of these hollywoodized movies. For example, bank robbers have never returned to the bank when they started shooting at the LAPD while we see them coming back in twice! Another example is the number of LAPD officials who were shot near the end of the film, this is far from the truth! But of course Mobile must have an entire full bloody so that they can * add more blood and guts. Other events were shared by many of the leading artists who played several different people but this is why Hollywood has done so why do you complain? I think the only sad part is that I have examined one one hour of the North American bullet at TLC which was better then this!
