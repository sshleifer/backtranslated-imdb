Children love dinosaurs. It's a part of their culture. But they have Land Before Time. The original. At least that movie had a heart. This. This film is quite clear. Because children love dinosaurs doesn't mean that you can just beat together any old story and show it to children. This movie has no plot, the whole premise is stupid, and it's more for the number of elements. It is not as a spirit that watches as Theodore Rex, but it takes away from being a Country before Time.
