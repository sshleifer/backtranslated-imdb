Put blame on the producer producer Wes Craven and Weinsteins financiers for this major budget emergency: updating the "Dracula" metal, as well as the jab's personal terms of the Bram Stoker (who probably don't want his name on this matter) and nothing for us all except the jolts of slasher-styled and gore. Christopher Plummer seems to be overturned as Van Helsing in modern days - not just the generation of Van Helsing but the real thing; he keeps separating himself from the harvest from the Count Dracula, which has been released from his coffin after being stolen on the vault of Van Helsing and toward New Orleans. This is what New Orleans needs in the 21st century! The film, produced well but without the original idea (except for the color range), is ignoring and slow, and after an hour it begins to repeat itself. * from ****
