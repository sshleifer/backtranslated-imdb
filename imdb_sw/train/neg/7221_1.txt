.... CLEARING! The type of film that makes you want to go and hit the movie creator and say "WHY?". The function of the awesome camera ... counting the camera time tries to remain consistent with one person and cannot. Discussion is wise. Acting is comical. It seems like they took the western city to see if they could make a film for a small amount of money. I would like to bet $ 10 using home video cameras to do this. Maybe that, or most of the cameramen were drunk. Realistic trailers are more entertaining than the movie. If you would like to attend the "Festive Festival", bring this. You want more entertainment ... look at the wall.
