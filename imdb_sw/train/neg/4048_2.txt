Maybe not, but it's bad. Even fantastic cast cant to save it. Okay, I admit that it started quite funny but it seemed to decline downhill as they jumped the girls in homes. Bill Murray turned out to be a quick-hit man, a runner in a war he was shouting at people on the roads that were not funny, as he tried to be very hard. His character stole weapons (RV? Come on ...) and end up being a national hero after invading another country and killing a god knows how many soldiers, to laugh. One good thing is that this film shows the disqualification and failure of the US Army and shows how they are ignorant and confident they are, though without pretending. In fact I felt that this kind of propaganda crap could actually be released.
