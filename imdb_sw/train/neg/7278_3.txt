This very rare film was a problem of staying. There is no good place, but at least the first was amusing amusing, and one medium had some ideas. The last end was just brutal, and after staying through two weak comedic shorts, one third was sad to look. Even at the lowest levels of the National Lampoon movie, this looks particularly stimulating and unhappy.
