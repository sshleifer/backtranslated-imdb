Eagerly, I have read some comments on this film, and I need to ask, do you? You are the people who watch the film. Yes, I give the directors to put a lot of credit to be able to refresh the 1930 harvest in Los Angeles, but why? Do not like these characters who love it, the story seems to be useless, Karen Black is not just a very good actor. Donald Sutherland is just icky. (and his character "Homer Simpson" makes me love for the animation version. D'oh!) Then you had a creepy child actor, Billy Barty, a faithful, and so on. This is one of the cinema movies and we all will look and go, "What is it!"
