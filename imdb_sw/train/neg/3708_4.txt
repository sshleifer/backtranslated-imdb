Under the World is about Lance Barton, a black player hit by a truck. He goes to Heaven and gets another body. Lance gets the body of Charles Wellington, a white boy. So Lance does a few things in Charles's body. The film laughs a few, but not special. It's a good movie if you're a fan of Chris Rock. Madagascar, the comedy of animated 2005, is excellent. This is a good movie, but Chris Rock has done better things than this. It will just laugh at you 4 whole movie. And it is not a very laughing voice. You will cut yourself and you can wrap up, but you will certainly not be around the laughter.
