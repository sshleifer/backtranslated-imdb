I read somewhere that Hollywood should reflect on fixing bad movies and leaving the classics alone. We can only hope. When this remake was not a general waste, I'd still have six bucks back to the original DVD. Most violence and one of the worst disasters I ever seen. This version does not add anything new. It just emphasizes why Hollywood should leave only good things.
