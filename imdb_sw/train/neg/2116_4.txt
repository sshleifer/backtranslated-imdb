Poverty shortages are frightened by the 1930s and '40s undermine the spirituality of me. God knows I have nothing against the small budget films, but produced in the same period dreary, shabby as well as looking at them - and, in the final analysis, not only very good. "Deadly Leaves" is a little more fun than the bottom-of-barrel dreck as "Invisible Ghost" and "The Ape Man", but it's not classic. Bela Lugosi, long passed "Dracula" heyday, plays yet another mad doctor; Elizabeth Russell cannot fail to play his wife. They sleep in coffins because, as Lugosi describes the young journalist's suspect (Luana Walters), the coffin is better than the bed. To hum. Angelo Rossitto and Minerva Urecal also have a hand, which can attract the hardcore fans of '30s and' 40s films.
