This is the worst thing about the TMNT franchise has happened. I was a child when this came out and I thought it was a surprise, though I loved the original cartoon. There is one place that I remember when a mafia girl explains to her friends what historical questions it is. It's angry. Most fans hate a series of female turtle, but that is not disturbed. In fact I didn't even remember until I read on the show soon. All in all, it's hard to forget. Something similar is the theme of the theme. Be guilty of innocence, call it ... Nanana ninja ...
