If I could measure this movie for 0 I would like! I see some ppl in IMDb says that this is a funniest movie of the year, etc. etc. Can you forgive me? What? you ppl snorting LSD or ........? There is absolutely nothing interesting about this film N O T H I N G! I really want 27 minutes behind my life that I used to look at this piece. I read a man sitting on a plane watching this movie standing watching after 30 minutes, I understand that I really would have looked at snakes on a flight 2 times instead of watching this movie immediately! Do not see this film, do something more important for your life to make a dish, walk dog, hell ... whatever is better than spending time in front of watching TV's hot stick.
