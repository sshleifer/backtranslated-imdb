There are some good things about the movie. Music and movies are good. Alex Wilson is hot and provides good performance. Ryan Bauer is also hot. Production was very lucky to give it because it provides a productive value for the movie. Jonny Vincent (Sean) and many boys in movies that don't say it's good too. Why aren't the actors who play Amy listed on credit? Brandon Alexander gives good performance of comedic as Pink Clitarissa. The worst thing about the movie is probably star, James Townsend. He can't do it. He is also very bright, not good looking at all. Her hands are like spaghetti. It's disgusting. They have no muscle sound even. It is not surprising that he should make his own movie and isolate himself. No one else could throw anything to him. James Townsend is not believed as someone who even has a girl because he does homosexuals. They would have to give someone else as a leader if they wanted what was best for the film. Then again, maybe he just wants to use this movie as a car to launch a job in a soft line of porn, of course not acting in fact because he could take acting lessons. Plus, anyone who makes porn is selected on Hollywood. The most unpleasant thing about the film is perhaps a cast of Latina leather skin as the mother of Devon. Sonja Fisher does not appear as an actor. All things, this movie is soft on the porn and is not better than what you can see in Skinemax. I think even Alex Wilson, maybe the best thing about this film, is embarrassed and does not want to be associated with it. There is no picture on its IMDb page and nothing else is listed, so Alex Wilson probably the name of the disappearing action. Further, I went into it in West Hollywood immediately and when I mentioned this film, it just turned out and walked away. I understand. If I had worked on this film, I would be embarrassed and not want to be associated with it either.
