The world can be over. Unfortunately this film survived while it is still another non-Canadian contract to make more films to implement. Perhaps it is because all our good people (Norman Jewison, Martin Short et al) are going to Hollywood.) It is really a short shorter that was not hit in this beautiful and banned film. He can give them trust. The Canadian government should recognize — and this movie is a good example — that money in the grave does not make good movies. If people lost this public money they had to compete, they would have to come up with something of value. As they have re-planted another attack.
