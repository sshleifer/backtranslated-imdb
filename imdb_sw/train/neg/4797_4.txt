After the attacker Vic Moretti (the late Anthony Franciosa) murders the woman who has cheated by Derek, the new Vietnam / Vietnam pastor, and accused the poor man, Derek finds himself in jail where he should compete with a bribe, a Vic brother who runs jail, and, o, an illegal attempt by the executive of CIA shady (good director and director of the first John Saxon) to turn various prisoners into zombies of powerless people. Of course things come from hand to Derek, and other uninvited prisoners, save the day after those infected take the jail. John Saxon is a good actor of talent & as Saxon's director is ... a good talented actress. Saying this film (John's leadership alone to leadership so far) has no other flair to see it would be a bit of losing. However, the film is not completely without reputation. Talk, during the idiotic, is just bad enough to be sometimes. Sadly, this is not enough for movies on the beach and for alone and it takes forever for the film to even begin to enter into it (which is late in the movie). So, many I can recommend this film is to say that if you are a fan of Saxon (which I am actually is), it's worth looking at one, just log in with low expectations and you should be good. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Dana Lis Mason and Tane McClure get topless <br /> <br /> My bridge: D +
