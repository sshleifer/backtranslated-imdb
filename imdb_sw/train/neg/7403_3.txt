This is not the worst film I've ever seen, but that's about as much as it can say about it. It starts with a good condition; The hospital is safe to eliminate, feelings are kept for "eerie". And then ... nothing. Well, somethings. An incomprehensible event ... and no effort has been made to clarify the connection between the strange and uncomfortable conflicts, and the hospitals they took. I mean, come, biker duds? Some bands watched Gwar very much. My self-love was a great demon, who looks very much like a middle-class businessman trying to scare danger, at the same time looking as he would like to prefer to sleep under a bed covered by afghan, to remove his belt, call the cheap beer (perhaps Schlitz), and watch the game. Honestly, I found truckers off bright. In truckstops. Drink coffee. WWWooooohHHHHHoooooooo !!!! Scary! <br /> <br /> Other dogs are more than cartoonish, and even less awesome. At least, on the DVD, the video provides an explanation of their presence in the hospital ... they seem to simply randomly, they play the "bippy" metal, causing people to be a little dead. Preventing a few positive effects, and acting that is not quite frightening due to lack of decent writing, there is nothing here. It's a noisy movie just background.
