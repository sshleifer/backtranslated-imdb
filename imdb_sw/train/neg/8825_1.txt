The only reason to give this movie even one star is how the end made me laugh. I was very optimistic as I often love bad movies of cinema vacation, but this was not characterized. It's really just a bad attempt to show the slide of the slow behavior slowly, which again, not a bad plot, but it's done well here. There are some cases (such as the end) that are not intended to be funny, but really make me laugh loudly. There were several times when I thought the movie would go true in an interesting direction, but it did not reach what could and should be. In my opinion, if you are looking for a flick of Christmas, try Silent Night, Nightly Dead.
