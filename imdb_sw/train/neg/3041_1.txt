Yes I played this film as one bad star. However, it will be in my cycle of Christmas movies right now. This is actually very bad. This is another production of K.Gordon Murray (read: buys a cheap / bad Mexican movie, uses zero money to get English name and leave it in kiddie matin√©es in the mid-1960s.) It is a shame I stumbled over this recently if I'm sure some "enhancer mood" would make this better experience. I cannot restore what many other observers have already said, the Christmas movie with Merlin, the Devil, the wind wing and some of the pathetic children who have seen the bar. I plan to run this on vacation back to Kelsey Grammar's "Carol Christmas". Actually the experience of a holiday conducted in Hell. Now if I can only get "For All Goodnight (aka Slayride)" on the DVD I will have a third element that can't be beaten. You see this film. It goes slowly so that I don't want you to remove the fast-forward button on the two dances! This suggests that a big blue cheese - I think you should pass trouble to enjoy the experience. Feliz Navidad amigos!
