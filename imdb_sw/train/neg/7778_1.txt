This should be the cheesest, the stupidest, most durable movie monster of all time. It is a full joke that came out in the movie. This is like watching monster Loch Ness in rural America. This movie deserves to be thrown into the toilet and completely forgotten. John Carradine, embarrassed on you. People who are linked to this array of garbage need to be persuaded. Wait! Maybe I give them too much credit. I assure you they were talking before photography. Can someone else describe the mysterious and mysterious folly that this leather bucket has? Don't waste the moment of your life watching this. Don't waste your time sending a review.
