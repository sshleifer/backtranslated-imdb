O what a movie to degrade! Putting Los Angeles, in the center of the world from Hollywood filmmakers, this film tries to be a social definition on modern American angst. cross the path in their daily life, humdrum. The order has been closed and followed. Many of the elements of the conspiracy make the film go, such as: driving, shooting, abandoned child, weeds, a gangster who fears a lawyer, a young man going through the night sky, a child of a summer camp. And through all these events, it is often a generous support of the "public awareness" provided through discussion, as the participants compare the information on their experience of life. One character tells another: "When you sit next to this (Grand Canyon), you know how we said people; ... these stones laugh at me, I can tell them, I am worried; really humorous for the Grand Canyon." on the meaning of all: "There is a gulf in this country, growing always a hole between people who have things and people who don't ... it's like this hole is opened down, as big as ... Grand Canyon, and what's filling up." ... is an explosion of wrath, and anger builds violence ... ". In addition to the casual and forced conversation, apart from the unattractive, impressive, away from the dumb conspiracy, the speed of the story is slow. Work is not working and not recommended. The film team is common and satisfied, in contempt of the script for the audience. This was a film project approved by Hollywood suits that make themselves as a powerful gurus, looking down from the top. They think their film will be a wonderful revelation to us for the low, non-conscious people of the film, eager to learn about the real meaning of social change in the United States.
