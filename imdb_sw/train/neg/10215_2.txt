Unhealthy and worst evil, the boring film. Stranger Than Fiction has nothing new to say about anything, there are no more characters of a more unstable attitude, and it depends on the main concepts that are not particularly original and will not be dealt with in an unusual creative way. Will Ferrell fail completely in what he can expect to be his answer to Truman Show of Jim Carey's, and change his usual chances of shouting (widely accepted as you reduce Talledega Nights) for, well, very very no. Emma Thompson is not more offensive by the gentle (that some reviews I have read here talking to her with Oscar's selection are laughable) when Maggie Gyllenhaal does a pleasant job with a very weak script that allows nothing more to introduce her character as a former law student who came out of Harvard to be a loaf because he liked to make people happy. Please. That she finished the collapse of the 'character' of Ferrell is very clever. Marc Forster's quiz for jazz on the film using computer graphics only is used to make it clear that he doesn't appreciate the material he works with. <Br /> <br /> I had either a choice to go to Prestige for the third time or see this. I would like to choose Glory.
