Here's an indie film I wished to love, but finally it couldn't. Lack of script (boldly declaring in key names) is shown in fact and kills images. Story is a nonsensical mess that is not worth trying to think. I quickly got bored within 10 minutes, then I was angry for the first 40 minutes - with the best hope - before hitting the shape of the (mercy) to the end ... even that was not worth extra effort. OZARK SAVAGE tries to be very difficult to be clever, raising its best practices from EVIL DEAD 2 and MATRIX. As a result, there is very little in OZARK SAVAGE which has not been done before, and better. This film would be more fun than 10-20 minutes, but as a feature, it just feels closed and forced. Of course, there is no money in short, so I understand the financial reasons that I think have encouraged them to be set for 75 minutes. Director Matt Steinauer shows a great promise, and I love luck.
