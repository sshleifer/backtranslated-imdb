I would like to tell you something about this movie. I have seen it twice. At first I was a child and the movie was quite entertaining to me. I liked it very much. I thought it was interesting and interesting and the main character was kind of cool. I saw it again a few days ago. It was terrible. True. I don't know why I thought it was funny before but now ... I did not laugh at all. There was nothing even a little entertainment. It was dumb. The story was weak. Acting was not unique. There are key actors in this film but still acting is the best mediocre. <br /> <br /> What's worse is the fact that this film is a racist. True. Don't make a mistake, usually I can't complain about racism in movies. However, I have seen people complaining about the lack of black men on the movie like 'Shaolin' Temple or on the fact that only black man in 'The Street Fighter' is one of the bad guys or ... However, you can get action. There are people who see discrimination everywhere. I wonder how they will respond to the film as 'Meteor Man'. Why? I'll tell you why. No Asians in this film. There are no white people among the good people. In fact there is only one white person in the whole movie and he is the leader of bad people. All good people are African Americans. Don't make a mistake, I don't care it's a good black or white or yellow or red or green ... What I do care about is the fact that we can hardly see a white person in this movie. This is the only movie that I saw. Not true. If there is one black black on a Japanese movie which is a case with 'Street Fighter' there is no problem - in Japan many people are Asians. But if there is only one white person in the American movie there is some kind of problem - in the United States most of the people are white. It's like hiding a Japanese film cast white and one Asian as a bad person. Not true. <br /> <br /> That's right. I give them a movie 4/10 rate. It would be 1/10 if I was not happy with it as a child.
