Bob Porky's Poor Fish '' Porky '' is the same cartoon full of bad puns and one time or two beautiful. Putting in the Shoppe's Porky fish, 'Porky's Poor Poor' is an uncomfortable scene among the black black cartoon 'n' white Porky and one of the books-come-life Merrie Melodies which was popular at that time. Usually of many Porky cartoons, Porky is far from the stars, only visible on the music number opened rather by the end of the film. At other times the star is a cat of scraggly who sees a fish shop as an opportunity for free food but gets more than he is given. Unfortunately, the audience gets less less than they discussed. As sometimes in a series of books-come-to-life, the watch is done by punching signals that can also work well in non-animation. Laughter is a few and, when the cartoon is about to be saved by the strong direction of Clampett, there is very little to suggest 'Porky Poor Fish' on any other less-par advance Porky cartoons.
