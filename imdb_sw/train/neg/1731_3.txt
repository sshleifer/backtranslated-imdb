Twilight area has succeeded some stories about it - such as Star Trek. That is because there are many volunteers who show that no matter what they think each part was a winner. They are the ones who mark each other 10 and can not evaluate efficiently show. For this reason, shortly I reviewed all the previous Star Trek (good and bad) intervals for the general reason and verification was very positive. Now, it's time to do the same for Twilight Zone. When I hit 10 events, this gets just 3 because it was bad. Writing really was bad for shame. Two people from the opposing sides of the great war seem to wander over the whole area. Over time, it seems that they are the only two people left in the world - as you learn in a stupid and complete conclusion. Usually misleading at the end makes this part good - this has killed!
