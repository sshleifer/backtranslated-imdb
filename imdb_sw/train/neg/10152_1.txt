Being a fan of awesome movies, I found this in my video store and I think I would try it. Now that I have seen it I love without a living soul on the planet. I get my tax movies free of charge, and I feel I had no value for my money. I have seen horrible movies during my time, hell is their fan, but this was just an insult.
