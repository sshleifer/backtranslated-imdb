Patrick Channing (Jeff Kober) is a student of Satan / killer who has "First Power": even after being detained by detective Russell Logan (Lou Diamond Phillips) and executed in the gas room, he can inspire his soul from body to body continue to kill for love. With the help of psychic Tess Seaton (Tracy Griffith, half sister Melanie G.) tries to stop Channing. <br /> <br /> This idea might have had some possibility, I think, but eventually the "First Power" is experiencing a typical scripting and film making. This is not something we have never seen before, sometimes it happens well. There is nothing about this film to differentiate from other awesome buttons. More for sure, it's not very exciting and certainly not scary. Phillips is hard to sell as a tough-like nail, military military density, and Griffith does not seem to be very trying; The best man is probably Kober who has different qualities, doing a good job of having great power. <br /> <br /> The maximum is not wrong and the end can't be too much. It is not really acceptable enough for the standard film of the same kind, therefore: <br /> <br /> 4/10
