This is a good film but it is not appropriate for real or emotional or for story story. <br /> <br /> The story depends on the actual events and this reduces the amount of action for almost no, there is no real doubt. Washington is believed in leadership but he is sleepy walking that way, there is no scope to change any muscle act for him or cast. The story falls just a little flat, even though he has never heard the character of the last title is obvious but different from other films about this injustice does not have emotional impact, he is particularly concerned about it and the influence of those outside it helps to appear more professional than concerned with its welfare. There is an attempt to insert some emotion using a boy out who a hero worships Carter but this seems forced. <br /> <br /> It is a good film but once it did not forget.
