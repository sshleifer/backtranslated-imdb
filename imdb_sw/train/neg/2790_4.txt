Julia (Kristina Copeland) travels with her husband Steven Harris (Steven Man) and their young son Alex spend several days with his family in Savage Island, their own island. Couples expect to solve their issues at the weekend on a remote island. While waiting for the boat, Julia and Steven meet two strong men in the port, and when her brother Peter (Brendan Beiser) arrives, he explains that the mountain family of the hill lives on the island. An uncomfortable Peter pulls a pot while driving that night and turns the head to show; however, he runs on a crash on the child of the Savage family, but in the dark he believes he has hit the animal. Later, Savage's family says Alex as a compensation for their lost child. The Young family does not accept the business, and it starts the killing of the family. <br /> <br /> "Savage Island" is a very low-budget movie, with stupid movies, amateur movies instead of amazing beautiful acting. Bad stories are very strange, and there are many unpredictable situations. For example, how can two people leave the two women and the child alone on the road at night with the risk of a troubled family? The logical process will go right into the continent and bring police power to save Peter. Then the Young Family will disappear; Julia and Steven leave their car in the continent and their homes and friends, and no one expels them? Peter calls his sister Julia of Alex when she gets to the boat at first. There are many errors in this flick that I could use multiple lines to write about this issue. I believe this film was done with a home video camera with a very bad picture. Release is well suited for the best working material. My vote is four. Headline (Brazil): "Sangue Day" ("Blood Island")
