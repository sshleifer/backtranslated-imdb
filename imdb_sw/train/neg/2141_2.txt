I was angry to watch this film with my partner, who, like me, is the first fan. This lowest movie is standing! It had the first magic. You can really understand every word mouse said, animation is crappy, the palace is very different from the first movie, there are new characters that have never been mentioned before and were bad, fortunately Prince did not have many lines that protect him from a stupid voice. Basically it is like the King of Lion 1 1/2 except his distinctive stories described by the mouse. Because I show this 2 out of 10 is because the songs that are not available and the characters were more enjoyable.
