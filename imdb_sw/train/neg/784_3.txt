With good audits and observations at international festivals, this movie is not for everyone. The story is similar to other movies, where a young girl from a migrant family needs to overcome many of the most common age problems, and also to fight the pressure of ethnic traditions in her family. He does this by choosing a certain type of sports, and with the help of a local boy, for some reason he likes him, he can cope with his problems and success. <br /> <br /> In Girlfight is boxing, in Bend if Beckham is a soccer, and now is Kung Fu. <br /> <br /> But the fighter is the most inferior product than these two, it was just a shame to look at. Semra Turan, "actress" who plays the role of a little girl, perhaps can do a lot of things, but one thing that she cannot do is act. His presence on the screen is a epidemic and difficulty, a bad condition, which he tries to express some emotion, is bad, his body and face language are amateur actors, very badly and the director. Some of the cast are better, but they can not only save this movie of clich√© for stereotypical characters and shallow plot. Apart from the shortest time of this film is not available or interesting to offer. Even kung fu fighting is not a reason to look at this, it's a wonderful thing. Slow motion was not required, the choreography was basic and was not impulsive, and most of the kung fu scenes are trained or stood in all kinds of kung fu space, not really fighting. Don't mention how to ignore it when a little girl and a boy is fighting with big boys and muscles, and stimulates their feet. The only reason for this film is quite the reason is because it is Europe. It is very easy to announce this film - the first military film from Denmark, but don't show it, not. It's just a drama about a boy's stupid boy with his problems, which is by the way, not a real influence. <br /> <br /> Bad pictures and lines of shame, acting and story.
