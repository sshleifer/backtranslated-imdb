Journalist Darren McGavin (as Carl Kolchak) holds back; this time, he is after the "guest of the night". Once again, police officers and fellow journalists either refuse, or want to cover, normal angle. Production Director Dan Curtis gives the same basic story as the previous "Night", and the lowest achievement. Curtis collects fun help, connects to "Shadow Shadows" by George DiCenzo and Ivor Francis. Jo Ann Pflug (like Louise Harper) leads a huge collection of abdominal players. And, although I've never been mentioned anywhere, Roger Davis must be a friend of Mr. McGavin in the early area, believing that there are vampires!
