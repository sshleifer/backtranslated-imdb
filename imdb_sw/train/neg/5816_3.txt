From the true praise, I expected more from this film and from Tamara Jenkins. The story had found and it was not found to be a step or conspiracy. And it's hard to believe that a 14-year-old girl (mature to her age or no) will be guilty of getting her virginity "over and over." Perhaps I am too young to communicate (I was four years old in 1976), but I had no trouble connecting to Shakespeare's stories in Love or Life is Good and I was not living for one of these settings. Cast is very good but unfortunately to them the script did not insert them to share audience. In general, Slums had time but unless you want to remind you of the halter heads and tube socks, I would say this jump.
