Fools! Fools! Fools! I can't stand Ben yet again. How this person is allowed to make movies is more than me. I can't understand how this happens if I work as I do in the film I will run and own my company ... I must go on fire. GOD! This movie was a clear bunch, of steam, interesting of POO, which needs to be vapoorized if it was possible. Something else I say about the 10 lines of text in the comments is idiotic. What's wrong with just saying a few things about the movie? I can't understand why sites will need a short novel written while a brief comment is all that is important.
