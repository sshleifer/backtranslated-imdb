If you have seen a very small film, this can be great for you. If you have seen many movies, this is a joke. The act of real heroes is shown very badly. Not to mention, there are songs, there are many obstacles, and most importantly, the fighting scenes are stupidily made. New characters, good trends, would work better, but since it has heros / heroines all of the emotions, you can predict what happens next. You don't feel sad when something happens, feelings that are going on are bad, especially because we've seen this actor in another 1000 hindi movies. It thinks that the real movie, but fails to show. There are times when you are wondering, you have thousands of military vehicles full of soldiers led by the militia to fight with them and no bombs prevail over them. What? Pakis is very bad for the purpose or the director made them foolish? There were only a few characters who did very good work, but now they are concerned with conspiracy, action, it is for conversion. This film would be short if it took songs, flashbacks, stick to the point.
