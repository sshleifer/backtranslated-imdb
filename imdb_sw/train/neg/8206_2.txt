Together with one of my very dear participants, James Spader, I expected this film to be at least worthy. It was not. After the first half I looked at all its parts and remote control in my hand so the speed was ready. So desperate, so standard, someone knows what will happen in each area. One can even predict the word of the dialogue. This is one of those movies that makes the head one head and say, "How has this movie ever been done?" In an effort to say something positive, I will add that there are some side effects of ignoring special effects. But, in general, if you have seen 5 movies of Sci / fi, or you are over 9 years old, lay a permit and skip this.
