I have been trying to track this film just by writing bad words about "young people cheating and killing someone in their house" and so on. I think I started to see parts of this film when I was 10 years old when you were running a cable. It made a lot of feeling! It is a kind of film that children know that they should not watch, and change the facility when their parents enter. When I saw who was healed, I couldn't believe that some of these good actors were in a very bad movie. Then again, if you would like to see men who mislead their wives to be killed, then this is an interesting film. Also, if I remember, there is a certain interesting time of pseudo-lesbian. Maybe the dumbest end of all time, but still ... don't remember.
