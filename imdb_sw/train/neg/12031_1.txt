First of all this movie is not comedy; unless you make a great effort you can't laugh. Second, the movie is slow and stirring. Acting is not bad but not special. There is Lucky Lucky comic on two families (one with great big and one with big ears) fighting in a small town ... you laugh more like reading this rather than waste your time with this movie. Religion and doctrine are not the best source of good comedy and this movie has nothing more than to prove this law. There is a subject like '' home teachers ''; this had a good time. My last comment is: don't waste your time and money to watch this non-dynamic and stimulating film.
