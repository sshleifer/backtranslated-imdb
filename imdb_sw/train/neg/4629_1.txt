It is clear that he demonstrated a popular show of 1950 Misty Ayers "acting" talent. It's not bad he can't act. It is a beautiful story of sweet, Sally Down (Ayers) innocent to be a drug and forced into white (prostitution). Then he meets with Tommy Cole who likes to easily. Want to help him avoid but he can? Surely you do not care. <br /> <br /> No real leather here - Ayers just jump under underwear (double). Others are just a small fascinating story of the worst acting, the "comedy" senseless (did not think prostitution was funny but I know what?) And the terrible conversation after being closed. I admit there was an end when I didn't see it coming but it's not enough to stay this way. Also the Ayers experiment in the act is pleasing! A real bomb. Avoid.
