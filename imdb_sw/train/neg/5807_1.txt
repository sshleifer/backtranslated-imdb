Don't be upset with this film, it's bad when you are judged on personal characteristics, but compared to the nature of 1972 (which is classic) is less serious. With BTW, someone said that the 1972 movie is bad compared to the book. This is proud, movies should never be judged against books that are being taken. They are two different types of art (if this is required to be mentioned but it seems to do so). If you use these criteria for all movies then "2001" would be exploited and thus "Forest Forest" and "Sheep of Sheep".
