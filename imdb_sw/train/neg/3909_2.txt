When I discovered that there was a movie with Meryl Streep's first partner and Wynona Ryder, I walked on the roof! But I had a hard fall after watching this filming and I still have a harvest. He treated his family as a fraud, especially his sister, played with Glenn Close. I could not get around or hear with any characters and I am not ready, but sex events were not needed or could be reduced. The Wynona and Antonio characters could be further developed and their love would be more interested. And what was the attitude of Meryl and his "authority"? Why didn't they get into this more? This film had many dead barriers and the bottom line is that this is a very powerful movie and there were many talented missing here.
