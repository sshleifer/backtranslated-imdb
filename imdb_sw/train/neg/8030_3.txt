It is not very interested in this truth. Stories are very good and not recommended. I enjoyed the first 10 minutes, a good salary. After this it was very good. Tim is not recommended role, comes as a pile of an independent pile and Pruitt taylor vince can not fail as a trumpet player. It is the best film and as a musician, you feel a little after watching it. No 1900 events do or play with colleagues, he is totally independent. I find it difficult to build any relationship with this kind of behavior, maybe I am looking at an inappropriate film. If you do not have a real passion for life or a feeling of music about all of that at the moment, you will appear in suspension and look at this.
