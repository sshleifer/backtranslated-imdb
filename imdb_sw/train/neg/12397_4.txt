I read somewhere where this film was supposed to be a 1949 film film, "Criss Cross". I found that the end was desperate but it was better than this film. This is a "neo-noir" since it is modern and has a color, the two things that purify would make it unacceptable for the black film status. The worst way, however, is not the movie (that was good) but the story of mud. Hey, some of the 40 stories of Dashiell Hammett were similar but I didn't care about some of them. The film staff here did not help the situation by putting obstacles in a story that seemed like every three minutes. Not surprisingly it was going on with this story. It was ridiculous! What is happening is that for a 45-minute mark, they are very chaotic no one cares. I know I wasn't.
