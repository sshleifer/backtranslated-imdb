I had to look here at school. And make it ... <br /> <br /> Non-spelling artists, talentless script, and an experienced director. <br /> <br /> This game is wasting your time. Don't even see the film. Don't bother. You will be very disappointed. My teacher said it should be good. What was wrong. He even slept in that little way. Film artists were just bad. The best actor there was an old man and not much to say. It has a terrible plan and bad characters. So it's not true and I can honestly say that he wasn't sure. The script was non-binding and combining. There were points on the film when I hit my brows opportunities and said, "What?". There were also many dirty relationships and holes of conspiracy. It was just absolutely awesome.
