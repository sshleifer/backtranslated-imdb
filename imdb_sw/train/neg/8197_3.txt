I have seen this film tonight and I must say it is a mess. I love Vince Vaughn but loses more exciting which is funny here and the film is more than the bottom remake of the classic crappy 80 "Santa Claus movie" but out of the camp or bad Sheena Easton song at the end. The story is your flight to the sheep of the sheep in the family who returns to the face of his family for a holiday kind of thing but with the North Pole as its set. Of course Fred (Vince Vaughn) is a family who found himself back home after a series of backs that includes his partner (Rachel Weisz in the role of comeo) to throw him, so he returns home to deal with his parents and his most successful brother Claus (Paul Giamatti). ) and wacky high jinks follow with a bit of rival brother and a bit of anarky also which ends up all Christmas. Now if you think you know the end of this film, I think you would be right because it describes on the hill. In the role of play, Vince Vaughn has the favorite player who always plays but this time he ends more surprising than pleasing, Miranda Richardson has Mrs. Claus but the role is more than one score, Elizabeth Banks has Santa's assistant but she is not a great character most of the neurotic jokes and the poor Kevin Spacey take the essence to play the man who plays in the film "Glengarry Glen Ross" but slightly more than anal. Only two players who come out of this film and their honor are Paul Giamatti, who brings true cleanness and warmth to his position as Santa Claus but seems to be embarrassed to be in the movies and you can't blame him for Rachel Weisz, who can do a lot more much more than most of the main characters do with them, which is a shame because both Rachel Weisz and Paul Giamatti deserved better than what this script gave them. <br /> <br /> To put it in short, great desire.
