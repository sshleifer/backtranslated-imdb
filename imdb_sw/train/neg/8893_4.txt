Celia Johnson is as good as Nurse. Michael Hordern is as good as Capulet, though it's his usual cry and whinnying and not a patch on Lear King. John O'Conor reads the well as Friar Laurence though it is never good anywhere. Alan Rickman is as good as Tybalt, in the first work of "yuk" that would make him famous. Benvolio of Christopher Strauli is compassionate. <br /> <br /> Settings are good, if not appropriate as on BBC Shakespeare. And so yes. Others are weakened by fear.

Patrick Ryecart is not compared to him, and his independence is not meaningless. Scene of Balcony flows smoothly and indirectly with emotional or impact effect. Their death comes as forgiveness. If I had a pig, I would give them an early hour. <br /> <br /> Anthony Andrews can't be seen as Mercutio, a great shock if you remember his good work in "Brideshead Revisited."

This version does not suggest class use, or more.
