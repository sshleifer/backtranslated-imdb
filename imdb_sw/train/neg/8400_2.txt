Even a very powerful fan can be like a film, (I one of them) holes are not given any material to work with. It is also embarrassing because this is the only film of the length of the dimensions that they have made with Curly, and this one effort to them is very bad, when it can be a great potential. Unsupported music numbers cannot help either. The shortest thing they did with the same head laughs more.
