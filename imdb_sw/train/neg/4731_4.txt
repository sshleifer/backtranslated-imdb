The half-hearted attempt to bring Elvis Presley into a modern day, but despite the little swimming area and Playboy-Playboy magazine, Presley is surrounded by the old coy, clich√©s winking. Woman takes E.P. on the beach and then take his life - and does not seem to care! Dick Sargent is tough on another board, but Don Porter and Rudy Vallee (!) Try as hard as two older Elvis (he is a month, you see). Some of these songs are very good, especially "Welcome to Love", but if you want to see someone who likes, hipper, updated Elvis sex-comedy - look elsewhere. When Elvis and its Fatal Attraction enters the bed together, there is actually a wooden board among them! Get the truth. ** from ****
