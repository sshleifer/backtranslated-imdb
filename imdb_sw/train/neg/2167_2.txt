Die For (1989) was just d.t.v. The feature that made it appear on the nasuem of the cable announcement during the early nineties. The only thing known about this feature was the last movie Duane Jones. Apart from that there is no reason to check this flick of the vampire unless you like the pseudo ass blows moving as a terrible film. Vampire is very tired of love and is looking for the backs of L.A. search. Will he succeed or Vlad will hit again as he has for the past century? This movie should be great because two columns were followed recently. They are very bad that makes this seem like normal. I know this is a film about vampires but film makers could use lighting. It was not recommended by me because I didn't like it. <br /> <br /> 'nuff said?
