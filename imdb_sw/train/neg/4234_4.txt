It's not the slasher movies better at all, but why, it's very good. The plan is crippled but the killer is not very bad. I should be honest, if you do not follow the bands that appear in this film, you will not see this film as strange as those who do. I knew someone who saw this film and was disappointed because of the limited quality of the film but you understand that it was made during the spare time to be on a tour, between playing with babies and drinks with previous friends. it does not take it seriously. It's a ubber cheese during the best punk and for more than 100 kills, most of them are ultra gory, it's a fun movie to have friends on watch, drink and have fun!
