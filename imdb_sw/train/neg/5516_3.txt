I do not know what to do this of the most interesting 2007 muscapen. Trying to become a new millennium cross-diversion between Golden Pond and Prince of Tide, this film ends up being aggressive mess shifting so mercurially between comedy and melodrama that pitch pitch always looks away. The main problem seems to be the difference between the direction of the sense of Garry Marshall and Mark Andrus' dark, rather than combining the screenplay. The story focuses on an unrelated relationship between mother Lilly and daughter Rachel, who have moved from San Francisco to a small town Hull, Idaho where grandmother Georgia lives. The idea is for Lilly to leave Rachel for the summer under the authority of Georgia's authority to be filled with its martial law since the 17-year-old boy has become an incorrigible hellion. Setting is clear enough, but characters are made to move quickly and often without understanding between compassion and pleasure to resemble a designated story line. It focuses on issues of alcoholism, child abuse and unemployed families until it gets into its patent resolution. Three middle workers deliver some of the major convolutions but with different degrees. Perhaps due to its distinctive features and the sound of his smoking voice, Lindsay Lohan makes Rachel's values ​​and manipulative techniques, though she is less reliable if her behavior shows psychological injuries that gives reason for her behavior. Huffman's feelings are compelled to play Lilly in two details - like an angry girl, an angry daughter for a woman who is not near her like a angry, drunken woman who begins to recognize her accountability in the situation of her daughter. He does what he can and does both sides, but his efforts do not add to the human body and blood. Around the seventy, Jane Fonda looks good, like the weather - she was beaten as she is here, and has the presence of stars to leave with the cartoon-like tests of Georgia. The problem I had to beat Fonda is that the story actress deserves more than a series of single liners and reproductive stares. Between this and 2005 Monster-law-execrable, it makes it wonder if its best work is behind it. It should not be surprising that male actors are completely hidden. Garrett Hedlund looks a bit too with a surfer-dude like Harlan naïve, a volunteer Mormon whose love for Rachel could delay her two-year missionary stend. Cary Elwes plays in the memory known as Lilly's husband, the unfortunate case where predicting the prediction appears to be the last telegraph of the film. There is also Dermot Mulroney any unknown in the role of three players of the injured players, the old Lilly fire and Rachel's new doctor as Doctor Doctor Doctor. Simon Ward. Laurie Metcalf is responsible for having a sister like Simon Paula's sister, while Marshall regularly Hector Elizondo and pregnant women Paul Williams are shown in the cameos. Some of Andrus' s conversations are very clear and the steroo's insistence voice cannot cope with anything that feels right. There is a small surplus with a DVD of 2007, no even exciting. Marshall provides a song of definitions which have many trademarks of its lacon humor. There are several deleted cases, including three variations on the end, and gag reel. The seven-minute period is included, including the original exhibition trailer, six minutes of short time showing three players and five minutes to Marshall.
