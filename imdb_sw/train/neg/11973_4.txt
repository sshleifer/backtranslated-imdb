This is probably one of the worst French movies I have seen now, among the more than 100 French movies I have ever seen. Bad screenplay and medioacre / acting non-function leads to power without power. and all that does not matter how good the French area and fancy music can add stories. One of the most important weaknesses of this movie is that these two characters don't want people, if the audience doesn't care what happens to them. I was surprised how this film won the jury winner in cannes, a man, I love almost all the films organized in the cannes, but not this. Great desire for me.
