I took this movie tonight because it looks like a fun movie. I thought that you can't avoid the concept of Ex Girlfriend and super powers. but the film was confused and meaningless ... The author also continued to provide us with a sense of toilet and sexuality that a young boy can be able to love. It seems that it can be very easy to draw stories from Fatal Attraction Super hero .. but I think it's not. <br /> <br /> This is not a romantic romantic comedy announced that. You can't take the child to see and you would be ashamed to see that day. If the author could make a basic story next to the above concept and purify it - the movie may have a chance of fighting. <br /> <br /> Damage of time. <br /> <br /> B
