This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I saw it at the first time in SXSW and I was very disappointed. The director did not know a little about John Lennon and even said as the first amount. This is a drama, but people were laughing around how cheesy film was. That's not a good sign. The only gifts to save were Dominic Monaghan and Jason Leonard as a colleague of Livien / colleagues. They were playing when all the movie emerged became very powerful. The fall of the cheesy of Beatles lyrics was just wonderful. The sound was good, however, and perhaps it was a good part of the movie. Unless you are one of these mad fans, Dominic Monaghan's madness, do not worry about this.
