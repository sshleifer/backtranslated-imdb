I saw recently and I must say, I was transferred to the real story of the story. However, "Holly" as the film did not work at all. I am still ready to look at the document that the producers planned this project have done because I think it will be a compelling task than this film. The global scope was included by B- class participants but their role was correct, and I must mention a little pastor who played Holly. This was his first role of the movie and he did a very good job, considering him the most challenging part. Ron Livingston was not enough but he was like Patrick, the US whose efforts are to "save" Holly, but Chris Penn was good at this, his last role. Unfortunately, despite my positive views of Virginie Ledoyen and Udo Kier, all these participants had forgotten very much and did not do their best in this film. <br /> <br /> I believe the message of the film and intention, but it must be fair, so I measure "Holly" 3 stars according to its limitations as a movie. But I think this is worth considering and I'm glad that people behind this film have also made a document that I hope to have first on the BBC and other TV networks.
