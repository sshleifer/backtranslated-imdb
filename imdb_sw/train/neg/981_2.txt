As a great surprise to Marlene Dietrich, I had (finally) look at this picture, very much. It is the first film of Dietrich color, and the most beautiful blond in the world is red! Make start. The story is a great weight, it involves a matter that itself tries to hard my hard: religious guilt. (Who needs ???) It is possible to say, perhaps, of all the films of Dietrich (and I have seen more, including "Pittsburgh") this is the only one even when its performance is not worth much. Color photography is the same (this is a very early release of Technicolor), but in any sense. Sexual assault: C. Aubrey Smith, Basil Rathbone (said enough?). The only thing of interest is John Carradine's caricature of the island's performance as "Sand Sand," who predicts all that will happen. The "end end" is one of the most painful abortion ever. However, another example of David O. Selznick's most popular reputation (made a very real film? - except if this One?) And, with one last resentment, the MGM DVD's sound is aggressive, and the voice levels are randomized. Not very available.
