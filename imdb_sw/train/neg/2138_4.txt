War, Inc. - Companies take up the war in the future and use the killings alone Brand Hauser (John Cusack) to do their rain work against the CEOs. Comedy dark satirizing military and similar organizations. It was often difficult to figure out what went on. I kept waiting for something important. There is no reason or way for madness. It is taken by Cusack to be a "spiritual successor" for Grosse Point Blank. I.e., War is much less knocking. We also see Cusack as a killer who protects * a spoiler * who should kill as he embraces his conscience. In order to be fair, John Cusack looks a reliable kind of taking half a dozen guys with ease easily. A short struggle is good. Another part of the film is not recommended. It is often quirky often bordering with wonder. War Inc is not enough to be discriminatory, and it is also powerful for anyone even to think about whatever the message of the film may be, which I think may be non-encouraging ways that organizations, like warring groups competing with the plan without falling due to given how they affect the average citizen. Interesting, but the satire doesn't work because it is not good and with his heart the film does not have a heart. We have to give a young man about how the war affects the shell of the Cusack character rather than millions of lives separated by war. John Cusack provides good performance. Its shots of a hot sauce and gives a smaller flight than each other but bridges have a sense of replacing character characteristics. Marisa Tomei emerges as a romantic journalist. There really isn't a lot of chemistry among them. Hilary Duff tries to focus on Russian and does not make the fool himself. Joan Cusack screams and screams out. Blech. Ben Kingsley can return to Oscar if he has not started performing good practice regularly. It is sad. It is not a bad movie, but finally you should ask "War, what is good?" Anything. C-
