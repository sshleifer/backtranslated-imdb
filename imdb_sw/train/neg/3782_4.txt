Here is the good news first. "Spirit" is a very interesting film of animation in the current release home. Illustration and effects are revolutionary, and I recommend giving this movie a look through the exhibition alone. <br /> <br /> And now for bad news. I mean when I say that animation is the only thing that this film goes to. You can remember that "Spirit" is badly affected by "Lilo and sew" last summer. The first person who says it is because Disney is properly installed and has the best ads can write four long letters with the title "Why Script 'Lilo and Stitch" did not grow. " <br /> <br /> With new technologies for new animation displayed in the "Spirit", the story is almost * awesome. There is a lesson here, and (it doesn't mean to say) not only on animation movies. You may have more effects on the appearance of the dying person, but if your story is boring and, more importantly, we don't care about your characters, it's a bad decision of the film. Simple as that. Animation still focuses on mind; I can't just wait to see what the most thoughtful person does.
