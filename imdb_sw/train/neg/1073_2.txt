I can't believe that many talents can be lost in one film! The man of Gingerbread begins on the right leg, and can create great final prospects. But at some point the movie turns into one of the worst stories I have lost my time. It is so precisely how Mallory Doss recognized it uses the behavior of Kenneth Branagh near his nose. At the end of the film it is not popular and it is flat like beer, which has been left out the sun for a very long time. The Gingerbread man is probably the worst movie of Grisham forever and this is not altered by the fact that talented stars collect movie. Don't waste your time here!
