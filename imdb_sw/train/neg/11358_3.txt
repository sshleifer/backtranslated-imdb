When I saw this trailer on TV I was surprised. In May 2008 I was in the Six New Flags in New Jersey and this was a reflection of the 4-D attraction (you know, the attraction that seats are going). I take that version I saw was summarized version (15 min.) And it was also created to increase the effect of motion. It was a good movie ... but that was. It was education and told about the first message but the end of CGI's position seemed a bit ... well ... do. I was not a big fan of a movie but I would like to recommend this film to any parent who wants to let their children know about the first month. I will say, the actors were well chosen and the characters themselves were good. So all-by-all, I would like to say, if you want to bring small children ... go for it. But if you want to take your older children, take them to another film ... they will thank you.
