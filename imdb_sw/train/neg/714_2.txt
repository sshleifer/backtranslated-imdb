This is a fatigue movie, but it is still a young female, clich√©s. There is a Nazi witch who has experimented with sf in the apartment? Oh please! Wanting a horrible state of fear and fear, the overall feeling of the film is that of the most horrible pregnancy. Not having any expectations before, I am left with: Xander-aged from Buffy and the heroine face face that doesn't seem to know how to act. Said Adrienne Barbeau just met before the most beautiful "Women of Cannibal in the Jungle of Death Advocado". Cameras and editing enhances the overall impression of cripples.
