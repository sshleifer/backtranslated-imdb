Another weak season of the third season, 'Is There Really a Beauty?' however it has at least one important element of the plot that is very different and as Spock would say, interesting. The main character is a stranger who should carry around in a black box because his appearance is so horrible that it causes humanity mad. It is very bad part that can not live up to this wonderful premise. In fact, I think, it was a mistake to 'show' a stranger, such as his real face in any way even approaching the building; all we find is the standard of Star Trek psychedelic used for any number of objects in different events, usually when the ship passes through a magnetic storm or one thing. In any case, the appearance of Kollos may at least be tolerated by Mr. Spock, and then only if the spock is wearing a special visor. (For a long time, I thought the visitor's name was 'Carlos,' which I've got humorous, but I digress.) Spock is needed to remember and Kollos at one time so that a visitor can run Enterprise to return to security. This has been completed, but when Spock / Kollos returns to the mind-meld, to golly, Spock completes its visor. Uh oh. He goes to heaven but finally comes back with the help of Kollos's assistant, a blind woman with mental powers. This might have been a wonderful part, better but it is not properly addressed and comes as one of the worst showings of the series' last season.
