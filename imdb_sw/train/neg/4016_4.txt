There is a DVD published in the UK in 2002 Code HRGD002 on the lid, no ASIN, VFC 19796 on disk, no IFPI code inside the inner mouth. <br /> <br /> Maybe transfer directly from VHS. It is not a great place to talk about adult film. But this has a small plot, and the characters are honest. It was shown in the United States in the most popular movies. I have seen it in Pensylvannia behind 1975. So it fits the space in the Encyclopedia of Movies. The DVD has no specific features and no headings, and may be made using the VHS tape as a source
