This movie was so bad, the first movie was not meant but it is radiculously ignorant if they didn't have enough and the first 5 films you need to add another, why not just do this in the ongoing series like James Bond, I will tell you exactly why for the film The guarantee is very good and these films are glowing, I do not understand, it was thought to be a cross between such kind of fear and comedy for good I 1 year old brother can not be afraid of the attempt of ignorance in fear, spit in front of people who at least want to be afraid at some point in a film called horror. Please no more of these movies.
