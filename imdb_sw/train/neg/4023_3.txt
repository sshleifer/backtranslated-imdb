I was looking at this with a friend of mine, who is a vampire striker, and I was overlooked by the fact that this film is available. This film should be shown to prisoners of war, yes, it's bad. Even John McCain could not stay this way. Why is the rating of 3/10? Because it was the midget of the vampire. Come, what is more entertainment than the midget of the vampire?
