This is my first movie review on IMD. I was forced to register after watching this film. I cannot with good conscience allow this movie to be seen with me. People should warn! <br /> <br /> First, my rating is: 0 (as in "zero") I love Jack Black, Ben Stiller, Rachel Weis, and Christopher Walken, and yet, I hated this film . There is a plot, but he cares about when there is no script. Negotiations cannot be true and happen, the situation is given, the flow of events is slow and to some extent, the characters are not worried and uncomfortable, and the story, though on the basis of a good premise, is stupid. This movie is a piece of poo. Never think you lose money on this film, it's not even worth your TIME spent watching. Please don't see ... I ask you!
