Decreased and beautiful pictures exchanged, and sometimes music is sad (you know Bjork) in history, for the first 75% of the film. If you didn't have enough sleep, that's a good time. But, at the end of 20% of the film director decides to bring the idea of ​​regeneration, regeneration or perhaps, through S&M images: "spiritual lovers" looking for each other's bodies with knives. For me I was very worried and really changed the overall impression of the art of abstract art and the image of modern Japanese secret. Operator and director is good, but it's amazing. It does not enjoy even.
