After reading in many years about how this film was great, how it has established Ruiz among French critics (especially the Cahiers of snobb), when I finally looked at it a year ago, I found it a good wish (but then, I think my expectations were the sky-top). To shoot in black and white, full of deliberate brain (released for TV, sympathy, one hour long) is asked in the form of a dialogue between art skills and a distant writer when reflecting through the series paintings (which are shown in tableaux modeling style) and try to find if they have certain characteristics of political crimes. (The Kate Beckinsale unknown film has the same argument). Borgesian is a word I have read a lot in the instructions about this movie, but I would say almost every story of Borges more interesting than this film.
