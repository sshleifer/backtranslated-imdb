I was one of the few free people who showed to see Steve's video. It was a great experience ... in the film of propaganda film and patience. I was hoping that the film could be a real document of Michael Moore's visit to my local school, UVSC, but it became another attempt to freedom, moving-and-burn by approving staff and community religious. It certainly seems to devote to the film manufacturer to make the document showing only his ideas on issues. What is most amazing is to see all '10' votes that his home houses are written here. Did you see this video? Golly gee Batman, this should be a title with all Men's President! Their estimation is obvious as a preference in this film. Well, if voting on IMDb will help the mature movie. Maybe my vote will help this balance out.
