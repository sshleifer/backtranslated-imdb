I looked at the mask in the 80's and is now displayed on Fox Kids in the UK (late at night). I remember thinking that it was cool back in the afternoon and had other stations but looking at it now gives me tears. I've never noticed before how to stimulate and ignore this picture of the cartoon was true. It's very clear! It is not close to one league as The Transformers, He-man or Thundercats and very quickly forgot and almost everyone immediately stopped making. I just look at Fox Kids because Ulysses 31 comes straight after it (that's like the mask doesn't put the first sleep). One of the less than 80 cartoons that I am hoping to forget about once after completing Fox Kids!
