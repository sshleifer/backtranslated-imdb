Lama, blind, lame! A 90-minute minute that is very 89 minutes. The rough environment and the atmosphere and possibilities (a neglected meeting) have been damaged by a stinker of a script filled with unhealthy dialogue that emphasized oh-so-hard to be hip. Many are just shy, and the gonzo experimental fear falls flat (sample discussion of this film: after displaying his artillery, a quick dolly shot to the next character of Barbeau's vigilante ?? he: `any questions? 'Hyuck hyuck hyuck). The worst, worried, homophobic joke and judging from the effects of organisms, it seems like the director looked at 'the way of evil' very often. I give my friends a long time to rent this turkey and share it with the last nine minutes they will not be able to come back. What's the turd.
