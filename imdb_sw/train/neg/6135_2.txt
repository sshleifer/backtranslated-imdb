America needs the best man possible to win the "Match" so who is hiring? Gymnast (Oh brother!) Played with Kurt Thomas who has the best skills to win in a game that involves ninjas, a village of crazies and Richard Norton who is told by Kurt Thomas "put his accessories in his pants." (His real words) I missed this in the movie and it was a good reason because I would have been taken out because of the laughter I had at regular intervals. The first thing that went through my mind was how badly the ninjas are like gymnasti can run their ass. Kurt Thomas is like a 4th foot and does not beat one like "The best man to work" As for the talent of acting on Kurt Thomas, well if you can't say something good ... In all weight though someone needs to ask how much cocaine was used to give The idea to be stupid. The only decision to throw Tara Reid as a scientist climbs the difficulty here. For 18 years though this was the name of the unsuspecting movie I ever seen. Not saying I didn't realize this, I was laughing hard I was almost dead. Twice. In just 80 years there may be a film with such a bad idea. Although the record is the only movie that ever creates the hero to wimpy, he can not even pull the sword from the outside. This is the most effective film that has been made, and one of the most hilarious ones too. <br /> <br /> * from 4- (Bad)
