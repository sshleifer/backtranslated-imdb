An unemployed family goes home to vacation with the results of murder and murder. Badly sexy Milligan home made. It is no better than a home movie (as many Milligans films are) this is the destruction of the 1960s style. (Although it has decided to rated). The film is subjected to cast and uneven production. (No one has ever been sure where the money was loved on its movies since it was lost). His worst bad movie should not see unless it's full of Milligan or because it has a good looking people.
