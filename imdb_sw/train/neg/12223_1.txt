I remember when this piece of rubbish came out, all the newspapers had emerged about how it had taken years to Barbra Streisand to get the film. Well it didn't take many years; The play just opened in 1975, eight years before. It made the Broadway star of the great actors Tovah Feldshuh, who probably would have to be healed in the film, but NOOOOO ... BARBRA Great STAR had to do that. AND FOR MUSIC IN DAY! This film is a general tragedy from beginning to end. For one thing, Barbra was a YEAR of years when she did and looked every minute. There was no way anyone could swallow him as a little girl would like to learn Torah. And then when dressing like a boy gets a camp. I see the impression that Streisand cannot consider that it was not interesting so she played next to the preparation; he is as good as a boy than he is like a girl. And if that's not bad, he is responsible for both the school of Avigdor (Mandy Patinkin, who when the best is shooting behind his back naked) AND his girlfriend (Amy Irving, who makes normal size sleepwalker, little to tell the poor woman always it goes when the director hates and does not know what he is doing. Yentl even goes up to marry a girl; -in-top (perhaps like looking into his mind), and each as an intrusive and irritating as fingers on the board. <br /> <br /> I won't say that Streisand doesn't show a dull of promise as a director here; some pictures are beautiful (Patinkin's back exactly), and he has a good eye on the problem. The problem with this movie is that he will not come out of his own way. for two hours and fifteen minutes. I was sick of any confusion after forty-five minutes.
