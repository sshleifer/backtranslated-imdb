This film is a great bunch. I don't know why anyone felt that the Garland / Mason version needed to be reconstructed again, and why Striesand would be the first choice of star. For this, I don't know why our people (Americans Americans) have a large amount of Striesand as a kind of treasure. At least in my opinion, he had worked skillfully with the Funny Girl, and What Bogdanovich's Up Up Doc. <br /> <br /> Make a warranty and classy Judy, or even original (good film for its own right), but please, Please, PLEASE stop this stinkpot!
