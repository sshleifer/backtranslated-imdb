I got this as a Turkish film and I had no desire. Acting - in general though most have been on other movies it is clear that they had to work hard to do this bad thing for a long time on all this movie and out of the accident allowing to decrease acting. Plot - being generous I would like to say that the author began starting with a plot but he did his job of ignoring it. The plot crashed faster with Chinese computers. Script - now which was a disgusting nature. failed to walk with any rhyme or reason. most of the line and characters were best pathetic for imbecilic. The script worked hard to ensure that no behavior was considered to be considered. I have watched other movies where extra are more interesting and unlikely. <br /> <br /> Special effects - ROTFLMAO !!!!! They were special buses of wise-wise <br /> <br /> Redirect - until you could come with your ability to lead a copy of your favorite style of style otherwise you would just fail like this. It is good to know that your friends / family has given you 10 stars for this movie
