One of the most boring slashers ever .. If you can even call it. I can't watch this even if it is some kind of porno film, which looks very similar. The fact that you look at a small group of middle-aged people in the forests cannot be connected. They did these kinds of movies for young people, so who were struggling when they got this sleep? My favorite part of this film is the archive art and that's the only reason I chose to find this film, which came to be part of the 50th Movie Suspense Pack and after seeing other movies in this 50 pack, I will know that it's another place . So if you have a good slasher in the forests, I recommend before the Daylight and the Last Terror.
