This is a real bomb. We should believe that Merle Oberon is the daughter of sequestered of a proud politician who must prove Tom DeLay of the 1930s that he is worth supporting as a presidential candidate. Poor Merle cannot go anywhere, but surrounded by politicians and their fearful and trembling women and only supported by Harry Uncle Davenport. She joins her two girls on the date of the blind and Gary Cooper happens to show. Some shots of rodeo may have made things, of "Misfits," but no such luck with this. Gary then returns to the official dinner, where Merle leads, and, though invited to sit down and join the group, reads their speech on their snobbery. Where did you have a sudden from a cowboy? The most fascinating part of the film is the phantom party that Gary holds in his unidentified home for his lost wife, Merle. What? Will there be no end? One to avoid.
