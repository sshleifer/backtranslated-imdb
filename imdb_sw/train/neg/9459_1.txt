Bad. Bad. Bad. This series line involves this small film that can attract idiot children and their parents to the movies. and its ... # 1 Movie in America! What is this country thinking? Mike Myers looks more like Micheal Jackson. Some Chineese woman sleeps in 3 minutes. It's grotesuque and bad. When Ogg Green and Ham come in 2005 I will be very happy! (not) Eddie Murphy and Tracy Morgan probably play two hipsters trying to get lost Green-May and Ham. They will try to evict Sam-I-Am and that means a boy running. (I hope they do not have the damage to the classic book.) Don't waste time and money to see this.
