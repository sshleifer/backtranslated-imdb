Have you ever sat in a movie when 20 or 30 minutes have gone and suddenly you realize that you have seen the movie before? It happened to me and "Youth Students". Video clip cover, if you can find a video, is a very cheat. I would like to swear that two women in the cover are not even on the film. However, I was born ten years old to appreciate the best points of this film or ... it's just a junk junk. I am so joining towards the end but I think some out there have developed a relationship with this film. <br /> <br /> Hmm ... plot. The plot. Let's see ... there must be a plot around here somewhere. No, I can't find it. It is very good for high school elders who do dopey and do drugs and speak in tongues that have been decades ago. One of the female students has lost her teacher. The teacher has a frigid wife (who is actually known as ice) so she accepts the development of a girl. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of driving around an inane conversation with a lot of play spastic. Our cat, BooBoo, was seamless with high school children playing. He looked at the amazing force as the players who had gyred and emerged on the dance floor. It is good to note that at least one species has found something interesting in this situation. 1/10
