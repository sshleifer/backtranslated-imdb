I watched this film on the 21st march this year. Saying a desire. Better than "Tridev" .Plot is a hackneyed. Anyway.Azghar Jhurhad is conspiring to kill his younger brother. He makes a plan to send a few people. School comes to pretend to be friends of Prabhats.Tell the child. For his father he throws him out of the house. Then comes the next time he and Aakash are going to Kenya to find him. he did well, Sonam was lost, Jyotsna was lost but he seemed to be good. For a child playing with Sunnys brothers in the movie was good. Seeing sad he had to get his character killed. made well.Irish was enough.Amrish and Gulshan did well.The cinema is best in both India and Kenya.Script is weak but has a few good discussions. Also circles too .One of the music was the same. Samundar "The sound of the song was beautiful. Other songs were saved. Don't see this. Measuring-3/10
