Even Steve Martin and Dan Aykroyd could not save this film from the set of an emu egg. According to the series of Phil Silvers TV's classic, it was bombed because: A) It was changed to the 1990s, and B) A simple premise of a series of television series became a confused, weak and gentle screens. The original television series used a few talented characters to show the most beautiful characters who are doing better but hilarious. Expanding this premise in the 1990s movie there was a problem, and it shows. No one can pay enough to sit on this stinker the second time.
