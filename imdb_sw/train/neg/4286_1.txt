This is a very good first film Jason Scott Lee I saw. I say very much, because I have also seen a soldier, who plays the villain ... but thanks to what I heard, not considered to be Jason Jason Lee's film. This, however, is. And if this is any sign of the quality of these films, I will not see any of the others. Lee is basically adopted as an artist of military art ... as a guide, he is bad. He gets in the battle with unnamed characters after a few minutes of film, perhaps because the author of the script could not know how he could open the film at the lowest time required for filming. The bride is the only character with a sense of humanity, and apart from the fact that she is faithful, she hardly seems to be a completely villain. Most of the films are Lee actually expelling villain for a while ... or maybe it's another way around. I can't say for sure ... and certainly I didn't have to look again to make sure. The side effects are not very frightening ... but it's close. The head coming from the popular idea of ​​using the time machine to go and kill Hitler. Somehow, the film looks at this interesting idea as well. The plan is very difficult for its own benefit. Planning is poor. I can't imagine something positive to say about this film ... I can't totally. It's just formulaic and useless. If I only had a temporary machine, so I could come back and prevent this film from thinking ... no, never look at it. I hope only if a small sense of greed seems to be possible for this. Listen to negative consultants. Avoid this turkey. I recommend this to Lee's fans, and no one else. If you are looking for the best film ... well, this is not the case. That's for sure. 1/10
