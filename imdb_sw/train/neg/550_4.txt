After a good AANKHEN (2002) which was a remake of the Gujarati game comes with WAQT which also looks like play for action stage. <br /> In the events of the events, we have characters shouting, confusion here too <br /> <br /> The first half shows Amitabh next to beat 40+ Akshay Kumar who makes a very funny like nerd tiny <br /> <br> Film has a good message about how you will not lose your child but sadly Amitab wants to make Akki responsible is a fake quite a lie! <br /> <br /> Some of the feelings touch you but most are over the top of <br /> <br /> The Rajpal Comedy is hilarious but also stretched in the second half <br /> Instructions and Vipul Shah are overdone much though some The scenes are the same music among actors Amitabh puts it in the first half but it is good at the emotional events Akshay Kumar also does his part well but it seems to be good in some of use chemistry chemistry Chemistry and Bachchan is not available Rajpal is a matter of his acceptance, he makes you laugh with his presence only with his dumb and humorous personality and he is a Boman champion is good in other comic parts but it's so great in Priyanka's place is a heroine so there is nothing to do, this is his film The last with Akki so far Shefali is amazing though he looks very small to Bachchan
