Americans are cautious to jump to fruit and if something is not done within normal business time, we would like to lose interest quickly. I have seen an exciting fact from this film: someone should draw the tall trees of high tension and make a schedule! And I think what, they would like to do something else (the observer has the same emotions). I don't usually watch that TV at night, so I can't recommend this film, unless watching a white color is your idea of ​​two exciting hours outside your life.
