Ladies and Gentlemen, please do not be offended by "film film Stanley Kubrick". This is a very bad film which unfortunately has been pronounced as one of the most horrible films that have been made. it is true but what we find instead is the ignorance, ignorance that makes the fear of terror. Everyone knows how good a trial is like it is different from the truth. All that is good in the film is the view of the valley of ic. The hotel where most of the participants were found also beautiful. In a word about the participants Jack Nicholson looks like a lost soul, a whisper that is not quite known what he should do. child actor.There is a need to blame the bad weather conditions for the tragedy. You can not be avoided if the film is made by poor Kubrick is not alive to make any changes.
