This so-called "document" tries to tell that the US has made a new landing. Right year. All who have learned the truth actually know the difference. <br /> <br /> First and foremost: there is definitely evidence. During the astronaut they were on the moon, they returned a piece of MANU of rock from the moon - to geological studies. These are spread throughout the world for hundreds of laboratories, who have tried. And they all said that they came from the planet, not the world: because the local anthropometric elements are different from those found in the world, but they are similar to those who are counted on the moon. I.E. The scholars of the conspiracy never know anything: they take something that is relevant to their theory and ignores others. Another wrong view from them is that they were wind in the hangar where they hit the new land, IE stage flag. There is a logical explanation: the astronaut led by his hand, so it moved. And what proves this: well, if the artists have even read the picture, they will see that the flag is not available after the astronaut allow it, I.E. Theorists of conspiracy are bad scientists, they learn a lesson well, or learn only until they arrive, so that they can lie from it, and make profits (IE called "document"). Claims say that it is impossible to be done in the moon because all shades come from different places, because there are different light sources, fake lights from the studio. Sometimes the artists are wrong (as usual), the same will be held in the desert of the night night, without sources of light. But I am sure that any scholars of any program have ever been out of their grandmothers for more than a few days to meet Star Treck. "Theorists of conspiracy are in denial, BIG TIME. They only see what they want to see. So they do all this to be important - that's true.
