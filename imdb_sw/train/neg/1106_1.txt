Don't waste your time on this dreck. As shown, the characters do not have the liberation values ​​and look at those who are interconnected are tortured. "Gothic" was the least entertaining, this is to decorate. If you would like to watch honest and destructive poetry, this may be similar to your journey. Lord Byron is shown as a perfect jerk, and why some would choose to spend more than five minutes with him too. Mary Shelly seems to be the only character and any spine, but even she comes out of any problem without an ounce of honor. It is a waste of time. Look at the Gothic instead. I also remember seeing another excellent movie based on the same issue, but did not get the head. I had this hope, but no luck. Not recommended.
