I will admit that I don't expect much from Roger Corman film. In general, I expect many scriptures to walk with evil. However, in this case, I am very happy. Gunslinger is a woman's story (played by Beverly Garland) who is considered as a sheriff after her husband was brutally murdered. Mrs. Garland is a very good shot, killing one of the murders the next day at the funeral of her husband. His first task is to install the internal bar that breaks during the city. The owner of the bar tries to buy land in anticipation of purchased by the railway (expected). However, Mrs. Garland is sandy in her plans, and the mountain bar employs someone to kill Mrs Garland. Because Mrs. Garland is responsible for her honesty and in fact, there is no attempt to go to Suzanne Somers "She is a sheriff" joke. Except for faux pas (the door of the apartment that opens OUT from the inside, the jeep songs, and the two horsemen waiting on the screen to run them around the corner), the movie takes quite a static film. However, Corman could not forbid his film and horse events, as he goes on to another film. Sterno says Gunslinger is an opera horse suitable for your time.
