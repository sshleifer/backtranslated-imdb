What are you doing? Does the show show someone who opens cans and envelopes for food? What? Should you have the talent to do that? He can cook but not shown in half an hour of stomach churning production of pot. I know she has the power of Martha-Stewart-esquire. Similarly Warren Buffett but I don't see him with fake opens of cereals and Alpo. <br /> <br /> Having a nephew named ... Brycer. Brycer? Stop talking about anyone whose name is stupid. <br /> <br /> More time is spent on a "column-table" than a real cook. Who has that time? Silicon should be on your spatula, not on my TV. This version should be on Cartoon Network, NOT Network Food.
