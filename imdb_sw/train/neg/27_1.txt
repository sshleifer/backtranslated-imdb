Movie terrible. Nuff Said. These lines are only known. Movie was bad. Why am I expanding on that I don't know. This is already a waste of my time. I wanted to warn others. Avoid this movie. Acting takes and writing is just values. Bad for every way. The only good thing about the movie is the breast of Deniz Akkaya. Even though it had been destroyed though in a terrifying and cruel place. The film is a piece of waste caused by the worst. Now I am going to the tape on the IMD for this stupid underline text. Then the feeling had to warn others I create an account with IMDb just to discover that I have to write a friggen version on the film just to explain how bad I think it is. Not suitable.
