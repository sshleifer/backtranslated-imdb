Making a film comparable to the prequels and the "real" Star Wars trilogy could rent even the most famous movie producer .... Mr Lucas is not a lover of film. <br /> <br /> Show the fall of the Good Man in the dark needs a good actor ... Mr Christensen is not an actor. The first 60-80 hours are the most frightening and only a few pockets of saber wars but there is still a lack of edge because you already know where the characters live on the Star Wars earlier. <br /> <br /> Numbers Dooku (Christopher Lee) has the most urgent responsibility here and about the best idea is to have Jar Jar Binks silent! It is not just a film that uses the Chancellor to turn Jedi and has the most overview on the server
