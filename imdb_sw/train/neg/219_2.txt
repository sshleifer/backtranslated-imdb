It might be a good film if it would see something attraction rather than a relationship of lesbians if this is the meaning of the movie ... it is totally unthinkable to say that two girls are similar to the Russian TATU group. ..sababali? I don't think so. There is nothing original in this film to support so it had to use something that is already known. You know the recipe. Other actors ... well, I don't know what their role should be. Most of them are well-known people in Romania and I must tell some of them are not actors (egMihaela Radulescu) .O so you can summarize: "fake girl tatty" + despair / broadcast requiring "executives" + who do not arrange a conspiracy + chance to use bad language in order to be charged = Lovely sick .... very bad ... The idea was good, though ... and I am working very hard to express the head ...
