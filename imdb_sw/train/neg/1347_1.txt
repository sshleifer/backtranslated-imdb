The Gadget's Auditor may have been my cartoon of 80 at all favorite time. I enjoyed the first and second season of the season with the Christmas Christmas Christmas "Observer Inspector saves Christmas". Some of the Gadget fans criticize the second season (1985) of the festival, but they need to compare to the 2002 DiC's release of the "Auditor's Final Audit: Revenge Revenge" at that time, they will get the second season to be the full gold . <br /> <br /> Become a fan of the gadget, I couldn't resist the opportunity to see the gadget of animated inspection in something that was not related to Gadget Boy. I bought the film, and I vowed myself that I would like to have a goal; I knew that sometimes artistic freedom would be removed from the original series. I've never been ready for what I was looking for. <br /> <br /> There was a very difficult show of the original show. Here is a short list of some losses for this film: * Humor is not available from the original series. Penny and Brain (originally the same part in the series as a Gadget) does not exist from fifteen to twenty minutes. * The original music with Saban & Levy does not exist, and the existing logo is small. (Understanding that Saban has its production company now, but at least "The Visitor of the Inspector saves Christmas" had a good music, even without Saban.) * Do not expect to see any of the gadget gadgets which made the show so endearing, like gadget -copter, gadget -brella, gadget-mallet, coat-coat (which was actually used but not even one thing), as well as its usual hats and hand gadgets. In this film, his feet of the gadget was telescopic instead of fountain. This kind of stuff influences the true fans of the show, and not just to change. <br /> <br /> * Gadgetmobile from the original series is now talking-fast, called "hip" convertible. All fans from the original series enjoyed gadgetmobile turning into the gadget car and vice versa. <br /> <br /> * Great Quimby is now very swift and even meant for Gadget. He was happy all the time in the previous series, but this pushes the situation a bit. Penny does not have a computer book. <br /> <br /> Is there good on this film? Okay, here goes ... <br /> <br /> * Maurice LaMarche works fine to take over Don Adams as big as the Inspection Gadget. <br /> <br /> * In one place, Chief Quimby says to a true woman from a series of cartoon: The Great Macro (classic "Gadget" villain from the second season, talked to Louis Nye). <br /> <br /> Looking for more things to redeem for this movie? Well, you're out of luck. Life is about making choices and living with that choice. Many situations in life have a focus even if they are teaching a lesson. The lesson learned here: continue the original formula! "If it does not break, do not destroy it." True Gadget fans should be clear from this film; you will certainly be expected. <br /> <br /> Hope, DiC and Piga! The factory will continue to be given more than the previous series after the release of 2006 for "Visitor Inspector: First Series, Figure 1," has the first 22 notes of the series. As a fan of a true Gadget, a lover of 80 animations and many DiC programs, I urge the viewer to buy "Gadget's Auditor: First Series, Volume 1" and "Gadget of the Rescue Saves the Christmas" of the DVD's best and reliable to restore good memories.
