If Bob Ludlum saw this mini series, he could cry. This was full of time and money. I have read the book and even though the movie is not exactly the book can, CBS lost time and money on this and it is a shame to claim that this was Ludlum's work. It might be a creator must look at Bourne Identity and Richard Chamberlain and see how the television series was good. The worst Mira, Blair, Anjelica and Colm, why did they sign to bow down? It's awesome!
