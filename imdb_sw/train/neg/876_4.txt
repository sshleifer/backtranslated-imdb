Up to the last 20 minutes, I was thinking that this is probably the worst movie of Jackie Chan (except its original 1978 work, which I don't know). The anti-ultimate system changed all: it's long and beautiful and bright - in fact, one of the most important aspects of the work of Chan. But to get there, you should sit through a lot of "comedy" that can provoke five-year-old children (oh, see someone hit the tomato on the face of that person) and the endless "soccer" events. Don't mention (which includes a line "How can I unlock it? It's not a tap" - see to get what it says). "Dragon Dragon" is worth the lease to fight the last alone, but the rest of the movie is just for Jackie collectors, and even just for those who have already seen at least 15 of his other movies.
