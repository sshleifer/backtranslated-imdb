I am a fan of both Shakespeare and MST3K, so I waited to see this section. I will comment on the first film, then part of MST3K. The recipe of this film: take talented actors, rich and well-equipped Shakespeare, and a budget of $ 1.25. Mix well, then run the whole life and movement, even the infinite scope. Serve cold in a large stone, clear stone. Modern, I offer 3 out of 10, because practitioners at least deserve a bit of credit. Okay, now part of MST3K. I will admit you, the first time I saw it, I slept half. I understand that it was the answer to several other packages as well. However, when I watched it a second time, I realized that there were a lot of mental memories and good lines I had missed for the first time. The trick and this part are: listen carefully! It takes several comments to capture each row. Give a second chance, and you'll see what I'm saying. MST3K: 7 1/2 out of 10.
