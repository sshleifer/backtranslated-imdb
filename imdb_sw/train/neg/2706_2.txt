Yes, people are racist. People are even racist at the university. That is a good step, and the issue of apartheid has been dealt with many times before many films. What puts Higher Education apart from the packet is that it deals with the issue of racism in a ham-fisted and predictable way, oh that's also at university. This film deals with this problem of apartheid through Frankenstein facing many problems, puts you on a regular headache in a cruel and sluggish manner. Most of the characters are cartoonish, single-dimensional, caricatures (female sexually, angry person black), who respond to the situation as fast and predictably possible. Instead of disrespecting this film exhibition has increased more. Angry black men feel deceptive, women hate men, etc. (one woman even has a sign that reads "Dead Men Do Not Cope." they will probably go exactly as you expect. The characters change may seem obvious to everyone but people in the film. Large-scale degradation in the fingers of a conspiracy is a non-Nazis violence will act like Neo-Nazi. I will think I need to just look at what is happening. Another problem I have with this movie is that it should be a "bounty" and "hitting hard," but doing Nazi bad people. I agree that Nazi is wrong, but that's what I mean. Everyone thinks Nazi is bad; we do not break any new land here. The Nazi has been shown as criminals since the 1930s. The film does not challenge any views or make a statement of courage. It only deals with the issues that we all know about in inclusion, after school-specific as, manner. To fight rape, fighting racism, and the fight against the Nazis do not take a strong stand on the issue of controversy. <br /> <br /> Top Training is predictable, of cartoonish, and with a stupid word. Avoid at all costs.
