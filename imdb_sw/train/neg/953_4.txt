"Happy Going To Love" has only two things that go. And these two are the feet of Vera-Ellen. This is the UK version (Excelsior Films) of M-G-M music full with second stars. I would like to think that Vera-Ellen took this opportunity to think that it might eventually lead him to a great star of music. But, I'm sorry to say, Mrs Ellen's position did not pay. Open to Scotland's horrible number and bad chat talks on the next tune, this movie seems to be very heavy sloppy. The negative identification method is very narrow, and except David Niven, Cesar Romero (who is the highest way of his position of Producer) and Bobby Howes (who has completely lost in any role). The cast is completely forgotten. <br /> <br /> Choreography is boring, but Mrs. Ellen gives it all. He was not as popular as other music stars (and should not be since he could not sing and even had a "playing player" in his several pictures. "But when he played the dance, it was just an intervention." This film that could make a star did not give him the tools he needed to shine.
