As great as the prairie of Texas and the same as boring. Even Liz Taylor, James Dean, Chill Wills, and Dennis Hopper can't float this sown boat. Taylor really looks at the bad, bad, and bad evil wardrobe - the unique efficiency in his wonderful work. The hopper offers only a reliable performance, and Dean in the climate area reflects extraordinary talent as something we didn't remember for - comic actress. The Hudson Rock is his typical example of Barbie Doll Ken and makes one wonder why, say, Redford could do with male leadership. There is no known conspiracy that provides any tension until the last twenty minutes, just a pastiche of the important steps that have little connection with each other. Except for the hopper, there is no character development, only a collection of paper pieces that come regularly for reasons that cannot be lost as random targets in the gallery of the shot. With his credit, the film faces gender discrimination and sexuality when they were fingerprints, and it has SIZE, and doing so to be the best choice for withdrawal of unsuitable home guests. Those with a DVD version can save some tedium by starting with a second disk. You can't miss anything of interest.
