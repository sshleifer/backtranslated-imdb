I must admit that I've been sucker for Samurai flicks since I can remember. I was looking rather than choosing, being "professional" works as Seven Samurai or different comic-book as blood Lone Wolf and Cub. I also loved US- / Japanese "Crossovers" as Bushido Blade. And of course everything with Sonny Chiba and Hiroyuki Sanada. And I've watched every samurai at least twice. But it's not Kabuto. In 1993 I watched Kabuto in the video, even the movie samurai could be bad. At first I expected Mayeda to reach Europe and the fight that would come from it but in time he reached Spain, I was not very worried about the movie again. will not make the right to film it "bad". Technically it is a fresh entry into the genre. But there is never never enough calm. Sho Kosugi has limited skills as director and all the performers and has only part of the top Japanese charisma characters. And speaking to Sho Kosugis son Kane, who looks next to all the fil films of Sho Kosugi like Shos son: he inherited a little knowledge of his father. The addition of low points is the lack of blood and that until that time it was a trademark of all Samurai film. This was clearly aimed at a limited audience of US- / Europe. Let's just say it is a film for a historic-action-adventure fan but it bears for the hardest fans of Samurai movies. Fans who are in "Samurai meets?" - genre, should go to look at Red Sun (1971), with Charles Bronson as a cowboy who has a team with Samurai Toshiro Men's in order to get a Samurai design from Bad guy guy guy. It's very good how to do it right and where Kabuto is not recommended. Therefore, although the film is only 100 minutes, it looks like a long film. The reason I gave this honorable points 4/10 instead of 3/10: The first time I saw this film, I saw it in the usual German edition. In this version, Kosugi can actually be understood. I must admit that its 'Engrish' is sometimes to play but it gets tiresome after 30 minutes.
