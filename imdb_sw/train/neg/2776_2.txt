The King's King is a film about a series of real events (required) that occurred during the Portuguese Work in Indochina. Though the clothing and art instructions are proposed, the film is not yet suitable to impress. Acting, in particular, was very poor. Some actors are trying hard to allow tears and speed, both real and fake, convincing them. The story of the story was also dumb and the fool was also true and it seemed like a subject of history. The film could not even capture the old and old air and it was seen as an attempt to make the Asian version of Elizabeth. <br /> <br /> Last say? Dress and direction of art gives the film a breath of fresh air, but the implementation was very poor and the participants could not even give the natural bursts of emotions. In short, the movie seemed more like hullabaloo than script.
