Occasionally I leave the movie without seeing the whole show. This is especially true when I have built it on DVD. Syriana was one that I left. Half of the way through I opened it with a dirty dirt. This movie is included, awesome, confusing and missing. Acting was dry and unreliable. The general plan was good but it was developed in a simple and humble manner that failed to understand my thoughts or interests. Many plots are often unable to connect and appear as more like random stories than a real concrete plot. The worst lesson a big lesson with these great actors can create such flop. I can't think that this film receives any selection under the prize.
