It may be a fascinating view of the life of one of the most serial American killers, but unfortunately it has not come close. Bad editing, direction, acting bad, you call it. This movie is about 10 minutes of plot laid out in 100. The only technique of redemption is Bruce Davidson as a father, but that's not nearly enough to save this stinker. 1 out of 10.
