This is a very bad movie. But it's not as bad as that attribute shows. Production ethics are not so bad and there is an unusual area. And it has cheezoid veneer of 80 which means that it's always kind of fun. See also, for a short time for Jimmy nail - his attempt to emphasize America is so wonderful garbage is amazing. Good is also the breast of Sybil Danning - a short time in the movie but the area is repeated ten times in the last features in what can only be described as "12 of the boobs of Sybil Danning." It seems reliable. As a horrible movie is not terrible, the effects are quiet and Christopher Lee returns to sleep through his performance. I think he had to buy a new home and he needed money for deposits. Two intermediaries - man and woman - were The very poor that I forgot almost everything about them and I just watch this movie earlier tonight.The Werewolves are noticeably less interesting than in the original movie, in fact, to bizarre, sometimes it looks more like bad punching apes. The European arrangement is very good and the music released by the new wave of Babel, when it is very good, makes at least one film of cheese. It is generally good to laugh. do you? sly anticipate that? And, at least, you have always received visitors to Sybil.
