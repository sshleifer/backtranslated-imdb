I had the “opportunity” to attend a special 'Missing Light' investigation in the Ohio fear agreement. First, you know you are suffering when the director establishes the film, saying: "Now remember, we didn't have a lot of money ..." Not that the non-budget film is bad, but when the film manufacturer uses this for excuse, the result is always. And there is no better example than this unknown fest of sleep. True, 'Lack of Light' is the first sign in the world of the underground movie: It's the only time I got a lot of fantastic dreams that really have. Kashmasi artists like David Hess, Tony Todd and Reggie Banister enter and leave the film and prove that everything is not as interesting as non-amateur names. They are their characters? What do they say? Who cares? It's all lighter, you will stop keeping anything or anyone. After thirty minutes of this test of patience, I left and walked out of the reminder. Not surprisingly, so many of the members used were attending. <br /> <br /> Any sex fan should stop off with this. Luckily, this film will never see "light" of the day.
