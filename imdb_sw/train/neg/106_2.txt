1 looked on 8/3/2003 - 2 out of 10 (Dir-Brad Sykes): A non-minded 3-D movie about zombies-eating meat in 3 stories inside the film memory. And yes, we get to see zombies eating parts of the human body in 3D! Wow, not !! It has been done regularly with 2D in a movie of a zombie but what usually makes a movie of the best zombie is a basic story not real meat-eating. That's what the original zombie scholars did. Eat beef only paid as a bonus. We are really bored in the greater part of this magazine of 3 parts because of the blind (the twilight area as well as) easily understood and slow-pacingly clear finale's. The last story is really a legendary movie began with (being an author of the observation of the so-called city of spirit) and of course we get to see the meat of a zombie eating in it too. Well, I think I've said enough. See the gift, not this 3D feast.
