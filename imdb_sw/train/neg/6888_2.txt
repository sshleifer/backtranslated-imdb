This film is poorly pregnant, poorly acted, and badly written. <br /> <br /> Jon Heder is very annoying, and can not avoid the same Napolean Dynamite size. Self-obsessed with ignorance. <br /> <br /> In addition, Diane Keaton has the same Manish, overly obsessed mother, who cares so much and still almost enough about her children's life (see why I said so). Even Faris, although I generally like her, has an idiot vapid in this film too. <br /> <br /> Jeff Daniels is accepted but nothing special. <br /> <br /> Please, skip this film if you want to keep your soul.
