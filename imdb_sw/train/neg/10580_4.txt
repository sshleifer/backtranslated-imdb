I saw this week ago after raising the cheap DVD. I had a desire to see it for many years, looking for a lesson of conspiracy. So my trouble was good, say the least. I thought the leading actor was very flat. This type of part required performance such as Johny Depp in the Eight Store (which is almost terminating), but I think the TV budget has not declined for this type of ability. I also thought the direction was confused and evil, it just serves to remind me that the creator has not made a good movie from the mouth of Madness. For the story - well, I had been disappointed there too! There is no way to achieve my expectations I think, but I thought that profits and profiles were inferior, and how he got an anti-climactic film at least. This is written by one of the main contributors to AICN, and you can tell him he likes his movies, but I would like the best results from a good background. I used the DVD on the shop the same day!
