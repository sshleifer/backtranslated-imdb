Lou's Gospel was a great passion for me. I received E-Mail from the theater showing that it was a great and interesting movie. It was neither large nor powerful. The movie was good iffy with the whole movie. Most of the events were the feet of the fire that was made in such a way that they could not always tell him what they had. Sounds often came out for no reason. Also many people in the film were very deleted. His relationship with his old son has not been made clear. Also the whole movie has its own way, and then BAM suddenly, heals and encourages people. The whole movie shows that boxing is one of the things that are bad in his life, and making him live his life in a way that he lives, but when he changes, he stops boxing, teaches others how to box. Thumbs Down.
