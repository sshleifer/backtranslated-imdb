If you want to see the mind, the filojia discussion of human potential and potential, see "Waking Life," which is brilliant. "What # We know" is everywhere in his perspective, not properly directed, not well written, not working, without any art and anger leadership. It did not stimulate thought or entertainment for a little. Inserting the freak of the race "Ramtha" in this film is enough reason to avoid. Is it not amazing how the filmmakers choose to look at the fact that this woman worships the 2,000-year-old Atlantic god or something? What is the old ass, and what is the time of my time and money this movie was. People involved with this film should not be allowed to do another film again.
