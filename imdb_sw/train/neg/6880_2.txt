I was glad to hear that someone had made a document on what was like Puerto Rican. When I heard it was Rosie Perez, I was surprised. It would know what exactly was to be Puerto Rican. As far as I knew .... was Nuyorican. Well so, I was worried to stay with my popcorn to look at. I found 10 minutes in it that my initial concern was right. Rosie Perez has little knowledge about what it is like to be Puerto Rico. This "document" is more than a first hand, a very personal account on what should be Nuyorican ... and all that apply to it. He (like most of the people of Nuyorisi I know) have less water, part and sometimes lose history. (They can't ... they live here.) Yes, they are all proud. If they should be! But much does not know the ins and out of true culture, history and political history or language in many places. It all became very clear with his participation in the issue of Vieques. Regardless of my personal being is on this issue. At least I know what hell is to fight for. There he was arrested for something that he knew a little about. For those who are not Puerto Rican, please check this as an account of a woman's journey of discovery and acceptance. Do not take this as a gospel ... a lot of it is not true even. Please check the source. Rosie is an actor; not a historian. This movie should not be, for other people of Nuyori, based on their information. Instead, the only step towards getting more information, learning and discussing what is the truth. Not only from the eyes of this woman.
