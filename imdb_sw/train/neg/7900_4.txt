Head creatures are attacked in a small desert town. That is the whole plot of this film, and when the volunteer events for Munchies itself are fun (through the way down), the rest are just filling, and filling the worst for it. From the "hero", who is Woody Allen wannabe with pain, for the ultra-bubble village striker, it is difficult to take the worst behavior in the film. There were times when almost all were on the screen as well as I thought, "Well, at least the girl is beautiful, but why should we focus on that break?". Movies are also filled with pop records (from Ozzy Osbourne to Linda Blair), which have already been prepared by the 90s. (* 1/2)
