This film is a perfect example of how not to make a sci film. The worst character in sci-fi is to make your theme worse, sophomoric, pseudo-Orwellian / Huxleyan / whateverian "vision" of "human future." <br /> <br /> False scientists (and authors), like geeks, take themselves seriously due to the high proportion of the good things of their kind. I think that other types of high CTGSR (yes, I have done, relax), as fear or action or even a romantic partner, seem to have less knowledge of the fact that they do not change the world and "messages." > Indeed Sci fi can succeed in a large scale, as many popular filmmakers have been revealed. But there is a big problem of the whole concept, which is represented by "Robot Jox," and its construction of the under "future" tax (the only good feature of the design: amazing banner advertising everywhere to encourage women to have many children) and his analogy of the heavy "Iliad" (He is NAMED ACHILLES FOR GOD'S EDUCATION! I certainly did not take this thing until I got the film as at ten, but I went to the public school, so the artists were not judged. /> <br /> Of course, if you are a shadow of a movie like me, this obstacle has great excitement. I totally love movies like this, because bad movies are often more often fun and sometimes even more interesting than beautiful. It's a kind of way to Lester Bangs to watch the film, I think. Remember: Guide to this film (Gary Graham? Is it his name? I refuse to go to look) not really bad. He makes his journey. He is a kind of cool, especially when he was beaten / beaten.
