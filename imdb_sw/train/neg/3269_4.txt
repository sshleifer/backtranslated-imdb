Except for acting Meryl Streep, which is typical as always, I would like to avoid this film because it has the quality of "Modern Wiki" about it. But it is worth watching if you hold several ideas in mind: How couples continue to explore the media, and how the differences are recognized. <br /> <br /> In this movie the issue is a distinction of distinction. Australians are different from "we" (more than the whole world), so we (most of us) come directly to the "unconscious" air on them. Couples involved are religious (as opposed to most of the culture) and Adventists (differently). So their lives and their ideas are suspected to start. Dingos are different animals than other dogs, so we are also faced with questions of absence. True story, then, is how society (and the world) makes a difference, those who have enough differences, different beliefs, than we and how we hear what they say as a suspect. It is hard to hear the words "Dingo took my baby!" without laughing and there is confusion, sadly, on the web all over it. But in subsequent years the movie and movie has been discovered (as you will find in the web search) more children have been hit by dingos. The research and experts of dingos have shown that it was not only possible but it is very likely that the child was taken by dingos (perhaps a pair), given expertise from clothes and eaten within time without tracking. However, what remains is the question of why people defended dingos when they were found to be threatening children instead of killing dingoes to save children, why because the woman affects (expression) is too cold thinks to be guilty, and continue on. <br /> <br /> Ask questions, without or without a film.
