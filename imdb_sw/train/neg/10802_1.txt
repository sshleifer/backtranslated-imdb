Let me give a quick summary of the film: Kido decaying, the gray called Max reminds you of the radio that has Kazaam: the rapping genie. Like all ears, he offers 3 but, as a good nature, also helps Max and his personal life, as he has to deal with the victims and the mixed man in the organized crime. All this time, Kazaam beat regularly, (also shows shaq's shaq rap skills). <br /> <br /> This movie proves what we all know: Athletes need to be connected to games. I agree that it has never been seen as an Oscar movie, but all about this film's scary is awesome. The characters may not be visible or ignorant, the plot is not appropriate to mention, the conversation is joke, and Shaq is only a quarter of the problem. Hell, even if Denzel Washington played Kazaam this film will still be a joke. I know that only movies has taken ANYBODY was because Shaq was too big (no pun was planned) at that time. I honestly can't think of something positive to say about losing this time. Shaq should keep the time spent doing this film for free practice.
