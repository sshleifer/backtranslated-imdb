I found "Fire" was on the cable the other night and I began to look at it because I couldn't remember anything else about it instead of remembering that it was a terrible film when I saw it again in '85. Twenty years later the film is still bad. In addition to the synthesizer, saxophone was the most used tool in pop music during the 1980s, as shown in the title of the head. Hearing that song again made me want to raise the gun in my ears to end the sonic trouble from it. And interesting attack on the music Roblowe played a saxophone play, and there was one place where he played solo that went on and if he was Charlie Parker, just his amazing voice and play were remembered more than monkey playing kazoo. All the actors were very interested, although I must say they did a good job of giving us inexperienced workers. In fact I thought Mare Winham was fascinated, and I began to feel sorry for her behavior because she was wearing hate clothes, but then near the end of the movie she decided to have sex with Rob Lowe's character who could vote more likely to transfer a variety of diseases. Sex if such a thing was chosen.
