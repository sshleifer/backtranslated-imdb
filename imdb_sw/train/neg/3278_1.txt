I tell you many people have said that some of us need to find and times to create a new movie "Dukes" is a modern version. OH PLEASE. If this is what you think modern then Hollywood can put it. Most people on the MSN website have also said that (and I quote) "You old fogies need to get more and more like it." Well, I tell you something, I'm 24 years old so I am a long way to have OLD FOGIE, and I can't get on it, it was DISGRACE FOR ALL THAT HAZZARD COUNTY. The only thing in the film's head was "HAZZARD." What? All of the dirt, cigarettes, and drink was very important. Sent was bad. Jessica has been showing several showers of the morning to discuss the movie and I really believe that all has gone to her head. She has no way to Duke Daisy, maybe goes, but no Duke. I love Sean Williams Scott, but not like Bo. They should be combined with the original cast as they entered, but even Hollywood knew they would not accept the script. I mean coming people even today's actors and supervisors show bad ideas and why some of you offer good words.
