I saw this trailer and I saw that my god is really this movie, who would like to see this film and at the same time I thought that, my girlfriend girl turned to me and said "we should go see this film". ..because he said so I saw this 5 minutes to go and I tried to keep the face of the brave and enjoy the cheap scares but none of them. It should be one of the worst movies I have ever seen the director does not influence any view of the same shots used again and again did not create a suspense of cast probably were just told to scream run run. I would like to see the script as the first 40 hours were very interesting and bad music, there was any development of character. The plot is just ... well there was no plot was basically I know we will be interested in a high school group at night and a powerful salute, that's a brilliant! hmmm Acting is what you expect in Australia's soap opera soap, the main character of Blondie god pond she annoyed me. The longest line must be half of the sentence, and each time she was on the camera was just drawing the expression to another face. Please listen if you have any taste on the movies and don't go this, and if you like me and you don't have a good choice then I would wish you good luck, maybe you go secretly in ipod or newspaper. It does not believe that this film has been made!
