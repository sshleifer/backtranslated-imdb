Reliable, unfavorable, unfamiliar, and flashy pictures and slow motion where needed less: Adrenaline is everything that shouldn't be a film. Georgina Verbaan (a-and-so soap-off actor who has not attended her English classes) has a wealthy girl Freya, who has a 'seeking-out' attitude. Which on the basis makes dangerous stunts, breaking things and distracting people. And it's not a fun way to Jackass. Then there is Dracko (Rivas). He leads the group but has other illegal activities on the side. Then there is the father of Freya (Lockyer), who also has an amazing role as well. And, finally, we got Jason (Fyall's first), a lover of Freya. One day, Freya gets disappeared and everyone seems to be involved but we, the viewer doesn't care if nobody is thrown can be interesting or reliable, and the story doesn't mean anything. <br /> <br /> Why was this done? 2/10.
