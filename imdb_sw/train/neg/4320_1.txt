First of all, I would like to say that this is not a movie for people who expect to look at something full and fun for a holiday. This film is cool, brutal, and very sad. Mary Steenburgen has a mother-in-law who is under Christmas because her husband has lost her job, they lose their home, they can't buy Christmas gifts for children, etc.. You get the idea, things fun for the holiday. So comes Harry Dean Stanton like Gideon's Christmas angel, who in his dark hat and long dress comes more like a pedophile child who relies on children every day watching them. The best way to establish a Christmas spirit in Mary Steenburgen than to kill her family and then give them to come if she believes Christmas again. Santa Claus is black and its Christmas workshop looks more like a refugee shelter for the lighting. The movie puts everything on a very thick that cares about the happy end when it comes because all the movie is harsh and unknown. I am sure that this film wanted to be something of Capra, but it has made fun and feeling about what the holiday film should be.
