If you want to see a karate gynecologist who lost the batch of a try of the Mexican wannabe group for regular hr, then this is the film for you. if not selecting another DVD from bin 20c which is the only part of this film. Acting was so horrible that I had to force it to the end. The lid makes it seem cool, but it is something cheaper, b grade bandster along 2 g lines and hub, streetz blood and danger. I can't buy or rent this film unless you hit stones to get stones and plot, edit and act it doesn't mean to you. it's really the worst film in the history of humanity !!!
