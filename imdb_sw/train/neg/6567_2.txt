I entered this film with the best hope. I love the music of the war in general. Dick Powell and Lucille Ball did their best with their duties; however, the authors gave them a boring conversation. The interest of the two of them was not given any growth; Suddenly it was there. I didn't think a lot of music; The best number was snippet we heard about Spike Jones and "the face of Der Fuhrer." The full number that Spike Jones did had a little bit of his music comedy; tame good things, even a monkey. Bert Lahr comedy attractions were not interrupted. There was a place to enjoy: Lucille Ball was an observer, and there was a good selection of small players who deserved more time on screen.
