My brother is a redeemer of DVD. He took one look of the lid (two models on toilets) and had to add to his collection. I stayed with him to look at what seemed to be a more inclusive film (I use the word freely) I've heard it must stay. I am not afraid to speak to my brother's eye, he must certainly be accusing the receipt in his locked fist. The biggest name in the whole movie is Michael Clark Duncan who appears in the same area, which "the film manufacturer" decided to show every take (almost four-fourth) in the movie. In fact, the whole film is following this suit. The fact that the DVD with deleted images was a shock. (I went to sleep without looking, however). Surprisingly, I found this disc without his case behind the TV almost a week later.
