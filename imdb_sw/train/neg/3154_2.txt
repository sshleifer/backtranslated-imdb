Look, there's nothing wrong with this film, it's just boring. It is usually the rom-com and the end that you see coming before seeing as such a trailer. The key difference is that the classic romic deal with their stories for wit and lack of bias. This movie does not block but does not mean the movement, you feel like you can rise and walk at any time. The production of the movie also feels the first movie produced almost fifteen years ago. I would like to recommend again to watch the classic movie as When Harry Met Sally instead of imitating this detailed. O, another problem of BIG ... no chemistry. If you've seen Michael looking at everyone as good as Vaughn in Alias, you will be very disappointed with the way they have looked at him here.
