Although there are many known "television" titles associated with "Person called Sledge", there is nothing amazing about the film itself or on any exhibition. In fact, the only thing that has benefited you from the 1960s and 70 television series as the "Patrol Rat" is the biggest cast and more violence. James Garner is a great star and seems to have to try to stop all the interesting things that he had done ("Maverick", "Help Your Local Sheriff" - "Gunfighter" etc.). Unfortunately his soil heritage works against him, as a sledge is a disgusting character recorded in the fame of the western character of the Clint Eastwood spaghetti. But Eastwood things are not so flat and irrelevant. I think that "A Man named Sledge" can be counted as a western spark even though walking is very slow to fit that small. Fans of the series "Fight" of the TV will feel as fast as Vic Morrow's leading film and writing script by Frank Kowalski. Throw some slow-trends shots and reduce-cross, which mentions their own attention instead of serving the story to explain the goal. The plan is a great "big head" (enter "Warfare War" here) and Sledge planning how to improve the $ 300,000 gold shipping. His group is Claude Akins and Dennis Weaver. The problem is that during the transfer transport is protected by 40 strikers and when it is blocked in prison in the district jail. I think there was a part of "Alias ​​Smith and Jones" with the plot. The story could make a good television clock but it grows very fast as a feature of the feature of the feature. Garner does not allow any of its leakage charm in its character and the film does not produce enough enough to hold the interest of the viewer. It will eventually fall and burn shortly after the shadow when the gang enters into a good and inappropriate game card. <br /> <br /> Then again, what do I know? I am just a child.
