I can always tell him when something will be hit. I see or hear, and get a good feeling. I didn't feel good to check the preview. I was not interested in this film, and I was not surprised that it was tested here as one of the most 100 films. In fact I was sure. The first thing that gave me the head. Not that I have a problem with ebonics (I am black on the way), but for the film they could use the best title, and at this time use a head that doesn't have a bad grammar. I heard the discussion, I saw acting and all I could do was make faces. I also think that the dance of the dance drums is missing. At least "You served" was better than this in my opinion. Even the sound of the voice did not appeal to me.
