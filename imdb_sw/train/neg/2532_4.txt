Humanity has reinforced the status of Roger Corman, Sam Arkoff, Lloyd Kaufman etc. as kings of B. Because people in Crown International were so important, they were not identified for the conditions they deserve. Films like VAN can now seem like a founding piece of Drive-in esoteria, but it was a great hit when it was released (not to mention re-releases as a double feature and other Crown hits). The VAN was a perfect example of the Crown's hit strategy to capture the impression of filmmakers during the release of the film. Here, it was sex, drugs, rock 'n roll and fad "Custom Van" fad. As others have discovered, it is amazing that the song "hit" in the film means Chevy when the head car is dodge in the film itself. I had a city Selectman where I was at that time even announcing these vans that "dens of sin on wheels!" A full line of film announcement! <br /> <br /> There is a common distribution of "good" and "bad" girls, muscle heads and low hijinks (with little help with Danny DeVito). In many ways this is not very different from the old Beach Party's 60s movies, but is now selected by the use of fraud and drug abuse. It is obviously made of small budgets and small schedules, film films are fun for the perfect for compensation that gives them some compensation, for today's standards for sure, un-PC views for women. The classic touch is toaster for Bobby's pit of sin on wheels. Yes, the Grand Provider! Hey, you have gotta fire for those munchies! Fest Fest.
