I've never read Shirley Jackson's novel, which I have meant to do at a certain time. I am sure it should be stronger than this film. I remember jumping once I watched it the other day, although I can't remember the area. The specific effects are good and I watched this on DVD, but I'm sure in the playground you must be awesome eyes. After the first few effects have been done and I wait for the story to develop. <br /> <br /> I thought this movie should at least be free based on ethnic novels, so a good story should exist, but it was not. I had already looked at the beautiful character of Catherine Zeta-Jones during the movie completely because there was nothing else to look at. Lili Talor was a sandy character. I didn't like her little, something about white people. Also, the boy in this film reminded me of Dudley DoRight's cartoonish with his voice and face. I wasn't connected with the characters altogether. Quigon, hem Liam Neeson did a wonderful job trying to go through this movie and some kind of action. <br /> <br /> Half to three-quarters of the way I had died to see Friday's 13th camp or Right Queen's film! At least there is some kind of entertainment. If there is no story at least they fill it with gory or attractive women. This had nothing. <br /> <br />
