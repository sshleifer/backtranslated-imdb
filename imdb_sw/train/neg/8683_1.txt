This show did not work. That is basically what surrounds. "Natural humor" which these authors try to withdraw to avoid completely shut off the world of bushing bashing is just an unfunny. In another opinion, someone mentions a few hilarious lines. My standing was George H.W. Bush tell their children not to watch any TV instead of Fox News. Wow. I thought the events I saw were bad. The fact that this verse is a high point for this series is interesting. My problem with the soil as this sad concept of political satire is that these people get second season. I am a free republic and I know Bush was not a good president. We all do. But that is not the excuse to eliminate the full time of poopie. I place these authors at the same level as the elite after 'meeting with Spartans'. Their form, such as many jokes that have not yet been disclosed as you can and throw in the worst of the original material so that you can give yourself a written credit. <br /> <br /> Again, it's just bad. Unfunny, and makes me more and more fun that decorate if this is renewed, but it shows surprisingly and original if the Progression Process is cans after 3 solid seasons. Please do not look at this trick, unless you are one of the hippies of green blood that they think any sentence in Bush words and dumb is the comedic gold. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the sound of Bush takes. All he does is to imitate the little inspiration of Texan, and bored hard at the end of his judgment. Of course South Park acknowledges sound incorrect. If you want a political satire, check out the Daily Show / Colbert. Or look at any political drawings on the Robot Chicken, which is fun to enjoy, since the motion of the motion stop is shown properly. Check out George Bush as a Jedi bit on youtube. Unknown
