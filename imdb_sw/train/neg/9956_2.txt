I made a special effort to see this film and I am quite satisfied with the results. For the paper, the script seems to be optimistic, and the choice of executives leaves one with hope - I loved Pacino in the Woman's smell and I saw Anny Duperrey and Marthe Keller in several French films and other 70s / 80s. But I had forgotten how important discussion parts can play on the film, and in this film is completely .... trash! The photographs were interesting but unstable, defensive and compulsory conversation drew one to the lowest level. In addition to this, I am allergic to the world of racing cars and I don't care about the interest in this game. Even a good discussion in the "Story of Love" was much better than that in this film (and that says something !!). I was waiting for the best from this film and I was very disappointed that I had gone too far.
