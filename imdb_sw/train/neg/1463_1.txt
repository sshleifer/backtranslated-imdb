Imagine real Hitler, who was a member of the propaganda and speech, it would be like a hit player like Carlyle showed him in this film. No one could follow him, even an unemployed, unemployed guy in the 1920s. This is a piece of Hollywood's propaganda card itself, hidden as “true history”. I feel sorry for everyone who believes anything from this show. Carlyle and producers caught nothing wrong with this. Why was Hitler able to win many people, cut the whole of his mind if we were that sausage? Why did people follow him to death? By showing him that a sad person is making their own film impossible. This film is a mixture of the old WW2 propaganda and the MTV news about one of the most important people in the last century. Think of a film about Churchill where the director shows him just like a drunk for 90 hours.
