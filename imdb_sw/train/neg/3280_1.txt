I'm going to go and give my 10 bucks I went and bought the fourth season with the best. At least my children enjoy it and can look at it without worrying about what they see. I have a boy and he thinks the preview is ridiculous and would rather look at nature. And she thinks Jessica Simpson is a daisy of horrible actually thinks she looks more like a slut than a daisy duke. These shorts can also wear anything. And since the time of the American Pie have anything to do with Dukes SHAME on them to put a very bad line there on sex and car. That itself would have found a picture of R rating. The only thing that can happen in this is the reunion movie and nature. Let all hope. So people out there who went and saw movies would see how it would look
