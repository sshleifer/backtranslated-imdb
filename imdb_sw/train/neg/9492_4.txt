One star for "plot". One star for acting. One click for gold in American sound. Five stars of Monica Sand and Inge Maria Granzow, and their ability to take all their clothes. And ten out of ten for Emmanuelle Béart's God, two years before making 'Manon des sources'. Bare also prevents several times, but even fully wearing its presence is enough to make this film appear. Look at the place that he tells his friend about the “first time” for the girl. It is corny, but it is still much more interesting than what is preferred for "love items" with Broeke, Granzow and Patrick Bauchau. Unfortunately, movies should not be; stills for fast install is the best sign of what David Hamilton can.
