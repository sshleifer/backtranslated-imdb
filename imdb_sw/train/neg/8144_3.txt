I saw only in the Vancouver International Film Festival. Sorry to say I was so shocked. I will not remove you from administrators if there is nothing they can do with this bad script. The first cry was clich√© without worrying, about weight up without being funny. The movie would have been better to hunt the hoe went with horror campy feel. Instead he worked very hard and this led to a stimulating film. I can't recommend this film. It was very long and all very weak.
