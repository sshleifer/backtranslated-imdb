I am a movie of Batman back with a TV fan. I liked to show (new and old) and I love all movies. But this film is not as good as other people were hoping to be. In my opinon, it's a great stop. I think the problem had no game. Batman: Mask Of Phantasm And Batman More: The Return Of The Joker there was a good game. and Batman & Mr. Freeze: Sub Zero had another game too. Also, I think this movie is light for Batman. The scene that seems to be a little dark is the great battle with Bane at the end. Anyway, it's the movie of Batman's ok. But I just like to rent.
