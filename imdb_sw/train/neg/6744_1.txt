As you can all know, JIGSAW did not make its way to Blackbuster because of a member of Full Moon's own staff, Devin Hamilton. Devin is selling for all video chains. Recently gave the film, BLEED, which was selling Blackbuster at the same time as JIGSAW. He assured the buyer of Blackbuster to take any JIGSAW, and double the number of BLEED. The result is that JIGSAW looks like a float, and BLEED looks like a hit. The biggest problem with that is that BLEED is one of the worst movies ever, and as we all know, JIGSAW is, well, gold. I urge you all to continue on the BLEED page on the web and vote for the film caused by JIGSAW, and all your talents. Similarly, you should go to the JIGSAW page and vote on top (if you don't already have). We need to get JIGSAW to at least 8 or 8.5, and to get close to 2 (so put it on the list of 100 worst films of the Internet). Also, try to convince your friends and family to do the same. <br /> <br /> Hope you all do well, - Matt
