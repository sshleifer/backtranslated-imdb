This was a really bad movie. I am a big fan of the Italian Horror, Argento, Mario Bava, Fulci and yes, even our best friend here Lamberto sometimes comes out with good. I saw the first two films of "Demons" to be very entertaining - they were so bad they were good but this is just the worst that is real, very bad. It is very difficult, the story does not do anywhere and I hate the characters - the wife who beat the husband and the pain of the baby-baby in *** wife drove mad, there was a place near the story of volunteer to Ogre who was probably the best actor in the entire film. I restrained over three quarters of the way because I was so much, I was provoked! Don't bother.
