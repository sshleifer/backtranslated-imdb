Brother ... Peter Sellers was one of the most talented talented artists. But his choice of film, say, after 1964, was very bad. He was not found to know how to use his talents. He would be better to work with more Kubricks than the film world than he did. In his later films, only "Optimists of Elms Elms" and "Be There" attracted me to those I saw. <br /> <br /> That said, Boultings and retailers had made a few films before this that hard to hear that bad - I've never seen "Carlton Browne" and "heaven above!" - at least in the sense of using Good sellers. But, "There is a Girl in My Soup" is really a bad film and a bad choice on the part of Sellers for the issue of behavior. In his films from 1955-64, you can usually expect at least some losses and always unigmatic emotions in his roles. Here, you have Peter Sellers try to play the most romantic shooting. It's almost Sellers playing Niven cad without joviality. Certainly not persuaded you, try as he can, or create an interesting character. He should leave those parts for the masters of such issues as Cary Grant, and concentrate on the wonderful and comic tasks that he was known for. <br /> <br /> Hawn and Traders do not have a basic chemistry; this is not an easy, romantic romance made by William Powell and Myrna Loy. It is a fake exhibition, all the way through - I know that it is part of Danvers' character that he is a dry contractor of women, but he has not changed completely from the way in the way it convinces. Sellers has a great way to play "charm" too ... this character has no depth, and it really does not get sympathy viewer or interest. Traders may go in ways that one cannot think possible while remembering the effectiveness of its effectiveness, iconoclastic performance in "Lolita". Nothing is going to say about the plot, leadership or characters, if they actually leave little or no feelings. This is one of the most painless, improper, and unhealthy films I have ever seen. Shortage of "car" for non-credited talents. <br /> <br /> Rating: - * 1/2 / *****
