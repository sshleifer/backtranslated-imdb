See it in Filadelphia Movies and Lesbian Fest. What can I say? Due to my good judgment, I loved it, but I noticed that the work was small ... weak (especially I saw this from the young man's family). I mean, the script didn't have a stellar starting, but participants didn't make me believe the relationship. <br /> <br /> The plan is also predictable <br /> <br /> Nonethelss, I liked it. The characters are proposed, and the plot is not challenging or inappropriate. It's sweet, concerned about each other, and don't count if fifty minutes have been used. <br /> <br /> but I don't recommend.
