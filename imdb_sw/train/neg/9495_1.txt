This is a terrible film, and not one event with a real feeling. The characters are not opened, obviously, predictable and the line of the story is clear and usually Hollywood want to be completed. William Holden (so sad to see him in this position) was 55 when this film was made, but he plays a man in his first 40 years and looks like he is in his 60's. 20 years old and recognizing interesting. I think the dog that they found on the side of the road was sexier and they had more life than their competitive connections. <br /> <br /> The behavior of Holden - age as Clint Eastwood when he directed this film, (not) unfortunately - it is set by 60 open events before the hippie cold: a bachelor pad, hi-fi walk, Yamashiro meals. But the film is ridiculously uncool, claptrap clinking of old fogies wishing that the free spirit felt on the Sunset and Laurel Canyon will find them with their great 'hukin sexy' cars. Youth culture has never been discouraged. And I'm wondering to think that Bill Holden was very interested in young people that took this part of shame.
