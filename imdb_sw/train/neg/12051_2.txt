This film is "riveting" but in the same way with a car accident is riveting. It's hard to look away. In general, this film is nothing more than a social-an attemptless attempt - and a non-profit attempt, therefore. Film artists work and seem to have no problems going to the lowest sectors. The way that money is presented to Ted is misuse. The intervention measures that Ted film actors involved in (meeting with so-called experts) were empty and without any attempt to connect with Ted. Instead, it is very clear that it serves to cover the film profile and serve more Ted status. The worst part is that filmmakers leave behind Ted after 6 months; and it seems to be completely cut off from the issue that followed for months before. If they cared, they would find the best "experts" to help Ted. If you really wanted to see what Ted would do, then they should allow him to spend money without intervention. This film is better than the top face of the Jackass and not the document. It is sad to think how much $ 100,000 could have changed the life of a homeless person installed in the right hands.
