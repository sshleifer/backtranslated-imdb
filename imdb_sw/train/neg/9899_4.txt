The ridiculous version of the film is a classic ethnic "Moby Dick". John Barrymore is Captain Ahab, who loves to the pastor's daughter, Joan Bennett. Brother Derek is an opponent of Mrs Bennett's issues. When Mr. Barrymore lost his foot in a whaling accident, Bennett refuses. You must kill the whale and win Bennett back ... There are several scenes that can be fun 1930 viewers of the theater; especially the events associated with Barrymore lose his foot. The movie has not been a good age, however; there is the best film from that time, all of the 1920s and the 1930s silk. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <3 /> / / <br /> <br /> <br />
