From the beginning to the end, this is the most pop-up movie about NOTHING I saw. Characteristics and cooperation between the character of the title and character of Marthe Kller is a pure passion. Racetrack as a gimmick figure is so great that it limits on Cliche, still the Pollack director takes on every hairpin side if it's something very important. Maybe there is a certain value for playing MSFT3000 of some events, such as Pacino to communicate with his inner woman, with a goof value. But, even the emergency humor is difficult to find in this total Turkey.
