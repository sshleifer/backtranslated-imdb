I assure people to watch this transfer out of this Briti film will watch watch, but for someone from the UK is painful in his mistakes. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film Elijah Wood gets off the tube at the Bank center, which has been trashed. He says to his sister, who meets, "What happened here" and responds "Oh Tottenham were in yesterday yesterday" !!! Tottenham is already in the city already. They are part of the city, do not need to go there! And if Tottenham's fans wanted to fight with other fans the last place in the world will do that is the Bank center, where there are more security cameras than anywhere in the world. <br /> <br /> There are other similar errors but their failure is the actor who is leading the koligan. He made it clear that he was not worth trying to talk to the end of the end of the end and instead he was chosen by Dick Van Dyke mock-ney, which made my ears move. It was caused by the fact his whole group said in a way that you would expect West Ham fans to talk. This error has made him unreliable in the role and actually damaged the film.
