Is rich, sick Elizabeth Taylor telling the Angel of Death on his island castle in the Mediterranean, or he is very busy - or more precisely, as usual? Actually, both are used for Joseph Losey's director of walking, a delightful mess called "Boom", correctly called because anger in a beautiful, elegant environment almost burst. Richard Burton climbs Taylor's mountain without acceptance; she dresses the perfect Samurai and saber. Although it looks good in a large mirror, the image is otherwise death, failure even Liz 'n Dick-philes should avoid (with the stars "what hell!" The view of their works of late-'60s came to the nadir spirit here). It seems, confused, and frustrated, "Boom" is a tragedy - although the screens of Tennessee Williams, who changed his unsuccessful play "Dairy Training Does Not Stop Here", said he loves it so much! * from ****
