I wanted to love Magnolia. The plot reminded the Grand Canyon (which I liked). 4 different life / stories that come at the end but Magnolia took half the way through the movie and I'm lost. I almost put it off once and then but I felt I had to stay there to the end, I did not know it would be another hours to 1/2 hours caused. Thank you God for renting me instead of seeing it in the theater. I shouted after 2 hours. A big kick in the pants was the last area of ​​the frog. My DVD player is still unforgiving and I don't blame one bit. It was a special movie, but a bad movie, boring, and useless.
