The 3-D mentioned in "Someone who hasn't been" stands for DUMB, DUMB, DUMB! This inept comedy has 3-D effects that makes the effect of 3-D in "Jaws 3", "Amityville 3", and "Friday Section 13" looks best for comparison. Not to mention the movie is aininine to the extreme. This was one of the most 1983 movies for the drop-out effects. Steve Guttenberg and Jeffrey Tambor got into the mess, but at least they didn't kill their jobs. Tambor would continue to star in the HBO's "Larry Sanders Show" and the box office of Ron Howard and "How Grinch Stole Christmas", with Guttenberg following this to "Police Academy" and "Cocoon". What is in these projects instead of the "No One". If you do, you will regret it. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * (out of four)
