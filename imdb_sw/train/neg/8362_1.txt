This is one very bad movie. I have broken my brain and I can't come up with one good idea to do. Acting is angry. I have seen more reliable displays on cable access. The plan is ridiculous. The stolen diamonds, President's secret records, and shark that attack anything that is nearing should be the most fun. The night of Sharks is not so bad is good. The discussion has a voice and is presented as written in seconds before closure. And on top, Sharks's night has the worst sound I ever heard. I wonder that my ears did not start bleeding from the 80s of syntnosized technology that someone bothered to record. From everything that I have read, the Italian film industry had died in 1987. The Sharks night is like the last nail in the coffin.
