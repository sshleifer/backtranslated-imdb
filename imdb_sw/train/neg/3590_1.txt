How can one sink down when trying to restore the old glory? ST: HF will be happy to show you. If you are used to see what was done with a good Star Trek show, don't show this. <br /> <br /> Writing is a hodge-podge, the performers' performances of their weak characters, and above all, the design work is a low dog. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for powerful leaders, don't look here! As a view of the Federation of power? Forget about it here! Starfleet is mocked by clusters wearing SPIKES in their hair. When a seemingly talented craftsman draws near and within two minutes of opening opening, Ensign Spikey tries to arrange an attempt with the engineer. It just decreases from there. No, even match matches, for good. They are very small or very large, collars under their chest, and the TNG One seasons with two uniforms mixed with the uniforms of the third season and DS9. Strong discipline and culture of any nature for lack of this production to the boat! The only good thing on this show is the graphics, which seems to improve slightly and every season. Okay, I take it back. Who uses CG that is not available? The creators of this show. Do not worry about it, it will say your Star Trek mistake, as it was. Even giving us back to the original exhibition can save this epidemic. I cried openly when I looked at this, probably because my eyes were blood and my head was lost. That's bad.
