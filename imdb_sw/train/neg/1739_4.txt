Watching That Lady In Ermine I wondered what Betty Grable did in the project that seemed to be aiming for Marlene Dietrich to do. The man on the 20th century Fox may have decided to have the same sex symbol. Darryl F. Zanuck should know well <br /> <br /> Betty has 19th century Italian Countess whose domain has been invaded by Hungarian soldiers Hussars captain and Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. his grandfather ghostly whose picture exists in. The palace hall with the rest of his distinguished relatives, sees no little similarity in Doug now and another invader some 300 years earlier who he dealt with when the forces failed. Besides that Betty has now been married to Cesar Romero and the invasion has arrived at the wrong time, before things have been completed. That's going to give anyone a bad view, I guarantee. <br /> <br /> New, clean every Betty American SI actress make seductive and amazing. Marlene Dietrich can put these, but with Betty falls down than the presidential candidate yesterday. He and Fairbanks do not have chemistry at all, although Doug is as charming as ever and someone can look at anything. Frederick Hollander and Leo Robin wrote a mark for this film and this is the Moment got Oscar appointed for Best Song. That Lady In Ermine's one chance for the Oscar glory fell Buttons And Bows. Ernest Lubitsch died in the middle of the film and Otto Preminger finished that Lady In Ermine. I can't believe Lubitsch had a grable in mind to guide here. Neither are you if you see that woman in Ermine.
