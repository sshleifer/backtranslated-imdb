We decreased <br /> <br /> Ratio: 1.33: 1 <br /> <br /> Type of sound: Silent <br /> (Black and white - short film) <br /> <br> Stan 'n' Ollie get mixed with several floozies (Kay Deslys and Vera White) after visiting the theater that decreases to the absence! Of course, their military wives (Vivien Oakland and Bess Flowers) should not be wrong ... L & H play the victims of the forehead, forced to lie a lie that is disturbed in an interesting style. Much of this is very surprising, especially the place where Stan is cracked by Deslys, causing a violent match to push and pushing. However, some fun is under Oakland and Flowers, and play their roles altogether, which adds an element of unpleasantness to the status of 'mumoe henpecked'. Previously released in the UK as WE SLIP UP.
