I died for what the dead recently and read the current review of thinking I could deal with the average movie. However this film was less than average, it still looks. The script was well documented and acting it was an average of B levels with a couple standing out as beautiful. This setting is similar to that of Saw, teaching people who have done badly in the situation and trying to make them more aware of life, but it is true where the comparison ends. The nine dead try to have the heart and mind of simple ideas that are not new. The biggest mistake I had found in What we were dead, had been hit by the face of the flashbacks viewer that happened 3 minutes before the film and was not absolutely needed by the wrong end that people will not see coming, in the wrong way. Preventing any providers I found worse than bad movies and even did not have this end. Flick good, bad acting and finishing though ...
