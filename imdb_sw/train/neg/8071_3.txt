I wanted to watch this film because of Eliza Dushku, but she has only a small part in it, and her character is not very good. However, the main character, played by Melissa Sagemiller, is very good and happy to look at the movies. This is not just a thing but a demonstration of his performances and talents. He does a very good job. <br /> <br /> The story itself is, on its face, good nonsensical. After a car accident, some friends may have died, but they continue to live their previous lives, while all sorts of hidden things happen. Some bad people are after them, but we don't know who they are (maybe they were in another car, but we really don't know anything about why they are after them). The last events are especially evident in pride, but I can't find anything involved. The opening part, where bad people (who wear amazing masks) cut the girl's hand blond and collect some of her blood not explained or followed. Unless bad people should be a representative of the surgeons who are trying to pull Cassie (Sagemiller) from the dead ... but no, that doesn't seem to work. The wicked are just wicked; actually just delete the story that could otherwise be interesting. In an unusual story about death and love and sacrifice, does hell need bad people? Over 3 out of 10.
