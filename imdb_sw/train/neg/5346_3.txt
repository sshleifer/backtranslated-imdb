I had to watch this film because the plot was very bad and the film lived in expectation. In fact it makes it to look at the worries sometimes. Unlike other films of Meyer, the sexual antics are less low. Some cases of abuse are not available and angry. The program is chaotic and some acting and lines are awesome. <br /> <br /> The movie is a wonderful mix of sado-eyeschistic fantasy with a brutal window and sexual immorality and it fails for all mistakes. It's like though Meyer was trying to create a sex / black sex for having a high moral message. Meyer knows we feel guilty of turning around with a beautiful commentary of the first dominatrix area showing Lady Susan with a whip in protest clothing. Then he tries to return to the right path by making it a film on the victory of good over evil. However, because they take out, you can't live with something. <br /> <br /> Because it is so bad in many ways, it's actually looking if you appreciate the art of making bad films in the worst taste possible. Maybe, because it's bad, we are about to allow Meyer to leave and unacceptable.
