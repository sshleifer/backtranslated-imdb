I have seen many films, from China - and Hong Kong. This is worse. No, the worst was 'Unknown Pleasures'. I saw 'Platform' last evening and I think that two other films of Jia Zhang Ke should be better. This evening I had been disappointed again.

These are true masters of the Chinese cinema, not the most active men!
