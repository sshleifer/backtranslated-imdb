Before seeing this movie, I would say that I liked everything Kathy Bates has done. Now it's everything-a-one. James Woods is grateful ... not his character, acting it. One should tell him that the "poor" is not the same as dirty, nor does it, nor cliche. Ditto for Randy Quaid discrimination. The only feature of redemption is Henry Thomas, who is not enough enough to carry this sodden aggression. If you like to enjoy the land, you will enjoy the environment. That's the best I can. <br /> <br /> I am a great fan of all independent and quirky films, but this is very bad.
