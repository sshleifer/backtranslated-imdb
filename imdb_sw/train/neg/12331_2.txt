One of the "coming to age" films that should be of interest to adults and promising children. This movie does not. It is a little relief of allowing the body of Sylvia Kristel twice to suffer from dorky Eric Brown. To make things worse, movies may be ridiculous or stupid when it tries to be funny, sexy, or fantastic. Laughing awkwardly as we should believe that the boy will go alone and bury the dead woman in his front yard. Think about why a famous woman for Emmanuelle needs a double body. As the movie went on, I began to reflect on a combination of Personal and Millennium Lessons that Sylvia Kristel deceived Jennifer Love Hewitt as Howard Hesseman makes us feel the WKRP. Look at this to laugh at the ignorance of other people, or to the performance of Ed Begley Jr., or to ask what Sylvia Kristel would look like Jennifer Love Hewitt. But I can give you an idea of ​​your lesson, leave off with the movies watching Sylvia Kristel that is not Emmanuelle.
