When Carol (Vanessa Hidalgo) begins to look at his brother's death, he begins to criticize something worse than "natural causes". He almost gets the truth, more than the threat of his son-in-law, Fiona (Helga Line), and the rest of Satan's inner. They will do whatever is needed to stop its windy ways. <br /> <br /> If you like evil, Satan-containing movies, Black Candle has a lot to offer. The movie is filled with many short and ritualistic soft-based sex. One particular area that involves a young woman and a goat must be reliable. Unfortunately, all the sleeve in the world can not save Black candles. Most of the film is the total weight. More than one area that I mentioned earlier, many sexual incidents are not silly and really not sexy. Acting is the best deck. Even the favorite genre Helga Line offers a desperate performance. The plan is useless. His main task seems to have to hold a string of red sex scenes together. I know only one movie directed by Jose Ramon Larraz. Compared to his Giza's daughters that combine glowing and scared with skill, Black candles come out as amateurish. 3/10 is about the best I can do.
