When I just thought I would finish a whole year without giving one movie "rating" of a bomb, a friend brought this very ugly turd to my home last night. I was so scared to know his reputation, and it was like God-bad if I wanted to. This is the Mexican mess, called English, and released by K. Gordon Murray. It has bad sets and effects, and Santa's awesome scenarios that don't work on the North Pole, but rather from the cloud in the outer space, and who have no little elves to help him make his fingers but instead of all different groups of children from each country there. The opening of the opening, where Nick is so passionate as he sees the observers show all these hardworking children when singing the bad songs in different languages, it seems to continue forever, and without a story. Obviously, This Santa Claus does not comply with child labor laws! Finally we find a good and slinky student who comes out of the devil's own devil who walks from Hell to the Earth, to make the naughty little kids and turn Santa's Christmas round to become a dream. Watching this movie is an experience of trippy and misleading, and appropriate to scare young children and remove Santa Claus and holidays forever. Naturally, the name of Jesus Christ is frequently mentioned in this Christmas film, which somehow makes all creepier in the context of all the wonderful things that are going on. This makes it easy for my personal list of "Movie Style I've Found", but I'm sure it's not the only thing.
