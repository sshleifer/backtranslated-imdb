This is just a bad movie. For what seemed to be a good budget was able to be better. It was close. With a beautiful heroine like Salma Hayek, a warrior fight as close as Jackie Chan, a battle with the nearest duels like Crouching Tiger ..., music almost like, say, Conan ... etc. Welcome. But in the end it is small and difficult to find anything interesting in it. Perhaps away from John Rhys-Davies with duel like those heroes in Hero or before mentioning Crouching Tiger ... I am a disgrace of the poor old John. He is after every good actor and more worthy. So if you - so if you still have a chance to just look something else.
