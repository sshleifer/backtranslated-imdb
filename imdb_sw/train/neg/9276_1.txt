This is a real film. In fact the original trinity (un) was governed by the decline of the return of the third and third, "Final Conflict" which turns out that a small ignorance plot about half of the way through the film seems to only give the necessary death that was destructive to now have all the reasons for etre for the series of "Omen". But then inducing this movie to fly-up on TV (beware of the buyers of the Omen box placed on the DVD - spinning and the widescreen ratio of the transfer, this had small screens of the screen) behind a series of very good demonic chillers was not forgiven , in particular, approved as it was, and exec.producer and producer of the first three Mace Neufeld movies and Harvey Bernhard. I would like to give away a conspiracy if there were any, rather than the usual death events (without hope for the tone of TV) and some of the worst work I have ever seen. All involved in this project for culinary people should be embarrassing to the embarrassment that has ever been a screens, not to put themselves under the name of Omen. If one person is convinced by my review to avoid this mess, I will feel better.
