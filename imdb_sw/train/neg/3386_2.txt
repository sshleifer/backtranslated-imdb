Yes, I was lucky to see the original production of long-term music of Michael Bennett's hit. It was an amazing experience and I was paid to see the movie when it comes to the movie in 1985. It's bad. Almost everything fails. First, Attenborough (a good actor, good director and correct material) is a pole - almost as close as John Huston was employed at ANNIE. The camera is always in the wrong place - you cut songs and paste !!! They are bad - the power of play were these players - hungry, talented artists just want the opportunity to show what they can do and when they got the opportunity - you can't remove your eyes. But this is just flown by playing, it works "good" to sing but none of them is a little bit. In fact, look at the stripes on IMDb - none of them continued to do anything. (Okay, OK, Janet Jones married Gretzky - sheesh). So this movie breaks down does not capture one of the second magic, despair, musical enthusiasm of action. General strike! (But although they are trying to make music - good music is still growing and reminding people how that score was great).
