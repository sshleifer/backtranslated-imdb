I saw this movie in 1979, I was 17 or 18 years old, when it was released. The Theater was perhaps 1/4 full when the movie started. Ten minutes on the movie I have a friend who came out of me to see the film is just two people in the theater. The movie was really weird and had no plot or reason for its script and people wanted their money back. We decided to stay for the movie ENTIRE .... why tolerate such suffering? ... here's why. We wanted to be true critics of the film ... to have the standard of introducing all other movies is difficult to justify that you have seen the best film (10) they come with something better. But, it's easy to be able to set up all the other movies away from the worst filmed film (and this is ... 1 best). There may be other movies out there that should be 1, but I haven't seen them yet. Now I have set up all the movies I see on a large scale due to this worst .... It is a true MOVIE FRIEND ... she.
