I bought this film on the blu-ray because it promised good performances and music. I am also a great fan of the same ... Baraka. The movie is very styled after Baraka, wide corners, similar shots and cameras set to keep long bundle in every shot. Even some cases were the same (street and traffic). Although Baraka told a good story, considering the nature, human nature, spiritual condition, and fear of the world in an interesting way with good music, this movie jumped out of the shot so that it could be hit without a fictional story, a short-term music, and . ... POOF, completed! I thought there must be some kind of mistake! History of the world? Half of the movie is Egypt and landscape (it looks like Arizona, but I wasn't worried looking). Great people, this is terrible, lease is a must, but do not ask. Film workers should be ashamed of themselves by putting this out.
