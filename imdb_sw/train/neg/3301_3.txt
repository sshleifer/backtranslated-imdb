The typical Swedish film today seems to start by giving us the possibility outside the window and proceeding down the same way for the whole process. RÃ¥narna is another good example of a film that makes a little sense. Banks in Stockholm are stolen by a group of effective "military" invaders. Two police officers are looking for a trial that will soon become more difficult than it appears first. It is common in the Swedish film that is usually made by the same people and you have seen it frequently. Mikael Persbrandt must be in every Swedish film from a few years ago! But it is okay since Persbrandt is one of the few that makes a strong here (as usual does). Problems with this film especially around the story itself. First of all theft feels more like history. This is still another movie about a boy who fought to reveal himself in the male world (if that was not done a thousand times before and a good actor instead of Sofia Helin). There is also a very unreliable plot to move closer to the end that looks as seen as visitors landing. But yet, I thought it was a really good touch because I was half asleep at that time. It selected a few things (and actually saved a mark from the next step). Finally the main problem is the same as for other Swedish documents of this type. Only that action and suspension does not live according to the standards that we use from other movies (especially Hollywood). It feels cheaper and rather weak for comparison. In my opinion Swedish filmmakers should try to focus more on the plot and act, and forget about trying to make a "Hollywood-action light" as they do now. For this reason it becomes another attempt to forget from the Swedish film industry. You have 3/10.
