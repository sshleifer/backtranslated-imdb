I bought this from Blockbuster to 99p. The boy behind the counter said the reason was cheaper because the disc was scratched for sh * t, but failed to mention that the reason was very cheap because the film was ap * s the worst efforts that sucked harder than Paris Hilton in the video The hotel room of the hotel. Talking to home videos, since it was a good game to prepare them as a film - I mean to say, films used to hire executives and technicians and journalists and so on - not more - just collect your friends and shade habits together for the weekend, The decline in production and budget of £ 8.00, and to get someone fall down the level with the keyboard of Casio (soundtrack) - then close on the shelves, for some poor sap (me), take home alone desperate. But here's the clincher - I used it in many ways this way, and beat it on one side, ready for hammer ... until the second night, when looking at Darren's Day 'Hellbreed' (£ ​​1.99) to go home and stop Blockbuster different). Now this film has made 'Grim Weekend' looks like The Exorcist, so I beat the Grim week back, to get some time on the amazing list of IMDb, which the audience claimed were few. In fact, once I had had the pain, pain, and fear, the recognition of the week of Grim was hit on the toast, I would enjoy, delight, and drop down on strange things. And there's a lot of it. Check the board. Then check the flick. Hell, it may even be worth it. AWWWWW CRAP!
