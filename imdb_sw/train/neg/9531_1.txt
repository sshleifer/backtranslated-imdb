This is an angry movie. Two women with dement cheat and torture a middle-aged person. There is not much to give away from the plot or "spoiler". I would just like to comment that the end is almost the largest part of the flick. A large part of this film involves Locke and Camp cackling obnoxiously, while all blowing psychology on the camera. Add this sound voice that repeats again, including a vaudevillian song about "dear old dad" which shows the infinite quality views the viewer cannot see. Music is offensive for the first time, then you have persuaded the viewer to be worse than that shown on the screen. The theme here is the young runaway amok, understood as a response to '60s, but with a little thought or style. Avoid!
