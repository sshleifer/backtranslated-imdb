I saw this movie long ago ... lucky was for free. I must be one of the twenty people who saw this movie in the theater. I do not remember the whole group, but I remember I was very tired, the plot did not know and when I came out of the theater the only thing I could say is at least now I know what the worst movie she saw was. I had a lot of trouble for one thing: if they can make heat when they approach the sun down enough for humans to live, why can't they open it at room temperature rather than hot and pot? Do we think we are foolish?
