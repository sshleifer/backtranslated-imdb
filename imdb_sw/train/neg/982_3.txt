The real star of this story of ignorance is a glorious technicolor. Visual treat for the eye, the film fails to stimulate the mind and heart. I was surprised, for the first time, with the idea of ​​Dietrich and Boyer leaving religion to "get" their love of love. Next is a great desire. Boyer is the only actor in production and one feels his punishment. The amazing wardrobe of Dietrich reduces its performance - sometimes his face is afraid to look - the wrong mask. As a player, Boyer made a form for hitting the monastery (which reminds me of the true story of Chartreuse) - when he leaves "marriage to the god" answers of his fellow members are amazed and fear that develops the planned religion. The viewer feels Boyer had already canceled his past. However, the journey is also predictable.
