Boy, this was one lousy movie! While I have not seen all of Burton / Taylor's cooperation, I can confidently say that this is even worse. The rich and sick woman (Taylor, of course) owns this island in Meditteranean, ruling over the attendants when she is suddenly visited by this traveling poet, who uses her mouth. In fact, the whole film is just talk talk, and a lot of talk is not minded. Even in 1968, no one can make the head or tail of this gentle trick, and the time makes it more clear. If it was not for good movies and landscape, it would be worth the negative. The only thing this film is good for its laugh without pretending at the cost of stars.
