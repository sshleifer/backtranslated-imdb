This could be a very good film, if I could look at it. Hand held camera was very bouncy. From opening loans I was concerned. Most of us look at the feel very cheap. But we stayed until the end was because it was an interesting and interesting film, providing some insight into the culture of pop-ups in South Africa. Black and white film added a sense of art. Acting was very real. Some of the talks were a little hard to understand, but a non-South African playground seemed more fun. If you get a motion sickness at all times, you can think seriously about this film. It's good, but it's not worth the nausea.
