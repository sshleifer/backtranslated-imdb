I watched this film, and I expected something to improve at all times. What is big about a boy who has no feelings? * yawn * <br /> <br /> You can't see Alex expressing feelings to anyone except his son. Yes, I know that is why his son is alone to make him lose his temper (if you call it), I get it. Characteristics do not create, relationships are not given enough time to be understood. In the same area Sarah says they will not have love, and in the future we see her talking about how her death had prompted them because they were so close? Synapses of logic has grown in this film. It is like someone looking at Boogie's text and writing this section to imitate Bill Little. Even the event that “loses anger” is the same as Little Bill will draw his wife, under the face expression (or lack of it). Yes, William H. Macy is good at showing someone without feeling-been there, did it - can you say Magnolia? <br /> <br /> This movie was not just emotionally, it had no substances, a good script, developed characters, and plot. And certainly there are no suggestions. :) <br /> ~ A ~
