It's funny, when you stop and think about it: awesome movie fans have deep and lasting love for those who tremble these days. Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE can throw us at night, but who of us (honest) who did not feel the real twinge of love for Gunnar Hansen in BRASS MASSACRE - or for Ken Foree, ever and even the fierce hero of DAWN's former dead? He came in remake he made me to stand and rejoice (such as Tom Savini came); I'm not a child. With Brian Halloran and ... Well, you get my drift (if not, stand down ...). These are some of the heroes of fear. Seeing many of these gathered together in one film is almost heard (at least at this rate, for my knowledge). If only authors (s) have been very active. Maybe someone else, somewhere in the line, will try again. As long as it is not another half-effort (such as blood restriction, for example).
