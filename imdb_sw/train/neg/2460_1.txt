I liked to love this film, but it didn't give you a chance. It is basically meant that the Mpeta Ring and hip hop theme, but fails to disappoint. It often feels like written and used by secondary school children for a particular school project, and is also a level of moisture that seems to have a purpose. There is no deception and, with more precision, never never feel like a document. And while the line is not to play for the first place, an instant birth attempt has helped me - in fact, anything better than the frustration we have been given. <br /> <br /> I recommend this to people who like "comedies" in the "Big House Momma" vein or "Norbit"; people who think that words like "butt" are a romantic nature. Other people should stay away from not wasting their time.
