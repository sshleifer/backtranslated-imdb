"Sundown: Vampire in Retreat" is garbage. Acting is terrible, the situation is not there and the characters are not interested. Any awesome thing about this piece is that most IMDb users gave 10. This is really awesome. There is no year, no doubt, no abuse, no.Bruce Cambell ("Evil Evil", "User") disappears completely , the support of the support is also bad. This, some people may like this picture, especially the national community but fans of the basic contempt or fear of fear will not enjoy this piece. In fact I love the act of fear, I would like to watch great movies of fear like "Holocaust of Cannibal" or "Last House on the Left". The view, the horror of the truth is supposed to be horrible, of losing blood and distortion, without stupid humor, which usually damages the whole concept.
