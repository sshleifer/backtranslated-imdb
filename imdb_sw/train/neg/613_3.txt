Wow, what can I say about this film? It's a piece of skin. I wonder that it has been tested as above. What is wrong with this film? Here is the best question: What is wrong with this film. <br /> <br /> The story itself is just stuck with clich√©. Here is very much about what ... Some of the hungry kinda and friends are not taking, they are killed, and they return as a scarecrow to take revenge. "All" of these are full of 86 minutes of inappropriate film. If you haven't seen this film do not waste your time watching it. Also, the second is not much better, so don't bother to check that either ... I loved this three movie because I loved the scarecrow dress, not because there is something good about the movie. I think you get a picture.
