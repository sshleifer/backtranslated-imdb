I was unfortunate to catch two of the worst films of 2004 behind this morning: the first, the lack of CGI not associated with The Chronicles of the zombies, and then, the shameless project known as Greendale. One hundred of the most expensive and other costs of money, but both are bad. True, it is quite bad. On the front side I must say that I am not a big fan of the world of Neil Young, but has contributed to its part of classic tunes: from Buffalo Springfield (whose best records were Teenage songs) to Rust Never Sleeps, Harvest, and Mirror Ball, someone has written songs containing very realistic. Unfortunately, there are no great songs in Greendale, and a few of the best value, and the film next to which they are building is really beautiful and simple political. Fully without features like art and non-attractive as polemic, Greendale is best left forgotten. Buying a book if you feel forced to contribute to Young Bank accounts.
