I was not impressed by this film. It was the name of Sin Eater earlier and it should be sitting in the same way with all that was said about the last half of the film. I don't even know the first 20 minutes of films were connected with any of them. It was very slow and what it was to pick up Robocop (Peter Weller) as one of the chief executives. That was a sad thing. All in all I could say this look in the matter of dealing with Catholic religion but anticipation eclipse or Stigmata from this film. Certainly it is after a few days and the word comes out.
