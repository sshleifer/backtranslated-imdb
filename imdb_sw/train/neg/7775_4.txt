I don't know and trilogy but came on this film last night on Showtime. The film looks very well with the design of the movie, but the screens were hit by wood. The acting was very bad - she thought that the two women led the service. You have never believed anything the executives said though. There was a discrimination-bible pastor without turbulence, Captain's authority, a soldier with a head of fire, etc. I am sorry to say that based on this deficit I opened it once as Canada without knowing that so Telefilm's last Canadian credit was off. I know I am a terrible person. Maybe I missed something in the beginning but enmity toward girls is never explained. Here they are besieged by the fortress and arewolves and men are wasting time and energy that are tearing two young people for any reason. FOCUS people. There is a much bigger wall than your walls than these girls are not girls - that's just a description of the hostility towards them. If they can purpose and fire gun you can also do well with them. The question of "immortal soul" can be solved later. Also, I think this relates to some of the trilogy, these girls should be characters? One of them killed a young Indian in the end to save one of their lives. I think one is a victim of his condition who cannot be judged because of his actions, but another is only a murderer who is not worthy of his happiness.
