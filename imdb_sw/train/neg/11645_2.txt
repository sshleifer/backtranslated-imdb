This is a review of 'Freddy Mercury The Untold Story,' release of the exhibition, Chicago Int. Film Films, 2007 One of the biographies caused by more, more unsuccessful and many more. If the movie I saw on the movie was first opened on television, I would like to urge its producers and distributors not to lose viewers to pay for the false pay-off feature. Even if the television documentary, the piano's favorite entertaining and participating in the presence of flower arrangements in hotel rooms and pumudo notes, pseudo-literary appear more than a bed sleepic Infomercial. Only part of the redemption of this "Mythical Story of Freddy Mercury" - or, uhm, was "Mythical Story of Princess Diana" is an original festival, video and TV - not the best Freddy Mercury and Queen. Testimonials testimonials and eyewitnesses and insights, such as: "He was a free spirit," (in fact. I thought Freddy Mercury was a company member ...) ignoring those Freddy testimonials, and Brian May or Montserrat Caballe lost The new and bright light in the complex life of Mercury and its character. And ... what up with Harry Potter-like boarding school? What? Interview with the first-crush girl ("... who are now working in the travel agency") and members of the first Freddy port contribute to what I need to know about Mercury? Vital key to his personal life, his gender, his artistic style and growth, the queen, the band remains unxplored. These traders do not ask a single, exciting question, or do not focus on independent or visionary research on their subject, rather than giving a bad picture of political and non-commentary on the rock and brilliant story, which is not worthy to be remembered by This biography of History Channel Grandpa and grandparents can finish on Sunday night.
