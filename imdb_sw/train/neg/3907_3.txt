I am happy to rent this movie for one reason: its shortcomings made me like to read Allende's book and get the full story. Pros: The movie is good, the period is well displayed and regularly (for my best knowledge), and Meryl and Glenn does a good job. Cons: This is the worst job I've ever seen from Jeremy Irons - I kept wondering if there was something wrong with his mouth. (And I hate the wrong way of English says "Transito.") Winona Ryder has nothing to believe except to look young and idealistic. Many of the other exhibitions are the same, but so few things depend on the behavior and development of the relationship that I was confused and becoming angry before the end. I am very interested now if this movie is a normal Bille August function. I might have to stop some bucks to rent the Snow's Smilla.
