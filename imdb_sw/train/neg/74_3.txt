They built this as a kind of fantasy Man from the Snowy River meets Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, and just by touching romantic Ned and Joe getting to play away from the class of talent, its young newborns of rich adults. Okay, there are many theories about Ned Kelly, but there is also a lot of fact well, but still a creative opportunity for innovation in producing good history. I mean, this is not the story of Robin Hood, not the stories of Arthurian, not Beowulf, not the person whose life has been associated with the dirt of centuries before that any entertainment of their lives and times is 99% of guesswork. It's just a couple of life ago. My brothers were already old school when Ned was impaled. <br /> <br /> So it's silly for me to fancifully think this movie was a great attempt to tell Kelly's story. After reading the best novel of Peter Carey "The History of Kelly Gang" I was eager to expect that this would be in the same line. But no, the fact is that Mick Jagger very sad 1970 Kelly was very close to the truth, and the best movie, which is not to say a whole lot for it. <br /> <br /> Fun is just cost me two bucks to hire a DVD! I will give you 3/10, and that's because some good shots of Australian bush makes me feel generous.
