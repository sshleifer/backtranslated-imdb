There seems to be a bit of curse there when it comes to gay movies. Therefore, the end of happiness is not very common. Good Thing has been taken, gay films have end of broken relationships or the death of the wrong time. And others, like Come Undone, just last ... period. The creators of this piece of evil have something or two to learn about plot, leadership, and time. In the first ten minutes of this film, I found myself a little, and even more after seeing the first picture of Jeremie Elkaim's character with a little psychological session. It seems that this film was randomly shared without a little or continuous attempt. There is no real way to tell you when you're looking at now or some kind of flashback. I could just take a lot before that really unappealing. Stephen Holden's New York Times called this film "... shimmeringly beautiful and quite real." In fact, it seems that Stephen has invested in beer battles before watching, for this is far from good. Given all the features provided by this film, I expected something worth looking at. Sadly, the film lived under his head. And at the end of the film (which has not provided any solutions, I would add) it is clear to see that the authors, director and film have all come to Undone.
