"Child Problem" is one of the most advanced movies. Not worse (although some people disagree with that), but it's not good. It is about a seven-year-old boy who breaks up the disorder (John Ritter, Amy Yasbeck) who loves to fool. This film is very silly and impossible because I do not buy for the second second that the child can act as unrurly as a child doing in this film. It is true and preposterous though I laughed several times (I don't know why). But I can't recommend this film. I know I am very good. If there is one positive thing about the "Child Problem" it is better than the series that was very bad. <br /> <br /> ** (out of four)
