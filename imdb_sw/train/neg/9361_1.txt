When I saw the preview on this on TV I was thinking, "ok it would be a good movie waswolf" but it wasn't. it wasn't awesome! Acting was good, the plot was terrible, the military effort was just stupid. I think the SCI-FI facility can be done better than this piece. The movie made a sound like Arron was going to be a turnwolf, instead he turned psychologically with a little throat doctor out. If you have read some of my other views on other movies, there is every positive, but this is not just because the story was bad. One out of 10 max. I am sure you were all expecting to flick some wolf, but I bet you didn't expect this. Over Loch Nes was a much better way than this film, hack, other films on the sci-fi station is better than this movie.
