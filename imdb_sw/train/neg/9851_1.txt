Worse than the worst of David Lynch "confusathon", "Dead Brain" does not mean anything. You lost talent talent (Bill Pullman, Bill Paxton), dial round as they are on the "cartoon Tom and Jerry" on acid. There is a development of poor behavior. It begins only to plant "extraordinary rate", up to the level of chaos. Do not take into this because of the best actors above. They do not have anything to work with, and you will wonder what is going on in a whole minute, uncomfortable 85. I strongly recommend avoiding the "Dead Brain" at all costs, unless you forbid your brain in total nonsense. - MERK
