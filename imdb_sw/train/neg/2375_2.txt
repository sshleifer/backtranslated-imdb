Freddy's dead: Final Fantasy, the sixth phase of fantasy in the Elm Street series and again other bad times. I think this is closed by the end of the Fantasy Child. I was fortunate to get a nightmare on the DVD series of the Elm Street series for my birthday, so I got to see all the columns. I can say that I get more and more desires even though with these sequels, at least two years ago, it looks just like Freddy will lose his edge. It is almost as if the authors tried to give Freddy spirit and destroy it rather than reinforcing the story. This was a kind of good, unpleasant love for Robert Englund, but this was much less than what Freddy Krueger represented. <br /> <br /> Freddy has gone back, but he has something that we don't know, daughter. Maggie, she does not know that she is her father, but soon she finds the secret of her secrets and wants her help. He should do well to resist his power, but it is hard for all the beautiful memories of his loving father. It's amazing, isn't it? But Freddy did not leave it on his way. The dead of Freddy: Final Fantasy is also presented to 3-D, radical, huh? See sarcasm. This is one of the worst sequels, is tied to the fifth sequel of the Nightmare on Elm Street series, I would like to watch the second nightmare on Elm Street to be honest. This had a bad effect, the stupidity, and just about any idea of ​​the story. I did not like his idea and has caused any idea of ​​who Freddy Krueger is true, the master of death, not the Father who knows Best. <br /> <br /> 2/10
