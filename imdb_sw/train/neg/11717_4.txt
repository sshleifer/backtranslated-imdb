Many themes or parts of the story are similar to in Leon, then other parts have been seen as another film, I don't know what it is, but there is a common sense on the entire movie. It was nice to look, but it would be wonderful! if the story would have been more original. Little girl, a bad killer from Leon, has done just a little. The secret of the opening is very good :-) It is amazing that people like to fight in the kitchen, in movies :-) My biggest problem is to remember parts from Leon, Nikita and wherever they come from French or America. If you haven't seen Leon, then this is a good movie. If you liked this film, then I can recommend Leon. New Regards / Rick
