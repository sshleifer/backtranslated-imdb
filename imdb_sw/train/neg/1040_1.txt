I can't believe that this film was able to get a maximum of 6! It is difficult to see and unhappy, certainly one of the worst films I have seen for a long, long time. It is a non-budget way, reminds me of the Star Wars I and II sessions for a great feeling that you are looking at the collapse of the total creative train. It is one of the "films" that only attract people who are ignorant because they are considered to be "different", so it's good. The film should not be "different", it's just a bad decision of the film.
