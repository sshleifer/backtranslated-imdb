This movie was one of the biggest movies made ,,,, with everything to make a good film. Good work, amazing special effects ...... oh wait you should think of a good movie. Well this was not one of them, apparently just burnt. What I want to know, what kind of bone will be thought that this film was 10. Now if any other vote, 8 or 9 was too high, but 10? Come, what made this movie sooooo good bad 10? I know these are exactly 206 that thought that Jean Claude Van Damme is a very good actor.
