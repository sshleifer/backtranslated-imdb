WENYEZI! Avoid as a blow. I would like to imitate this standard for more than 10 ever-ever movies. Specific effects, acting, emotions, sounds, etc. seem to be made by day care students ... wait, I've seen better plans than this. It opens as a special show of a woman and a female emerging female doing a swimming area and then gets worse since then. Good nude events, but it's so. Sound and light problems were developing in movies. Sometimes I would swear I could hear the sounds of camera motors. YIKES! I would like to see another film on this story, but it's made by different people. This group of executives and staff need more studies to act with the film. Got 1 out of 10.
