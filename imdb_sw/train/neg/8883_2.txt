Cliff Robertson as a foolish husband married to a wealthy wife provides excellent performance of razzie here if there is one; it's like Michael Michael Anderson continued to tell him "call, think a zombie, just under a delightful" through his little cow as he struggled with Robertson's efforts. Some of the cast are very difficult; Jennifer Agutter's popularity of LOGAN'S RUN was not found for what should be played as an important role. If the quality of acting was three times better; if some gap holes were filled; and if the wind was shot of the adrenaline, then the yawner could be brought up to the level acceptable to the Lifetime TV. As is the case, its level is too high to be able to help imagine the chronic insomniacs are using DOMINIQUE to catch a little snoozing time. Perhaps the telemarketers of night-night television do not have great opportunities in not doing it.
