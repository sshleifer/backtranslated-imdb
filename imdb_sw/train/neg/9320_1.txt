If this film was a comedy, I would like to give it 10. Oh my, where do I start? Keep this way - I've seen many awesome films, but this makes Troll 2 look like Freakin 'Saving Private Ryan. It's like a group of porn movie developers has decided to make a horrible film, change their mind in midproduction and decided to make a comedy, then returned to fear, and then decided that they should be stuck with porno (softcore at that). Everything about this film is just awesome: the music symbols (someone hits the guy who bought the keyboard of the Yamaha), the script, leading, movies, acting. There's just no words to describe this. O wait, that's there: Holy $ *%!
