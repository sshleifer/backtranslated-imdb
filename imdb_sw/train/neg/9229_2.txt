This is a movie about making a film. These movies may have entertainment, but require some substances, to do so. It didn't happen here, I'm afraid. Mr Coppola did not inherit the skills of his father, unfortunately (neither his sister, who can not make movies that one can look at) <br /> <br /> I wonder how this film got a similar review. Let's take a look: a leading actor, supposed to be the director, explains as the frozen squad and his voice has the same level as whatever he says, the leading female actress describes his face that never changes, the plot is fully integrated into bits and maybe one of the connecting feature, The movie inside the idea of ​​the movie should be more stale than paleolithic rocks ... Will that be enough? I was sad every time I watched this film. Walking with the dog is far beyond the best entertainment for this unpredictable movie of cripples. It is like François Truffaut's plot was led by Dick Cheney ... Brazil, other ancient SF movies? You must be old ...
