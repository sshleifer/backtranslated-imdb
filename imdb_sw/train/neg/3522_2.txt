If you like the usual flicks that involve on top of the stages, unreliable stunts (not accepted as a gift here), and a long discussion; you will like this bunch of mountain goat goats. I had great optimism according to the trailer. I thought that Stalone would be forced in his "days" to give wise people and to make a film of action that would put a reliable hero in a reliable position where the story, set, and (reliable) step will continue. I crave the act that is at least close to the fact that you can think of the fear and excitement that would come from the event. My little knowledge about hypothermia and its effects have changed at least one area of ​​ignorance. Judge Dredd is only better because you know to go to the theater that you will see a comic book made on the film. Characteristics, settings and everything else to compare with anything we can meet. Cliffhanger on the other hand turns the climbing mountain in Rambo before saying "yo, Adrian!"
