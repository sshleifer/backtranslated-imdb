My mark for this trick: 1/10 1 for technical only. Everything else is very bad. Other videos that are useless. Obviously it seems that creating a good script for a film or television is almost impossible. Although it is easy to understand why politicians cannot tell the truth, they are among the world's greatest liars, it is difficult to understand how to make the film so pathetic. We should believe that taking people to morons. Perhaps it was a reason to believe, because 99% of the films are dancing. Because they are stupid and ignorant and very bad events. As you look at the prices we give to Oscars, we understand why we continue to make more films than others. <br /> <br /> And odd was always money for that shortage. But it was not education and health. <br /> <br /> If you want to still listen to this t ** t, click the Top Publisher button (at least 20X).
