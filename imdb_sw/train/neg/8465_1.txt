I can't believe how bad this film was. I feel proud even if I regard it as a "movie". Acting was flat, editing was a horrible and conspiracy growing many unanswered questions. The cluster was the same, not ordinary people: a small group of foreigners living in the US and trying to slow down humanity. But it goes quickly down from there. How can they persuade a "man" to accept a stranger as his wife so that they can become a stranger to the diversion they need? They show an aggressive visitor but do not show what it does. They have a plastic surgeon who can produce perfect skin for industrial level. They throw us into a huge monster of the guest and teeth. The latter was very painful to see. I think I am very disappointed that Bruce Boxlietner will have nothing to do with this. What? How could he tell the big farmer of the stranger and the teeth, "Get away from him you son of bch" with a straight face? It's a long fall from his Babel 5 days. Avoid this at all costs.
