I was really, desperate for this movie. it started very well, and it created a lot of scenery and doubt, but eventually it got round to reveal "monster" ... it became just psychological and skin problems ...... again. Ond-de-do. However, another movie of nutjob ... if we can't have them enough. <br /> <br /> Be fair, "may" is actually separating the look, and how he goes with the wonderful sounds he makes is very good, but I'm sick to rent a film like this just to discover that the monster is a human being, though it happens , closed, itself. When I saw all the mice mentioned earlier I was hoping for some kind of a mouse-mix of a mouse player ... it was dropped down when Creep was revealed. Over this, other things in this film are useless. (Spoiler) <br /> <br /> Why Does Hell Creep Kill Security Guard? What sure, without clinging to a very mutual stress that says "I am PSYCHO and I live down!" His fool, and seemingly just happen to prevent the behavior of Franka Potente to get help. What was he eating under the fire? I got the feeling that he had been locked in, and just unlocked unexpectedly in that part of the tunnel to let him ... so he has been a rat all the time, and why are they so around him? Why is he so dangerous to kill? She is thin, natural food and not particularly in the performance of the peak ... but it seems to continue and despite the same injuries that are typical of non-psychic characters in the film. <br /> <br /> DVD notes say we are sad and Creep, but I just see him shy. It is a very effective movie, but it has lost many opportunities that make me sick.
