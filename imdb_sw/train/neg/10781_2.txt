In fact, it was never. I do not know why Billy Crystal wanted to restore comedy 1940s screwball. What a mixture is enough! None of these people near Cary Grant, Spencer Tracy, Katherine Hepburn, etc., and yet, the present audience is not receiving this easily. Writing is small. The hackneyed way is a thin beard and obvious. Chemistry among the leading characters does not exist. It is interesting that Julia Roberts seems to think she is a reincarnation of some great star from "the golden age of Hollywood", whenever it can be. It is the effect she tries and can't reach again with Richard Gere in Rudeway Rudeway.
