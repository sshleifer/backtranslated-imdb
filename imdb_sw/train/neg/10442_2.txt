All of the internet buzz aside, this movie was very bad. I expected the movie to be more farce than anything. Instead, the creators of the film tried to make a great film of fear / fear, and they missed it all. There was just a good place, and a few nice lines with Samuel Jackson. Other than that, it was a gang of snakes and bad snakes. All joking network was better than the real movie. Now that the movie has come out really, with hope this joke will die. Do not waste your time or money on this piece of hyped waste. If you're looking for something that is exciting and entertaining, then just go to Snake on Blog.
