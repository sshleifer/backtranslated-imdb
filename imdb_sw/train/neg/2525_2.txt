This movie was, like Homer Simpson would put it, "it's more boring than the church." Maybe I don't understand well, and I thought it started very well, but after (START OF SPOILER) Hermann Braun was sent to prison and Maria began to work / sleep with her boss just began to pull, and I tried to keep an eye on. Again, maybe it is an example of something, but the explosion at the end seemed very forced and out of place. (END OF SPOILER). At the end, I can't see why some think it's so big, as I have seen it very boring. By the way, I did not watch this film at my own discretion, as I needed to see it in the movie class.
