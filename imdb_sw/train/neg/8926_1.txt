I saw "Myra Breckinridge" when it came in 1970. I was 20-year-old, who loved movies and loved the Welsh Raquel. On top of that, I had read the Gore Vidal novel that was based on and thought it was very funny. I saw a movie on the local car and almost half way through I was tempted to turn my car car so that it could die to the monoxide poison and not have to see it all fallen by the movie ship. It was not "smart" or "trendy", it was great and inappropriate. All actors were voices of the deaf and the director did not have a little idea just what he did. Mae West's release was one of the worst choices in the film history. If one inspector here said, his role had nothing to do with the movie or book. Her character in the book is sexually assaulted by a young chest, which can not do to Bibi West. Oh, the plot has changed so he hits sex HIM up, very reliable from a 77-year-old woman who looks every day of her age. I would like to continue, but why? It was a bad movie. <br /> <br /> Bluto
