Gwoemul (Military) - Due to pollution in the river mutated animal animal goes rampage. The younger member of Park's family is being bitten by an animal, and it is for his whole family to look for him, before it is a recent meal. The bears, alligators of the highest size, the dragons of Komodo's drag crack, lots of votes. The article of the creature is my favorite type of film Horror. So, I longed to love the Army, but it was not there. There were three major problems: <br /> <br /> The first can be seen by looking at the IMDb this page / / <br /> Type: Action / Comedy / Drama / Fantasy / Fear / Sci-Fi / Thriller <br /> <br /> Many kind of damned. It made itself so much to be a comedy, and it was still very lighter with any true message (though it seemed to be trying to make some kind of information. Fighting pollution, fighting the US or opposing the government). The ceremony had been lost and confused in a mix-up mix with all other styles. Second, after the first monster attack is not happening around the entire film. The main family announces on finding one of them when the government of Korea and America, apparently, does nothing. And that's it, they run around, constantly blowing someone else, maybe for a comedy aid. This lack of action made my mind walk, and apparently also did the same for the director, if all the fibers of the conspiracy were not found (the problem of the problem of the American Americans has completely forgotten, and has never been resolved). <br /> <br> And finally, the film is political. It shows Americans to be stupid and evil, but will not give us the American and deeper characters than the cartoon villain. The opening section has the most fool of America vs Korean wisdom when. With Korean Korean assistant to ask his master, the coroner, not to pour the chemical into the Han River. The entire Koroner except cackles with caution if it commands the assistant to continue. Despite being a racist, it's lazy to make a film and no excuse for it. <br /> <br /> On the other side, the monster is good, a mixture of Relic and Deep Rising. Some of the effects of the movement are quite cool, and the first monster to expel through the reserve is much fun. There are also good shots in the film. Some of these remind me, in a strange way, of the Firefly's way (trembling cameras, out of focus on etc.). There is also a good place at the end, where the hero and the little boy has saved them in a family food shop. During the night and the snow is falling, the street lighting gives the light of the cold, but the food store has a warm light from it. Overall, I was desperate for this film. I would like to look forward to a respectful creature, and instead of me getting pseudo-political, panic-comedy lite. Viewing comments on IMDb I can't help but I think if this was American production would have been planned. Because it is a foreign flick does not mean that it is any good. There have been great movies from Korea in recent years (trilogy revenge and Fraternity, for example), but this is certainly not one of them. <br /> <br /> Once I have agreed with remake. Confirm guide, upgrade scripting and this can be a good film. As it is, it is not recommended for several hours of anyone's time.
