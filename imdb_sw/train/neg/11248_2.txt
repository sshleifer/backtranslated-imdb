A gave "2" instead of "1" (anger) because there is no denial that most of the images were amazing, many talent came into special effects and artwork. But that wasn't enough to save it. The "Sepia" hit, has been deleted the color of something made before most other movies. There is nothing new there. I can see there are some hints of hats on some old, old movies. OK. There is no problem with that. But the film should be fun and interesting, not something that makes you sleepy. <br /> <br /> The story line and the script of this film were bad, two characters of the direction. Decreased speed. Some cases were good looking, but finally, in general, it was quite boring, I could not recommend.
