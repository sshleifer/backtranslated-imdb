PENYEWA. This movie is a mess. It's a tragedy. Don't waste your time with this. I warned you! <br /> <br /> Acting, story, talk, music ... basically everything is over, it's very sad and proud. It made me want to give (if the discussion / acting / story did not do so, everyone was shot). You will feel like watching the comedy. The problem is, places that are thought to be funny are not even interesting. Acting, story, cinematic, you can feel everything is just trying the WAAAAY very hard - but never does. Normally every shot is canted, but so what? This movie just feels like a student film. Not surprisingly they photographed this for HD because it would waste more money to shoot this on the film. If you are easily distressed or as a bad acting, writing, editing, leading, perfect clich√©s, everything that is forced into your face, oh and did I mention a bad act? (in fact, not the whole act of the actor - it's director!) then I think you would like this film. <br /> <br /> I had to look at this for class. I would like to open it once if I could. If you still can't say now, I have this movie. It made me want to lose and get my time back ... at least I don't need to pay this garbage. <br /> <br /> Jeff Goldblum, you know ... The boy from Jurassic Park / Independence Day, is in this film but he certainly came down from that moment - accepting the role of the movie as a tragedy.
