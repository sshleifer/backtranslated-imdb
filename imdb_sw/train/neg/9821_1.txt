Not often I watch a movie that is bad like this. I kept watching, every minute hoping that this was just a joke to get it meant to be taken seriously. Well, considering as this application of nature type. It was a shame and a state of decay and clich√©d. If the film was made in 1920 (for example) and it had the quality of Hide & Search (string) in its leadership we think that the movie at the same time was ridiculous. If it happens, this film was made in 2000 and I haven't seen a film from the silent era that has a charm like this. <br /> <br /> Of course not for a great movie-goer. <Br /> <br /> [Haifa rating]
