I bought Bloodsuckers on ebay ago. I looked at the part and I found it very dumb. For most of the blood water at the beginning is very obvious - not to mention the "wind-around" voice. My friends and I made a small budget of the budget, and the effects have already increased this gun. In the amount of errors in this film, there are many ways to count. I knew one of the actors - believe it or not, was my THEATER teacher. HA! The final decision: Don't bother with this flick of "fear". <br /> <br /> 3 stars (out of possible 73)
