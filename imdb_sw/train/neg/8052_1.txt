I've sat through this turkey because I've never seen it, and because the column seemed like it was able. It was a gentle entertainment to a series of hurricanes. At the height of the storm, the wind is strong enough to blow the windows out of the house, but the back trees are exactly the same as the leaf is running! In fact, when the characters come out of the house, the hot sun seems to shine light. At that time, anything that the film monitors had come to be faster than the most stored rain in their film. As all the hurricanes are not like this, it will undoubtedly help our home insurance standards here in Sunshine State.
