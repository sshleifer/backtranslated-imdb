"It seems that many critics find the idea of ​​Woody Allen's disgusting game." And for good reason: they are a wooden frame and the attention of Bergman. And let's not children ourselves: critics were most supportive of Allen's Bergman desires, Allen's stretching charges against the contrary. What I have not found is this: Why Allen had been accused of the nature of Bergman's succession, but the proposed Brian DePalma was surprised to "delete" Hitchcock in his exciting / awesome films? From Robin Wood's view, it is a wonderful kind of snobbery of culture. I would like to agree with that.
