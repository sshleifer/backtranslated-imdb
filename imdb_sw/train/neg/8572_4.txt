The good story involves two young brothers of the city and their battles on family dignity. David Morse is a compulsory task, encompassed by a 'good' brother; Viggo Mortensen, a 'bad' boy, is an old soldier and a former defendant. As an actor (especially in his early years), Sean Penn seems to have planned his performances under Method. Turning the author of the first time with the director of this arti, an interesting player, does his script and characters through the same process, slowing down the walk to crawl (so we can find every creature with the option). This method can be interesting if there were three-dimensional characters keeping, but the photogenic Morse and Mortensen did not really convince you as a brother. Then, we look forward to more from the ancient fighters Charles Bronson and Sandy Dennis, who don't get a chance to come up with anything that is interesting. The image is balky and turgid surveillance, a false guide and a mixture of confusion (always planted in order to show extra art). Penn tricks and cameras show the eye of the talent, but they become angry. * 1/2 from ****
