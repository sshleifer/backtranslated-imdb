Slam Body (1987) is a flat out of the awesome movie. budgets The series, the direction is passes (at best) and writing and acting are crippled. But if you are in the old wrestling school (circa of 1970 to mid 80 ') then you will have to entertain more than the average audience. I should warn you, this film begins on ice. I paid two because I felt generous. This turkey "led" by Mr. St Needham. Roddy Star Piper, Tonga Kid and a bunch of scrub wrestlers and c-list executives (Dirk Benedict). <br /> <br /> The summary of this "movie" is about promota who wants to combine "rock rock" and fight. But they are others who do not want to succeed. There is more but I don't want to spoil for you. If you can abdomen the worst acting with the storyline, there are a few surprises close to the end for dead-hard wrestling fans. I would like to recommend to my worst enemies (and I mean).
