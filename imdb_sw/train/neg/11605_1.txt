With the first look of the plot identification I thought it could be a good film. What? Could I be worse? The beginning of the film makes it look like a freaks group got together and decided to make a small film budget. For the first 10 minutes you are not aware of the efficiency of cheesy, the terrible sounds and the special effects of god, but it becomes worse. About 20 minutes in it I was asking myself, "Was the conspiracy again?" I could only ask that question when I did not break out of laughter due to the shortage of this film. The main actor has to put one in mind and put it on the entire film, even though he had to go through love and hate and everything in between. The flashback area almost made me a bottle because it made me a second minute of photos from early in the movie. Now we are running in the middle of the film where they are trying to put an end to Morpheus from the "Matrix," though they are just doing a terrible job. The references are talking about "Star Wars" and the cookie words of fortune are very difficult. Now the end of the movie does not know that it is the end of the film because you really think the plot will eventually develop. The character of "Morpheus" dies, the only thing about the movie. Speaks a few words and a credit roll. What is this? No plot, acting evil, cheesy everything, can not get worse. Please, if you appreciate human stability, do not put this MOVIE!
