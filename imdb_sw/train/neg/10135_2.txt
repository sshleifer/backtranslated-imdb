I just watched this film on Starz. Let me go through a few things I thought could be improved; acting, writing, leading, special effects, camera staff, sound, and lighting. It was also seen if the authors had no idea of ​​the movie. It looks back in 2007, when the dollar was strong you could buy a high-top bomb that could have been seen for 75 million dollars. It seems you can fly from the United States to the Middle East for an hour. There was a very lesbian area of ​​random, which I had no intelligence, but it seemed like an attempt to lose more young people to see. The camera could vote for artists and jump on random screens. Oh, since his movie Steven Segal, it is known to be hell. All in all I title is up there with snakes on the Birds.
