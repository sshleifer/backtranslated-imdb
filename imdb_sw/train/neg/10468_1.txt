I didn't know what to expect from the film. Well, now I know. This was a really bad film. Screenplay, guide and act were the same. The story was ridiculous and stupid. The director can make a stimulating and thoughtful film, but he did not. I stood on my seat for the last half of the movie because it was so bad. What? Where was the aim of the film? Where were you in this film? Christians should fight this film instead of promoting it. It was made easily and lost my money. Don't see this film.
