It's Jon Pertwee who said "It's very hard to be funny but very easy to be silly". Well if that's PASTY FACES is "very easy". David Baker (as Director / Author of Screen) and his cast seem to be under the impression that comedy involves stealing scenes and style from the best Britcoms like LOCK STOCK .. and TRAINSPOTTING, using a completely developed script and jumping up and down talking too fast sounds loudly. Alan McCaffrey is suffering from this type of OTT performance but not enough to destroy the film because they do not have enough film to destroy. <br /> <br /> PASTY FACES is awesome on all borders especially for scriptwise. I could not understand why it ended the way you did, it seemed only to stop by a sudden and gentle way. Oh and other interesting mistakes are that you need a visa to visit the United States and a green card to work there - This film would believe you can turn off the airline and start a new American life without any permission - that you are still paid to donate blood in America - People I know The United States, and who donate blood to me to charge aid aid stopped several years ago - and that you can buy any kind of weapon from a gun shop. As far as I know the gun laws in the United States differs from the state to the state but there are no guns to sell the tank guns on the counter. So we have seen a negative view of America due to a non-fiction and oh so unpopular film. Maybe this is a revenge for BRAVEHEART a Hollywood view of Scots? Maybe, but this doesn't stop PASTY FACES from being a comedy artwork
