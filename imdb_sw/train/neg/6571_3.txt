When I totally disagree with one inspector who described Charley Chase if he did not, in this film it certainly is. It's a shame, if I suspect another viewer should just appear a few Charley Chase duds and assume the guy was not funny. Films like MIGHTY like MOOSE and WHAT PRICE GOOFY? is a very good chase films, so she can be really funny given good material. Unfortunately, in this film was not given at all. Even the usual slip is good Oliver Hardy as a foil is not any help because the primary basis (the boy wants to marry a girl but the girl's father thinks the boy is wuss) and gags are very poor. It's a shame, if I wanted to love this film but it couldn't. <br /> <br /> Ways, for those looking for Charley from mid-1920s up, you will be surprised if the Chase games are no glasses or mustache - and it looks very little like you would expect.
