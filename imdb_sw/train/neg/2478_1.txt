This movie is S-L-O-W. The biggest film was waiting for 'start'. The layout was unfamiliar, the script was colorful, the movie was colorful, the plot was sent, the budget was small (not all low budget movies are bad, but this didn't have any features for redemption) . The plan was used more by a vicious hunter, much less than a real Wendigo who made a very short end to the end of the movie. This itself was awesome as this 'Wendigo' was just a wonderful mix of tree and stag. Everything about the movie was impractical. The little boy's parents seemed to be worried and sometimes seemed to be completely blocked from their son. If this was under a bad acting or bad script I am not sure, but only strengthened my desire and weight level. <br /> <br /> There was no food for thought, nothing of pique interest. If you have a false or interesting feeling, this film was hit with pain, you can't take care of what happened at the end. Wendigo's landscape reminds us of a fascinating movie shown at the awards ceremony towards the end of 'Mr. Bean's holiday': an artistic and nonsensical movie, tries to be meaningful and meaningful, but comes as of engaging in an awesome and frightening. <br /> <br /> I never want to look at this again. I just watched it until the end in the free hopes that something interesting could happen ... but it didn't.
