Summer Holiday is a forgotten version of the music of Eugene O'Neill's Ah Wilderness and with such frames to change Broadway's music Take Me Together. In addition to Stanley Steamer's song, there are no other songs by Harry Warren-Ralph Blane that should be remembered and even one of them. It was right after the release of this film that MGM allows Mickey Rooney to go and think it was unfortunate. The film was made in 1946 and released in 1948, so Mickey was playing with Andy Hardy as a young man. He was too old for the age of 17 who was affecting the big ideas in the spirit of the boy's rebellion. Rooney made four films for MGM from 1946 to 1948, this, Killer McCoy's Roads of Crayd's Robert Taylor, Love laughs at Andy Hardy and Song and Music. All of them Rooney was playing an adult. Even in the film Andy Hardy, Mickey played an adult Andy Hardy returned from World War II. Why was he in this Louis B. Mayer only knows. The bad casting of Rooney makes the summer of the summer a worse time because in the past Ah Ah wilderness is stressed on the behavior of the father played here by Walter Huston. And in Broadway show Take Me Together which won the Tony's award for Jackie Gleason, the Great Man played his inbriated wife Uncle Sid here played with Frank Morgan and that is the central character. DeHaven action for Judy Garland as Rooney's sweet sweet and friend girl and Marilyn Maxwell has a girl show who gives Rooney adult education. In the previous play O'Neill has her as a prostitute, but this was Hollywood's Code so both Marilyn is getting young Rooney subed. <br /> <br /> Many talented people really had a hand in this one and did their best work, but summer vacation dies rather quickly in the winter season.
