This film is probably guided by Questions of Questions, for women and I encourage them to see the film instead. The film has two powerful things and it is, (1) a true (2) act of amazing, unworthy, picture. Besides, what is very striking is the endless stream of silliness. Lena Nyman should be the most angry actor in the world. He takes the very fool and all the dirt in this film, ... is not good. Compared with God's film, knowledge has been changed by ignorance. Without going too far on this issue, I would say that it follows from the difference between values ​​between the French and Swedish society. <br /> <br /> movie time, and place. 2/10.
