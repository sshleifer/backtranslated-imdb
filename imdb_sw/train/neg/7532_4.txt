What I love most about the short film of this woman is the inspiration of the theme - especially in "Living with Fun." This movie has a good start - a natural scene and the possibility of a wonderful cinema treatment, but it fails to succeed with the ecological dialogue of nature, good performances and much television. It is once again the most popular television movie. These ideas are beaten out that almost feel pat as a television business. But the feeling is good so we can't complain very much. I would like to see this director making a full-time animation and try and work with a producer who doesn't need too much transparency.
