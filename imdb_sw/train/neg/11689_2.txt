I have never seen any original Spike Lee film, as their trailers did not get my interest. I have seen, and praised Denzel Washington, and the work of Jodie Foster, and have their own DVDs. I was, however, totally disappointed with this film. If this film is any sign of the ability of Spike Lee as a director, my advice will be "getting a job", leaving a waste of time and talent of others. I wonder if some of the IMDb comments others watched the same film I saw. I can only assume, due to their review of the sappy lovelorn, that their Spike Lee service blinds them to the ban on this work. I only paid $ 2.50, in the second run of the "Run Run", and I still felt I lost my money. <br /> <br /> IMDb "page" Trivia "says all ... <br /> <br /> *" Shot in 39 days "- How can you expect a big budget" Blockbuster ", (like the voice of the instruments The story was promised, in a very short time? It is not surprising that there was a very weak performance and all of them. ”/> <br /> *" Ron Howard began to lead the film ... "- He can make this project right, with more time to do that, of course, though the writing was angry, solid it had some characteristics. \ t pride, which maybe even can't do a lot of it. (Hey Ron! Be sure to thank Russell ... Good phone!) <br /> * "Jodie Foster chose its part in three weeks." - And it showed! , who makes people's problems leave, was not as strange as a given script. Did you even want to be there? <br /> <br /> Other Peeves: <br /> <br /> * Wany how many banks will trouble coming to the door, and inform the uniform officer that they were inside to steal the bank, and would be better to keep ... or else? <br /> <br /> * When "Detective Frazier", (Denzel Washington), comes to the bank to prove that there is no corpse yet, how many banks, without guns, would be "leading" soldiers, (much less "allow" soldiers ) to return to the front door, let the police officer walk behind him? <br /> <br /> * Det. Frazier later claimed, to give the tenant "every reason to beat me." Why, then, in their short struggle, did not even try to hide the face of theft? That may be the answer he was looking for ... the thief could shoot him to prevent future identification. And why it took "Steve, Stevie, Steve-O", (assistant assistant), for a long time to come and help? I understand that these were not your ordinary bank robbers. They had a different agenda, and didn't want anyone to be used. But the fighters did not have reason to think that they could not. For them it was a very bad situation. Why, then, when two bad people came out "take pizzas?", They were not removed. (first of all, how many robbers would come out without using hostage as a shield? Is this a Spike Lee version of NY City, or SNL?). Taking them down would have reduced the number of the bad husband, planned their plans, and the remaining robbers would have left more. If not, there are at least a few bad guys. (To give SWAT something to do, or use them at home!) What department of police in the country, could allow Madeline White, (Jodie Foster), just go to the bank, and discuss the matter with the host, that shall they not bear witness against them first? He had authority, no government qualifications; and instead, this was after all, "ready" hostage conditions ... add one more? Why does the CEO of Christ Bank, Christopher Plummer, have destroyed the documents that were created long ago? Delete emotions! Diamonds, she could sell it. Who was the "sand", (character, not the actors), and the jersey of the jersey, that, easily, volunteered, and said he knew the recording was "100% Albanian", but still himself could not say ..... SIR! YOUR OWN! And his ex-wife! What "schlump" was !!! Both of them are totally unwilling. <br /> <br /> * When questioned suspects, why Det. Frazier, always bothering people who were clearly not part of the heist? (Ie - tell the old woman can go, and then could not, then could, then could not?) Give me a break! Who, after seeing the bank robbers claiming hostage wear flying suits, could not decide their escape plan included coming out of the bank pretending to be some hostage? Welcome to the end of the film, the false wall was shown to be built in the distribution room, behind which Clive Owens hid for "week" .... Where did the things come from? (drywall & studs). It was also thought that they cut into the sewage, so he could pull out. Bank employees had not complained about the smell, every week for a long time? Okay! After the debacle; since the documents "had fallen into the hands of the swindlers, what kind of" references "that Mrs White had hoped to get from the CEO of the bank, seeing that she was now aimed at accusing her, from her failure? * And the end, but certainly not the least, What and the “Glide of Electricity” which Denzel did? HOW TO STUPID? It was necessary to show "solve" him to bring these rights? The shopping cart, while trying to prevent the movement of the intestines! "Cheeee-Zheeee" !!!! <br /> <br /> Apart from an unusual plot, the lousy script; .. yada, yada, yada. <br /> <br /> We hope this will give you enough insight into the movie to help others decide whether they lose their money or not.
