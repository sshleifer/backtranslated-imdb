Detailed size, for-number-western (directed by the style of Andrew V. McLaglen, so is that any wonder?). Military Colonel Brian Keith plays with defendant Dean Martin, who has kidnapped Colonel's wife (Honorable Blackman, who has never found a niche after playing Pussy Galore in "Goldfinger"). Pig fights, bullets-out, stakeholder and Denver Pyle's role in helping ... in other words, absolutely no new or original. Speaking in monotone below, Keith gets dale and prostitute (something shocking after running on TV "Affair Family"), but otherwise this low-tax material loses Keith's talent. It is also bad news for Dino, who doesn't seem to care or care. The hack of hack, write poor and several attempts to dislike the humor of the lowest ball. * from ****
