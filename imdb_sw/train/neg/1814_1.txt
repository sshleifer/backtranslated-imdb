All these viewers see. I have seen many bad films over the years, I believe, and this vote! This is not just “very bad” to waste time to spend, but it is true, highly hilarious, emotional film. <br /> <br /> CHECK OUT tool of a white monster! Ours are looking for the "Spell-weaving" of Christopher Christopher! TOGETHER IN THE SHEER A ** INVOLVED TO SUN! in the sets of threads! <br /> <br /> This is one of the "European co-production". No wonder we have too many battles. I swear, some of the people involved with 'lost Kingdom Partners' do not know that they appear in the film! <br /> <br /> FACT! I originally looked at this film in Wales Those HTV at the end of one night when you were experiencing discomfort and insomnia. I had to follow a copy of a couple of weeks later to make sure that this was really bad. It is. Worse than Lee Majors in The Norseman, more interesting than all the films of John Derek, this is true, Kane's Citizen's garbage.
