Final Score: 0 (out of 10) <br /> *** Local traders (but who cares) *** <br /> <br /> Yes, it's ok: zero. And I rarely give 1's. Even for the most great movies I watch things like music, movies, ideas, it is humor, even a good speed to be as a focus on the possible score. Looking at its genera or subscribe. But there is nothing to redeem here. I can't remember sometimes the movie has taken me down and down the room when it's over. The only reason I made it to the end was because I didn't seem to change the channel - just sitting there bright, waiting to see what the stupid says would come and the next. It was like looking at snakes cutting the mouse. But let's be happy and take this child out alone, do we. First of all, there is no technical about "Obstacle" that works. All displays are the style of sitcom. Occasional photographs of all traffic on the road are ongoing at night. Music and logo, not only contributes to anything on the film - it's awesome. Not to mention it has nothing to contribute in any way. Acting is like a card as it comes, round and which goes to Amanda Peet (open "star" that has found this train has broken the green color) too. These guys, who think they are good friends, do not have more chemistry or a sense of purpose then as the director Peter M. Cohen fired them at the bus station bus before the shot. <br /> <br /> On the creative side, there is no original bone in his body. It has no thought. It shows us anything that we didn't see a thousand times before. The whole column, or "twist", of this film depends on the male-bashing and "idea" which capable women can play with men "as they play". Anyone, who thinks this is some sort of lost or in any way naturally never has never turned on the TV before. It continues, poor women are normal. Male-bashing is normal. It's not stealing anything exactly, it's worse: it's stealing from the clich√©s. I can't imagine women who are making films showing some women on a large scale and in this sense of contempt. It makes me to lease "In Men's Company" - or better yet, "There's Something About Maria". This movie wants to be "edgier" version of "Something About Mary" very bad you can see sweat. Movie does not know about women, men, dating, sex, or anything. Cohen is the only pleasure to regurgitate the story that has been indoctrinated and from other sex movies. On the other hand, the movie does not work as a satire, either because though it is excessive in which one can see it as "satirical" does not have the same fact in fact that it needs satires. He doesn't even know what motivates. Then there is talk, which is a little more then the characters shout for each other. Example: Character 1: "F ** k you" Character 2: "Oh, well f ** k you" (repeat) <br /> <br /> And below, something that can forgive all the other wise: There are movies many without plots, without good work, and moral characters and exit which have been interesting and so, have been good. "Those who were beaten" are not funny. Not for the second. It has no comic skills or time. The whole situation is completely deceptive, not any foundation of truth, especially enough to lose us. All actors are given in large quantities so that they can be implemented at the lowest level of common denominations. Just check the "marquee area", "religious area" of the hair gel. One of our heroes opens the medicine cabinet and sees the Mena (Peet) vibrator. For some reason the light shines down as if it received a holy grail. Why Cohen thinks men respond to this method for vibrators I don't know. While engaging himself, he throws us into the toilet and then tries to close his hands while, oh, Mena walks in it. Oh, my sides. But wonderful, people really love this film. Of course, people also love "friends" and the reality of marriage shows so I shouldn't be surprised. All this has a common thread however. "I was beaten" is a great witness to me that there is only a whole package of Americans who will laugh at any joke because it is about sex. They will like any show or movie (or think they love) just because it's about dating or relationships. The lack of any quality does not prevent these people. As people are taught to find white teeth and thin bodies to sell dentures and weight loss programs, it is also provided for blindness for everything dating / relationship related to sale at affordable prices, without, non-power TV, movies and any product . Special advice will be that when I die, because I have seen this film, I've got a loan to get 80 minutes of my life back. <br /> <br />
