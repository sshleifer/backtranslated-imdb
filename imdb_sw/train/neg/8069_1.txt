Unusual mystery and sound-sounding voice, "The salvation of the soul" is the most recent entry into the "dead and who live" films. Two young couples, Sean and Cassie and Matt and Annabel, are preparing to go to various universities, but before they share until they break the thanks, they attend one of the fling at a lave party in a burnt church in view of lusciously Annabel slutty (Eliza Dushku, aka faith, another vampire killer. Unhappy young people begin to pay more attention to Cassie (Melissa Sagemiller) for reasons that are never explained, and before long, the quartet will come out of the party. To drive in their SUV, you are not searched and then passed by inexperienced youth, who quickly and wisely makes 180 in the middle of the road, causing a serious and terrible accident if the SUV starts on the stick and gets into the River. Sean is killed (or is he?), And Cassie uses the rest of the movie to deal with loneliness and guilt (he was driving a car) when he was not haunted by the spirit of Sean or expelled by the uncomfortable teenager. An unspeakable lack of information follows if Cassie's mental condition declines, even to the most conclusive conclusion. So who is dead and alive? After ninety minutes of this purgatory, who cares?
