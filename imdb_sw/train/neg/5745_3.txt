This film was a recipient of the 1990s Best Film Animation College. In the last few weeks, I have seen dozens of electors and recipients of this award from the last 30 years and I think in fact that this film can be just worse - however not just the chosen but won! I think that 1989 should be just a terrible year for that kind. <br /> <br /> The film shows a group of characters who seem to be like Fester's Muslim-skinny. It seems to be a simple described data that is transferred using a stop motion animation. They are all the same - with similar faces, bodies and clothes. The only difference is that everyone has a different number given on their backs. They are all standing on a great platform that has been stopped, as with magic, in space. Everyone has a pole and they are also a box on the platform. The platform begins to spread slightly and by responding to men migrating on the platform's equitable effort. This continues and continues to continue longer. The only help from this problem is when one of them is doing the worst job towards the end, but it's not enough to make it fun to look at at least. In addition to possible stopping animation, this shortcut does not provide any interest to me .... NOTHING. The way, the shortest KNICK KNACK also came in 1989 and I don't know why it was not among the elect. It was much shorter and was better than any of the elect year or year ago. Perhaps the success of Pixar in previous years was caused by them, but KNICK KNACK is clever and so it is very easy to be criminals to ignore. Could Pixar not enter? This seems impossible.
