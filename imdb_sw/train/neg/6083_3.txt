Two types of movies we love are (1) west, and (2) movies from 30 or 40 years ago. We should love the Person called Sledge; BUT ..... <br /> <br /> But ... this picture is unacceptable, angry and stupid from the beginning to the end. Since there is no one in the story (good or bad) to turn up, no one has instigated doubts to keep the viewer interested. There is no solidarity between boys trying to steal gold, and there is no relationship between those trying to protect. Sledge has a good girlfriend, but there is no reason why she walks on a guy or why she wants to be in the same room with this pig no account. <br /> <br /> The film is also experiencing an intrusive and a symbol of gawdawful music, and from bad writing and bad leadership with Vic Morrow. In the last 30 films from Netflix or Video Vault, this was under the rock, the only true dud in the group. .
