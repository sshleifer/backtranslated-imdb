Marlon Brando had lost interest while doing this film. His performance as "Swede" is his worst work, and that's exactly what he wanted to be. He can not overflow. Rather, he does only in an extraordinary way and is very proud of his arrogant pride. The area where Brando climbs on the toilet shop is probably the worst, during the funniest in the movie history. When we witness the head-first fall into the toilet, it is hard to believe that we are looking at the same actor who made the star in the Streetcar Name named, on Waterfront, and the Godfather. <br /> <br /> I think the real question is why Marlon did like this in his later years. Was he a business business movie? Did he like to make a fool full and stupid? I think we will never know. But this film is used as an amazing research on what the wrong thing is about everything. In this magazine, look at his colleague, Donald Sutherland, trying to give his lines, embarrassing himself by accepting to participate in this success.
