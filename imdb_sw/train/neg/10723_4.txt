The spirit of an old woman is transferred to one of her followers to punish everyone involved in the destruction of her grave. The transformation of the soul makes the young man at a great speed even though he is like a mother. Directly, blood has been extracted from those involved in digging. To be as short as possible, the Curse of Pharaoh is quite enough. While the movie offers good ideas, the original (blood drink mummy, the transfer of the soul, the effects of renewal, the location of the hand stuck, etc.) and the shortest time of the sky, leadership and speed is the very definition of plodding. To make matters worse, the first 15 short film of the run of 66 minutes does not mention anything more than padding. I often go to these silent movies that are slowly decreasing, but Pharaoh's curses and my sick. Sent helps very little. Only one exception (Ziva Rodann is a bright spot only? Wanting a film would be more focused on its amazing behavior), cast it lighter like screens. Finally, I do not know who the idea is to keep the staff of looking at mummy in what appears to be pajamas, but it is looking proud, looking for pride to the creature that is supposed to inspire fear for the audience. Even though my negative views on the curse of Pharaoh, I will come to the level of 4/10. Not a good rating to be sure, but hospitality has been given all the difficulties I have with the film.
