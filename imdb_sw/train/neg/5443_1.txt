Unfortunately, I love Kristen Cloke and Gary Busey. But the director failed to keep this together. There are a lot of steps, many promises, but all comes from hokey. The director did not do his job. The promising step comes off. It seems largely emerging in a great film storage. This version of "Rage" (DirecTV is claimed as 1996) is certainly not worth the time to look at it. Another director would do a better job.
