I think Stuart Bliss movie the worst I ever seen. It was wrong with the plot of fun. I see the fact that the wife of the main character who left her caused a breakdown of the mind, but it became so stupid and incredible, after a while I could take care of all of the characters. The movie continued on a regular basis without anything surprising or surprising to add to the plot. Anything with Geiger's deal was a lot of time after Stuart began to open his wall to see what was behind him after he had confronted something that happened. <br /> <br /> Then there were cases of repeating the flyer, and the confusion he encountered. I was supposed to think that this film was dropped when I didn't recognize any of the participants. Make yourself a permit when this movie comes, read the book! You will be much better.
