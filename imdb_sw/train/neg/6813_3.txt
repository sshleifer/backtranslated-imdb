Jean Rollin artistic ignorance about vampires, visitors and immortality efforts. <br /> <br /> Women are beautiful and wonderful pictures. Negotiations do not. It's a mess of taste. Great look but as any example of a horrible film or thriller just bad. I am trying to think if we think we are afraid or not. At the same time is it set or not? Its amazing mix of films and fears that are not quite available and the best time to look at it never seems to be "meaning" anything, and through her it will not be so horrible even if a bullet or a regular sequence builds a frisson time well-deserved of engaging. Something to leave behind as a wall of those who have as naked women.
