Dakota (1988) was the first car of Lou Diamond Phillips. This film is similar to the film later Harley. There is a little different but all the same. I don't know who came first. I think it will remain one of the secrets of life. But both are troubled by "children" who are trying to return to life. Instead of this bike it involves horses. They are basically one movie and both are happy as hell. If you are a great L.D.P. The fan then I recommend that you look both. You get extreme input and lead from L.D.P. if you are a game then go to it. <br /> <br /> Not recommended, except for L.D.P. fans !!!
