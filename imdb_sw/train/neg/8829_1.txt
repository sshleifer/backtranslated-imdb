This is a bad piece of news-story. It's about an hour on a movie before we know the great idea of ​​what is supposed to be high; often the characters appear to be invisible; actions often seem to have no relationship between them; no one cares about who killed the real girl; A pair of young children go swimming in the water that seems to threaten but nothing happens; The Irish army is buffeted in the face with one of its partners because there is no clear ... continue to be boring as the movie itself. Only half of the entertainment feature is photography; but anyone can direct the camera to an Australian outdoor park to get memorable shots. In general - the dreary, incoherent, engaging - with the contempt of contempt for losing too much during the viewer.
