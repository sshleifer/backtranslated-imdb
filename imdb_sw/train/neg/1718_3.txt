I have read a few books about Bonnie and Clyde, and this is definitely more accurate than the Beatty / Dunaway version, for the dress and its areas reflect the actual picture of the group. Especially well is the death of Buck Barrow, and catching his wife Blanche. The impressions seem to look like the pictures taken on the day of Blanche wailing over her dead husband. However, this film is still Hollywood, and our heroes fight to stay pretty to the end, even after being shot in the holes (in life, Bonnie had been burned in a car crash a year before they became popular, and was not found the only player during his death). Script is exciting, and acting is poor, especially leads. Very disappointed. Keep with Beatty and Dunaway. Their may be a "true story," but it is a good film.
