I heard a lot about this movie how it was a good slasher and one of the first 80 movies that die for fans of the most slasher films that should see. Well, I used and I must say that although it has caught my attention away from the doubts of many films like "Day of the Fools of April", "Friday 13" and "Prom Night", this film would be right there above and mentioned above just didn't A real passion and ability from characters such as going to the story. The people I have seen were unfortunate that in this film is a boy of weirdo and beautiful hair that have continued around on the dorm and of course lead to its real climate climate at the end and he faces a killer. Another would be a dirty look for a guy and a jean jacket, he could play more roles on this film that might have made the film more interesting, instead, the film played this guy like someone else who lost out there making unknown calls while sleeping with His lover and then jumps to his part and beat him to the end that was desired, I was desperate in his last place. Apart from the true identity of the killer goes, when the identity was given as he was, I laughed, but it was all obvious and actually made a true jerk from himself and the terrible behavior after his real purpose was revealed. This movie should be one at least looking at once for all the fans of the slasher but do not use your hard money on it in some rare hard to find inventory inventory.
