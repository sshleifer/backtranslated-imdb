I still can't believe that Wes Craven was responsible for this piece of film. This is worse than "Death Friend". The program is ignorant, acting is pleased with the film is very bad. I don't know why Wes Craven hates its start "Last House on the left" - with the ultimate hub of the type and likes (probably) this Turkey. .
