I usually do not have the courage to write a review. But this film was very bitter I see it necessary. I broke into a predictable plot, a cripple made and laughed when it had to be time. Indeed most of the spectators seemed pretty tired and chatty even when "more time" of the movie. Molly Ringwald stood up as an exceptional characteristic of any quality in the production. Even "misleading" at the end was not. I have heard it says that movies are not focused; but I could find little evidence that in the film. Cut you should be left on the floor of the cutting room. Make yourself a permit and use your time and money for something else!
