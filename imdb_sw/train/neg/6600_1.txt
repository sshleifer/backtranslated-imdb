Come! If anyone who likes Laurel and Hardy can watch this film and feel good, you are a better person than me! This film, while a great attempt to 'emulate' Laurel and Hardy through the appearance, voice and order, becomes too short to respect them, or even become a film of any substance. I blame Larry Harmon. The debate was broken down from old L + H movies and planted in an unusual way, the plot is full of inappropriate stars of other unwanted stars, Pinchot's inspiration was amazing for Stan, and when Sarta did a good job with Ollie's attention, he tried also difficult to create a wonderful mix that was Mr. Hardy. Where was the music number (good)? Editing is choppy, acting is hard, the lines are rough, physics is-impossible- (though perhaps they were TRYING to provide so feel of a cheap set?), And generally it's a bad thing to witness. It is more difficult to look at ATOLL K, where the story of the story made their last film in the bad 1950s and photography. Are you interesting and look at the amount of Laurel and Hardy's ORIGINAL films as you can, and learn how things were. You know what MAGNATE is, aren't you? Stan Laurel had no regular response to semi-moronic quips in each sentence. I feel sorry for anyone who thinks This was a disgrace for boys. WHAT IS THE DAY OF THE DAY? Why damage 'Here is another good mess'? Why are you flying 'any wisdom'? Why was there no sense of co-stars? WHAT IN THE MISS'S FACILITIES WIZARD OF OZ? WHY DO YOU MAKE YOUR WAY? Why BOZO! And does the CHANNEL Learning Learning Center help support this? I mean, really. Fart's joke, for God. JOKES FART.
