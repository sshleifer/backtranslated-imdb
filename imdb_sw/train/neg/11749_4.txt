Phil Alieni is one of the existing films where humor depends on the destruction of everything rather than real punchlines. At first it was odd and strange but if the movie continued I did not get a joke or printing again. <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <3 /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> </> I think this film will appeal to the stones that he now shares. <br /> <br /> For the same thing but better try "Brother from another planet"
