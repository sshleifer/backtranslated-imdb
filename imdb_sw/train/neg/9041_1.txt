I loved the film despite the frenzied speed. But, I did not accept the views that Canada was called Montana Montana. It is definitely NOT North America and never will be. Americans are wondering why they seem to be proud in the whole world, and that is one reason. Stop teaching American children to think their own planet. The centrist's world view is not one of the world's major states. Even with surprise. I can never mention the United States as 'Alberta South'. Walt never put us, why not start now. Other than that the film was good goofy, good luck next time.
