... the actors of the children liked. It also seems that the creators of this film were trying to fill in 90 minutes. A vision of good death, though. If not for the events of death, this film would have a very impression of Disneyish. The main protagonist of the child was not seen as afraid if he should be. If I was in the middle of a forest with a kind of self-murder of a fairy individual, you can beat your ass I can't walk around and run my bike. Overall, I have seen the worst (ie Waiting) but it's not something I could look at, or suggesting anyone who bothers you unless you are a sharp player.
