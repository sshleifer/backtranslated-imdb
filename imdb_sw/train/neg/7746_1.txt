In fact every aspect of this flick of the science fiction budget falls under the categories that have been set by its predecessors, time, and those who follow. Serious side effects, weak storyline, amount of blood ignorance and gore, bitter and useless characters, all you can expect. "Attack of Sabretooth" is about a new resort of holidays where owners are engineering genetically Smilodon cat for gravity. Cat escape and start killing people, the boy who witnessed the show wants to protect and warn visitors who are not interested in them, and there is a port of visitors and other workers who rebel and plan to kill the cat. <br /> <br /> Special-wise effects, the film is on the average achievements issued its budget. Sabretooths are shown through poor CGI. Surprisingly, however, the cat is more visible in the real shooting, closer than the long shots, far beyond the CGI is well hidden. Their attacks are caused by bloodshed and anxiety. As you expect, they are attacking, breaking arms and legs, and leaving very little back. This is part of the reason why the film comes from the bad schlock. <br /> <br /> The program and characters are such as awesome. We have college children who come to the island and prepare a necklace. And take it so much, too much. Even more than personal property, decreasing security systems, and stealing. Why take a simple game seriously? What? I lost something? Was there money? Or were they sent to do so? I don't know, I could follow the film. But it seemed to me if they were just doing it with pleasure to do it. However, they went too far. <br /> <br /> "Sabretooth Attack" is a very bad film. Even with the flick of the low budget, it is a very bad and cheap model. It will bring many viewers with tears, it may be interesting for some, and it will make you laugh and laugh all the way. And remember, this is not comedy, this is a cheap comfort panic, so it's not thinking to be comical.
