I am still trying to determine if this is true, the worst films I have seen - a very troubling problem with this film is that real scientists are being interviewed, but their pictures have been edited to make it look like many BSers' ideas that live in this film. The BS sign of the interview is almost one to ten thousand - at the end, respondents seem to say, "We want you _think_ !!", but they themselves are very lazy to make a simple study on what they say as fact. If you feel that you have an open mind, and want to broaden your knowledge, please be willing to open some real books on quantum theory: "Einstein World", Nigel Calder (less, is not a challenge), "Code Cosmic", and Heinz Pagels. If you are unable to read the book, please do not complain to the counselors about being "open mind". <br /> <br /> To restore, this film is just bad. <br /> <br>> Do you know what beautiful film that asks the state of reality? "Thirteenth floor", headed by Roland Emmerich, and Craig Bierko, Gretchen Mol, Vincent D'onofrio. Smart, sexy, stimulating ideas.
