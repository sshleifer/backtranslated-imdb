I never had to walk out of any film (a private policy that made me suffer through different types of dreck, such as Rambo 3, Baise Moi, Deep Impact) - but Mr. Seidl almost succeeded. Hundstage was a very bad experience. Anyone who sees this film will think that the Austrians are a sad, sad group. It shows the world where love and humanity is not existed, a world where people interact with one reason only - to mislead them because of their sad existence. By choosing the style of the document and non-academic practitioners (most of them seem to be directly from the idea of ​​the Austrian photography director Deix) Seidl wants to make us believe that this is real life in the Austrian suburbs (Europe? West?)? . The viewer faces sexual images, violence against women and people with disabilities, madness and destruction. But this is not social opposition. This is a fresh shock without any testing value. Instead you get a bad act, a movie of bad movies, the effectiveness of bad films. If someone needs a film like this to realize that there are bad things in our society then this person must go through life with closed eyes. This is a pseudo-social resistance to a hack of sledge. And it looks down to people in a pleasant way to ignore. It shows bad people - that's not the reason I like it. But it shows the average people in a bad way, of misanthropic. And this is why this film is despicable.
