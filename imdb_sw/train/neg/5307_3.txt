What happened? 'Of course' he was most likely to be a brilliant film - but instead he lost it and inserted a simple line of line that made me stop watching. The only thing the film was going on was the beauty of Meryl Streep, who no DOUBT deserved the Oscar selection. Although it was not one of its best performances, it still gave us a strong and realistic character that stayed through the screen. However, even the beauty of the screen story can save this film to the bottom of the hill. From the beginning of the boring, which had no power or punch - to the bottom of the end, the film was really disappointing - especially given that it provided great potential through the promotion and its tractors. It was obvious that the director had difficulty with the simplicity of the plot and ended up with a stirring film, which was created for a very long time, with a lot of conversation and insufficient action. <br /> <br /> Additionally, other Oscar-selection were under the influence. Although Philip Seymour Hoffman gave good performance, he did not mean Oscar-worthy. (Especially since they left entirely exhibitions such as Will Smith, in seven Pounds). Amy Adams is not eligible for selection. Watch Amy Adams was like watching a cardboard card - as it was on one side and open. It would be more important to appoint Razzie, if I am sure she could move forward. Viola Davis gave a short but realistic performance, but the length of his performance made me question whether the school would have given him a decision. Overall, I doubt that it is one of the most desperate films of the year 2008. It was a very high-resolution film, and I do not recommend. The only light shining in the film is Meryl Streep, who gives good performance, non-power - even doing enough to save this film. *** / 10.
