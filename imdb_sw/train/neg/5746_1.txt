About the worst films in the distribution right now! I love zombie movies and I found this in a rack used so I thought about why? Oh my god shy for zombie movies and fans for genre! Anyone who made this film needs to stop your camcorder and go to the film school! There is a lot of hounds out there who have set time and effort in their films and have something that this film does not respect. I know what it takes to make a film and I am sure there was a lot of money and time spent in making the Meat Market but there is no money and that time it went in to do it well. You need administrators, script, real camera, invest in some books about how to make a free film. I do not know how you got the DVD but anyone who did that is a very good friend or a head on the wall. In the film of gore is quality is not much, the effect is weak! I was very angry that this was true in the shops and that I couldn't get my money back. Please if you have seen this film write here and finish the shlock. I know I am very aggressive, I only had 10 lines and so I try to reach the point.
