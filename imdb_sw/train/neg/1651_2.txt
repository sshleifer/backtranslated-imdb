Invalid script written by invisible characters. Since it is a comedy, I forgot to laugh. It is about two fun friends who are trying to get women in their bed with them (no sexual events) and another friend (who is a very favorite-half) who sometimes also claps but especially is considered a man who works. 3 friends meet and fall for the woman (Amanda Peet). In this way it has been done without any love. 3 boys stop being friends as they did. He destroyed them out of their friendship because they despised women. - The bad movie
