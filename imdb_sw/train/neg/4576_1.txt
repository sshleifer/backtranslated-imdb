At first glance this document / fiction / cartoon is quite entertaining and stimulating thoughts. Of course, when something that stimulates thoughts, it can be investigated. The fact is that this film combines metasiksiki with conclusions and non-core conversions. Link that "What Bleep ..." you would like to see between science and spirituality is, in fact, not rooted in science at all. The Transcendental reflection study mentioned in the film claims that meditation by the group could reduce crime in a particular area, Washington D.C. in this case. In fact HRA (Homicides, Rapes, and Assaults) crime rate was about 30% in 1993 than the crime rate between 1988? There was no shortage at the rate of death during the study. In fact, every claim that connects metasikicics to science can be damaged. My end result from this information is that this film is an attempt not to include people or jokes. Any way, I cause you to lose your time. If you are looking for a long-standing film about science that can cause a move, you can think of Mindwalk (1990).
