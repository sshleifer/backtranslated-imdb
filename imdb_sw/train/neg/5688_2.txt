Short version: Seed is not meant. It's just derived from inferior. And normal. Older Edition: If you have never seen any films that describe an uninterrupted "psychological fear", this film may be remembered by your face. Maybe not, but it will give you a good burn. The opening of the real abuse of animals will be enough to open your eyes to the possibility of violence-on-video, and the event (only) memorable future later in the movie maybe more than you can handle. This session will play with your emotions in a way that no other film has. But that's like you don't have much experience with that kind. If you have seen the real thing ... "August August of August," for example, you, as I did, is very difficult to stay alert until the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Other Viewers have compared this to old video videos. I understand this comparison. As the video holds, "Seed" is more violent than the most common and non-mystical film. But the reason for the video which is still known to us not only for high reasons - those who are still distinguished were something special. Give me permission, I think you will understand: those who have stuck around were "soul". <br /> <br /> Take this quote from Gabriele Crisanti, director of "Ground Ground," on an interview on a new -ish DVD: "... we will not have more films like these, because today, technology has passed and the technology is cold. many things will be destroyed because such small films will not be reproduced again. The biggest tricks, which are very expensive, but are cold.Today, the terrorist film of this kind gets more than $ 1 million. very expensive ... is the real effects, made by our hands ". <br /> Maybe it's wrong to take a comparison with the fear of the old school seriously. But Crisanti has hit the nail on the head. Even in those who seem to volunteer, the best of the video was looking for the first "truth". And this is where Boll declines. It's like the movie and he didn't understand it. Everything in the list there is ... BS on "reporting on humanity," the terrible suffering of the area, etc. But it is like Crisanti says, "cold." Gore is all CGI. The whole thing feels like events organized together from other movies. And pacing is sooooo slow. Man, very swift <br /> <br /> Remember another amazing note: one scene of the cloud reminded me of a video game. <br /> <br /> However, BS is not enough. Falling movie.
