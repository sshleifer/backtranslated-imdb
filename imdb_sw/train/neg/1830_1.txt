this is the worst movie I've ever seen. I'm not kidding. the next time it comes, I will always keep my head in the wall. I would like to enjoy more staying in an emergency room trying to explain to the doctor why my brain is burned than trying to make it through this film again. <br /> <br /> I hope that black and player do not work together on this bad project again. they are both good comedians, so I was shocked this was wrong. If they had to do it again, I am sure they will decide to do so. The people who passed the money, should have lost tons. not really - because special effects (both) were bad.
