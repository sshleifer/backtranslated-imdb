This show is bad. no comedy, no plot no good characters. America is blind to award awards for real performances. I hate this show with a rock 30. honestly I am very happy to have deleted this show. thank CBS. keep two and a half men, put Christine, setting rules of participation to keep how I meet your mom which is not really funny but funnier than this. This show is a rip of friends. and the same director is the same. but show this show and don't put it again. never forever. The only reason I have not given 1 mark is because it continues to remember instead of sleeping. These are a variety of movies or TV shows that I offer one. The only reason I was still awake because of the laughter of the audience and I was looking forward to the show. I would really show this was sad but my opinion is stupid. very foolish. I don't see why everyone likes. my opinion again. but I also get a big bang theory kinda stupid. my bad smart. class but bye now I have a smile and not from watching your show.
