This movie was so bad, temporary and stupid that I had a bad time to look at it until the end. I had seen that Rodney's death in Natural Born and I thought he was like hell in it, but this film went up. "Jokes" were not funny, participants were not funny, anything about it was not even far funny. Don't waste your time on this! Only good things about this were his good :) and Molly Shannon who I have really tried the best, but the script was very bad. That's why I was rated "2" instead of "1", but it is obviously one of the worst films I've ever seen.
