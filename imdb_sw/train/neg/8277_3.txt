This may be unreliable, but this film has got $ 878,138 in Russia! It is shown next to all movies and still runs! Well, I don't know why distributors keep their eye on this special "movie", which did not have a closer look around the world. That's some kind of trouble! Haha! Perhaps it was according to the fact that the other film, "This Pledge" and Paris Hilton, which also released the DVD only around everywhere, had an extensive investigation in Russia and worth more than $ 1mln. Besides, both movies had great promotions, if there were posters around the world, TV shows and etc.. Speaking of the film, I would say it is light and very sad. It can be better, in fact. Even if it has Jessica Simpson.
