What desires, especially due to the budget provided, technical resources are available, and the talent gathered. Is not the basic principle of science fiction / drama in order to create in the audience stopped ready for unbelief. POA 2001 creates an interesting start, welcomes us, but later Mr Burton admits that his travelers have a sense of work. On the libertarian on Helena Bonham Carter's chimpanzee, the deficit of the human area, the ease of escape, their extraordinary skills of unusual (this is an astronaut and a group of ordinary people riding a perfect tilt), a great and almost human rebellion of all is not trusted. Mark Wahlberg never ever makes any realistic, dangerous or coming projects in this world turned down. Comparison with nature, which the nakedness of Chuck Heston was carried out by its deception and surprising in its time of events. Wahlberg securely maintains its gentleness, but also its clear view of management and control in the nature of wacky nature, and we can never wonder about its welfare. Unlike Heston, he seems to be in real danger. Tim Burton should use some f / x budget for a particular screen. In fact, after this inferior fiasco, I wonder why Hollywood manufacturers once suffered to deal with threats of directors and directors. Let them walk. The monkeys taught can do just as they did on the Planet of Apes 2001. I will repeat the review of this effort. It can be a new franchise, with a new new stage for thought. Another lost space.
