I am a Christian who generally believes in theology taught in the left. What I said, I think Left Back is one of the worst films I've seen at some time. To have a good film, you need to have a well-written screen. Left Then fall for evil on this. For one thing, it is largely from the book. Sometimes this is done to freeze the 400-page novel to two-hour film, but in this film I saw a change that had no meaning. Something else, there is the development of zero behavior. When the characters in the story are saved (I will not say), the book shows that it is a long process of seeking soul. In the film is fast and fake. The book was very well written where people like Rayford Steele, Buck Williams and Hattie Durham seem to be real, but in the events of the film they are given fast treatment without anything big. In another area where one character is offended on the left back (again, I will not say), it seems to be fake. I know as a Christian includes I say I didn't like this film, but I can't have a good conscience to suggest a film I don't feel was awesome. Perhaps it would be better to make the first book in 2-3 film. In any way, Christians need to realize that being taken seriously as film makers, we need to start by putting the film together in the best way. I realize most efforts probably entered in the left behind, but that's what I see.
