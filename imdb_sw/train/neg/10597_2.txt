This film was quite awesome. I can't imagine one good thing about it. The holes of the conspiracy were too great to run the Hummer through them. Acting was so bad that even Jean Claude should be embarrassed, and that says a lot! And talk, What is the discussion? To think that I was the first fan (I use these views freely, more like the pleasure of guilt, than anything else). This movie was with Goldberg in it with a loud voice! Nothing can come to this film. What makes this film even worse is that it is so bad you can't even watch it with a group of friends to please !!! This should be in my five worst movies all the time. 2/10 because it is very difficult for me to give 1.
