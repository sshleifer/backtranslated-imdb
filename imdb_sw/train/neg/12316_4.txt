Director Jonathan Lynn has made some of the past comedies, like 'Mjanja' and 'Clue'. This is not one of them. More than the 'Police Academy' film than its inspiration, star Steve Martin in the role of Phil Silvers played a role as an army of permanent hosting under the nose of its heads. But the good life of Bilko and his lazy gray is seen when the former enemy visits the basis of deciding to capture Bilko in the act. Nothing happens, really. It is all quite lightweight. It's not very funny. Martin, Dan Aykroyd and Phil Hartman are retired with great effort, but they are all better than this and are very painful to look at working with thin material.
