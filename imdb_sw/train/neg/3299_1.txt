This must be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I was looking at a bad movie but I failed to surprise it or not. The story of the story is traditional, all the clichées are included. The talk is very inappropriate that it laughs when other semi-natural actors are trying to make it real. The picture is not very good, the music is actually malplacée makes me angry, the artists do not try yet, the script makes it impossible to expect more from people who have been doing for 30 years and the action called scenes actually manage missing "action" itself. <br /> <br /> I don't understand why these kinds of bad movies continue to come, who is this money shit? Where is the investigation? And why on earth makes executives take this impossible script script? There are millions of cinema movies in this kind without even wanting to achieve movies, but even good video clips can look at a professional by comparison. I can't say anything positive about this unless the head tells you all, I feel stealing for two hours of my life.
