I saw and loved the first two times, in fact. Especially because the second is not just trying to make another be as good as the first. And it's a story standing alone. You don't need to know the first movie. I loved being in "Free Willy" films, too. <br /> <br /> But ... third, here is absolutely free! I tried with my friend, because we both liked the first two. We decided to stop after half an hour. The movie is the same, there is a funny part in it the same. But why? Timon and Pumba were amazing creatures in the first two movies. What the King of Lion 1 1/2 is for me is: the hardest effort to get more fun than the first movie than it was already, with telling stories from their perspective. But why? I would like to know the truth. You know, the idea of ​​two of them sitting on the cinema first look, it's very good. But what follows next is very important. I think many people liked Timon and Pumba, and so it is true. However, for me many parts were very built and try to be funny. No chance, most of them were not quite funny, at least for me. Btw. What was the movie about it? Was it about Timon and Pumba or b) trying to get more fun from the first movie? I tend to choose the option b and I am very disappointed about it. <br /> <br /> If you would like to see stories like: "story behind xy", you should see "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead" by Tom Stoppard and Tim Roth and Gary Oldman. That's very funny and no trying to get more from "Hamlet" then it has.
