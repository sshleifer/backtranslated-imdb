As a fierce fan of Cary Grant, I expected to watch this film and mourn with laughter, as AMC claimed as a comedy. I have never been more disappointed with the film! Cary's charm of common and comedy quest is AWOL from all this movie; he comes as a burden, bored, and not himself. Mississip's attitude among one of the worst discrimination I have ever witnessed - its emphasis is very serious (and not correct, according to what part of Mississippi he claims to be from), and whenever he presents a line, it is several decibel higher than any member another cast. Mississip tried to put himself in the film as a favorite goofball, a country-bumpkin, but ultimately can only prevent a weak plot. Mansfield looks more like a doll blowing blow than a kitten's sex Hollywood, and when it is not known in Hollywood for its acting ability, this film screams that she did not have the ability to start. Ray Walston's behavior was sugar and was eventually developed. For the four men who survived the shore, it was the departure I had ever seen. I expected this dream to the end, and when I could not destroy it to anyone, I will tell you it is the most sad thing you will see. The film tries to stimulate patriotism and debt feelings for fighters men, but the film is totally wrong because of the weak line of the plot and cast. Sorry, Cary!
