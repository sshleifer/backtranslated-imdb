(destroyers) Wow, this is bad. I took two times to watch the old Star Trek day one day - it was one where everyone was infected with the disease and then going to a little nuts - and there was Stewart Moss, the invisible "hero" of Life and Night! He played the first to be infected, who dies from the last depression. All I could think was that she could watch her own movies often, that's the reason that caused depression. This film is full of uncertain people. There is no liberation behavior in the film, not one. It is very difficult to feel bad about Dr Beck's turning on the bat (or whatever he changed), because you just don't like it. And you don't like his wife's wife, or Sgt's wife. Ward, or Dr Mustache Love ... Why can you invest at any time or energy in this movie? Where there is no understanding and characters, there is no reason to worry about it. Not to mention horrible pictures, which have been seen as the film through the urine, with five special effects, many of which have been found to be the pieces of paper thrown into the fan to imitate the type of bats flying. It's not the worst films I've ever seen on MST3K, but down there in the bottom columns, obviously.
