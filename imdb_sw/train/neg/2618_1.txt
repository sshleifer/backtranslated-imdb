... because this was so bad. The people of Dalari were funny even if the formulaic, but this is nothing more than drier drivel. The same attribute except the story translated from him; macaw of an intelligent and horrible world; Tim McInnerny indicating that he can not make a comedy (always remembers Percy in Blackadder but that was his top spot - it's all been downhill since then); The worst trend that as a group of university students did so would like to throw it into the bin and tell them to do it again - well this time. Ieuan Grufford better return to Hornblower bright, while Glenn Close and Gerard Diepardieu should hide for several years. Maybe I would be too strict; after all I do not manage to sit through the entire film. Get 1/10; just because I can't give 0.
