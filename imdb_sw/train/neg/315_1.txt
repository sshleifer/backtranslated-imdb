Watching this stinker is a cruel and odd punishment in the hands of the Sandler. In fact a slow and painful death. <br /> <br /> 'You buy a DVD in bin $ 5.88 at Wal Mart. But the idea that continues to shake my head is, "How can I get my money?" Something not to be forgiven on the film is that the boat is not recommended! <br /> The best advice: Theater of the Comedy Theater. You know that display on SciFi Channel in which someone else and his machine of the puppet destroys the mysterious fricks of Mystery Science Theater. IMMEDIATELY, delete the comedy program and add this flick. Without a good spoof of the humor of the fall of this train, I am afraid that viewers can really follow Sandler and ice procedures and chain. <br /> <br />
