I am A.S.L now. The student was obliged to watch this film in the class, and what I came out of was a wonderful part of the film. The film is headed for P.O.V. the "common view of the deaf" they are not in the middle. Also, the film did not mention mentioning or considering other situations that are also under discussion on this topic. I.E. Deaf people who were born to hear and later went deaf. What? Is it right or wrong at that time? The film is proposed by almost all of the non-W / capital "D" view. It's not that this is bad, but since the true film of the document must try to have a little unbiased.
