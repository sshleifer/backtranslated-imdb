Considering the possibility of this argument was, the reality was desperate. Although there is always fun to see Jennifer Aniston on the film, even that could not turn here. Most of the act was expected. Jokes were flat with a gentle amusing. And the characters were not very interested. I wanted to love this film, but it never happened. Ben Stiller was a carpenter in "There Is Something About Maria". Here it looks like he's just going through that way. If they have to raise the points of conspiracy from "Friends", they should know that something wrong. Toilet humor should stay in the closet :-). See "Date 50 First" instead.
