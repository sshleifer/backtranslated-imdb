This is a very bad brain damaged, ultra cheap, super stupid, silly, masturbation has never seen me, a wonderful garbage of an instant cult situation among wonderful fans. If you think "Ed 9" Ed Wood is bad, well ... I would like to tell you, it looks like "Kane's Men" compared to that. ? Special effects? ... again, "Plan 9" is "Star Wars". What does he do? ... Thor Johnson is Al Pacino ... so it's more bad, in fact. But if you're looking for that kind of amazing movies, it's for you! I am an American American fan for many awesome movie titles, Como-Corman-Poe movies and many analytical items, but with "Star Creatures" descending to Z. level. work for reverse if you like to watch bad movies for fun (the boy who plays the Indian leader is good) so enjoy and enjoy ... if you can.
