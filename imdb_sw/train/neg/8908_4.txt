This series is CBS networks to answer to the success of the Big Valley. It was just West 90 minutes if the ABC program was. Although it was the answer, it did not have anything to do in the last season. The problem was actually lost on this show. For example - in one place, Johnny gets his eye with a stick. Surprisingly, at the end of the show, Johnny was completely healed. However, the story about this is not close to the power of the Basin Valley. <br /> <br /> This is a show that I do not want DVDs, & hope the truth they will never be given. Think since CBS lost the ballot, they used the usual settings. This was one of the western CBS series conducted as west was not very popular in the 1970s.
