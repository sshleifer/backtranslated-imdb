In U.S., very small films have been made in Rome that were not placed at the time of Julius Caesar or shortly thereafter. Hollywood's swords and sandals had a Christian theme, which makes it difficult to find the original Roman history (Spartacus was perhaps the first of this law, and met some resistance to Hollywood because he did not have Jesus in it). <Br> It is interesting to see at least one picture that not only happens before the time of Caesar and Christ, but it was installed when Rome was the only one city in most of Italy, and had dismissed the hated Tarquin king and created the Republic. However, this is not a historical film; is a peak, and when production values ​​are not under the rock, acting and character is a cardboard. I can only think what the conversation was in Italian, but in the English wood dubbing is a very campy. I liked the first time. I haven't seen many of these films, having missed many Hercules movies in 60 years. It is exciting to action, but as the film goes on, it gets boring. One thing is certain: if I would like to see this movie when I was ten, I would like to love it. At that age, I went to anything with the Romans and the fighting of the sword in it. Therefore, at least this returns to childhood records.
