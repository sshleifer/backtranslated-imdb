No words can describe my great hatred for this bad version of the BTK killer. Evaluate this film one out of ten compliments this true excuse for film. From beginning to end, there was no one to show. Anything was put together; script, act, plot, lighting, manual, ACTING, realistic description, ACTING, by name only. Several events speak out-of-the-sound, through the anger that the whole thing is put together. This review can be seen as an informal and surprising attack on a small budget, but this is not. Just think about the movie I saw only makes my blood start to boil. How this film was given the rights to production I never know. I am almost tempted to actually recommend BTK, because it's actually stand out on how pathetic, and disturbingly bad it is. I can honestly say, in all my years of film-going, this is WORST. MOVIE. JUMA. I lost one hour of my life on this improper rubbish, and unhappily I would come next to a nearby building, I would know what I was. ZERO out of TEN.
