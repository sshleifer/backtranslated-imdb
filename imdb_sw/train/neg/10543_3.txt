The only thing that the First Power is really going to is is that it gives Jeff Kober the opportunity to play one of its most beautiful psychologists who have done well in the last 25 years. Kober is a worthy successor to Lyle Bettger who is known in those places behind 50 years. Kober is his latest catch, but Kober in the league with low power and going to the team to make Lou's sadness to him. Even after Kober released the gas room, his spirit returns to all kinds of exercises. Mykelti Williamson is as close to Lou's colleague who meets a bad end involving a horse with Tracy Griffith as a psychic and Elizabeth Arlen as a nun with an understanding almost help Lou. Will he succeed in fighting against the outside forces? <br /> <br /> When the film ends, you pray again. Lou really was bound in Turkey. Maybe the devil made him make this film.
