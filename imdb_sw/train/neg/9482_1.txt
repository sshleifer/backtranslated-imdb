Don't waste your time, just don't pay the lease for this dreck piece! How it was made is more than me. (I don't know why there is a minimum of 10 lines ... I have been shortening this film of trashy, but, oh well ...) Acting was bad, if all needed lessons. The program was weak, last ... Feh! I think movies are the only thing that doesn't really suck ... well, maybe the voice was quite small. One good thing is, if they can make this film, even making money with it, there may be hope for any screens of any screened view of REAL. So, you-all make heart! I think the same holds the characters ... if these people are paid, then you can also!
