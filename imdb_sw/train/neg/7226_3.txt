I like comics. Although I have problems understanding fully the story? The visual style is unique with all its dirt, dust and rot. So I thought I knew when I was coming. Surprised I understood the main plot? but some of the best decisions that have been made in his visual style. What does it mean - to look at the "CG 'vendors of the worst? Why ?! Didn't work all the time !! Horus - and other Egyptian gods - succeeded in the CG and very close to the comic version. <br /> <br /> I think for real actors this movie can be a cult movie. It is a shame.
