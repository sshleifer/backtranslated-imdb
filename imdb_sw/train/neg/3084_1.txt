this is the result. A piece of garbage movie that is not even considered to be a film, is just a group of objects on the reel film, which has no logic. Refer to the executives, who from getting seem to be a group of friends who thought they would receive a small amount of money together and try to make a film that would be a great movie to be awesome. Well it's a great fear however, do not have a film. There are many horrible things in "Hobgoblins," but the worst is the protagonist named Richard, who is the only way to weaken even the root of the species. Yes, when you beat a group of friends and try to make a scary film, for a small low budget, not down, this is what will happen. Oh well at least MST3K version was hilarious. But this is still a bad movie, which deserves all the bashing it receives. 9 for MST version.
