Okay let's get right for sure. We have five recent campuses (we must be honored in the word F) to go out on a weekend camp trip. They go to someone who needs help, but instead of trying to help him, they decide to put fire in his place. Nice group of people. Then some of them start going sick - it must be something in the water on the cabin living. However neighbors seem to be the same. Well, when things start to get worse, they tie someone instead of getting help (try neighboring by way). Some locals will not take it. They expel one with the speed of bursting through the forest for many miles, until the truck decreases. Somehow ten minutes later she shows on the cabin (how she could get and how she could travel at the speed of light to find the secrets). Another type of brain surgery in the cabin knows something is wrong so he hides out the cave to allow this blow. Then he decides the second day to return to the cabin to believe it must be a type of temple. He is giddy and forgiving that he survived (he must have thought it was a 24 hour bug). Unfortuneatley meets some friendly police officers. Other couples decide to have sex when the carcass of the worm makes the work of magic, and then women know she needs to stretch the legs (take many skin skins and shaving cream). Otherwise you get an idea. No meaning here. These are five people that I don't want to be friends with. I had roots for eating bacteria. Other characters were identified who were also amusing but not quite identical. Twenty minutes of good life was lost here.
