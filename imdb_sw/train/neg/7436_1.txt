This movie is wasting time and money. In an hour and a half, I kept waiting to get better and has never been doing. It was slowly moving, the plot jumped around, was not terrible or interesting, and really never had nothing. Credit during the introduction was long and released, which was essentially as a whole film (long and offered). Many parts of the plot did not know. Several times during the film I had thought that maybe I was "taken out" because the conspiracy of the plot, however, my friend had one issue and assured me that I was not "disappearing" due to weight, but it was really a movie. I have never been published here on the film before and I have been looking at the full film on IMD for many years. So the fact that I am sure to take the time to write something you must save the amount of this bad movie and that you should not waste your time or your money.
