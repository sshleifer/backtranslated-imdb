"Private practice" has been beaten successfully with the text "Gray Anatomy". Sent is fabulous. Cluster may even work. But Scripture is awesome. The original quiz has been hidden as part of Gray Anatomy should be my first warning. The plan was just blah. I thought maybe it was a fever. So I have set the DVR to run experiments with all other sessions. As I watched the experiment, I was investigating how the actors had good actors put together the boring experiments. The experiment should absorb people inside and keep them back for more. There thought to be excited, flash, good writing, interesting story and cliffhanger which needs to be answered all the time of the season. Interestingly, this show did not have anything. Thinking it was a fever, I looked at the second event that was better. And although it is much better, it is not worth close to what it needs to be interesting can not lose the TV. <br /> <br /> I just reduced this show from my list of displays. It is not worth IMO, and I would be surprised if this show even makes it through mid-season. Go to this one folks.
