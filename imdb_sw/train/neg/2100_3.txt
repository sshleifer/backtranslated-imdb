You think the first landing on the Moon will be enough without having to do things about it. However, this document appears to be hitting everything in bright light as possible. It talks about the risks associated with the new module and describes the closest accident to Armstrong and the training vehicle, such as the trainer and the flight planes with anything to do with each other. It makes the computer exacerbate the problem (1202 and 1201 alarms) that met at the last round of airplane if it was a near-catastrophe when it was just to be angry and not dangerous to employees. And it takes "thirty seconds" calls for thirty seconds of fat left before they happen out, when it's actually thirty seconds before delivery is necessary. <br /> <br /> If you want to see an Apollo document or sketch 11, go "From Earth to Moon" or one of the PBS documents, but this page.
