Eager to explain this - if you were a fan of Russ Meyer film behind the day, you will certainly be happy to see that Haji still looks very hot, though Forry Ackerman hasn't done very well (what does he still do to do these movies yet? If I take him to the camera he will be on my movie?). It was a beautiful beautiful cluster - superhero which the mammals are the most powerful weapon - but sometimes it did not come from all the length, and the joke was on the scale and your average Joe E. Brown (or, Abbott and Costello if it was your business) - basically bad puns. Still, I have found this interesting film to watch, and because more than 2. Good work, but still basic production.
