Sorry to say that this film is very bad. It reminds me of c-grade porn movies and one big difference: no porn. <br /> <br /> Stories and conversations require full renewal. Maybe then the worst acting will not be as visible. On a very small scale, monitoring should be taken. When I admitted that this had a small budget and the director did a good job for having small resources that he had, he would have to spend more time on a story or better yet, get someone else to write. Most of the action events did not mean. It was a complete waste of my time.
