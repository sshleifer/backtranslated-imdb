Warn them! <br /> <br /> This is a crap that crap even even stop having a company and because it's under them! Okay, I've got that way, let me say something bigger. I have seen the ashes of long time ago thought it was pure to take the material that depends on the most famous wuxia Tome of novel due to the emerging characteristics of the director, Wong Kar Wai. Yes, despite all the WKW failures to change the novel on the screen according to most wuxia fans; especially are just shots of refreshing water, suit beads, horse race, etc. I can't sit through many films. <br /> <br /> Quickly many years later when I wanted to give Mr Wong's film another shot after hearing many features, especially from Cannes. I was fascinated by recently, in 2046. A friend told me to start a w / Chungking Express because it is her movies that can be found. So it's not right! I was p.o. that I was gold in losing my time and money on this piece of pride. Other professional experts mentioned that meditation on isolation and solitude in modern capital, blah, blah, blah. It's all good if the director has a view and something to say why these things happen and tell them. But no, he just shows what it is. The work of Faye Wong is very common in Hong Kong style: postpone words, effort in the eyes of the eyes, try to be good and good to act; Some of the cast are not available. I think the word, Auteur, is usimmism for the director who tries something new and different, which should be applauded, but not the person who has not yet done the knowledge of the movie's story to tell, which is what Mr. Wong, for the last 17 years!
