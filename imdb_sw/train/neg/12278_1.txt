When you look at this show you do not know whether it is a story or acting that is more contemptible. First of all, the story of each section is very possible, the authors should use every possible model, you can think not only the general plan, but the order of events as well as the lines of each character, making a certain exhibition of each collage of the police out there. . Above all comes the "message" of the show, that good is good and bad is bad and that at the end of a good day it will prevail and that we should love each other, that the best person and the best citizens, all have done better. Actors, like these missions and no more, will use a small set of acting skills: "I am a good man to carry" smile, looking for anxiety and "victory is our" body posture, when bad people have "I it is "" and look at "you have taken me" look, followed by "I'm good for something and I must be removed from the community" head banding (this type also sums on the overall development of each show). True stories or not, the show is garbage, but other evidence that manufacturers do not get s ** t about viewers, that we are all thought to be witches. Well this series makes every possible experiment of the living mind from you.
