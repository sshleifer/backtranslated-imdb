Here again there is another movie of Diane Lane where she beat her husband. What? Is this the only role he knows to play? This time it was set up in 1969 and she beat her husband and a blouse. I am not surprised because it is very possible. Then her husband gets mad and gives us milk. I can't be surprised if you sleep with milk too. I can't be surprised if he sleeps with an ice man too because this is a very interesting movie. Then after giving milk, she says slowly and sees someone of the blouse again. Duh. Then when he did that with her, her son was struck by dust. My mother always told me not to lose rocks on the nest of wasps. This mother mother did not have time to tell her that, she was very busy with a man of blouse.
