This movie would be very good, especially considering talent. The description of Larenz's father Frankie Lymon is not good, especially in music shows. It is not appropriate to speak well and his way of action is Larenz Tate, when he should be Frankie Lymon. Women's show as a group of gold diggers has Hollywood written everywhere. The forces that have pushed, but have only made the characters more untrue. The hope of the film was a picture of Miguel Nunez of Little Richard, and came to Little Richard himself. Lela Rochon is an eye candy, as usual, even in the conservative role. It is so bad that the talents of Halle Berry and Vivica A. Fox disappeared. Frankie Lymon's whole saga was amazing in real life. This film was still a chance to get lost.
