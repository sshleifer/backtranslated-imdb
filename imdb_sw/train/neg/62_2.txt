SWING! It is an important film because it is one of the remaining Black films made from the 1930s. Most of these films have been very badly unknown, but this is in good shape. It is also a great opportunity to see many of the Black talented characters of the same period after the cottage of the Old Cotton Club - all but forgotten today. Unfortunately, when the film is historically important and has a good exhibition, it is also a mess. The main features are similar to the Hollywood music of the era - including the prima donna who will destroy the show and unknown surprise who looks from no where to save the day. However, writing is just a very bad-and-repeated - and pictures of Black America projects that some might get a little contemptuous. This is because before the plot did not come, you are dealt with an unlicensed bomb that lives his hardworking wife (the most famous of the time) and when it gets to the hussy (who, by the way, completely contributes to this role), they have to fight that it looks like a scene from WWE Smackdown! And, one woman wants to cut another woman for an automatic mistake - a real trashy area! Later in the film, when the prima makes a bad habit, her husband claps her face and everyone thanks her! It looks like a film, sometimes, wants to appeal to the most common denominations in the PLUS audience can not even do it well - and some of the worst work I have seen for too long. <Br /> <br /> However, if you can look back to the production of lousy almost every way (and the characters of the trashy, the worst acting and the wrong direction with bad writing), this may be a peek value so you can see the best music and play pipe - including the picture of the forgotten Black culture. It's not just saying I didn't warn you about acting - it's true, it's so bad!
