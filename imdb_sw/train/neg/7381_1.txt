Okay, first of all, the voice of Seagal is called on a film like 50% ... Why? Because it seems there was a script record with a story when they were shot and they need to change his conversation to continue with a story if they have many versions. From the beginning, you start your head because the overdubs not only disrupt, but they don't mean. <br /> <br /> That said, the story is still drinking and it doesn't mean anything at all. When I got to the end, I was finding my head because the movie was useless and the end was meaningless. Avoid as a blow. This film has made me stand looking Seagal directly to video movies causing it worse and worse.
