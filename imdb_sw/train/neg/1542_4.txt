Did this first tim meadows play a role in the film? The character, leon, is funny enough but shortly after that the joke of sex and humor is also dumb listening again. Some movies may discard sexual jokes, and the basis of their audience should know that right when the ads are coming. The other movies that make this is the American pie and the scary movie. The scary movie was stupid, and the American pie would have done well without sexual jokes. The only role, instead of leon, which had the fun you followed you would close. The attitude was really dumb and it was all, the dumbness of the dumb was all that I had to look at. The movie was the same, and nothing else. I don't really know why people who get away from the show always get a movie according to the character they played on the show. skits 5 minutes, and if they can make a movie off the skit 5 minutes, then what is the world coming? molly shannon had a star, cheri o'terri had a frightening film, but had no responsibility to lead, and had an elf. but that was good, but it made a dancing film, but I don't remember, and my girlfriend and the world of wayne. how to come to the tv workers who have never been to the movie deals? he saw only one man breaking through, but only in movies like 2 and the show of tv and dicky. but that person relies on play for his life to continue, funny or not. This movie is not good, but it had a good humor. what to lose film and people's money. (DD-)
