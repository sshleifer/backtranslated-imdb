I just liked to look at it and be happy with the films of the film. I saw this film through the Mystery of Secrets of Mystery 3000 and I have a DVD. If you open on the other side of the DVD, it shows the real movie, so I gave the opportunity. By and large, these people are cheese cheese. <br /> <br /> Acting, special effects, and the plot is generally very cheesy and untrue. "Is not the need for lungs" said Crow seeing how the head could still talk when it does not have the body, and Tom Servo says only "No, he has a juicy juice." The latter is just classic and no one can touch this sound with K-Porn! I liked to "fight with cats" between two vendors. That "Meow" after the fight or location, whatever, was normal. So, somehow this was a fun movie. I think for fans of fear, maybe you will enjoy it. For a good time, see the MSTK3 version, you will find a great laugh. <br /> <br /> MST3K version: 10/10 Brain that died: 1/10
