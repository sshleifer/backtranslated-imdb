Life in the future of fascist or near the fascist that prohibits personal freedom is a common theme in modern literature and for film makers. These works give us warnings about improper conduct in our community looking for; but being effective should also be entertaining. Unfortunately many books are more effective in sending warnings than they bring us enough to read too much; during the film the problem is usually in another way. The first job like that was known most probably George Orwell's "1984" (first published in 1948), and this is still available easily through the book and as a film. or read it: and then, when you have a little trouble with humanity to man, reach Cinderella 2000. This is a fine under the budget comedy of a film that is derived from the same theme that provides ineffective independence; and as with 1984 the calendar is now over its time. Most of the comedy are kept by the chest though there is only a very short time. Keeping your mind in the long run between these can focus on the question that this film will receive a new expansion of life by releasing a DVD or if it eventually disappears in the form of existing existing copies has reduced the previous redemption. There are many bad films that look like these modern DVDs, and really don't care what happens any way. Until now the best films of this kind may have been "Tale of Handmaiden", but I would like to convince you all of the well-made film of the London London novel "The Heel Iron". Such evidence will, however, still seem surprising that there is no modern producer of films who has witnessed the experiment (IMDb selects the B / W version of silence held in Russia in 1919).
