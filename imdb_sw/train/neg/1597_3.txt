This film has been awarded a classic on the impression not on any quality of filming. It comes from the possibility of distrust, from unrealistic and interesting. An unpredictable program surrounds an attempt by two British soldiers and Hindu gofer in order to rescue three soldiers who have been taken by the Indian warriors. In the future we will see full force and drums and pipes going to attack. In the British army, the sergeant does not offer a rescue attempt, and if you go past, it does not try with just one soldier and a slave of India when there is a full force in hand. Indian fighters feel that they are laughable ... there are hundreds of them but they can't hold their prisoner or kill two rescuers, of course not. At one time we see British soldiers placing stone blocks under the war of the fighters, who are scattered along the mountain in the ambush ... one should have green plants for the brain to think this would make any damage. After Cary Grant as a saved prisoner is shot, lying on the floor looking next to a water boy ... the hardest man has been beaten back. The boy's gun blows the gun boldly (which comes from anywhere) to hear the bell ... this he does by standing up on the wall so he can be seen and shot by bad guys, and we shed tears as he tries to talk more like he is shot at a time and a small call breaks into a weak squawks ... instead of hitting a gun when hiding behind the lid as anyone with half the brain will do. This area has been been featured in comedy drawings. If they would like to make comedy Buster Keaton, they should hire Keaton and do better.
