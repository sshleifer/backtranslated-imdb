Do you have the Laws for the weekend? Then this is a film to speed up their departure, failure that will help the catato situation to bring you a welcome welcome from time to time. <br /> <br /> The film is allegedly installed on a luxury passenger ship, which is more than a high car ferry; The plot has holes more than a common colander and cast has been allocated from the depth of D's popular list. A fascinating piece of amusement stimulated is playing "Spot Villain" as a passenger joining the ship. There will be no mistake! With a script that sinks faster than brick, the clich√©d slices laid by a large amount of raspberry jam twice as blood this tries to insert exciting films, films and fest and at the same time cannot fulfill any of them. <Br /> <br /> Must watch the movie, if you just laugh how bad it is.
