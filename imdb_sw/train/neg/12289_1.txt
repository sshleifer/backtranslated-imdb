I am sick of cinema patients who enjoy the sound in one line of synopsis and end up to the same as what you find in the bottom of the heap of fertilizer. Who knows: "Pastor" It may seem interesting to the fastest in the studio, even with "a great name healed" (like Blair and Hasselhoff - wink-wink, nudge-nudge) and the effectiveness of Hildegard Knef (I dunno, a certain woman ...). But on the film, it falls just faster than the sculpture of paper on rain. It seems that these unfortunate people are confined to the island's house outside the East Sea, and one of them (the woman, I would like) is targeted by the devil's worship to carry the child of hell while others are beaten in chaos, suffering the way. In fact, there you have a cross section of the squares from "The Exorcist", "Omen", "Ten Indians" and other smaller movies in the sample-worshipers-refugee-amok line. Not one of the most entertaining and for the most part, you will exceed your way from location to area to the end. No, even Linda Blair and David Hasselhoff help many things. They are just within taking charge and don't seem to be willing to give "all" them. From its exhibition, Hasselhoff wants him to return to beack with Pam Anderson (and who can blame him?) and Linda ... well, who knows; A recommendation of a celebrity of PETA or a pro-golf tour or whatever he is present. <br /> <br /> And torture events! Ecchhhh. You will see people smuggling buttons, inserted into the fires of fire, examined in trees during severe storms, broken pieces from their necks, etc., etc. Sheesh, and I thought "Mark of Devil" was a lot of sad movies I would like to see ... . <br /> <br /> Don't worry. Not suitable for your time. I can't believe I told you as I did. If you look at it, see if you can count cliches. And yes, Blair gets, if you haven't got that come down the main Street followed by the accompanying band. <br /> <br /> No star. "Pastor" - these witches will give them.
