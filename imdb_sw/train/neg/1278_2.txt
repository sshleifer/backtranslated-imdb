Imagine a woman in the house for forty-five minutes that nothing happens. Then this continues two times more. The writing is flat and unhealthy, and the joke likes it, and a bad act hinders you from worrying about the characters, even when they are fighting the wolves of the wolves and getting beaten by brotherly violence. Anyone who has placed this film more than two is not exactly the same.
