Note: I will reveal a key part of the plot, but if you look at the DVD cover or any promotional material, you will already know. <br /> <br /> This movie seems to be written by a eleven-year-old who is not very aggressive and perhaps was very tired when he wrote. The author does not know the difference between chemicals and organisms. Forgetting the fact that the UN and NSA seem to be running a festival in Hungary. Forgetting the fact that when these intelligence agents are going to evict the person who just touch kill you in minutes they do not wear protective equipment (even even breathing). These are parameters in the context of this film. In the world of science within this story, 2 + 2 = 6.34 and gravity goes to the other side. The fact is that people in this movie do not have (for a few few) to live as humans live. Almost every time the character responds something is not good. The story of love (of course there is one) makes the script's opera script looks like Shakespeare. I do not believe that we lost the rental free of charge on this matter.
