David Mamet is a good and very good director. His first movie 'House of Games' was the best I liked, and put a series of films with characters whose life-style changes when they get into a difficult situation, as well as viewer view. It is therefore a 'killer' from the title attempts to keep view of the viewer in a normal crime game. The main characters are two cops, one of the Jewish and one Irish who is responsible for the location charged racially. The assassination of an ancient Jewish shop owner who shows that the old old war of Israel makes the Jewish identity in the mind and heart of the Jewish detective. These are the wrongs of the film are more obvious. The wake-up process is normal and difficult to believe, a group of Jewish militants are working, and the detective way finally goes to the final struggle of violence is terrible. At the end of the film itself is skilled at Mamet, but desperate from the human point of view. Joe Mantegna and William Macy provide good performances, but the stories of the story are very obvious for compensation. .
