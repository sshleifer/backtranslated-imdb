How can Barry Levinson have a red-red talented Ben Stiller and Jack Black, a beautiful Rachel Weisz, an old man Christopher Walken and still gives a non-cheap stinker? Black and Black are still friends until the end welcomes the medicine to lose the dog and happen to be millions of consumers. The house is thin but it has enough voice for the right hands to be a great hub between the two stars but all involved beat every hand, every chance they can. Black and Black are not so funny in many ways, Weisz seems to have a feeling like always but it is used for crime and, except Walken as a batty gun who encourages the stiller's revenge, it's turgid The end to the end of this caused the farce.
