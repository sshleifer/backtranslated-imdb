Now I had a good attitude when watching this. I would like Tony's work, also my friend told me it was a great movie, though I heard otherwise from other people. But this was only hope. <br /> <br /> In my opinion of humility, Tony Scott was very trying. It was too many. I would like to explain it. Miss Knightley was winning, and not a good way. People who did well, were Mickey Rourke, Edgar Ramirez, and Christopher Walken, but their screen time could not save the movie. There were a few incidents that came out of their origin, but somehow it had been seen as written by someone other than the great author. Some tune was used around 4 times, which started the bug for the second time. I am faithful to not use the same tune immediately. Also, editing has come out of this, if the level of denial is over. Oh, and memorizing it for some of the Keira lines just looks cheesy after hearing for the second, third, fourth, and so on. Basically, my opinion is that if you want to see the scope of the action that is high and "somewhat" of funny, and you care about everything I said above, you can love it. <br /> <br /> (For a side note: I'm not a fan of Keira Knightley.)
