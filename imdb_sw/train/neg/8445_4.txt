For me every piece of art is judged by these criteria: Form, Function and Meaning. Guernsey seems to be dedicated to the form: good shots and sometimes acting acting. The closest length of time shows the tasks the viewer can fill in himself. Because of the lack of scripture the story becomes an attempt. The person who identifies himself has a deep sense, but sometimes it does not have anything to say. This film acts as an importer. If you have not read the example you will not see that it is suicide (and the question of unanswered questions). 'Why don't you talk to me?' asks Sebastiaan. Anna did not answer, she just starts looking at her without saying a word. What work of that shot? What does it mean? My question is like Sebastiaans: What does this film say? What does this movie mean? Answer for me: It shows us a handful of people with a glass of water. The story of their lives is simple and terrible. The reasons for their actions are not shown. Others are: skin, shelter, theme. Good and artistic has been made, but it doesn't mean without having 'use orders'. In my opinion this film is made to fellow artists, not to the ordinary viewer.
