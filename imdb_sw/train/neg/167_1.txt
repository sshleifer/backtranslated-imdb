Anyone who has ever been a fan of the previous series, or even has a clue about the storyline should be embarrassed with this series. Borg does not come until Q brings Business to Gamma industry, Klingons have not seen until Kirk meet them, NCC-1701 was the first ship to bear the name of Enterprise .... need me to continue? Berman and Pilliar have made the shock of the creation of Gene Roddenberry. Having died, just felt $$$$ and just went their own way. It is not surprising that Majel Barrett was in one part of the star journey to this series. I did not accuse you of not participating in this mess. Poor Eight. He is a good actor, as he was healed. I love it all, but the story is bad and it rejects all of the predictions set by the previous series. Just check the testing. I think many people looked at Deep Space 9 (which was deleted at the wrong time).
