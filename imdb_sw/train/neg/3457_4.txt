This film was made and thrown from my home town. I remember the friction on it and hullabaloo all about the truth Molly Ringwald was in the city ... <br /> <br /> Story story ... without completing, a group of film students decided to complete - with a bad result. It looks like someone doesn't want the film to be completed. <br /> <br /> Story story is flimsy. One should remember that this is a comedy and is therefore considered to be a little harder in the cheek, but he had no real oomph. The characters are so many and little information that you receive on them is not just a matter of concern, it seems to be irrelevant. It is a great hearing to hear Kylie's voice as Australia again and good to see the child I went to school with the role of star. But that does not redeem the film at all. Beauty you know why the creators thought they would go Molly Ringwald. Perhaps because of the nature of the film (it's a kind of filing film 80s / horrible films) but actually Aussie's actors would only do well. Besides the disposal it deals most of the act it seemed to be solved. Some of these children (especially two main ones - played "director" and "producer") seemed to have tried to act. That's not a good look. Also, shots had a bad feeling on them. More bed? It's not as soft as one is used. <br /> <br /> The murderer. Lord. Could it be a little awesome? There are some things shock though, and a couple of major events. I loved the film, but it was not good. It went for 90 minutes but it could go down. Maybe if they would strengthen the script it would be better. They had many characters killed - but there is no real building for them to be killed. Perhaps they would kill a few people and actually concentrate on a terrible situation would be better. Now I know it's comedy and elements were funny. Or so they were not honest they were funny. But I don't believe. <br /> <br /> LM.
