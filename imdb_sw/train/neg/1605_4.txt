Recently, I found the document "Revolution can not be television", also know if "Chávez: within the revolution". For the first time I thought it showed a realistic view of the events during the fighting in Venezuela in April 2002. What was troubling me was the fact that the voices of the notes and music you followed were interesting, and that of course any opposition showed Hugo Chávez. This is unique because if the document is to provide an unselfish account of what happened, there may be some of them too. After all, Chávez is certainly not holy. Fortunately, since the document is many years, many additional information is available on the internet today, and it was not hard to find for example "Quick investigation about the Chavez revolution and 5 European TV companies who helped the film that gives a bad lie about Venezuela "It mentions many errors and expected or unexpected damage in the document. (Use only a header as a search string in Google, you'll find). Another interesting document was the registration of video presentation of many errors in this document, "X-ray of falsehood". For me it seems to be good to deal with "Chávez: within the revolution" Found on video.google. I strongly advise you after looking at "Chávez: within the revolution" look at "X-ray false" and then make your comments. My end is that Kim Bartley and Donnacha O'Brian were (knowingly or not) part of the Chávez propaganda.
