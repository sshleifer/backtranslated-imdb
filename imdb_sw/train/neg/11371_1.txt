"Document", and we use that word clearly, explains that Muslims are trying to take the world seriously. Then it says that any Muslim who does not accept this is either ignorance of their own faith or lying in your face! Also everyone killed in the film has found a fascinating market to take the truth by selling claptrap to producers willing to allow others to make their own ideas. What the West needs to know is this not more than propaganda aimed at the mind of the mind. If you are looking for a real document on Islam and the current Middle East situation I will look elsewhere. Try something that gives a lot of comments from sources of attributes.
