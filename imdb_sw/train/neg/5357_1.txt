I don't know where to start. This movie feels a lot like one of the lowest price on Saturday morning shows that they were doing back behind the early nineties. Type like Captain Power or Power Rangers. It is filled with poor digital coverings and good sound of "secret agencies" and criminals. <br /> <br /> Acting is very bad even not funny. The direction is terrible and there is little to continue. It seems like someone had lost a series together and forgot that it was considered a plot. Maybe one of the most ridiculous events in the movie comes early, when a number of criminals climb up an explosive device in a car. For some reason, although the device is described as a "missing village" bad people decide to evict him from their motorcycles when he leaves. This guide continues. all the time with bad people are making cycling bicycles. Stand on the bike, make wheels and so on. At one time, an accident occurs with one of the attackers being beaten from his bike, we see a bicycle (open cgi) thrown on a car of a broker but the rider has gone. Then, a few seconds after the return of the horsemen and bicycles ... it seems to have not been disturbed by the accident. At this point even though the car has an explosive device that is planted in it, the attackers choose to hit the agent while driving, and then drive his car. Which is also made clear by cgi. Confusion sound? It's, and so it's all the movies. I can say that when I say cgi, we're not talking about the Lord of the Rings type cgi here. We speak cheap Power Rangers Power Rangers type of cgi, in fact I think it would have done well on Power Rangers. Why Savini and Todd did not know this film, I could just think it made for money, like a permit for someone or because they were inserted into it ... maybe the end.
