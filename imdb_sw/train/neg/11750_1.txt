The person who wrote, led and watched this piece of horror must reach the guardian's change. Yes Rob Stefaniuk, I mean you! With diligence, who supported this trick? there are many talented writers out there whose money can be used more effectively. I think the idea is great but acting, the script and guide is just plain! Jokes are not funny, I understand that they should take mickey. BUT do it in fashion, this movie is shouting 1995 Saturday night skits live. Why, I say again why the studios give them money like Rob Stefaniuk - Don't Get From COMEDIAN Opportunity to Write Assistant and Trophy In His Store. DUH!
