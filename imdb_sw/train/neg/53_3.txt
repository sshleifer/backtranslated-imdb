I read Catalan, and I was delighted to find El Mar, a book with a lot of Catalan talk, in my art gallery. Hmmm ... is not good to see it. </> <br /> Yes, as other critics have said, it's done well, and photographed. Although the opening of the children's opening is critical, it is good to act and influence. (For the most part, that's ... Is the traders going to be dead in the preparation of the burial in the center of the city, with a full view of a 10 year old boy?) O, well. To this point, it had something to feel for the non-magical Labyrinth of Pan, and also installed in the Spanish Civil War. Open it up, and the three children who saved the opening event came to age. Francisca is a clever who works in the sanatorium of both TB and two boys, Manuel and Ramallo, both are sick. I know, but hey, the incidents happening. The problem, like many Spanish movies (apologizing to fans of Almodovar), is that for one exception (Francisca) characters are just so dang * weird *. Their activists, their behavior, and discussions often do not happen. <br /> <br /> What's more, dropping in the awesome horrible scary. Be prepared for LOTS of pain and LOTS of blood. The auditor who called it "potboiler" is on track. If it was given 40 years ago, the poster had said: SEE LOVE! RAPE! HALG! SEND !! FANATICISM! CRUELTI OF WORK !! BETRAYAL !! The opening sequence is not close enough to make friends with the trusted characters. In order to work, this should have many restrictions for the characters. Like, it seems a wonderful cross and depression between "Brother Sun, Sister Moon" and "Pulp Fiction." If it looks like something you should see, by all means, enjoy it. I think I am going and something that doesn't make me do not need to wash to wash gas and darkness. As for Catalan, it is a Mallorqui language, quite different from Barcelona's dialects, although I was surprised by the comments that said that even Barcelona needed to be translated to Catalan to understand.
