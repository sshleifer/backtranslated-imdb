This movie wants to clarify that criminals are the product of modern society. So, can thieves, fighters and killers (the killer of this movie, Carl Panzram (James Woods), all three and worse) fully responsible for their actions? An interesting concept, but very difficult to bring on the screen in a mental and emotional way. And this is where Killer: Journal of Murder falls very short. Although the film attempts to keep Panzram's attitude towards perspective, as well as publications for its young and violent childbearing, the viewer has never found the idea that Panzram is a victim instead of the offender. Of course, this crippled system, and one stupid person who is running the whole prison of the Leavenworth Prison (where many of the films are being held), many prison guards are concerned with anxiety, and the prison director as anything to be crazy. But why on earth down the prison guard Henry Lesser (Robert Sean Leonard) take such a pity on Panzram? Even after reading his bad list? The movie gives an explanation: Poor Panzram's Witnesses have been beaten with pulp and many sadistic (and stereotypical) guards, and it is a sense of mind Panzram (though it is unclear why the player actually thinks this person is smart). Surely this is not enough to feel sympathy with someone who hates like Panzram, though this film tends to undermine his crime and show his personality? On the one hand, Panzram is completely loyal, and the viewer is given the impression that for this Below is experiencing all the evil that he has read about in the Panzram newspaper. Does this little person have very little friends that he takes on the face of everyone who seems to be closer to him? Perhaps it is the youngest who is the product of modern society, judging on the appearance of drugs. <br /> <br /> I can advise Monster, Shakira Charlize Theron and Christina Ricci, as a movie that covers the same theme and far more trust and scope. BTW: The killer looks like a shot on TV (not good)
