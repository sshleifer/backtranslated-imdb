This is a small budget of Roger Corman horror / creature flick. DinoCroc is created when the destruction of genetically prehistoric genes runs amok. Croc slain first kills one of its own and then gets the taste of man and becomes a quick terrorist after the flight. No extensive characters, but then it is not based. We only get a few of the two hundred dinosaur giants and some pictures of "kill" the best in a small budget. <br /> <br /> My favorite part is the character of kirohoki trying to use three dog legged to bait and becomes a croc food yourself. Nothing was left on the tramp but the foot on the foot. And no real roles: Jane Longendecker, Bruce Weitz and Charles Napier. Many are pleased with Matt Borlenghi and a croc specialist of Costas Mandylor. I was so surprised by Joanna Pacula that she was so afraid of Dr.. DINOCROC with respect as a crock of pickles.
