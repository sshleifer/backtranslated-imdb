This movie was awesome. The first half of the hour is like ... well, apologizing for lack of conversation, but it was just a bad version of Orange Clockwork. The first place lies almost one copy from the first one at Clockwork Clock! It was indeed a tax, for the appearance of the Clockwork poster on the protagonist's wall, however "ripoff" is the most appropriate word. The movie felt like it's bursting right from the classic Kubrick, just made through the new director's eyes. Blind Director. Unfortunately when you stop the killing of Kubrick's work, the film gets even worse. As another speaker said, the depth of this film is just beaten under your throat. Pride, self-absorbed and ultimately without a trivial challenge. Maybe his colleagues might have touched the courage if there was any development in this film. I felt nothing to this person. And I am drunk, so I think that anyone can feel anything for him, it will be me. Promoting odds, discussion and plot. The worst part about this film is the head. For a film called "16 Years of Alcohol", alcoholism is not a factor in the flick. See the first paragraph - it was the refusal of the Orange Clockwork I could not find. The most appropriate title would be "16 Years of Violence," or, even better, "Banana Clockwork". Let's do this permission and avoid this film. If you ignore my advice and take it again, drink it. Believe me.
