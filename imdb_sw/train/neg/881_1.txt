Thanks to another division of home video that was brought in what is called the German Independent Series, Fourth for Venice is not just bad, but it's very bad. It is therefore very bad, because I have lost in a second store of store products for extra money. Nick and Charlotte are a couple who have reached an agreement on sex only on Tuesday due to their schedule of their wisdom. professionalism. Eva and Luis are a couple of couples living by hand, where Eva works as a servant with Luis, the artist. Nick directly causes Eva to lose her job as a servant. Luis and Charlotte had something behind Eva and Nick. Luis depended on Eva by telling her that she could fly London to do something related to her artwork, but the fact is that she leaves Venice and Charlotte for a sexual holiday. Eva took Nick and took her two children together with Venice to fight. Venice's journey ends with Nick and Eva falling to each other. The presentation of a trip from Germany to Venice between Nick and Eva shows the failure of comedy. It's not just seems to be useless, but it's also a draggy. In the film, Nick tries to seek help in a number of ways, but it doesn't always work. It may be visitors around him who act like morons, or just dumb. <br /> <br /> Comedy also had a habit of adding in unwanted scenes to add stories. While some problems can be solved with common sense, no one in the film uses common sense to solve the problem. They love through one big round to solve the problem. It is very unsuccessful, even the most beautiful Venice events have not been able to create the title of the film.
