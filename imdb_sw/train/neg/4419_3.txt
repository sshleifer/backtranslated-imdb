As a "Catholic Catholic" who was 11 years old Catholic school, but has never been to Mass in 35 years except for marriage and funeral, I thought I could run. And I. . . for the first two-thirds of the movie. It was all the common things - the teaching of government schools, prohibiting sex, etc.. But then, suddenly, the film turned into meaning. Really mean. Now look, I seen this before the pedophilia scourge. . . and maybe I wouldn't be quite so irritated at as nasty, digs hate in the Catholic Church as I would have known on these abominations (like a long Catholic!) and coverups. <br /> <br /> It has been a few years since I used the video, and I will never come back to a new perspective. It just left a bad, bad, bad taste in my mouth. . . I am wondering what all the participants had the Church, because * the * truth * they hate, or wrapped it in payment. It is an anti-Catholic film with an incredible, offensive to anyone who has a light of respect for Catholic education. What I'm still doing because there were no better teachers in '50s. Any other thing that these dignitaries did, they redeemed me to learn how to read and write English. He made us remember. (How many children today can make a simple calculation in their heads?) The truth is, there is nothing more important for success in America. Can you read? Can add / remove / exit / share? Great. You can get any high degree you want. With Catholic education discipline and standing you rather good, not only if you continue your studies, but also for the rest of your life, regardless of your opinion about the Catholic "stories" we all had to learn. <Br /> <br /> Dropped down, the rough, rotten script. I really feel bad (and no, it's not "wrong" - my hope, nuns taught me better) to the author and director <br /> <br /> I thought I had mixed feelings about Catholic school. But participants in this project must ' you've been those evil (ie.e, fool) children who are sitting behind the class, if they were willing to participate in making this film.
