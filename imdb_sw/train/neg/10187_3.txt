Shadow, shade-minded on airplanes gathered within hours and of mechanics that have never worked on the airplane (run by Burgess Meredith) to run Porsche's running car which runs for many years of petrol sludge, led by Lee Majors, and Chris Makepeace as a run -wiz technology who can McGyver spare pieces into the radio that can take the frequency simultaneously, and who somehow learn how to get and use chemicals to make advanced bombs in a fully peaceful community. As moronic as it seems. The tragic loss of Burgess Meredith, but Chris Makepeace can be forgiven because it was only his second film.
