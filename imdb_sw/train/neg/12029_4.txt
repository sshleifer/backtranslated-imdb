Normally, I have found that if you hear about the movie before you see it on DVD, there may be good reasons. I've never heard of this film completely until I was in Blockbuster the other day and noticed on the shelves. Since all good movies had been expelled (which I wanted to see, however), I thought I would give him this shot. It's not really true than other movies in Ghana, such as Ward Singles or RM. If you are in such movies, you will probably enjoy this. However, if you don't have a mormon, this film will probably not be interesting. There is no way to escape the mormon inside, and sometimes it comes as sappy and cheesy. Finally, if you fall into the mormon population, perhaps you are better looking at something else. True, there was a very short time in the film, but I didn't think it was enough to salvage the movie in general.
