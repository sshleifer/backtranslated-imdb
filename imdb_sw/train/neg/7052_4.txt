This film was just so interesting and music that I liked so much, I mean what it was really in making this film please anyone who reads this review does not get this film, it's a waste of time. Emraan can act but was very sympathetic In this film, I am ashamed that one of his fans especially in this film, was very bad. <br /> <br /> Celina is just another beautiful face without the lack of talent what she does, she can't act at all, and there was no guarantee that in this film, such as another girl Radha was the same I think but would do well. <br /> <br /> How long it is. please watch good music and don't watch this film.
