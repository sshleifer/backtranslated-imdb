Wow, I am a great fan of Henry VIII / Tudor and, well, this was ..... interesting. I was the only one to look at Catherine of Aragon. And wow ... just wow. I found a bad mistake before, but this reached a new height. When the actress who played Catherine had a umm. he screams and screams and I must admit that I repeat many times ... often, often .... funny, amazing things. The only person who showed even any talent of talent was an actor to play Anne Boleyn (I might have discrimination though, I have a little humor with Anne Boleyn, she was a real woman, read about it, it's worth it!) Also, I've read a lot about time the Tudor and I think the characters were not shown too much, they were all too common. Just watch this film if you are ready to see the most important time, and the important life of those involved has become a laughing laughter.
