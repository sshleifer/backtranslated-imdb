This film begins slowly, then it leaves. After looking at an hour, and seeing anything happen, I went out. I mean, nothing happened. Sufuri. Zip. Nada. No stories. The characters are an indirect representation of many very interesting people we know. The filmmakers can be charged in a court of law if they try to sell as a "motion" picture. There is no motion. I could tell "stories" similar to a couple still photographs with a brief description. Script is a joke. It's very bad. I am sure that any script in the world could save it. My great regret is not that I have lost 60 minutes of my life looking for "Love In Money", but that I have lost a good chance to be a leader. I would be the first to walk out, but I waited too long. Instead, I looked at about 20 people from my presence.
