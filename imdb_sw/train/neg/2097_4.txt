I looked forward to the best franchise of Battlestar Galactica. Prequel very boring for the main series. After the first 30 minutes, I was trying to stop. The characters talk a lot about religion, computer, software, payment, etc ... There are bandits, mafia type, who makes hits. However, Caprica does not have a preliminary step to deal with small pieces. I would like to give you a good advice when watching movies: As a general rule, if there are too many bad obstacles, then you know the movie will be dud. Caprica has a lot of this. The director / writer often tries to compensate for his poor ability by throwing a few bodies of honey. It has not worked with all that is done to force the participants of the youth who are involved with them and I feel sorry for them. The directors / authors who do so should be banned from business. If you want to leave for an hour and a half, by all means, borrow Caprica. There are porn (free) on 'Net if you want to see naked bodies. Otherwise, go on together, there is nothing to see here.
