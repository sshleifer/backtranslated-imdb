Although he cautioned me I actually sat down to watch this film. For part because I give each movie even break, and because I thought that one movie can't be bad. I'm stopped. Even George Kennedy, Barry Bostwick or Ben Stein can save this turkey from sinking as tons of bricks. Just once during this lost humor spoof I was laughing. When Simon says the area. Another joke is made simply for damage or simply. And some of them see coming miles away. This movie has not found what is needed to be as good as a Bird! (I + II), Naked Naked (I + II + III), or Awesome Movie. All were with A. strange practices, B. good discussion and most importantly all closed barriers. Men In White have found D. none of the above. Making this bad phone will be hard on the bottom. FOLLOW ALL OF THE MOVIE CAN GO! LEARN TO KNOW!
