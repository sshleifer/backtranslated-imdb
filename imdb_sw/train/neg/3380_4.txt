Michael Bennett and the Broadway show of Nicholas Dante running for years, but the evidence of his strength and charisma loses in this state of the film, which is very likely due to the choice of director (Richard Attenborough, away from B-way as you can find) and the leading actor (Michael Douglas, who plays the choreographer-acting lawyer). A small story, about a great show for Broadway show which turns into a therapeutic session for actors-singers, is just played on us, with great talent, of brass playing on the rafters. There is nothing planned or cunning, especially for the old player who returns to the reminder and the heads of fire and Douglas of the past. The hope of lust is filled with promises and heartaches, but their personal stories are a little embarrassing; this, comparable to Attenborough's disgusting, describing the tragedy, and even the current songs are known to fail to break through fake closure. * 1/2 from ****
