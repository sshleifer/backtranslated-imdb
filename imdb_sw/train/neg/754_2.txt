I must admit I shouted when I saw one inspector compared to LOTR. Yes, if you exclude a few, thousands of thousands, special special effects, great battles, strong behavior, good plot, good acting, class trends and everything else. That unites you with a walk. And the boy, do you? This movie is going! If Mr Piano had his way, this would probably have a three-hour cycle of hard walking through the Wisconsin region, but every 40 minutes or so these pesky martians continue for a few seconds to resist before going to another place. You have never seen so much walking on the film. If this had a $ 20m budget, most of them should have gone to Mr Piano's shoes, because he had to go through multiple pairs with his walk. Which explains why there is no money left for good effects, good video camera or proper actors. In fact, it's like watching a fantastic video of fetish for people who have something to go for a long time for travel trips. Even in a hurry, this is a walk to looonnnggg. <br /> <br /> With regard to sci-fi items, I think it was a mistake to put Martians in the film: they just find a way to walk, which is more obvious to the director than the story. <br /> <br /> I wonder how much Mr Piano charges to walk dog?
