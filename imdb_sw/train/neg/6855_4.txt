Why is it that a woman can not be a strong character in the movie without sleeping with someone leading? The campaign manager in the dream of this film leading Tom Sellick to the White House. It's all he can think of. Why, why on earth should he have a relationship with him? It did not add anything to the program and serve only to lose successful women. The only value of that tidbit was good "we've been sleeping with your husband". Also, did not people who made this film look at the national gatherings they made? The shouting between two major political conferences only showed all of their transparency and selection.
