It's hard to believe, after waiting 14 years, we wind and this piece of cinema. The original had a great impact, the dark thriller of the state of “worship” which depicts the beautiful art of the movie as described by Paul Verhoeven. This film does not add anything, is not worth anything, and eventually comes in a big box of sequels failure. <br /> <br /> The opening sequence can be triggered a set of seconds of the development of the plot using using talent and capabilities. Unfortunately we are treated for 90 minutes in the self-defense of Catherine Tramell ... or is Sharon Stone. It is possible to combine them all. If desire is also the promotion of gender gender testing as "B.S.1", neglect. You blow the wind and the soft endurance of the porn that ultimately emphasizes the old adage which the woman can attract more clothes than out of them. It is amazing to note that Charlotte Rampling strange was visiting her skivvies, through the 1966 GIRL's GEORGY, when Mrs. Stone was only 8 years old. The most talented and well-versed in the making of himself even here. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of a real video then you must see this film and judge using your rating system. If not, you can also wait for the release of a DVD on the "tested" version, the "connectivity" version, the "collectors," or "end" version, and perhaps over the next 14 years we will cover "Basic Instinct 3 "At that time Mrs Stone will be 62 years old and no one will care.
