My true advice to all: don't look at the movie. Do not even come to a memorial where this movie is playing !! even see little is bad for health. bad. no joke. is 3.30 in the morning. and I came back from this worst movie in this world. HOUR HOURS DAMN !!! I am proud that I lived after all! If this is called life. I have been very distressed. he was angry. desire. it was a waste of time! The money went! no plot. I hope to rise tomorrow and without the memory of this night! RUBBISH MOVIE. <br /> <br /> Joy of the Republic of the day one and all :)
