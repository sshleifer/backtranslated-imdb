What a piece of stupid folly. <br /> <br /> I can't even lose time to evaluate any points of this show. Not suitable time. One comment I will make is - why do you get DUMB like that, unknown doofus being stars ?! There is no more serious evidence for the poor mental state of the network than the fact that FOX has said it cannot bring John Doe (good series) but it will bring back the shadow of the brain like Joe Millionaire for another round of brain kill American public. FOX has lost, IMHO.
