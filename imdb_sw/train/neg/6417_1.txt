How the opinion that was the headline and secondary school girls even made it on this site, this is the stupid movie I've ever seen, was ridiculous, how anyone can sit there and say that just because the movie makes you Jump is a good movie, which can be something more modern than I've ever heard, I could go back to your back and go "Boo" and it will make you come, but that doesn't mean that it is characterized by writing or leading the movie, without saying "they closed everything together last" not a good reason for the movie to receive well. What kind of film would have been if they had not connected everything together, I think it would have made a half film, not the whole movie. So basically this beautiful girl praises her for finishing the film, I love the young people today do the media and production companies at a high level. It is not surprising that the political system of this country can overcome whatever they want, we have such values ​​as coming to our country, what will happen if this girl ends up leading something one day, that's a horrible idea. Get life and look at the real-time film, try the Shawshank Redemption or on the Water Water, or something like that, don't say that it was "boring" after seeing it, just using the little brain that God gave you to analyze is a little.
