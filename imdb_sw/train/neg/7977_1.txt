Well, Jesus of Montreal is basically an intelligent movie. The characters are really good and the technical side of the film is the same. But, though I was very interested in the topic and like to think and talk about religion (I don't believe God), it was hard to get involved with watching a movie with bitterness and in my opinion somehow regardless of funny. Why is this film so interesting? I don't know. It's just and so it's not recommended.
