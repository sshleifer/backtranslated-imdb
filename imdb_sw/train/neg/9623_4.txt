Ben Stiller doesn't work as much as he responds. And he does very well. Much depends on the comedy going around him. There Is Something About Maria, the area of ​​the hair direction is used only because of Stiller trying to keep the same face. While fighting with two other fans of Maria, she is an unwanted boy in the room but the area is hilarious. <br /> <br /> Together Polly Polly, the formula decreases for reasons that are difficult to grasp. Stiller is surrounded by an array of comic talents. Hank Azaria and Philip Seymour Hoffman find the best lines, which there are very few. After saying this, Hoffman is very dependent on physical humor - you know we're in trouble when they go to the fart joke to laugh. The basketball area that Hoffman drives at a fast pace (though it gives us one problem in the form of an opponent with a shirt that raises a smile - visible through Stiller's reaction). However, everyone seems to work on a bubble, there are very few answers. The characters of Hoffman and Stiller could play more, more. Aniston again repeats his Rachael role, but is still Ross. It's more than "Joey and crush on Rachael" state. Polly is a number of com-com and that's a failure - it doesn't have a heart. You have no roots for characters. For a little work we can have a deep story, but eventually the failure of the film comes to the poor writing. It is worth watching if it comes to television on a slow night, but you will be sad to ask for money to see it.
