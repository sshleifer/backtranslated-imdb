This gives away some plot, by the way. Charlie Brown Christmas is one of the most timeless books that teach you the value of Christmas and just enjoy the holiday. This, however, is not recommended. Trying to capture the Christmas feeling of Charlie Brown, there is even another Christmas game, but it fails to worry and easy jokes. Charlie Brown does not know again about the Christmas spirit but she needs to buy it now for Peggy Jean (wheel of $ 25 ... what?). Sally's sister is the worst character in the movie. Here is one of his jokes: Sally wants to write a letter to Santa, but he doesn't know how to beat Charlie (for some reason he needs to be in his letter) so instead he decides to call Sam, because he knows how to Sam Sam. Also, Sally plays an angel in play with one word per day: "Hark!" He instead says the hockey stick (har har). If Sally says hark 12 times (all of the wrong voice sounds) didn't kill you, nothing will. Peppermint Patty and Marcy are a great priority, but that should not be better. Marcy is funny and her response to Patty, but Patty is another story. He feels like a boy (which does not give a rumor) and he feels when he should be a sheep in a dancing (both baas and both). It seems he is a sheep every year, and he worries he will forget his lines (verses don't have). He is worried he says twice, one after another, and gets the same response. I think he must have a short-term loss of memory, or something. Lucy and Linus are more welcome (although Linus still has some angry advice), but very difficult to air. I'm sure Schroeder don't even have in this. All in all, it tries to be a parasite in the past, but it has caused a message to quickly spread.
