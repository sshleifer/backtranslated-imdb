Where is it written where the sequels should absorb? Right 2 did not do! Others didn't! But this has proved ... The problems include the terrible actors (just Christopher Walken can act in the whole film), writing bad (you can't understand what is going on with me even doing research on the idea of ​​Nephilim before), and just the bad choice of making . Eric Roberts makes Michael the Archangel Michael who I have seen in my life! Avoid as a blow unless you love to see Christopher Walken. In this case you just hurry to the place where he is in the film, and avoid others. <br /> <br /> Yech !!!
