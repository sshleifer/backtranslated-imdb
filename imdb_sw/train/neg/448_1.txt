What I hate about this show is how the leaders are written badly. These women have no respect or respect. The whole plot is they devoted themselves to young people. Amanda Bynes talent is completely destroyed. He was a brilliant on "All" and his own show. Why would they write to him and Jenny Garth as the wind, airhead, desperate, men hunt, "the old boys" wannabes are more than me. Their discussion and conversation reminds me "Simpons", Homer says whenever Poochie's character cartoons are not on the screen, "Everyone should ask, where is Poochie?". All discussion points about stretching over a certain boy, and then stretching to someone. Sometimes they change and someone cries instead. Then they come back or break at the end. Two women are lazy, stupid, or drunk. The only word I could think is "gets".
