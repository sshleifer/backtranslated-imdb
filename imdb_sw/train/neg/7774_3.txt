For half an hour or so, I remember my soul thinking: "Hey, this could be very well successful Bill Billane forever!" The opening process is in the atmosphere, once it is a terrible time to enjoy our director even explaining his notorious stinker "Attractive to Spider Spider" through play. This concept is an attack that was stolen from the "House on Haunted Hill" of William Castle, with three million aged and highly motivated people who lost lost nine in a special house to win $ 1,000,000 in a lifting game. Typically, participants begin to walk fast and straight, and takes a very long time of bones before they realize that the old people are worried ... or there is another killer among them. The movie begins and ends with an amazing player who says many things that are not important or even interesting for the plot, but there is a very good T & A beautiful in the first ten minutes and that dumb's (Shelly, I believe is called) is a hilarious exploring . After the first half, it is usually not inevitable and "Cold" turns into a book of Rebane's text and losing losses, a casual conversation ever and a lack of total excitement. There was no budget for the bloody demonstration, but our most talented director (?) Tries to pay this compensation to the endless picture of the girls playing disco and the amateur rock band. The film also has four or five different achievements and none of them are small. Maybe it was an inspiration for LOTR: The Return of the King? Avoid this film, live again and happy.
