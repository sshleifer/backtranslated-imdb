This is one of the worst movies I have seen for a long time. The story was bad, talk was sad and hammy. I don't know if this film was the result of a home school project, but it certainly played like one. It's not particularly successful in its great pride to try to look like taking one continuously. Balanced camera pieces are the lowest and lowest price cuts.
