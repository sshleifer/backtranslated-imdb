One of the worst films I saw. How to define "worse?" I would like to have all the eye balls left out and then they had to dance on them more than they saw the dreck again again. Somehow, One-Hit Wonder Zwick can perform a film that is offensive at the time of Elvis fans, Mary Kay saleswomen, Las Vegas, gay, FBI agents and other human beings with any shoddy mind, sloppy farce encouraged them to deserve to be removed. How Elvis Presley Enterprises can allow Elvis's real music rights to be used in a high-quality film which appears to be "Elvis Presley Imitator is just fine" is more than me. The worst part of this mess - and that takes some work - is the mangled script: In 1958, Elvis's words and songs that he could talk / do in the 1970s have been taken! Bad effect special? That Oscar would go to the moron who decided that Elvis tomb, which is likely to be a graveyard / acceptance in the world, resembles a pyramid with a gold record that was beaten and located in the middle of a beach somewhere. To a large extent, many viewers of this film will be the fans of Elvis. However, the great folly (Nixon gave Elvis beta the DEA, not the FBI attributes ... and I can continue to continue) actually eliminates common wisdom. Ugh. I used the word "wisdom" to describe this stupid film. This is a terrible, awesome film.
