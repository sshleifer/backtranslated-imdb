A group of children establishes a theater to have a marathon of the terrible movie all night. However, if the night goes on, there is one of them killing them directly. Who ... and why? I saw this in the playground back in 1991. I expected - but the boy! Not working at all. Cluster is beautiful, very attractive young people and other benefits like Dee Wallace Stone on board ... but it doesn't work. The story stops half of the half (which could be because of the great editing before the film was released), the murder is the amount of blood (how this has R rating is more than me) and the unmasking of the last killer was boring and stupid. It is very bad - this film was capable. With this best script can be a great film of fear. As it stands though it's very forgotten and cast itself looks embarrassed and (I heard Stone won't talk about this). I give 3 and that's for cast.
