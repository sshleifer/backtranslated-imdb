OK. It is therefore a budget under the "film" (I used the quotation because it was shot in the Hi-8 video). Acting is very bad, the shapes are laughable (blood looks like it came out of Sherwin-Williams and I found the most insulting reactions made from kitsu halloween ghoul), and the lights looked like they used a pickup of someone who borrowed Toyota to shine head heads in executives. I might be able to forgive these low-budgets if there is a real content, if the movie tried to tell the story. But this video collection can boast no plot, no real characters, and no speed. It's a personal mess. Do not worry - no providers here, because there is nothing to destroy.
