When I borrowed this movie from a friend (with appreciation I did not buy it) on a pack (which looked bad and bad) was published "The last error of the vampire". After watching I thought that the marketing campaign was more expensive than the film itself. "Stories" begins when a boy (surprise!) Is expelled by vampire creatures / other zombie. <br /> <br /> Light, sound and everything reminds me of my first attempt to make a video on ten-year-old VHS-system if not worse. I gave 2 movie out of 10 and just because t-promo-T-shirts looked cool. I do not want to involve students of film or film splatter in general but I have seen Braindead and I have seen a 20-billion-dollar movie from students that was ten times better than this trick.
