I have seen the original German version which has not been called and I was surprised how bad this film is. Thinking I saw my part of bad movies like Ghoulies 2, Rabid Grannies, Zombie Lake and such, nothing would have prepared me for this! It was a pain of staying through this flick, if there was no plot, no good acting and even special effects do not convince, especially so-called zombies, without wearing anything more than making white clothes and their old clothes, so their good sets could not be damaged by ketchup stains marmalade. If you want to lose 90 minutes of your life, then look, for all others, don't do it, because you will!
