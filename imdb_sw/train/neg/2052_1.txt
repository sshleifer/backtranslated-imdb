Loss of this time is a very unwanted remake of a good film. There is nothing new or natural adding over Perry abbreviations, which has low interest. It does not feel the text of the first film and a sudden emergency that made it effective. It is also difficult to lose it is the sound of Quincy Jones that has increased significantly on the original film. I can't understand any high quality for this. It's quite bad. Why does anyone waste time or money doing like this and why have I lost time to watch?
