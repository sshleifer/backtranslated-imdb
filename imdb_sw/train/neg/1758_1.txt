If you haven't seen this yet, I just say add, walk in the garden, don't waste your time. The situation or acting is not worth your money. * Thieves * - I can't decide that it's worse: It's a movie itself or a hairstyle of Baldwin? Ellen Pompeo's gift is caused so much I hope she can improve for a while. Story story is simply unreliable. The command to lose US orders to fight offenders in Europe itself? Slavic detachment officers were protected by two hunks only ??? Emotional teacher teacher leads a group of lazy? Dumber police chief gold than a hammer bag? Give me a break. There is only one good thing about this movie, though: Of course, the cost of production should be lower than the "12th Sea" which were meant to and above like this.
