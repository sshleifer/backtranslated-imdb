I will be clear and sure. This film is not quite good. Part of the film I hated acting, script, story, direction and almost every editor. Amanda Peet has proved that he can act, for he was a step on 'Yards All of What'. So he should avoid this movie with ten foot foot. However, a small part of me has found this film very interesting. If you can forget about how the quality of production is, and if you get a joke of funny smut, then you should be the same. And for those who cannot stop your action, that's your choice. My inner child has not died, and I laughed a little. However, only 3 out of ten, because as a movie, it's actually decomposing.
