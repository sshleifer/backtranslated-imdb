Hawked as MOVIE IN EVERY TRADE, COMPLETED BY EVERYTHING - WHAT DO I THINK? It worked, I missed that we have invested in this tax. I and two friends were exhausted and we decided to see if all the cow on the film we saw on TV was true. Desire Comedy Out with all other networks that pushed this garbage to us! It was the worst movie I saw since Man Sneaky. I generally avoid those crappy, but got sucked in this one. We have been hitting a prick who advises us to lease, and its repetition of the rejected film. There is nothing good about this film ... even the "adventures of dickman" area was sophomoric better .. Paint me p *** ed. Imagine maybe the value of the production decreased for some important reason ... no. Don't keep this! for any reason. Not even a large amount of illegal substances would have this film be fun. That says ALOT. Please for the love of everything holy, if you value your sanity - never see this film. It is a lot of ignorance, meaningless, and meaningless to mention a few. But the main thing was aiming: exciting funny - failed miserably. Crash and burn ....
