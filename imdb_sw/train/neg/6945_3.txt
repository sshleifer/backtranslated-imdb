Thomas Archer (Ron Eldard) has his son killed and his wife was attacked viciously in the home invasion. Dr Heller (Christopher Plummer) tries to help him through trouble with post trouble. Then Archer finds himself in contact with a man (Til Schweiger) tied to the seat and slapped. He is told this is the man who killed his child and attacked his wife and can do anything he likes. And there is a great bridge there to help her ... The plot continues and turns. It all ends at the end of the old age which was old and ignorant that I was shocked anyone could think of using it again. How talented actors such as Eldard, Schweiger and Plummer have emerged in the trick if this is my most. This gets three stars for acting but a stupid plot and twist realistic twist makes this work stay.
