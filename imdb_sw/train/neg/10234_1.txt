I will put this short; thanks to Greg for helping me to keep this effectively: Capture is about a person who takes a drink, put him in prison and tortures a girl, then puts him as a prisoner to have sex with her. That is one blow and a punchline of the film. It is suffering as an act of slow rape. And, even not a good movie. Not bad is good; it's just bad. It should also be mentioned that among critics, there is a "code spoiler" that they do not want to break, though others were tested for this because it is very serious. Why no one had cojones to lift and say, "this is garbage, and that's why," is more than I have. Do not give these money to those who walk.
