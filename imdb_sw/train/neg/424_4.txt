Yesterday was the World Day (April 22, 2009) in the United States and other countries, and I went to see the film-feature film of the "World" and DisneyNature. I think, as automobile manufacturers, Disney tries to convince us that they care about the planet. Maybe they care about the planet, I don't know, but I don't think that allows a special unit with the word "nature" in it. I know that my little daughter loves Mickey Mouse, and who will I tell one-year-old personal feelings about Disney? <br /> <br /> In addition to the incredible movies, it was the usual desire of Disney to me. The previous and trailer of half of Disney movie, half of Disney clich√© ("life cycle", "fall of style"), top music, printed images (Disney claims "40% of new videos"). I was beginning to think that James Earl Jones's story is getting a little boring. I wish James Earl Jones, but his work to Disney and Morgan Freeman make every story of Warner Brothers begins to wear thin. In fact I think Disney bought some of the BBC pictures that were done carefully, they felt they could sell themselves if they played orchestral music and realized the sound used on it. <br /> <br /> And what is the absurdity of Disney and showing the fraudsters playing and killing baby animals? There were about twelve dozen events, full of young people bleeding during their throat. I think Disney needs to realize that animals have a rich and interesting life outside of life and the death of the fights that are attracted to the young people who are considered by the film they have found on this film with their parents. I also realized how Disney stood for so long to tell that someone had anything to do with climate change. Are they very afraid of the small minority of denying that they still think it's a controversial issue? <br /> <br /> I recommend this jump and rent DVD to Blue Planet on Netflix. Natural films seem to be better for UK at the moment.
