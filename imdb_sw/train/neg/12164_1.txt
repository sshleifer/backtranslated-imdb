This movie is not good.The first one almost faces, but it had an endless sense of doing so deserving to look at.this one does not have anything.there a terrible, zero tension or suspense.this not really a terrible movie.most of the murder not show nothing. they don't have to talk about this can almost be a TV, except for a little dirty and bit of violence. Acting is not very good, either. do not let me start the discussion.as by completing the surprise, surprising, no one.i suppose it would be worse, though I don't see how.but then again, it's less than 80 minutes long, so I think that's a good thing. though it was too long. it seems this is a refusal version of the film. It found it at a very affordable price, but it still doesn't deserve. / 10 from me. Psif you expect this film, maybe you will be a bored and unhappy girl. If you are a real fan, you would like to take the Sleepaway Anchor Bay camp (with live seat) a collection of three discs that have three first non-specific movies
