I've seen useless characters and stories are not good. I have never read this book (thanks), or it would have been a bitter experience. I got a ticket in the preview for free but it was still not worth my time, or my friend. I think this story is not worth telling. It is like saying that the ancient people have passed away before they have been older (they have not taken them). Life of the main characters were painful watch, one generation is not better than the next to avoid stupid mistakes. However, I think the participants did better with the cripples. I've been a big fan of Ellen Burstyn. I am writing this review to deal with the positive comments made, which unfortunately has believed me to give you an attempt to this movie.
