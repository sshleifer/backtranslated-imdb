Maria Bello does not seem to care what people think about her choice in movies. Again chooses a very complicated movie and not popular with stars. He probably needs these movies, to remove the sugar (aka "Hollywood") that he does here and then (Coyote Ugly and of course Mummy 3). <Br /> <br /> When I think it fails to achieve what it does (I can't destroy it), Maria Bello is as good as her other independent / small stars that the stars are. It is its performance that raises this movie. This along with the strange thing was close to my trick. But at the end (and even if I try to stop certain errors, like the bad and dramaturgy errors), the movie is still too long
