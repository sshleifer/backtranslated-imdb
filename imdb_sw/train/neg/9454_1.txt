When my child asks me to leave the show of the opening of this film, I know it's bad. I wanted to close my eyes out. I wanted to get through the screen and applaud Mike Myers for giving the last sacrifice of respect he has. This is one of the few films in my life I have watched and once I wanted to "unwatch", if possible. Another film is 'Troll 2' and 'Fast and Furious', both of which are better than this hip in hats. I might drink myself to sleep tonight for an attempt to forget I've ever witnessed insulting in the name of a good Seuss. <br /> <br /> To Mike Myers, I say stick to Austin or even revive Waynes World. Just because it worked for Jim Carrey, it doesn't mean Seuss is a success for all Christians. <br /> <br />
