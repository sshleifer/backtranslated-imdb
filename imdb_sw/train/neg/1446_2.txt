The movie is a long story of a classic novel that fails to completely capture the original adventure spirit. The terrible American Swayze is beaten as a British hero Allan Quatermain despite his transparency. <br /> <br /> Movie continues on to "Hollywood-ise" stories by changing every plot and characters to fit more comfortably in the acceptable mold. The film will be predictable, even for those who do not know the story and are faced with very serious acting and a great fight against despair. <br /> <br /> For all, add to the horror for the already a bad collection of movies based on the story of Mines King Soloman and Allan Quatermain.
