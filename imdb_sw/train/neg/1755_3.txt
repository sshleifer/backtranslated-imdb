This film does not exist of charm and also shows a little heat, but ultimately this effort is very free and focuses on the direction. There is no doubt that Mary Tyler Moore knows what to do with all her time of screens but she takes off too far off the cast. <br /> <br /> Another problem is paid to the script for cliches. A girl who secretly comes from university, an older woman finds it difficult to find a good job (and ultimately ends up with a job of contempt for justice), an executive network of worries and her toes that goes to glitz on property, a journalist who responds to his faith, etc.. There is nothing wrong with anything of these, that is, all of them are well rooted in reality, but together they are just too much to leave us with a very deja-vu and very little surprise.
