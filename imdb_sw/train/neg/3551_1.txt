This movie is very bad !!!! Decrease rapidly, slow to reach the stage with wooden characters that should not be there. The best part was to show the songs of Iron Maiden in some video on the theater and that. The latter was worth looking and waiting for but that was !! The characters in this film make me sleep around. Avoid !!!
