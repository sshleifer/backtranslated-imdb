O dear. good cast, but typing and redirecting art and writing Wit and automatic wit is a bit of work. Even making a good comedy you should find time and time right. I did not put it down there where I laughed loudly but it was very rare. My main goal was for a free free discussion, which made some people in this sad film. It can hear well when reading the script in your head but getting it out and with the camera is working differently. And the hand-held camera function provides energy for small parts of the film. The whole direction was good but the script is not all to me, but I'm sure you read the script in your head would be good. Sorry.
