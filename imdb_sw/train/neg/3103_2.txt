So there are past guards and a boy who dies and then there is a KEVIN, the greatest world. Kevin wants to impress his girlfriend AMY. When it returns from work to go ... a random house ... finds his "friends", KYLE's confused sex with DATHNE's true rebel. They have recently joined Daphne's boyfriend, a young boy of sexually active sex. And there are the beings of the head, the small puppets of dogeared who kill people by giving them the desire of their heart. Kyle's heart's desire is to engage with an attractive, clever woman in spandex. Nick's heart desire is to throw bombs at the school's school restaurant - I mean a nightclub. Kevin's heart's desire is to beat the pig pig and nunchucks. Amy's heart's desire is to be a disgusting slut. Daphne is already a slut of disgust, so they do not have a heart desire. On the way to hide the band actually hits the most amazing song. Hobgoblins randomly return to where they came from bus hitting. "Citizen Kane" can not hold the lights on this true American cinema.
