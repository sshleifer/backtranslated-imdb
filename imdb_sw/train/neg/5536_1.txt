The rebellion of the zombies is not characterized by redemption. I am tired and people say that it is not bad, and that the effects must be full of punch more in 1936. I think this is not true: not as IQ has grown steadily in the last 7 years. A common viewer in 1936 was perhaps as exhausting for this litter as an average viewer today. Why? Just try to look at the first events, and count among the things that happen, a great cut-off time, a slapdash configuration that appears to have two extra seconds on each shot to make time. Beware of the whole discussion: "I'll make tea / go out / read my book now." "And you?" "Yes, I am." This type of exchange occurs several times. Usually I would like that, to be a fan of bad movies, but see non-listers that include their interesting and stimulating lines, and all who want to laugh on the film are slowing down. This kind of long-term pensioners, the brewing of alcohol is much worse than the powerful, intellectual to think as the Eight Plan Out or the Cross of Santa Claus Martians. Those who say that this is "better" than the most interesting movies have a backlog of entertainment. This movie is not so bad that your jaw is amazed by surprise: it's bad for that your eyes are almost slow. Where is the worst.
