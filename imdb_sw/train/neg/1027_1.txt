Normally, I have the best things to do with my time than to write a review but I had lost much of this film that I spent an hour reading with IMD just to remove my chest. Would you think a movie and names like Morgan Freeman or Kevin Spacey would bet betsel ... well, this movie was just awesome. It is almost impossible to "suspend unbelief"; I tried, in fact, I wanted to enjoy but Justin Timberlake would not let me. Timberlake should be connected to the music, it is a bad act - HAI is an actor, NO character. It can't be blamed everything on Justin: The movie also brags a bad plot and bad editing; it is obvious "F". After seeing it, I need to wonder what motivates executives. I mean, certainly Morgan really read the script before taking part. Did he not see how poor it was? What then can motivate him to take part? Money? Of course, acting is often more about who is seen as well as rather than developing a better job. <br /> <br /> LL Cool J is a good actor; she gets a lot of time screens than Freeman or Spacey in this film and struggles to come up with poor conditions. At the same time, the audience goes: "Does hell continue here? Do you expect to believe this trick?" In short, far away from Justin the greatest widespread murdered - very desperate.
