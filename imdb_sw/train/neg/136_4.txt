*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Does all of the boy decrease due to natural drought? It's obviously so. First of all, this is a good premise that would have been well used. A little rejected brother who grows, pulls and kills all the girls who tortured him in hell when he was on top? Can't say he had nothing to work with. But this film flows in the same way as all other recent slasher. Everything from the logo to the camera device enables us to predict when a false alarm will come and when a killer will strike. We know the example now. These stupid stupid films pusher more and more trust in the minute. I would like to ask you something: Who, with their good minds, will surprise their friends in the dark, dreary darkness at midnight and surprise him out of the blue when he alone and surrounded by the dead? What? Does it make any sense of meaning? "Valentine" is just a creative time. One good shot involves filtering character of Denise Richards. He gets trapped into the pond and the killer plays with him for a chainsaw. There are some good songs in sound sounds, including direct track with Orgy. Music videos are available in a special DVD section. <br /> <br /> Even acting is the best mediocre. All actors sleep through their roles. Of course, David Boreanaz often becomes stoic, even to show him as a character of the title on "Angel." Denise Richards is a good actor, though, and puts a stone stone in the film. "Valentine" is as much as you would expect: engaging, unacceptable, forgetting, cheesy and without good fear in seeing. Do not break even. <br /> <br /> My logo: 4 (out of 10)
