Based on the Disney's practice of stealing. I grew up on the original series of the cartoon TV. Any time of the original cartoon series will give you more than a movie than this movie. There is currently no Penny computer book. It is also now the gag and the destructive orders that always end to eliminate the Great. The new is a soft chatting gadget (the original cartoon had a cool car that can turn on a car or a car) with a typical, non-realistic romance of mobile. Do not fill the buttons to pay administrators of Disney and even _ex_executives them - don't see this movie. <br /> <br />
