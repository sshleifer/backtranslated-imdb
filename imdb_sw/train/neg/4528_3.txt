Worldwide was the cheapest version of the NWA under Jim Crockett Junior and Jim's Crockett's Promotions developed after the 1980s on the "Big 3" Interviews on Saturday Saturday / Wrestling Craze Saturday. When Ted Turner put his hand on the NWA version of Crockett failed by NWA it turned out to be World Wrestling Competition and dropped all of NWA together. NWA World Wide and NWA Pro Wrestling were returned to the WCW logo and left the Disney / MGM Studios road in Orlando, Florida and finally became anything more than Nitro, Thunder, and Saturday WCW. Worldwide was the final WCW program under Turner for the weekend of WCW buying from Vince McMahon and WWF. Today the entire NWA World / WCW Worldwide Tape Archive as well as the entire NWA / WCW Video Tape Library is generally located in the Wwe headquarters vaults in Stamford, Connecticut.
