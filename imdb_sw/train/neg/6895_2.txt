The plan is rock. Acting is somewhere in the south of Jr. High School play. The movie is not bad but it looks like it was cut off by the machete. I could not decide this was a flick deliberate or if the people behind him really thought they were making a good film. Think Valley Valley From Mayberry RFD. People around the modern 'non-law' city are wearing small guns fast. It has more than its right part of the 'cutsey' items. Make Good Boys connect to the old farm house, and strengthen the Ford Mustang right in front of the crashed rail. Make a clerk at the hotel to watch the western movie (hemisphere) of Japanese tracking games but for English titles. It is amazing but it can be improved if you look at when you enter a little bit. It is a real curiosity and modern comparison for every western picture of the film that you can think of. There is even a modern version of the beautiful girl-dance girl, and the Jewish string in the sound of the voice. True! If someone brings this to your home for a Saturday night session, say 'your DVD player died.
