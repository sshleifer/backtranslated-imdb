I lost it because the second part bothered me like a little child. I snuck downstairs early one morning, start looking HBO, and The Raft (part 2) terror me good. At this time around, I still enjoyed Raft, though I could not tell if it was because of nostalgic or if it was really short. Two other parts were full garbage. I can't believe the producer somewhere paid to make this junk. All I did for this look was to destroy one more memory of childhood. Creepshow 2 will now join Rad among my list of classics of childhood childhood. 4/10
