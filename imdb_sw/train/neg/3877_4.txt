I was looking at someone with a wonderful mixture for the second time, and it was worse than when I first looked at it. I do not understand why it has become a 'ethnic tribe' as it is very quiet. The opening part looks promising, while the oil nurse will lower the canister of the blood and runs his beloved life. After all that is happening, it is a melting person around the trees and houses, while having a life trick like an astronaut. The shapes are very beautiful, and the face of the face is clearly seen. There is a cold place where he gives us the head of the mans in the river, and goes up to the waterfall where it falls on rocks and burst. There is not much to tie yourself even though, many events have been struck in the dark and you can't see what is happening. There is no big year, at least on the Vipco DVD I watched. No, The Good Smoking Person is not quite big. I will give you a score because of his cheese but that's about it. If you want SIC-fi / horror classic worship, see The Deadly Spawn instead!
