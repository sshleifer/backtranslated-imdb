Destroyers / Overall, one-line summary says all. Melville's "Le Samurai" is original and there are things "Leon". And they are better - better! <br /> <br /> In the "Samurai" Alain Delon is a specialist / professional killer who keeps the plane in the castle and steals cars for his work (with much emphasis on these scenes!). Even the end is the same: Samurai seeks death with respect and is getting shot with an empty gun in his hand. The world has changed and he has no place in Samurai. Delon does not kill many people as a dog of the Spirit. But I think Jarmuski liked "very" or even "Desperado" by Rodriguez. So this added, too. And I would think: a girl will be a professional as a dog dog (like Natalie Portman in "Leon")? Why Jarmusch consider after all? Where is the special, original thought in this film? I can't see the action in making a cellular copy. <br /> <br /> Rating 4/10 and Macaulay Connor
