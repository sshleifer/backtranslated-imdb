Describe this film as garbage is the same. At least root through trash can be a hobby absorbing. This flick was not interesting and unsuitable. Kevin Bacon can do a great deal, so he undoubtedly had an IRS bill to stay when he accepted this bad screenplay. The story of the 'Man Sneak' man was told earlier, he was told well, and he was told not to use special costly costs. Many of these unique effects seem to be built around the anatomical dolls of men, women and dogs you can buy in the early seventy years. In the UK they bought as a 'Person of Transparency (/ Woman / Dog)' which probably gets the name of this film. <br /> <br /> Help with special effects, false script, unintentional conspiracy. <br /> <br />
