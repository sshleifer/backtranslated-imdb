For Daniel Auteuil, Queen Margot 'was better. For Nastassja Kinski, 'Paris, Texas' was much better. The greatest desire from Chris Menges (`CrissCross' and 'Far World' cannot even be compared to this), and Goran Bregovic using the music version from 'Queen Margot' for this film (Beware of the film's end) . If this was a American movie pop, I can't feel quite surprised; but for European films and many independent actors and director, such a common approach to child abuse without a natural understanding is very simple and desperate. There are those bad people who rob and sell people down. There are those poor children who hate people to sell and wait to be saved by someone. And finally, there is a great hero who kills all bad people and saves these poor children from bad people. All character is displayed in black and white simple words: good against evil. More, from the beginning, I could understand how the story would end. What? Is this the end of the history of sexual abuse for children? I believe that the most difficult problem of child abuse and pedophilia is more difficult than is shown in this original film. I think this movie was not disturbing, but very terrible.
