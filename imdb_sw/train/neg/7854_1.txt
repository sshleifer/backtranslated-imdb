wow this is a very bad movie ever. The only reason I registered for IMD was so I could complain about this movie. I've never walked from the theater or drop the DVD but I almost stopped this (and I should). but I looked all the way to the end so that we could put it to the end of the horrible end. wow like this is all the western craven can produce its time is long. I've never seen the first and never after watching this. his horrible act and a terrible plot. hey looks the person who blows the glass in us allows you to go look. and the sad part is that when this movie came to the DVD it was completely watched in the blockbuster forever. so I feel bad for all the people who saw this junk.
