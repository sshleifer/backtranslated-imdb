I should say though this film was a formula for everything stolen from the film as Friday 13 / I Know What You Did Last Summer, this movie was not bad. In fact it was not as bad as many Horror Hollywood films recently released. Murder though very rarely also had just many cases, the original. It was a mediocre which is expected from the lowest elements of the budget but better than that of the major artisan label / Lions Gate released. My true complaint that was not due to the film budget, which should be limited, was the end of the "deviation" that emerged. Sorry but this is what to put this film in a bad group for me. The end was just stupid and it was done. Before that I was a little tired, but really enjoying it. 4/10
