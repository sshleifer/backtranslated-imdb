This movie thinks it is wonderful, exciting about someone who is looking for a lost girl. However, 30 minutes on the movie, it turns into a fantastic, untrue story with angry characters and random events. I can't imagine anyone who does not laugh when Cage randomly Karate hits the girl's blonde or when “carries” to beat the old woman. The line, the characters, and all actors should not be done badly from going. I have loved Nicolas Cage as an actor, but he has made horrible movies this year; this is far more (still ...). I would like to recommend this film to anyone who wants to look at the hardest interesting story. If you want to enjoy this story, enter the original tax. However, if you expect to look at it, use ready to laugh at the lines and end of events instead of taking them; that's the only way you enjoy this film.
