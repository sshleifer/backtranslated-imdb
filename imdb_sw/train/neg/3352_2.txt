I don't even know where to start here. "It's all about the family." That becomes the worst line of conversation that heard in the "awesome" film, though this can't be a terrible movie even though it has tried it! Ugh !!! And I know that Owen Wilson is an excellent actress. He should stop playing a token man who dies in every movie of the work (Anaconda, Armageddon). After all, that man made a co-writing "Bottle Rocket" and "Rushmore." He has some talents. Also, Lily Taylor should be connected to indie movies. They don't have this place. Finally, Catherine Zeta-Jones should be a star of porn. There is no place in a valid acting for him. I am bad. One of the worst movies I've ever seen, EVER.
