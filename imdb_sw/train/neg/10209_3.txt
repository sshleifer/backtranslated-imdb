Having been surprised by Sandra Bullock's performance in Miss Congeniality, I decided to give a shot and a shot at the shot. During respect in the roles of independence, the work of Mrs Bullock in "great roles" (see Hope of Hope, Speed ​​2, 28 Day) may be very desirable. His character is at the same time knowing, confused, and sexually (a small part of Sandra comes as an unnecessary filling that is not necessary to develop his already unknown behavior). Two young boys gave a good show, although their engineering expertise and get-me-like-like can be faced with a stupid mistake that shouted "We did!" Chris Penn if all of the obvious suspect disappears here, as well as a partner of Ben Chaplin's sign / characteristic interest. Close-up Sprayers *** A helper working away, serious mistakes can be tracking a TV-week-old plot that you have never bought in the first killings, and as described , cyclical errors (vomiting a rare food in the murder area, is very easy to form a school teacher, two boys living together in public, proper love because of friction, etc. etc.) leads to a departure outlook and despair by murderers. The end was "for Numbers" and it was a desperate thing for the movie. Using the currently selected approximate method of displaying the climactic location at the beginning of the film, and then filling the audience with how we arrived at the time, the last events did not surprise anyone and did not have anything known as the film model was supposed to reach that conclusion. A certain promising concept, but is beaten by the weak in almost every way. * from ****.
