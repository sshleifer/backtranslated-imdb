There is a lot of suffering these days. That's all this movie is. It's about a good person who makes a bad decision. Because of his kindness, he is difficult for two psychological women. From that time on his attack. I don't know what time you're doing something about it. There is a wife and baby out there somewhere; he has great feelings of guilt and fear. But there may be several times where he could do. Movie seems to be a man's bread. I think after the murder of Manson, we had little procedures on the love of these two. However, why does one make a film like this? What is an appeal except for sadism. The conclusion is not very good, but that would be amended by the clear purpose of the plot. Oh, well. Another hour and a half of my life.
