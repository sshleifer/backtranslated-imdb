This movie is just dumb. <br /> <br /> From the cast of Ralph Meeker as Mike Hammer on a horrible peak, the film is a practice of wooden forecasts. Mike Hammer is one of the true sociopaths of false conversion. Unlike Marlow and Spade, who put the pieces together to solve the mystery, the hammer breaks things away to find the truth. This film turns to a hammer into a boob by around it and bad people who are ... well, it's also dumb to leave with nothing. One is so impressed that it hits popcorn attacks. Other parts of the film are outside the Stooges Playbook. The Velda Dance for the road, for example, or a bad person who hurt his boss back. And the continuous rest is embarrassing: Frau Blucher runs down the middle of the road when the camera is standing on its lower foot but she is on the side side when the camera turns to a wide shot. The worst break, however, precedes the popcorn attack. An evil man who hits a hammer passes an hour after our hero, unless the hour shows he was seven minutes behind our guy. To be right, there were interesting corners of cameras and lights, and a great finale is so bad that it should appear, which is the only reason that gets two points out of 10.
