I can't believe the positive views of this film - I thought it was one of the worst movies, caused by the wrong I saw. And the plot was quite difficult (sp?). He begins to do with him when he is bound to the chair? rental. The worst part is that it was not bad even in a good, interesting way. The only fearful fear - I couldn't think why they failed to show it in HBO. I thought Belushi was very surprised - very unknown as someone "was" to hit. idk, I could continue - again, lacking good feedback. The only thing that made me look at it is fun to see how the movie could go wrong and what is causing it to be bad. And at last there was no desire in his silliness either! "live by the sword, die of a sword ..." ignorance.
