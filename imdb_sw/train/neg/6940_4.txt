When you have two houses of a tower of singers that are beaten against each other, at least you can expect it to be a good mix and that is the case in this film where we have 64-year-old Amitabh Bachchan forgives 34-year-old Tabu. In fact all that is the name of the plot so instead of the "scissors" is the content that is "Kum" in this Adman turned out the author's author-director R. Balki. <br /> <br /> Trust two senior artists The house down with their prudent cracks and time of bitterness when love appeared in this unusual pair, and that's all you get the first half but fun. London districts as sent in the rainy season are interesting. At the end of the first half, romance has been completed and the message is being done. No amount left to say. So in the second half the strange resistance comes in the form of the father of the girl to the extent that he goes to Satyagrah is a test of patience. There is a wonderful peak of how he gives. As a result, the second half is dry, flat and no energy. There is a subplot and a child who dies to cancer, not a great effect. However, the film is recommended in its pure way and exhibitions.
