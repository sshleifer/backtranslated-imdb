I have never seen anyone playing this film and I think I could be the first one. It was wrong. In fact I had no look at his end. It was like watching boring soap or one very good (all soap is crap). Participants were poor and the story was bad. The person who was rated 10/10 does not know what he is saying. Script was bad. 2 People were in an angry conversation involving threats and expecting a good person to say something good and beat a spider from him but no. He says "If you do that ... I'll hurt you" Hahahahaha. If the comedy is your thing, look away. Please do not look at this film because ... It's CRAP !!! <br /> <br /> Summary: Bad act, bad war, bad script. <br /> <br /> Don't look at it! Of course this is in my opinion.
