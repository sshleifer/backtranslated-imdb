The weekend of "Nightmare Nightmare" of Henry Sala is a rotting piece of sludge from Troma. A bad assistant professor loves girls in an extraordinary plan to do a secret experiment. Using the predicting the brain converts victims to their date in zombies. "Weekend Nightmare" is a perfect piece of garbage that has a dirty dirt and some cheesy gore, not to mention the color of the laughable music. it's bad and the script is not quite suitable. Why this piece is taken more than me. Remove as a blow.1 out of 10.
