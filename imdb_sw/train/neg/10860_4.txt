This was a desperate film for me. It came to me by putting a box with the head, "Classic Film Noir," which was a gift from someone who knows I usually enjoy the film done in the same style (I insist that Black is fashionable, not type). I don't think it's a totally black film. It seems to have a modern tendency to write and sell every black and white B made from 1947 to 1955 as black, and the label is not recommended every time. There is the main character of humanity, Ed Cullen (Lee J. Cobb), and many film stages take place in the house. That's about the only things that I could see. There is no widespread paranoia, or any true cause that one should feel compassion for by Ed Cullen. Jane Wyatt was distressed and did not feel like a fatale woman. I don't want to destroy this film for potential viewers. However, I would be willing to hear what others involved with film films should say about it.
