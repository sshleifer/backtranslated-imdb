There is a very good movie emerging just below the surface of the layers on the cheese layer that is "Pagemaster". I realized this when I looked again this morning after refusing it for years. I remember hating it when it first came out, but this time, I found that special effects are very good. The program is “Neverending Story” with the ultimate innovation of innovation, but it's a little flick for anyone who just wants an eye of an amazing eye. Animation is amazing, and I liked exactly how the leaders leave their characters to look and act a little more than usual. I give the third grade as I * would give them two (just for the value of testing) if I ever decided to watch this film intending to beat my mind of the story.
