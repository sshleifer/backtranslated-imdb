"The piece is a cake" is a history of failure, the history of the worst kind of reform, which is the only action is to destroy the rights of fighters (trusted to be emerging). It left a very bad taste in my mouth. In March 1989 "The Moon of the Moon", Roland Beamont wrote a war on the way that RAF Fighter Command was shown in a mini-TV series. A few words should repeat: It was never meant to be a failure at any time in any force that I saw in practice, and the lack of childhood was shown in the 'piece of cake'. .. ... The current situation was much more similar to the good rugby club, although with more discipline. again and below. ”/> <br />“ There was no conversation about 'courage' or 'fear'. People would have guts or were not - but actually did. But we knew the fear, we saw it in ourselves and with each other, made our control of control, and then we went on to work ... I could feel 'glory', but there was great meaning, and there was nothing similar to the 'piece of cake'. "Beamont was, in his own words," the fighter of a fighter who, unlike the author and producer of a recent television series, was at that time ". Beamont served with all 87 squad in France and BoB, before continuing to be one of the first performances of Mavumbwe and strong winds, and post-war trials. <br /> <br /> "The part of the cake" is entirely, the total representation of airports in Fighter Command did at that time. It is not subject to complete and real shame.
