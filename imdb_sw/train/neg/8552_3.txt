... see the poor Robert Webber character (better performance, once again!) who tries to compete a small gun machine from one of the terrorists. Everything in this film seems to be a little wrong. The biggest mistake in my opinion is the efforts to give a solid step in the realities of the 1980s (the fundamental difference between this flick and the most fantastic, wonderful and therefore long-term Die Hard). The story comes through a failed attempt to honor SAS orders. Ideas like when the command is shouting? "The lowest" all good people do so and all the bad people are not that they can lose ad lib (with good conscience), that the main character is not available for the masked command though he is wearing the same clothes and carries weapons from their weapons seems to be impossible it makes it difficult to take the film with weight. And it just happens that you try to be more fun. The toilet-mirror-signal section ... I do not know the resistance on Pacifist movement as a shield to criminals and move between a fan of peace and settlement, even the leaders of power representatives in this movie. The sad thing as the film shows the first performance of Judy Davies.I does a great fanatic and seems to have done a lot of lessons on the subject. ‚ÄùHowever, her performance is a summary on others and somehow I feel the movie leaves her.
