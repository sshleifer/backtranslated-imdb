Simply put, this is a bad movie since the "Police Academy: The message of Moscow" (if you liked that movie maybe you would like this). What were they thinking about? Other ideas should just sit, the idea. The fact that this idea may be itself to the film must be a criminal offense. What was so bad about this I hear you ask. One word ... ALL. <br /> <br /> Costs of Employment: $ 4.50 Cost of Check: 89 minutes / <br /> I want to pay money for all!
