"Bank" (1915, Chaplin) "Bank" was one of Charlie 1915's Essanay films. While this film group is more visible than their peers in 1914, this seems a little less than average. Gag and the vault of the double unit of linking and unfortunate that has Charlie rise from a dream, where it reduces the hair of the leading woman, and takes the head of the diagram she used as a quasi river, is a common time for Chaplin. They are all amazing start and end. In the middle is filled and fought with a partner partner partner and making a bank robbery to win a girl. The artwork is probably the most exaggerated of this film and Charlie uses it to the effect of comedic professionals if it is his attitude or not. The picture seems to be that Charlie's change to do what he wanted he could do but not with his own hands. Interesting things but there are better.
