It is a good cast, but the film does not have a place near the original grace of the Italian comedy "Big Deal on Madonna Street" Anyone who wants a film of film entertainment should visit nature. William Macy can be one of our most active participants, but here he uses less. And his role in nature was played by Marcello Mastroianni, so I feel sorry to try to fill these shoes. You can also try to imitate Bogart or De Niro less. The orientation of the art is rich and textured but does not bring something into the story, the extra bits they add to the feel completely unnecessary and the items they take are missed. Even from the way they do it seems strange and takes away the original surprise. Sam Rockwell has an odd and priority charm and Luis Guzman has an unusual charisma, but part of the love part of the movie looks just a genius and flat. It is so bad that no one has decided how to make this film as it was first made, but again it is very bad we live in a culture where we feel like we need to fix things rather than just learning to enjoy nature.
