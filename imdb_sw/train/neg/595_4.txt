Go - "Your trip is over." Some of the biggest events and ... well, yes, it's all over for this film. <br /> <br /> No real plot, no story. Inappropriate characters, well, 'characters' are incorrect because you have no clue that anyone is real. I mean, they are driven by something else to look into the sewers (which is this? Why is it there?), That is a horrible thing I think, but I really care? No, I don't. Why not me? Because I have no clue that these people are and I don't know if I would like to live or die. It is one of the direction and depends on the sound effects and sounds to frighten you, which does not. This video has no meaning, any purpose. It feels like I have slept and I have lost 45 years of building. It jumps right into action. Basically, some women and friends are locked up in the London River below, driven by a weird creature, and finally run away. Creep has time to make you curious, the art is good, the scene is good and the sound is the same, but that doesn't make the movie a really awesome, unfortunately everything that loses. It is not new. Another modern predictable mistake, where Kate (the 'leading' behavior) often makes a fool 'hey, I know you are sitting at home you think you must do a good thing in this situation, but, ohoh no! Do anything contrary to me because I it's a "silent blond" thing. I wish they could not do it, it has been done many times, it is boring and it is recognized. here's a long line of films, yes, a trip to the film is only a short time on the film.If you've had a few beers, you've contacted two girls, then, look at all the way. , try.
