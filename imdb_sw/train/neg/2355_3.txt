I've almost ever been opposed to the insertion of songs in the movie. My belief was that the quality of the film would be improved if only those sad songs would have been considered. However, things have changed quickly after watching Black black (no songs) with this movie, many songs. When Black was so severely violent, it provides an interesting story with a powerful guide and good leadership. The songs were close and connected to the film. Certainly no woman is drenched with water because there is no clear reason for the water-rich sources of water while blowing down the street at night. I was so surprised by the courage and not being used by the director. There was no microphone on anything and almost every area was completely trusted. I would like to recommend these films to Indian speakers and at least a little understanding of Mumbai's life. The former because the English density was low and had many errors which, sometimes, completely changed the meaning of the actual information. Finally because you will know the exact accuracy of the exhibition once you live yourself. I would like to have this title as an internationally recognized job. The events with the touch drivers were a good touch and was used simultaneously as a source of real humor and another view on the entire mishmash. The film is not opened in a few places, however, while characters sometimes say trivial things that block the film's direction. I also thought that several sad events were not done very well. It was an exciting touch look, instead of awakening any feeling of sadness and the whole area had emerged as a fool. These are minor issues though, because the film, in general, is treated with a rare look. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a stupid, ambitious view and one of the fun! Staff, not 'heroes' - that's the key. The source of seeing honest people in a strange environment - daily life. A back-of-scenes look the level of dirt and a rare ray of hope for Indian movies. <br /> <br /> 8/10.
