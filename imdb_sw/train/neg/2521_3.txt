There are many problems with this movie, but the bottom line is that you tried to do too much and very little. The basic story is quite good, but the money was not available to do the right of the story. Non-existent budget was killed this film. Stuart Gordon (author / director) has a talent for writing on 'Honey, I've left Children', which was a box office smash. However, the film had great financial support from Disney. In fact, this is a good example of when you don't make a film. If he had been waiting a few years, the technology would have made it easier to do more harm. (not to mention he could get a company with money.)
