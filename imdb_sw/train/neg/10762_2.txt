This was an inspiration from the local video store. Don't make the same mistakes I did. This film is exciting, uncomfortable to work, and generally interesting. The discussion between the little priest and his uncle is inadequate and made; I broke every area they shared. Dennis Hopper performs a few performances and it is its regular separation; his role was not clear for him. And although the movie is thought to be installed in Puerto Rico, it feels much more like Hollywood movies; All the characters are of Caucasi and several have English and accents of pseudo and Ireland. Unusual. However, when you see this on your local video store shelf, keep walking.
