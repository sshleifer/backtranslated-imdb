I was bored, around 10pm, so I watched this film. And I couldn't stop laughing. Everything was so ridiculous. Ways in which children were doing were just over 11 were lost. One of the children had a ring, which is thought to kill people after 3 or more years. He gave me a feeling that he wanted to be a gangster. It is difficult to take small children with weight, especially when it is related to eating insects. They act like everything is a great deal, like Billy (the main character) does not make worms then the world will end. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie for young children (without the fact that the age of 5 says 'penis'), but not for young people or adults who do not want to waste their time.
