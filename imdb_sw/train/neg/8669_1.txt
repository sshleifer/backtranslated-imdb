First of all, I liked the novel by Ray Bradbury. It's a kind of fear that gets under your skin and sticks you later. It was one of his best books, and, you know, Fahrenheit 451 and Dandelion Wine. I just hope that this film will be the same. It had many opportunities, and cast much, like Jason Robards and Jonathn Pryce. And Bradbury even wrote the script himself. And above all, it has PAM GRIER! How can it fail? It can be destroyed inside. <br /> <br /> First of all, it was dropped. Many fears from the book were lost as Bradbury must have been forced to put the violence to a minimum. All displays from the book ... have gone. Everything that made you play ... went. <br /> <br /> And then there is acting. Like many films that Disney provided in the 80 years, children in this movie can not act. And, this gave me a lot, and no one looked at 13 but 9 or 10. Their strong friendships were never addressed. It was like it was friends. <br /> <br /> You think Jason Robards and Jonathan Pryce can pull this into their roles of Mr. Halloway and Mr. Giza. But here's if they don't care. All they want to do is somehow pay some credit or something. This is far from being some of their best displays. <br /> <br /> Pam Grier was as good as a witch, but the Witch Dust player himself was not well pulled off. He is very bad and does not exist as he did in the book. Everything is left out of the book. On the night of the ballon expulsion, marking the house of Jim, the actual death of Mr. Giza, happened to Mr. Coogan on enjoy-go-round, finally the trader of a sharp stick, the actual death of the witch, and oh much more. And the special effects were bad, even for the 80 years. The surprise-go-cycle of punishment for one thing and the powerful powerful horses did not have much beauty, and that weird fog that we had nothing to do with anything. I could go on with how this movie searched the original novel, but it makes blood boil. Do not see this movie but read the book. It's a classic of Bradbury.
