Look, I loved the Anchorman film, but this was very bad. The worst kind that makes you want to find that time in your life, the worst kind that makes you think “what the world thought that this film was first”, the worst kind that makes you want to take 50 minutes while entering the kitchen to get snacks during the movie therefore, the worst kind that makes leprosy happy, the worst kind that makes you think you want to rent the film Pauly Shore instead of ... In fact, I can't describe how this was so bad. <br /> <br /> After saying that .... there are some laughs in half, but all is much more wonderful than Anchorman. Indeed, they tried to make it entertaining and fun, but any lesson that was left out of Anchorman that made it here was actually left for good reason ... it was not good at all. Do yourself a warranty (or USA, grace), or do not see this DVD ... it will destroy the film that Anchorman is and you don't want to do it. <br /> <br /> Right ... I'm right now.
