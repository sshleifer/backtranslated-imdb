It was not an unfamiliar filming experience, but it certainly is not as interesting as it tries to be good. Combining the beauty pictures and computer drawings, this is the story of the mustang, later called the Spirit (Matt Damon, giving the first details of the person), and traveling through the Old West borders. Basically he is born free from all other horses in good land, then he has been robbed to serve as a saddle horse, he can give all who try to ride him. However, when flying his castle, with Little Creek (Daniel Studi), the two form friendships, oh, and certainly has something for the Kidney Creek horse. At the end, after the further flight, after the expulsion of Colonel James (James Cromwell) and his men, and making the last major string on the mountain, Little Creek allows the Spirit to go, and also provides his female horse, and runs home to their country and horse races. Also star Chopper Bernet as Sgt. Adams, Jeff LeBeau as Murphy / Railroad Foreman, John Rubano as a soldier, Richard McGonagle as Bill and Matthew Levin like Joe. I looked forward to contacting the horse in this film, but it seems that like something of Dumbo all over, and Bryan Adams songs are not more involved, but it's not a bad film. Selected Oscar for the Best Animation feature, and selected the Golden World's Best Song by Bryan Adams' "Here I Am". Okay!
