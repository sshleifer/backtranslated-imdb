I longed to see this film. Many people seem to be excited. I also have my faith. I believe in Jesus Christ but I am open to any kind of comment or opinion. It does not matter to me, as Jesus was in the way written in the Bible. If Mary was a virgin or not, or any other similar to pagan covenants. What is important to me is the idea of ​​salvation, the idea of ​​love as the only way to find peace in this world. What has caused my anger is a person who takes judgment, presenting it as a fact but without a written encyclopedia. For example, they showed in this film after the great judgment: "Those my enemies who did not want me to be their king - bring them here and kill them before me" Jesus (Lukas 19:27) What they did to tell you is the context. Jesus told a story about a wicked king. There is no passage in the Bible where Jesus supports the killing. He is love! After quoting the biblical errors they show us they are playing people (pseudo-christians) filled with hatred. Many viewers do not look at the details given so that they can think of Jesus = hate = inappropriate for me or for anyone else. This is the people who cheat pure. Please use your brain. Don't take everything as the truth they tell you in this film. We destroy our own foundation, our civilization as we begin to break Jesus in this way and the message He brought us. You saw a branch that sat down.
