I would like to say that curiosity was best for me. If you just noticed the trailer, I'd like to tell the whole plot of the movie; I could save myself an hour uncertain and forty minutes throughout my life, and about twenty dollars. This movie was a catastrophe that awaits to happen, and it is a shame to Hollywood. <br /> <br /> The movie shows an ignorant ignorance of the truth. For example, a remote drive to control the drive goes everywhere, and even into the house. It's even covered with clothes. What? Is it not reasonable to believe that a village can no longer send signs under these conditions? Hollywood certainly did not believe it. Common logic and any concept of lightning describes the contrary; I doubt that the race car can even reach the road, not put the house on the road. Another false character is the lack of intelligence that criminals have. Why is it in all these movies, these criminals are rocket scientists until they meet the age of eight? Does the child mean being the most intelligent person in the film instead of professional terrorists? Please, there is more truth in the Matrix. Also, the leader puts his real pistol and "crash" takes a plastic pistol; apparently, he could not distinguish. Even with immunity, one should be able to do so. Just because they seem right doesn't mean anything; there is another mind then see. Traps are also false; if any of them worked, the criminals would die. But, Hollywood expects us to "laugh" on the "wonderful" results of traps. I don't laugh; I was afraid to buy my eyes. But, I recommend this movie to anyone who thinks they've seen a very bad movie; The movie they saw will appear as Citizen Kane compared to this. Otherwise, skip this because of your pride. Home alone 3 also brings a question. We all know the stars of Alex D. Linz in the film, but also wrote?
