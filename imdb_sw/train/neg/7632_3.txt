Many people see this as a classic, but it must be missed something. Life in Anarene, Texas in 50 years is very good - which means that the film about life in Anarene, Texas early 50 years will be very good too! What? What do most people see in this? Once the last picture of Anarene's photo will stop there will be nothing to do in the city. Duane (Jeff Bridges) makes that point at the end of the movie. But even before the closure is not much to do, so basically everything is about sex. High school students plan how to lose their daughter - sometimes with each other and sometimes with some of the same people who are similar to the city. You see, they don't have much to do it - except to have sex (sometimes with each other and sometimes with aggravated teenagers) or right over a high school football team. Three times something happened that I thought was adding a player to the movie. Sam (Ben Johnson) dies unexpectedly, but nothing happens for that reason, Sonny (Timothy Bottoms) and Jacy (Pastor Cybill) elope, but nothing happens for that reason, Joe Bob (Barc Doyle) robs the little girl , but nothing happens really for that reason. The only thing that added anything of great value to the movie came at the end and Billy's death (Sam Bottoms) which shows a shortage of life in this small town, since men stand next to look at the body discussing where to go for breakfast. Peter Bogdanovic photographed this black and white picture, which is intended to explain how this village is, but the only thing I liked was looking for actors like Water, Pastor, Bridges and Randy Quaid. (If aside it was horrible to see how much Chaaid - in 1971 - it really looks like her characteristic of Cousin Eddie in the National Holiday Holiday Vacation.) Classic? I don't think so! 3/10
