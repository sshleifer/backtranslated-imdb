This is not one of the best Arbuckle or Keaton movies, indeed. The wife of the father is tired of drinking him so much, so he takes him to the sanatorium where Keaton thinks he has a sure cure! Well, there, Arbuckle accidentally eats the thermometer and is considered a surgeon. Then, he runs and chased away where he meets a beautiful girl who also wants to escape. Finally, despite the dismissal of the workers, they run when it becomes clear that the girl is mad and Arbuckle has recently been made again. However, he wakes up everything after surgery has been a dream - there was no beautiful girl girl and Dr. Keaton is not as great as he was seen in a dream. of humor is a great trouble with the film. Indeed, making people with mental illness is very interested, but in her day she was sure to laugh. I would like to laugh, too, if there is just something interesting to answer! Most energy and all that. <br /> <br /> FYI - during a series of tracks, Fatty surprises in the race of more than 200 pounds (wow, what are the odds of that?). And, after recently, he comes back to the post which the number 5 was just colored. As a result, five are now behind the Fatty shirt and looks like a normal participant. KILEKA, the number should appear back on Fatty's shirt but it came out of the front - fault, if they should recognize the image of the mirror would be back 5.
