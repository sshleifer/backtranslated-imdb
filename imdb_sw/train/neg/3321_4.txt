Normally, I know after the first minute of the film if I like or love it ... but now, I was wrong. It was good; "This depends on the true story" and blah blah blah something was funny. Later, cartoons and the definition of life of boys and pictures make me think I have made the right choice. <br /> <br /> Then, seeing the fake care of Toronto was cool. Also, the appearance and appearance of the house seemed to confirm my first idea. <br /> <br /> That was perhaps the first 10 minutes of the film ... which was later seen as ever. It is probably not just understanding the Canadian English humor (that's possible, the British Canadian also do not know every time the Quebecois humor), but he ... there were enough things for it for a short movie, * no * more. Maybe that could mean to the head? However, almost everything was filling, and a few things were close to comments in my opinion. <br /> <br /> As a fact, "doing" was better than the movie. At least you understand the motivation behind what made everything wrong. The possibility of the idea was good; that's why I took the movie, with the intention of something "amazing to people". However, I did not know the whole world would leave, and therefore even the movie's stage. <br /> <br /> If you are English Canada, it seems you can appreciate the inner humor, based on the amazing number of people who gave this film.
