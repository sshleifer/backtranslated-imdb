Take: <br /> <br /> 1. play popular <br /> <br /> 2. The director and now think of himself who uses <br /> <br /> 3. copy of the design of the most popular production stage The playground mentioned in 1. <br /> <br /> 4. The leading actor - who has no feelings for the playback and you will find: "Hamlet, Prinz von Dänemark" the "Hamlet" and Maximilian Schell as Hamlet and I was very disappointed. I hoped that the display version would be better, that Schell would have a body language to emphasize what he says - nothing. Then set ... the minimalistic structure is not the taste of everyone, but often I love when there is just enough on the point of describing what the environment and nothing more. Alas, that's on stage, in the theater. It does not work in a video-driven film which actually has a reliable environment. That the idea of ​​setting was given from the theater that Schell played with Hamlet already ... let's say if that's the only thing to complain about ... Play Hamlet for the second time. If you have the option to watch any sixty-movie movie "Hamlet", don't look at this, unless you're awakechist, or really hard, or like to enjoy non-qualified actors.
