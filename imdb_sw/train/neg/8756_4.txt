Russell Hopton did in many films until his death in 1945. He only guided 2 and "Black Gold" was one, (another was also from 1936). Frankie Darro had the presence of a screen sometimes but for this he was playing a beautiful baby. He was quite clear on the "quickie" cycle - made too many films. In this he plays an old fat player who believes that he will soon beat the oil. <br /> <br /> J.C. Anderson (Berton Churchill) tries to convince an old man to sell if he knows that there is any oil being beaten at any time. Scientist, Henry, comes to the area and helps the father "Fishtail". It also encourages "Fishtail" to go to school regularly. Henry has his eye on Cynthia, a good teacher. This was the final film of Gloria Shea - she had started her career as Olive Shea in "Glorifying the American Girl" (1929). "The father of fish" is killed when the rig is destroyed by Henry has brought Anderson and his investigators to justice. Henry was kidnapped Anderson tries to convince "Fishtail" to sell his lease oil. All fits well with oil fired by "Fishtail" to Military School. It's okay for rainy days.
