Because a person is under 10 years does not mean they are stupid. If your child likes this film you would like to be tested. I am always wondering how many people can participate in something that is so changing. This "movie" is a display for the digital ministry and NAME. Writing is bad. I can't remember when I heard such a bad conversation. These songs are not harmful. Acting is small-par but then participants are not given much. Who decided to hire Joey Fatone? He can not sing and he is as bad as sin. The worst thing is the transparency of all. It is as if the authors went out of their way to make it all as stupid as possible. A great children's movie is bad, skilled and full of film films like Shrek and Story Story in recent years, Willie Wonka and Witches mention two past. But in frequent sleeps for more than America surveys to get lost as Finding Nemo (yes, that's okay), Charlie's recent and Chocolate Factory and rubbish crossing such as Red Riding Hood.
