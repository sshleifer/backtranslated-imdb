Teacher of cheap, Rolfe Kanefsky, finally makes a film that does not do the same on the Playboy Channel. "Hazing" lends a lot from everything that came before Nightmare at Elm Street to Evil Evil, but it still will be able to do so with enough humor to make it possible ... just hard. The characters are cardboard, the conversation is timber, the story is a thin paper and the participants could not act their way out of the grocery bag. Put it all together and you have a donkey's dancing ball. Sometimes, when I'm bored, I would eat paper. Watching this film is much like that. Chew on it for 90 minutes and leave with a wonderful taste in your mouth and no nutritional value.
