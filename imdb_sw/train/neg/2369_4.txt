The sixth trip to Freddy Krueger who was finally able to kill almost every boy in Springwood; now wants to expand its scope and (** SPOILER **) needs a family member to do so. <br /> <br /> Failure as a terrible movie because it is not just awesome. Makes good as a black comedy, black macabre, telling you the truth. Freddy Krueger has now been removed from all his ability to persuade this viewer. (Most publications, indeed.) Pastors are not happy (safe Robert Englund, as usual, and Yaft Kotto decreases) and there are many effects to see too much. Finale is the same but does not give too many sparks as I think someone can hope. <br /> <br /> In a new addition to the known story of the killer of dreams, it provides Englund opportunities to make more non-performing scenes than ever before. <br /> <br /> There is a value cameos to recognize: with cameo and couple Roseanne and Tom Arnold which does not value entertainment, appearance appropriate and veteran shock-rocker Alice Cooper, and funny comeo by Johnny Depp that also kind accept the pop icon that was. Breckin Meyer's first movie, who plays Spencer. <br /> <br /> One of the best things about it is to reflect on key events from the previous details during the closed credit. <br /> <br /> 4/10
