First of all, not a big fan of modern Turkish movies, which is because, the typical example of creating a successful office box is blowing down the waistline. This movie is not an artistic thing that takes the currents, as the director's advertising and marketing shows. In my opinion, the sole purpose of this movie is money to touch the sharp trend (in fact it is widely considered in the country of origin) affordable populism can provide a short definition of what I meant. <br /> However, acting is quite close. In fact, most of the cast has a history of exhibition and try hard to pay compensation for what Altioklar did not; talent! All members of the cast were fully perfect in their roles and qualified professionals, even those with limited skills. (Like Janset) At least, Altioklar deserves a small word of gratitude, because he knows how to choose to be cast. Other than that, he is just a media monkey, who thinks himself to be a director and artistic talent. Come, art is not just something that only includes women's nakedness and half. And just because the media is coming, no director is the most important in the history of Turkish movies. Just close to your ears and something modern sophisticated, I am waiting for your enthusiastic work next. Hope, this time you manage to achieve artistic techniques. <br /> <br /> In short; Benefits> Good acting, hot women (just!) Cons> Everything, everything except cast
