I really tried to love this film. It deals with the most important problems in any society: sexual abuse. In this story we learn that you can lose everything when you have sex. In this case, our main character and hero, for having non-stop sex with all kinds of women (mad, kinky, neurotic) puts a risk in his marriage, his work, and even his life. production standards are terrible; especially acting. Oh, you won't enjoy any sex scenes, most of them happen to a very bad taste and you can think you're looking at home made. Secondly, the plot is simply non-emotional. How can a wise and good wife stand up for all the bad things from a husband? What? Could he believe him? The exciting situation is worth it and will make you a little longer. Also, the area that serves the black movie black and meaningless and will stop thinking "wtf?". <br /> <br /> Such events will find a lot. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie. Please, avoid; not the foundation of the soft, not the documentation, not the main feature. It is an attempt to independently create a director called a document or anything. <br /> <br /> It is Mrs. Kinski's only feet that are shown worth checking. I got it in HBO and I'm glad I didn't spend my money on it. But those 90 minutes of my life will never return.
