What? What was this? Fisher King's Remake? Why do we care about the character of Sandler? What's slow, dreary, boring, movie-an-damn-about-these-movie people! Just the only painful to sit, I turned off before the top. It is very clear that Cheadle needs help like Sandler; as I said: can you say "King Fisher"? And does this psychological practice work in his daily life? We should not think deeply, I think. Why Cheadle continues to give Sandler a chance to turn violent on it? If they were very good friends, how did they get broken? If Cheadle has control, why does he keep looking for advice on downward street? We are not told. That's why Fisher King was the best film on many levels and why this just takes. Approximately 8 out of 10 average? I disagree. Even. Even the top films are lucky to get the highest level, and this trick is not supposed to be in the same world.
