His match costume is thrown sick and without charm. George Sanders was a good actor. But he is quite implausible here as a guide, rogue of the thirteenth century known to his philosophy and looks very good. Its costar is for all, Akim Tamiroff. One Frenchman! Then there are Signe Hasso, in the dark pigs, as the daughter of the rich family of the family. Carole Landis travels best. Film opens him in silhouette. She is soubrette, and a bad girl in it. He disappears for a while but he returns to the wrong place. But he is good. He was always a beautiful actress. Here he is cast near his typical role. It means to be naughty little, kind of ooh-la-la. It should have a little touch but it is a leading thing from start to finish.
