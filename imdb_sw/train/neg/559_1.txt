I saw this film in the first London, and I must say - I didn't expect too much, but I expected something that was good for entertainment. <br /> <br /> The original "Primary Foundation" did not have a good film and it is still something of "classic smut" but it was entertainment. I can often remember walking through the TV on Friday or Saturday night after coming to the movies and looking for myself to start listening. However, this blind-brain, waaay- sequel is beaten. Is Sharon Stone still very good? Well, suppose that - for a 47-year-old, he is very good. Is he as good as he was at the beginning? No one has had plastic surgery on his face, and his hair cut in this film is much less. He does not look like soft or real or innocent as he did in nature - which is a kind of whole action to be bad seductress, and whatnot. All the distance away from bad to horrible - and Michael Caton-Jones (the most secure director - who does a great job all the time but can make suitable films) has given his first real Turkish Turkey; The movie the bad people were laughing at some time which were intended to be bad. Listen to the film that has gone through many times of editing, and is clear from the beginning. Nothing makes sense. The whole plot is a cosmic mess and the end - oh my! Talk about stupid and unknown. (However, it is still possible.) I saw "Gigli," I saw "Son of Mask" - and although I don't look "smear" this film, I can say to my authority (which you don't have to agree with all the time, see you) that I prefers all these films on the failure of this tragedy. The Way, Stone has left five minutes before the movie started with people in the theater began to throw things into the screen during the worst and scary area within a night orgy club. The "Basic Institute 2" - basically, says, too.
