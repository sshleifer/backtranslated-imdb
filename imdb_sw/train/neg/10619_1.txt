... but a lousy film. As Maltin says this was an attempt by Christopher Lee to make a great films. In fact, it's bad ... TOO great! The program is silent and slow (something about the old people living in the bodies of small children reach immortality) ... film is talk talk talk talk talk about the same things regularly. I have actually done several times! The movie is sooooo red! Sleepy sleep in this way by the sole of Peter Cushing and Lee ... but this was probably a love of love for both (often complained about the horrible movies that became very violent ... well, this does not NO Violence!). Avoid all costs ... unless you fall asleep ... this will make them sleep!
