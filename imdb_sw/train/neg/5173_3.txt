When I saw this shop I thought it looked good and original. If Wolfs Creek meets the Texas chainsaw killings, I mean only three expenses (about $ 6). Be honest don't think it was worth it. It looked like the directors' brothers' 'could not decide if they wanted to make a kind of fear of art or grid gory. It ended fifteen minutes and fifteen minutes with all the characters directly and you can't take care of what happened but try to make the audience care about the characters that would add an unpleasant monologue at the end and the beginning of the film that will not be trust absolutely not needed. The only part of the truth was in the middle / end - I will not destroy you. But that's the only part of "good". <br /> <br /> Overall, check is not meant. It felt like a two-hour film but it really was only 75 minutes. If you want an art-free film. If you want a slasher movie - don't bother - the film goes slowly and nothing is going on.
