Sometimes, doing something extraordinary and modern does not work for everyone for the benefit of everyone. When I accept that the design and concept of the film was interesting, the implementation of these ideas in one group story did not work. This film was slowed down and useless, even Robin Williams could save this waste. Obviously the dream of Barry Levinson fell on his face, but he would have to warn the whole world on this slop.
