Oh dear god. This was terrible. There is a bad, then there was this. This movie has no meaning. It travels across the map and unknown about what it says. Music seemed like you tried to be like Batman. The fact that 'Edison' is not a real city, it takes. Since I am Vancouver, watch this film and identify all these places that make it impossible to consider. Why didn't they make a real city? The most honorable writings were 'Tilman' which John Heard did a wonderful job. He was the only actor who played his role in the truth and not over the camp. It was a shame to see John Heard playing a very bad boy for a lot of time screens, and a movie being washout. Very bad. We expect a key person to see it, and at least give John Heard a loan where you have paid a loan, and bring him back to the worst guide, where he should be. on A. List
