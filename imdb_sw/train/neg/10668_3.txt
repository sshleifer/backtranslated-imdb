This moment had many actors in it! Unfortunately they have forgotten how to act. I was hoping that the film would be much better if it continued but the acting was so robotic was damaged from the beginning. In fact it seemed that the executives were reading from the script at all times. Perhaps it was a color of Music or Director himself, but one thing is certainly a Make-up artist needs to find another job! The face powder was too thin you can see it being exposed to the faced administrators! Can't recommend this film to anyone, it is not surprising to hit the Home. Cuba Gooding Jr. / James Woods shy on you guys for all your tiredness. Plot was just good needed much more.
