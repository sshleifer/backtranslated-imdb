I've been reading the publications here about Dress Woman Wonder for this TV movie. It should be displayed when the movie took place, was not wearing its traditional dress. Traders were joining the writer's WW book for seven years earlier. <br /> <br /> About the movie itself, I must agree with many billboards here. Snoozefest! I was a child when it appeared on the ABC in 1974, so when I was a good old movie about a comic hero. However, I was "busy" with the plot, I stopped looking at three quarters on the movie. Of course, I didn't have a good age to appreciate Cathy Lee! : -) \ t
