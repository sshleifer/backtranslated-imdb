The full version of Margaret Landon "Anna and King of Siam", in 1946 by Irene Dunne and Rex Harrison, has Deborah Kerr who was beaten as a school teacher and a mother who travels from England to Siam in 1862 to work as a teacher for many children of the King - and perhaps teach Royal One something or two in the process! Good pictures start well, but quickly lose energy and focus. Yul Brynner, taking his step to win as King, is the presence of orders, but is used - for a mixed story - like buffoon. Kerr continues to be polite with the best weather prices, despite having tips for the voice of Marni Nixon. Maybe you've already done this part of the death, Brynner looks like he didn't have anything to translate to the screen except bombast. Two and a half, with Anna and moppets to the music of "Mama's Cabin" are very worried, and Rodgers and Hammerstein songs have been running. Brynner won the best Oscar player, but it's a brave Kerr who puts this on the water. Excessive, heavy, and 'old-fashioned' in poor condition of time. ** from ****
