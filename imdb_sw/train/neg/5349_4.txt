Leffer direct-video is another nail in the coffin of Rick Moranis. As with the Disney culture, quality is provided in the name of fast money; this is the sluggishness of pride and Moranis accidentally descending himself with a few brothers so that they can repeat all the best scenes from the original movie. Regularly dated the visual effects and a mix of a lot of museums in this cheesy lamer, which had nothing but made me pine for the day of 'Wonderful Fall' person, while this kind of thing done well. Surprisingly, this is headed by the top-class writer Dean Cundey, who should hold the work of the day or take the best material in the future.
