A good film, and a beautiful woman who leads, but a leading man. Stephan Jenkins, who plays the husband, is a very good actress. Joyce Hyser, on the other hand, is grace to save the film. He is the best actor of the pile. <br /> <br /> NOTE * The first comment, and a colleague who hit the top of the film (and, according to its IMDB.com account, has just written ONE review - and I think why the film?) is clear plant. When the movie is shot well, not by false or large or any other hypobolic viewer used. <br /> <br /> "Art of Revenge" is a fair movie, but it's a great tease. It offers all kinds of sex status but is not available. If you look Flick Skin on Cinemax, but with “all bad bits” changed. <br /> <br /> Movies, in general, is a little without deleting and end, and a lot of third action, is really a great mess. There is an end to termination, in fact, since every modern day of the film gets it necessary to have the end of losing. <br /> <br /> A 4 out of 10. <br /> <br />
