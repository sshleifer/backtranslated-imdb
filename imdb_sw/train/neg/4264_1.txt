This movie allows me to hard to decide. was a great concept that had been destroyed by a bad script. The story did not come in and it had come out well. There were many aspects of this story that were not described, or had to enter the place and out of any realistic ideas. elements like love stories can be extended to a little more, and horns need to be well written. The main character of the growing is more needed on the training he had received and a little stand. everyone likes good "little guy triumphs" the story and this showed the promise but for the failure of the script there will be no. Although it had some pyrotechnics in the final sequence of the war was a lack of because of the lack of choreography. this has been caused by looking through fraud / / <br /> would have been very good ((
