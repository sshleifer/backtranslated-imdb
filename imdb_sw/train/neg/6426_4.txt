I found a document called Fast, Cheap, and Out of Control to be an interesting documentary. The document contained four “mini” documents about four interesting people. Each of these men was very involved in his work, showing his love and joy. <br /> <br /> The sad part, I must say, would be the lessons that these people worked / learned. It was interesting for five minutes, then it became terrible and durable for quite a long time. <br /> <br /> Video was done through creative though. I was very excited about the same film and the sound of another voice. It plays well and also fits well with music.
