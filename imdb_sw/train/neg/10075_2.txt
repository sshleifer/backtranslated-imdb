Sorry, but even Adrian Zmed's TJ Hooker could not save this storage. I went through half of the movie thinking that this was the original spoof. Then came the wild and wacky wild (caution that this is the only movie that Patricia Birch leads); and I sadly realized that they were trying to be bad. I got a kick of the fact that the protest group, having lost their "wheels" from their gambling behavior in the original Grease, were forced to use a motorcycle in the second movie. To be embarrassed and putz Carrington's behavior, I would like to see what they will do next: maybe it explodes? <br /> <br /> I have never bought a hackneyed theme: hunky-Australia-boy-can't-go-out-of-school-ergo-go-to-bad-guy-and-stupid-biker-hat -to look. It was the story of Disney descended on evil. So, it seems like UN could destroy something good by putting a gum to bind Michelle Pfeiffer in music. The only thing I removed from this film is the idea of ​​how many of the ten points to give.
