I used to love the bill always because of its great script and characters, but soon I feel like it has become a kind of soap. If you are looking at promotional pictures / billboards now you will see two officers / kissing or something to do with friendship when the previous image development of the bill had shown something to do with crime. This proves that it has changed very much since being a fantastic Police Service for a typical TV soap. When I look at I feel like I am looking at the Coronation Street address or something else. I tell you I still loved the bill if I was impressed by the police and the kind of thing but I missed the size that Bill had. I want to weigh 2 out of ten because you have to admit it was completely destroyed by people who took the bill. As for the script and all the characters have gone down, many of the main characters have gone now (although few remain to think) and I will not say that new characters are poor or nothing because they really are not, they just don't have shapes The difficult, legacy and lines of the script that all the ancient characters had reason because many of the new ones now interact with bad relationships and family problems. Overall being one of the only Police programs on television these days, Bill will always be something interesting, but if I say it has lost a lot of unique (if that's the correct spelling) and it would now be installed as A bad, odd soap television. It was recommended to look good on the ignorance of the police officers involved - 2/10
