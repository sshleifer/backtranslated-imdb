'Omen 4: The Awakening' is a sequel-to-original 'The Omen' film. Instead of Satan with a young body, he has the body of a little girl passed by rich parents, who are being abused at school and who ends up retaliating against those who make mistakes. The movie seems to be struggling with anything horrible, and many events that are happening are quiet rather than frightening, and it's hard to believe that the little girl is Satan, even with all the surrounding events. I just did not get this film to emphasize or frighten, especially compared to nature.
