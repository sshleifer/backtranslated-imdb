This should be the worst piece of waste that I have seen when. Heath Ledger is a heart of heart? He seemed damaged. I would like to know that she and Naomi watts is something in real life because I spent 2 hours longer hours of my life looking for what she saw in it. Orlando Bloom is a heart of heart? With the scraggly beard and the fingers of the fingers to look upon, I can't say I agree. Rachel Griffiths was a natural man, but Geoffrey Rush seemed like he could not wait to get off. Should I feel sorry for bankers and killers? This is a great cry from the Cassidy Butch, which in fact was a film of entertainment. This was ethical, strangled and distracted. We stayed just because we were sure it would be better. It doesn't. <br /> <br /> End of 10-15 minutes or so you did not have a trick. Heath and his group are locked in a fronti hotel, and women and children are dying because of their presence. That's not funny. But it was funny when they walked out of the hotel with weapons up, because all we could imagine was the Black Knight from Monty Python and the Holy Grail. I continued to wait for them to say "I put foot on foot!" We shouted and laughed, as did many other participants who had fought. When we left, everyone was talking about not losing when this film was. I can't pay money to see this tragedy (sneak preview), but it really wasn't free. I found two hours of my life that I would never come back.
