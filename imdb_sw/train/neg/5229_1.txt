things that give us what we got here. Its 5-minute shorts are much better than this. know why? because there are only 5 minutes and not 91 minutes or how long it is. <br /> <br /> The plot is kinda ... eh .. The last half is exactly the same is boring and not funny = (I was hoping, the trailer made it look funny but the speed of this movie is slow and sadness is not funny. Klaymen just plainly runs and tries to make us laugh. It doesn't work. <br /> <br /> Maybe re-cutting this movie and adding the best scenes could make a lot of healing but now it's not just good.
