This film makes you start promising and then worries and is made. Kamal Hasan has made a lot of effort to get a good look at the time, the anger did not have more time on the plot. Many of the little characters in the film show for some reason. <br /> <br /> Overall disappointment, I would recommend avoiding this movie.
