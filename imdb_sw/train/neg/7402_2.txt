This is a typical example of the video-skill video directors who are trying to make their first film length of full feature. On the one hand photo, camera, lighting, CGI and even the sound is painted and looks with “feel true”. Even executives show a certain amount of capacity - even when even the best acting can not hide a serious plot. In this case it is not a bad plot but not quite a plot. So 50% of the discussion includes "What is hell?", "What was it?" and "What was hell?". In any case the perpetrators are not provided with a little sense of reply though. In many other discussions a person feels that he did not have any kind of dialogue book with the participants had to cancel the program that you have never explained to them. The only reason Skye Bennet's performance could be good is that her behavior as a autistic girl did not allow her to give a horrible conversation that other participants had to deal with. That way he was able to show only his talent to act in which all others could not even get close. I mean there is no one actor in the world who can make a discussion like this: <br /> <br /> Ben: Is this true, huh? Emily: Stop that. Ben: a massive psychosis, huh? Jon: Someone needs to control this situation. Ben: This situation cannot be controlled. Not for you, not for anyone. Emily: It's not with you either. Ben: No! But not for fear, more for the wrong attempt. At one time I felt embarrassed to actors that they have added this to their war. <br /> <br /> 2 stars for best technical work.
