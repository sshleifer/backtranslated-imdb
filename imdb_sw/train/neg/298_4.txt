Daraar left for a good start. The first part left me on the edge of my seat and wondered what would happen next. Other than that, the first half of the movie is BORE Total. The first half of the movie is about Rishi Kapoor falling head over the heels with love and Juhi Chawla. By the way, do you? Do you think she is limited for him? The things eventually begin to form in the middle of the film when Juhi tells us about her old husband; and wow what day is he! He was on a protective, good-looking and HOT HOT TEMPER! He was striking poor Juhi without good reason! One reason I don't like this movie is because I can't stand to see Juhi (my famous actress) to get so abusive. This film generally has a bad way of abuse and blood; I found that it's very strong !!! However, all that I am trying to say is if you think about renting.
