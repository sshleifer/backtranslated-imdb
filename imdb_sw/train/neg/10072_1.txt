Unfortunately I made a mistake and I paid Euro 7 to a movie cinema to watch this useless movie. My items; <br /> <br /> The movie has focused on 2 items; 1/1/1/1 But unfortunately it is not enough. Knowing there are 2 names of other foods does not make someone understand culture. For example shaving is a symbol of clean living in Asia but everyone was trying to stop the girl. The people of Lebanon are Christians (Ok they have found it) and their forms of culture and beliefs and methods are very different from other Arab countries. The main difference between the eastern and western culture is we do not do ethnocentrism. So we do not judge people after their first question about our lives as the father did in all films. The girl's sex revolution: Nothing can say about this. Show me 10 girls who had these up to sex more than I will say I am wrong. I wrote these comments because the producers are developing films in black type of humor. Please see DrStrangelove and understand the meaning of black humor. Black humor has a realistic view and it is worth looking at viewers in its amazing places. Where is the truth? Where it means about the movie.
