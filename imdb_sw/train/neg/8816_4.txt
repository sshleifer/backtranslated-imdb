I saw my mother ... well, she never kissed Santa Clause; he has his hand on his foot and evil thoughts in his mind. That was enough emotional boy who wanted to believe. He became a bitter man who was angry with the quality of the fingers made, and the lack of a Christmas spirit. <br /> <br /> Expect a real flick of the slasher, I was desperate that less than a few people die, and no weaknesses. What bummer. <br /> <br /> I wanted this beautiful, but it was very slow and really didn't have a good script. I did not expect to do a good job, but I really wanted a certain step. There he had nothing.
