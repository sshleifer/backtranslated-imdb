This movie will help improve the mind. Read the book! It is amazing that anyone would think this movie is worth time and investment to do. I have seen "B" movies before but the movie "C" is only taken. I didn't think I would like to enjoy Power Rangers since my children stopped watching but I found myself looking at those videos fifteen minutes on "Knights." Secondary school production is better than this and participants involved should erase this from them again. Abuse is one of many details that comes to mind. My friend, who likes these types of movies even fills them. Now that tells you something. If you watch this film, and like it, I will pray for you.
