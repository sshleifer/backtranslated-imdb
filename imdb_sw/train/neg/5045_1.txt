Claustrophobic cameras that are not suitable for the movie: Long eyes only shoot where they often get the feeling that the bottom half of the film does not exist (that the screen is cut off), because it seems to be an important step up, but you can't see. There is still a great mix of films in the film, so these viewing corners are getting worse and do not provide art pictures. I love movies and works of cameras without limitation. I can handle comprehensive and slow movies. But this is trying to be very difficult to be a pleasant thing and fails in my opinion with bitterness. Nothing is connected, for any characters, because they don't work properly. In order to work more than the characters required, than just long shots of the face, at least with this set of script + artists. <br /> <br /> I wonder if some work is not very good due to the script by the director or due to the executives. <br /> <br /> I will leave off with written movies and be led by Le You for sure in the future. It is a video that has even heard of someone who would be interested in that part of history, and for someone who spent time in Shanghai.
