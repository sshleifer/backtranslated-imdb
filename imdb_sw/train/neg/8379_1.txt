As some of the other observers described earlier, I would like to know what moron really read the script and go ',' yes !!! ' This is it. This is the next film we go to green light! "And anyone who is, he should have his head to investigate the actual brain activity. For anybody who is really responsible for wanting to do so after reading the script, well, I'd like to give you my email address and maybe just like give more money. This movie is angry for every way. It is a lot of good films and have some very good films on the way. But here, it's not just the inspiration that you refuse All the logic, not just a horrible event, not just any event of film from beginning to end, not only is it as an amateur as you can find, but really want you to pay to see this film. it's still a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Normally I would like to write a long time around, a review review about what this film is bad, but just enough to say that allowing my brevity to do talking. A very common lump and it's about not like a heart attack. 0/10. It offers my ten lists of the worst films!
