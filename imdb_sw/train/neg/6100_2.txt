Efforts aside (This is not an opinion on good intentions, it is about the final product), this film is not recommended to be written, interrupted, and misused. The story seems to be able, but the story does not exist anywhere in this film. Clara Barton was a human. He had desires, desires, love, pain, shame, weakness, and self-doubt as we do. You can never know it from this leading actor's film. In fact asking that for each character in the film, but in the case of Barton: Each sentence is a speech. Epic on top of the speech as though from a humanitarian robot. In fact the event that is really good at one of the board meetings, and I realized it because she does a speech! Every thought he has is believed in its environment and comes with ideas that seem to be taking the life of life at any time. For example, when he sees a wounded person, he will begin to testify on the needs of the battlefield and protect the soldiers and put the white flag, etc. If you played in the film, there is no way that can come up with a detailed description of the outward thought out in seconds. In conclusion, this film stimulates Clara Barton's fight. It stimulates his humanity, and naturally eliminates all the costs he has made because the script is written on the clich√©s. The author does not know Clara Barton, and it seems to have its foundation on Britannica. (yes they had those back) But hey, beautiful Technicolor! (who cares)
