Jesus Christ, I can't believe I have lost my time watching this movie. I just looked because I have cracked Jordan Jordan. But watching this film almost put me off. This is very bad! I would be looking at the Survivor Series on this. <br /> <br /> The leading boy in this was bland and generic. I would like if the Chief Mistuharu Misawa drove him '91 was his ass through a glass window. I used to emphasize every time saying "lake" and "cabin". I would like to go to his ass. Jordan Jordan, on the other hand, was very strange. The true angel. But he could not even save this joke of the film. Sadly, he could not even act as he was away from his nut when he took the same medicine. It seemed very appealing. <br /> <br /> I also loved a little where Jordan instructed the yogurt on it. Reminds me when ... never. <br /> <br /> Anayways, show this film because of bad conditions.
