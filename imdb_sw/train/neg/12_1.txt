All I could think of when watching this film was B-grade slop. Many have talked about the quality of redemption is how this film demonstrates the true representation of the effects of drugs and individual and after an increasingly independent state of bad events. However, the methods used (such as those that have already been mentioned) were affected and therefore unacceptable to the film as a whole. Apart from that field involved, it was inadequate, unimportant, improper and judgmental. You can read more reports on this film and they will say pretty much like I would. It has been acknowledged that some actors and actors are attracted but when faced with such an interesting action ... it seems only to carry the film so far. The action is bad and medium: a few punches hit here and there, and the end of the gunfight towards the end. There is nothing to write at home about. If others said, 'BAD' movies are good to watch because they are so 'bad', it shows that reality. This film, however, is empty. It's nothing. Additionally, if someone needs a movie of education to scare people away from drug abuse then I would like to recommend to the full number of other movies out there that deal with such issues for much more efficiency. 'Dream needs', 'Trainspotting', 'Fear and Loss in Las Vegas' and 'Candy' are just a few examples. Although a person should also watch the lighter films on the subject like 'Go' (in general, both major and exciting) and 'Half'. For a final note, one of the line of this movie's release, released by Vinnie Jones was stolen from 'Lock, Stock and Two Smokling Barrels'. Thinking that a bit of this big movie is hated by 'Loaded' is bad. Overall, I suggest that you save money and your time for NOT to see this film.
