"Darkness" was somewhat entertaining, but it was not found to be conspicuous, none of the other films that have been criticized by these effects; that is, "Bad Taste". It started very well, and someone running away from something. It was very creepy for these first minutes, but after a while the film became entertaining to the level of the year, which was difficult to do for some points due to bad lighting and the quality of recording the shock however. The movie was hard to believe because of the youth work, which often, it seemed like other friends to chat with video cameras, making lines on the go. That, by lack of anything, it made it like a movie without it, and it ended without, a script of any kind. As we said earlier, the year was the only mark of the film, which was often difficult to do.
