Carlos Mencia always, violently, shouting "B ** ch!" for women is like shouting "N ** ger!" for black people, but it's worse. Remember, the word B, in contrast to the word N, is the only pejorative word that is involved every day with violence. "B ** ch!" it is the last thing women hear before being raped, beaten, or killed. A boy promotes violence by using hatred for hate. It seems like he can be a gay boy trying to cover with a woman-bashing, so that he can give like hetero. And how about all the whites of the Nazis in his audience giving out the greetings of the uninvited when their female-colored band was worried, they were so afraid to defend this woman's hateful woman. Hee hee. Bet Mencia does not believe or support free speech to them! Come, Carlos? Do you want women to have a free speech b buffet to clap your hands loudly and loud-mouthed if you, or do you think "free speech" is just for men to decorate women?
