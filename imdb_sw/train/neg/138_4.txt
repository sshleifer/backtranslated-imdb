Good: I loved this film because it was the first movie I had seen for a long time that I feared. Acting was not very serious, and the killer of "Cupid" was honest and worried. <br /> <br /> Rough: The line with the story of this movie is very weak. There was not much. The ways that the killer killed his victims were frightening and disgusting. I don't like this film for anyone who can't handle the year. <br /> <br /> Overall: A good fear, but a bad story. ** /> ​​<br /> ** out of *****
