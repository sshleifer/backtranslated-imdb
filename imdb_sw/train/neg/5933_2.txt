I've been a fan since his first album. This film is safe for him. Exhibitions, except one for Rufus Wainwright and Teddy Thompson are just awesome. Martha Wainwright, Nick's Cave, Antony, and Jarvis Cocker were very close. Even one of McGarrigle's sisters was destroyed by Martha Wainwright's compromise. I have never seen my wife rise up and walk out of the room on the film before and I found myself quickly sending it through the exhibition to reach the shortest group of interviews, which were also difficult to watch due to poor performance of camera. There are many who have been able to translate songs of Mr. Cohen, Jennifer Warnes, KD Lang, Billy Joel, Aaron Neville, and Willie Nelson come to mind, but those people chosen for this performance were just bad. Hope will be another attempt to seize Leonard Cohen on a film that will show his insight, talent, and intelligence. So sad
