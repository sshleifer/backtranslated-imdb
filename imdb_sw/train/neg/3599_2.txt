Umm .. I was quite surprised that someone actually gave this film a high score. Lets face it ... Tori Spelling is not a great actor .. and this film only confirms the "brilliant" level. The movie plot was weak ... I bet dork come up with this concept and some distorted peeping tom. If there is a good thing about this film, I would say it is that Tommy Chong's daughter, just for the fact that she is her daughter ... and then there is that soap opera-ish male leader whose good looks looks somewhat to do with her interesting, but it stops helping its great potential. * Why IMD requires at least 10 lines? How many more ways can you say "this movie takes"?
