Very bad video, the story is very simple and predictable and works as bad as a helper. This vampire story of the vampire is so bad that I have seen now, Derek Bliss (Jon Bon Jovi), travels to Mexico to find some blood suckers, he uses some interesting weapons (but no compared to Blade ), and is part of the hunter Van Helsig vampire net?, OK, but he works alone. He gave the opportunity to follow a powerful vampire king who examines a black cross to perform a ritual that will allow them to be a solar cycle (near the end of the Vampires (1998) led by John Carpenter and the star by James Woods), Derek starts his quest in finding a queen and Other new friends: Sancho (Diego Luna, doing very badly) boy without knowledge, Father Rodrigo (Cristian De la Fuente) Catholic priest, Zoey (Natasha Wagner) a certain vampire and Ray Collins (Darius McCrary) another hunter of vampire hunter. So open in this adventure he is not alone. You can begin to feel how this film would only look at its leading actor (Jon Bon Jovi); it is a great difference in acting quality compared to James Woods, and then, if you look at a movie (I don't recommend this section), you will participate in one of the most simple, predictable stories, and good acting performances, special effects and unusual events! I insist on watching this film!, Renting another movie, check another facility, go with your friends, etc.. <br /> <br /> 3/10
