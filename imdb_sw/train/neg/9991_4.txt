First, I'm not here this dog movie. I am really happy despite the poor quality of production. The actor is here on such disgusting things as monster stimulates, although the monster itself has done well ... it has been smoothly, so. In fact he looks like other nations, as a guest family came to the Himalayas and when the father was going ... attending a natural call, Spot was free and had no time to look for him. That, or he is a brother of Caucasia of Wishmaster. I have not decided what it is. In fact, this seems to be happening somewhere in the snow country, yes, but there is more likely Canada somewhere than China anywhere. Trees and vistas say Canada to me, and it is okay that the place to keep does not take or feel in the cold-winter that one can expect to find in China's Himalayas. It's a movie of Sci-Fi Channel, so we can forgive the lack of location. Overall, it seems (as we created) Sci-Fi directors do not travel too often, because they do not know that airplanes are flying over the weather as the so-called here and their real fall will not happen. But as I said, it's a movie of Sci-Fi Channel so we should forgive a few things. <br /> <br /> The movie is very good at times, and spinning among the "Alive" about Witness Donner, "Predator" about a stranger in the forest, and any bad movie of wushu where they fly around on the wire. Yeti looks can fly up like Spiderman ... or Super Mario ... remember? "Run speed! Jump on! Get long!" <br /> <br /> Also, Yeti missed its teddy bear. He searches up and down, but can't be seen working. Poor Yeti! You can't help but feel sorry for it. It has succeeded and altered thousands of years to deal with a severe loss of teddy bear. Missed to carry it. Or maybe it wants to get married, but the idea is BANISHED! What? You hear me? Yes, it seems to be a man without passage. News! <br /> <br /> And it's superhuman. In fact, it's not human ... it's super-yeti! But again, it's normal-Yeti? I do not know, but has a definite reputation for Michael Meyers. And she has this wonderful way of cleaning her fur. Dahlink's FABulous! It is without white color when SO should not be. He is fastidiously superhu -... super-Yeti. <br /> <br /> All in all? It was very fun to watch, it has some massive killings and few features of honesty. Despite the effectiveness of the production efficiency, this is a real entertainment. Can I help to ask if they are planning on another? <br /> <br /> It is 6.0 / 10 level on M4TV molecules. <br /> <br /> Reduces 4.4 / 10 on Modern Scale from ... <br /> <br /> Fienda :.
