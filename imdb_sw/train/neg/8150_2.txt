If you want an unpleasant hour and for good reason amusing or so, then it's ok to see this. Not all evil, in fact. Yes, it has a lot more logic than I describe here and it can pay for the patience of people - like myself, I must admit it - who are refusing to throw things on the TV sometimes, but it's least at least. Because it is not often not funny, there is no need to allow it to decline. However, if you have read a book - or otherwise books with Brookmyre - then you would like to better avoid it. I read them all and when I watched this film first, I despised it. I have hidden in detail and for a long time on other websites, in fact. Television films are so large that there is nothing to that of the book and it only served to surprise them and convince many of the faithful (and worried) of Brookmyre's concerns. <br /> <br /> Better than advice ..? Look at this, then read the book and then compare it with your judgment.
