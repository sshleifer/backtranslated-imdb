I began to watch this film expecting some of the amazing hammers of the hammer hammer ... and I was not far away. There is a fairly low rate of year, and they were thrown to the dirt, but the last half of the movie gives a few twist surprises. The sacred cows, in fact, put a few ideas on the story, and did not fall completely in the anticipated one. And boldly say, some weakness of "freeous" was not freeous after all, because it resembles a story and set. <br /> <br /> Don't do it wrong, it's still a bad movie, but as bad movies goes, it's a shadow of mind than a really awesome tripe like Mesa's Lost Women and Robot Monster.
