I would like to give this movie zero. Effect of cheesy and act. The only reason to see this film is so you can see how bad it is. Let's start with a child who plays Brian. It's geek! I couldn't believe mullet! Then there was talking myself. I think they couldn't just have a film to be silent, but still. Of course they had to have skin skin too, not something I wanted to see. But Jared gave good performance, compared to the department of special effects. Everything from carrying to accident is something that I could do myself, and better. I am very doubtful that Gary Paulsen had any connection with production, seeing if the film was not even called Hatchet. Finally, I don't think the author has ever read the book, because nothing was the same. I think the book was good, but this film has fallen like a scent goat!
