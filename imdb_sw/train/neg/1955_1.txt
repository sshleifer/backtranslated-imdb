This movie is just stupid spinning corner and becomes stupid. I wanted to watch the "dark is" really and I think that this was a movie. Boy, what a mistake! I used as fast as I could and yet I was not able to overcome the interesting time. I hate people who were paid to play or work on this film. They were given true money for this trick. Isn't it wonderful? I mean in this movie a person is killed and cut into a wood grinder with small pieces of blood and a few minutes later the mother and baby speak silently to the table without something that happened and drank coffee. Please! Come! Who gives money for these decoration movies? Oh, and "fairy-fairy" was lame. It is not frightened and it is obvious that it is the person who is wearing the wrong clothes.
