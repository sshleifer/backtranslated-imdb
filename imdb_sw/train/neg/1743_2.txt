Unlike his head, this film does not provide links and so the audience is faced with an improper dish. Humor seems to be compulsory, exhibition, mechanical, installed, reminiscent of Pakistani games available on video, including common means. Everyone is screaming, crying and doing unusual things for any reason. The premise appears to be interesting if it raises directly from Boeing's Boeing's Hollywood.John Abraham who is natural in all his films is misfit here full.If we set ethically aside, however incredible events seem disappointing. Kumar and Paresh Rawal, two skilled guards are struggling to raise the film to be natural but for free. At least, the characters of three girls should be different in order to bring interesting things but sadly here also all seem to be unwise, bimbettes ( 3Bs that speak, make and even shout in the same style. The main hole in the plot is what made the main character to keep three girls in her home pretending not to know about each other? do some sex, what else? That can be done for hundreds of other ways. So very much the rockabaazi because no not the audience will be able to dig easily. Indeed, a good body suggests and lobby always provides s films are original original. Now for those who call the comedy of the situation, I call it a delicious taste. The sense of humor of the film to the audience has already been misleading by the closure of which they join the sad, mysterious and sad form, where it is not the characters who laugh but rather themselves and for themselves. so that laughter we should carry with such things?
