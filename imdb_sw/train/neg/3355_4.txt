There were only two things that made me interested in this film: I was waiting for Owen Wilson to die, and Catherine Zeta Jones. That was basically a woman's show. Catherine Zeta Jones was just there to give eye-candy. Liam Neeson was completely lost in this film. As Jones, he had no responsibility at all. The film was all Lily Taylor (Ransom, Ready to wear). He was the only one who had any real part in this crappy script by David Self. Well, he was the first and released himself by losing. I don't know what the director of Jan de Bont was. did a good job for Speed ​​and Twister. she fell down at work here. Maybe he was recovering from a catastrophic 2: Control of Cruise. He should thank his lucky stars for Wild Wild West, perhaps this would be a bad picture of 1999.
