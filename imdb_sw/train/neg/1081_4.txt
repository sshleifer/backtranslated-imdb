There is no one characteristic of all this film. What? Is a lawyer involved with Kenneth Branagh that we should connect? Let's take a look - we learn that it is the security of the sleazebag lawyer who gets offenders off the technology. He treats his colleagues like cattle, makes them involved in his own conflict (in the process, getting one of them killed), threatens his children's safety, threatens his ex-spouse, and tries to support strong police and school administrators - and all this why? Because he was thinking about his little head! I was smiling at the father and his group to beat out the lawyer and put him in the rain ... it would have made the most satisfying end.
