I couldn't believe my eyes once I watched this film. Nothing in it then let blood and abuse. Unlike other horrible films that were meant by this film is blood, gore, and killing directly. This movie is not quite good, it has no meaningful plot or story line, and it doesn't have a mind in it. The blood looks very fake and this film is generally, useless. Don't waste your time with that. It is an hour or two of senseless violence. It has many bloody cases that are not frightening but they come out clearly. This is probably the most horrible movie I have ever seen from all the awesome films I saw.
