This movie has no plot and no target. Yes, it should be a string stick, a comedy of stupid, but the authors of the screen do not know what the movie was nearby. Even the head doesn't go with the film. It should be called "Cool Ethan" or "Cheaters Never Win" or something like that. The characters don't progress and nobody cares about what happens to them! The woman's style (from the 70th Exhibition) was the only person worthy to look at. He was hilarious and stole every area he had. Others need to make sure that their college diploma is in operation since they need work instead of acting.
