I am a big fan of B5, just taken at the end of the third season. I watched honestly last season when it was reconciled, and concluded that it was one of the most well thought stories on television. Even the filling events were interesting. Movies, too, were well-fed and as entertainment as anything to hit the cinema. The 'River of Souls'. Naturally, after seeing everything else, I had great expectations. Martin Sheen seems to be working on Ed Wood's movie instead of the great Sci-Fi story. The story itself, it may look good in the summary form, even made it on the storyboard. However, it is exposed when it comes time to fill this idea out of the two-hour movie. There are no special effects to bring us back to the total lack of compelling story. There was a place where they were obviously short and just improved the dialog to fill the story out. If this did the normal season, it would be compared to the worst of the worst.
