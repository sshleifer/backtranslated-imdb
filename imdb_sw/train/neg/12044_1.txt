It came to see the movie "Troy" this afternoon. Here's what I learned: <br /> <br /> Contrary to popular views and history in general, the Greek people were not gay. JUMA. This was established immediately at the beginning of the film and was strengthened every five minutes or later. So it's safe for US dudes to see this movie. Helen of Troy always had hair and improper pregnancy. He seemed good at all his short screens which, though many, could have been done one day, one after another, and the director said, "Well, now very good ... Well, now look fear ... good. .. now look sad ... good ... now look at the ... good ... now look again ... good ... "<br /> <br /> Many Greek and Trojan people were qualified UK. Those with American accents could not act. Troans look like Greeks, but they liked to sit on the right side of the screen. <br /> <br /> Brad Pitt doesn't see a camera. Helen's great Troy line was, "They come for me." Trojan / WTF Music was found to be amazing as modern Bulgarian music. Brad Pitt's sides are going up. Achilles had a boyfriend who was very close, but it's okay. They were cousins. Don't worry how history says. Peter O'Toole can describe the whole story with just the expression. Trojan gods seem to have all Greek names, but their images appeared in Egypt or as Peter O'Toole in the drag. Greek men did not touch each other unless they fought, as the people of America. <br /> <br /> Thousands of films had the same color of skin ... Egyptian Light, and Max Factor. Troy had only three women. There were many colored Greeks, which is good news for Brad Pitt, who had no doubt had run away. <br /> <br /> In spite of their coastal desert area, the Greeks were able to lose access to the unlimited amount of firewood, funeral pyres, Trojan horses and so on. br /> <br /> The British actors seem to be masters and Greek hair. Brad Pitt changes only when the sun shines directly in his eyes. The Greek Philistines fought constantly, but their clothing was always considered legitimate. The Greek Philistines wore underneath their skirts. The temples of the Greek temples were always being ruined, even back when they were all new.
