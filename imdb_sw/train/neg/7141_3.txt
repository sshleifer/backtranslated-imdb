Well I went into this film very unexpectedly I thought the action was much more like The Fast and the Furious. Some of the beautiful girls' beautiful cars are some of a good plot. Unfortunately I would say that this is probably the worst movie I saw this year. Do not misuse cars were good and girls were the same but the way they put the movie together was just so plain to put it well. The story has never made you aware of the cast and the movie seemed just taken. So generally this film was not the worst thing that had been far away but if you were looking for a film to this weekend I would go through this now.
