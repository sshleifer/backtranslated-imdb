Seeing a picture of a person being attacked by Zombies gives me hope that Lucio "Zombi" Fulci can be on his old tactics. Unfortunately, in addition to the decline of corpse decay, there is little to suggest in this story of the murder of the rich man and the effort of his daughter to know who killed him. There are no appealing characters and when you know how they did (which reduces, at least, it was cool), you stop caring. The only thing he can say is that it made more sense than a dream!
