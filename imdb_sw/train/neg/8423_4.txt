Forest Whitaker's performance is more amazing by making it useful to stay through this dreck. "Historical writing" does not accept the right to change history. The deficiency begins from the bottom up with the leading attitude of thinking played by James McAvoy. Creating a false observer with a view to giving the reader a point of integration in the book is sad, sad that white people can not read just a book without a white protagonist, but at least was placed in some political role. Creating an artificial historical actor and acknowledging this deception to be shown to Amin to the world does not concern the responsibility, laziness and ignorance. It is not to perform the works of this trustworthy or even gentle, only the criminals, and has opened the door of the film as they are planning to do with Leonardo DiCaprio as the Enron warrior who has never been seen. The logic of the world is unacceptable in this film where Scotland's child thinks it is okay to sleep with the wife of the murder dictator. It does not use where the dictator's wife wants to sleep with a boy who is unintelligent gray. In this case, everyone is bound to sleep with a white, innocent, proud, and even Gillian Anderson with a positive influence. I would like to announce, I don't like James McAvoy. I don't know what it is about him, but I thought Mr. Tumnus in Narnia was amazing and highly pervy. I think Kerry Washington never looked at him twice so I can't believe that the wife of a strong man like Amin could endanger his life for him. I don't believe as Doctor, and I don't see just an appeal. Her character seems to be more proud than it would have been wise, and trying to make her like a badass in a bull shot was just ... there is that word again ... amazing. Think about it, you see all these characters putting themselves in bonds to take into account this unpredictable character and never become that person. Gillian Anderson looks amazing and looks more than Britain's more Brits. Whitaker offers great magnetic performance, and showed, with its original Oscar's incomprehensible conversation, how much he was doing. It is a disgraceful film around her did not have any reason to exist.
