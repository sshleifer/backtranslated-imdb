ALARMIST is a non-selfish text that you think of yourself in the world made an actor and come like David Arquette to admit it into it. It should be one of the smallest plots that I have ever seen and without a bit of humor, it is the boundaries of the sparkle. It competes with the horrible conclusion that seems to be happening just because the director got tired and wanted to fast quickly to get home for his dinner. Stay away !.
