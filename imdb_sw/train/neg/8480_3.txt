I can't say this is one of the best movies I've ever seen. But again, I can't say it's one of the worst I ever seen. Well, so basically the girl is doing a skating, it's very good, wants to go to expensive school, can't afford it and takes a hockey hockey. He should hide his secrets of skating from his friends. Personally, I did not like the actress playing Katelin. He could not cry to save his life, just made the right voice, as a little child pretending to cry to find his own way. Katelin was just an angry man. The way he tried to do all good and help people. Also part where two skaters are calling his names and they say something about his choreographer and says he 'draws a line' made me cringe. <br /> <br /> We all knew where to go with him with Spencer. Usually they did not like everyone and the kind of getting together at the end was just normal. Overall, I think this is a movie to watch if you like skating but if you care about the main skater to be very annoying. It is good to kill when basically.
