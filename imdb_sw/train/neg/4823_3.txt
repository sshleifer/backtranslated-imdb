Sama plot with a two-dimensional script made the characters look like the kadiboard-outs outs. Needless to say, this has made it difficult to feel compassion for the characters, especially the partner; He looked and made more like a cartoon. In summary, I think you could say it was the same as your size given to the television festival. It uses almost every book period. The victim of the class who wants to break and play the salsa. The free pastor is responsible for the "counter counter" that does not like. I will not keep their list or maybe it will be a spoiler because I would give away a whole plot. Play was the same but nothing special. I've seen more. 3 stars for good music. The band was very strong. I saw it on YouTube. Thanks I have never paid good money to see it in the theater. I am still surprised by the positive review of this adorned movie.
