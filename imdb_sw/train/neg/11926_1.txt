I often migrate to make these kinds of BUT comments after staying in most of the movie's awesome rankin I feel like I actually get the right to say what I feel about it! I couldn't make it last, and it was one half or more of the walk (about 1/3 of the audience) after the ragged plot, the bad conversation and the verbal behavior began to carry. This film is pose with no art. All the fashion and no substance. supervised by strong actions, realistic script, non-cinematic and ethical production standards of students. how to be sponsored, start, and finish it secret to me. I bet bet you a million quid never never offered in general. correct critics will burst. The worst film. amazingly bad. The really really bad quest and it doesn't even mention the free-new-born-kitten-gets-dropped-in-deep-fat-fryer time. meaningless, very simple, well connected; This movie is a horrible scandal for the cinema.
