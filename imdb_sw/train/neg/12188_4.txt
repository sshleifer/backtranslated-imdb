While I cannot deny that his movies often enjoy, I always felt that Martin Scorsese was just a little in his power. Its use of the stylistics of flashy in a good number of its movies seems to shout "Look, is not I the director of thinking?". His beautiful film that I saw is one of the least added, full of "Bull Raging". The part of the non-fiction film of the 1950s was bland as a problem itself. A close series of text along with a limited series of "Psycho" scores are more likely to provoke the smirks of contempt than the feeling of fear of the atmosphere. The results of "Psycho" were very weak, this 'stooping' looks just amazing and offensive. Even cast, who may be honored sometimes, give a history of the history that sounds 'caricature'; Special discrimination for this is a change of mind with Lewis as a visible daughter of Bowden's boyfriend <br /> <br /> The worst offender here is wonderful De Niro. Indeed, he seems fit to risk but once he opens his mouth which aura leaves out. Now I am not a professional accents of the United States, I originally came from near Manchester in England to 'all, but surely he would come and draw more than south south than that? Being physically gifted, he conquers this wrong bottle, but not quite. It had accused me, as a De Niro fan, that he wanted to be removed from the screen, instead of running for his performance. <br /> <br /> (POSSIBLE VIDEO VIDEO) <br /> <br /> More style-top of the entire movie continues ridiculously overblown finale. Will Scorsese learn what to be during such a situation you can sometimes create tension effectively if you give visual bombardment visibility and sonic? I also thought that she had the respect and reputation of resting on the cheap 'kill-not-dead' trick which many talented people can employ. <br /> <br /> For all, 'fun'. Scorsese and De Niro have done the best work together.
