The magical book of Isabel Allende, known as the three generations of South America's family, was lost. The films of the film that were caused - largely due to the cast of Anglo-American players are not able to overcome the Latin destruction of Allende characters, and the Scandinavian leadership - was worried in its own skin that I returned to the theater second to make sure I didn't lack something that could change my opinion. To my trouble, I had nothing. None of the Meryl Streep, Jeremy Irons, Glenn Close and Vanessa Redgrave who could beat without a trap that were set by director Bille August. All seemed to be very difficult and resigned, as, by putting a little effort as possible, they expected to be recognized in a timely manner. (Yes, the film was an articulated in the inland of his life.) I wanted to know that the producer of the producer allowed the caffe to keep open KFC products in the area that occurs in 1970 - years before KFC. Back, it was known by its original name: Chicken Fried Kentucky. Even forgiving it, what is the country of Chicken Fried Kentucky who makes military dictatorship in South America in 1970? The American fast food chains did not hit South America until the early 1980s. "The spiritual house" should be an event of a motion picture of 1993. Because it was a footstool and loyal to its vague idea of ​​what novel represented, Miramax had to make it as an art film. As a result, it was not an event nor art. And therefore, Isabel Allende must be charged with rape.
