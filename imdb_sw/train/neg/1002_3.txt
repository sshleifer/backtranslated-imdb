I don't want to go too far, because I can't justify losing a lot of time in exploring this film, but I had to give other comments in hopes to help people avoid the movie. Animation is bad and the story exchanges between stimulating / useless to convince them. Humor was completely lost for the audience, and yes - Spirit in Shell fans, this is not a sci-fi action or something like that - a comedy slapstick attempt, and humor did not work after it was translated. It was a general work of watching this film, and a terrible way to reject the fest film, especially considering how excited I was and how to open me for anything - I did not expect the Spirit in Shell sequel, but I was expecting something of entertainment, and certainly did not reach this. Yaaawwnnn ... Kino's Leisure Journey instead.
