The second thing in the holiday series is very easy to enjoy one, as Clark Griswold wins the whole family trip to Europe. might not be here. In fact the error lies in with the Hackerling director, who is clearly a close place as a good director like Harold Ramis and a non-uninspiring script which has a few lines of selected lines around. The cast does what they can; Chevy Chase injures some kind of life in the case but it is not enough just by Eric very funny loses quite a small role as an unhappy English. Sometimes hilarious possibilities are not available for all their capabilities and the departure of the viewer increases. All the whites of Europeans are one-dimensional and almost completely not quite funny (like how English is SOOO honor) <br /> <br /> In addition to a few events, there is hardly a laugh at the front and end turns this one in full slapstick. But if you're a fan of Chevy Chase (like myself) the film appears, but no more than that.
