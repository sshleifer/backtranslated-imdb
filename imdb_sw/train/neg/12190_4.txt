One of the worst Scorsese. The average happiness; The only thing to recommend is De Niro to play psychological. The latter is usually the highest form, and another can not fail, the village of immune pain. I did not like the 60s, and this version did not have much improvement. I don't know why Scorsese lost his time on remake. Then again, considering how his recent badness has been bad (I have talked about his red movie of Buddhist and all with his new actress, Di Caprio photographer) this is not bad even by comparison. And considering Spielberg wanted to make a remake ... it would be worse.
