Of all the movies (and I am a film graduate, if it's worth anything to you), this is a movie of the WORST that I've ever seen. I know there's probably the worst out there that I haven't seen yet, but I've seen this, and this is the worst. A friend and I rented one night because Denise Richards was on the lid. Talk about being limited and losing. He was not accepted! His role was very small. What did he do on the lid? IMD is not recommended even for its films. This film was very bad, we wrote a little bit of a video shop when we returned, and put it in the case. It read something like "please secure your customers more from watching this full and bad film!"
