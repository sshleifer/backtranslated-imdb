I got this film without work from my work, with three other similar movies. I looked then for very low expectations. Now this film is not bad for se. You get what you pay. It's a story of love, betrayal, lying, sex, scandal, everything you want in the film. Certainly not a blockbuster of Hollywood, but at affordable prices is not bad. I would never see this film again. In short this is a kind of movie that you would see or late at night in a local television station that just wants to take some time, or you would see it on Sunday afternoon at a television station that is trying to take time. In spite of the worst acting, cliche lines, and small works for the camera. I wasn't interested in turning off the movie and pretending it had never been to my DVD player. Stories have been done many times in many movies. This is no different, no better, no worse. <br /> <br /> Only your average movie.
