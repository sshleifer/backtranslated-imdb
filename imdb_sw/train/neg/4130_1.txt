The top mix of the worst films made. Joanna Pakula's behavior seems to have I.Q. of 3 which is just one under the author and director. Screenplay could not pass through a high school writing class; "joke" is young; The concept of corny. These artists were very obvious to work. I stayed to the end so we could see if it was worse. It did. Life is very short to use any part of this film.
