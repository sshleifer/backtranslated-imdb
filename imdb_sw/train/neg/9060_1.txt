The center opens with this gateway on LOGO. It was one of those "I need to look at this because it is a very bad time", like the Roadhouse unhappy. Writing is angry; The intuitive and acting is a throw-in-mouth-mouth mouth bad. There is a low budget and then there is a hole in which this epic should be thrown and never seen again. I mean, the main characters enter the rental house in a specific house and the house is, well, odd that is not a big deal, but chooses to show all visitors drinking it as it was the Sistine Chapel. Sorry but look at 6 boys looking at every 10'x10 'boring room and futon in it and gushing is blind. I think they didn't learn anything from Bad News News in Breaking Training (see hotel room to watch the area) ... wow toilet !!! yaayyyyy !!!! I don't buy all of the above so everything is going on. If it smells like ... and looks like ... well, you know others. Avoid as a blow. It looks like some other newer advocates believe that since I did not like this film, I am a "disgusting" which I can just think is my phobic, which really isn't true. I decided to do this wacky, something to do with judging the movie according to the actual content of the film and not just for its presence (ie it is fun to see ...) In fact, it may be comforting to see but that is not the same in the big movie, just give them the best material to work with a sharp direction. In fact, I enjoy the effort. In fact, I would like to go to my diverse kitchens instead of looking again.
