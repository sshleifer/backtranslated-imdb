I do not know what HK films have some consultants, but Enter Eagles is not in the top of the pot in HK action. Michael "Fitz" Wong should be happy to find employment at HK, because he could not take his way out of the bag of wet paper in English. Shannon Lee looks good and is a wonderful fighter (better and fights than his father), but his acting skills are also small. In fact, all English talks (90% of the film - even more than in Gen-Y Cops) are very bad and I have changed the voice of Mandarin in order to tie ourselves to the trouble of negotiating dialogue with English subs. Indeed, there are some good guns (but there is nothing that we have never seen before) and a good exhibition, but the effects of the cheesy feel are actually damaging. He said, it's worth getting in with Shannon and Benny "Jet" Urquidez going there. Store, and almost watch all the films for. <br /> <br /> Finally, you can see some of the events that appear to be "well known" to you, especially to shoot out the market (consider Matrix) and Fitz diving out the helicopter wearing black fatigues (consider MI: 2). I think someone thinks at least a few things in this flick were worth stopping.
