This is one of the worst movies I have found to be very interesting for a lot of boring conversations and has some of the most interesting characters and an interesting creature. The only reason I looked at this piece of rubbish was because it was about the 8th fears that I set. This program is ignorant and completely ignorant as it ends. There is no blood which is forever except a few blood tags on the creature, and several wounds of blood guns. Acting is TERRIBLE !! Richard Cardella is as horrible as sheriff and was quite laughable with his behavior is angry. Glen Roberts is a comic exemption and there was no funny at all! Mark Siegel is very annoying and also not FUNNY! Bob Hyman is a decent but not more than that. Richard Garrison is angry and had no chemistry with Kacey Cobb what so ever. Kacey Cobb is so here and had no chemistry with Richard. Generally avoid this part of the litter at all costs! BOMB out of 5.
