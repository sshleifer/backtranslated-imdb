When I come to IMD boards, I always see when I see the "bad movie" after having watched this movie *, I think that soon I will create my own post! <br /> Opening names: large, some type of breathing in the gas oven (yes, see fire = explosion = big film full! I insist, "sometimes") but Seagal Steven as the policeman plays is ... more than words. Some of the cast are ... well do not know where executives were employed but jeez !! I bet my dog ​​would be a better actress than them! <br /> Plan: Grab is not normally <br /> <br /> Action sequence: The first shot of the movie is an explosion.I told myself, well, cool !! At least there will be a good pyrotechnics. Some films are so filled with low-stock shares that were taken from the Air Force ... <br /> <br /> Talk is hilarious, music is pure clean, the end is fun (I mean I was happy at the end because The movie was over !!!) <br /> <br /> My brother who was watching the movies enjoyed (I'm 22 years old, he's 42 ... well). it was about to take a film and destroy it. Maybe sometimes I will look at ... (who never said?)
