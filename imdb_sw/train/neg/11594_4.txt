As a revenge of Freddy, this sequel takes a very good idea and does not go to great lengths to squeeze the story from them. Basically Alice from 4th is pregnant and her child is hated by Freddy who gives her money to deprive her friends. This has the smallest deaths of the entire series and the cracks of wisdom are very poor, so no fans of fear or comedy fans are happy. <br /> <br /> I've never talked about this. It is interesting to see the characters of Alice and Dan come from four, but not worth watching the movie more. Without fun and unhappy, perhaps only the tournament direction saves you from the worst in the series.
