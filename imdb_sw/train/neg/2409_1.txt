It was a sad thing, the whole story is really there so I can go into it but acting was awesome there is this part at the beginning when a woman scientist is going to work she really wearing a white coat at home before leaving to work, I thought to work with biohazard equipment it meant that you should wear a modified clothing in a controlled environment and the laboratory looks like a school lab there is a follow-up on the file cabinet which is associated with any location there to make the position visible and the scientist is actually having breakfast in the laboratory and next to him is a biohazard journal published by his master walking in it and even telling him anything about it ... not to mention the worst worst he cannot get worse than my advice did not look and I think nothing could be worse than the house of The dead visible film of U wi Boll looks like a typical Shakespeare compared to this!
