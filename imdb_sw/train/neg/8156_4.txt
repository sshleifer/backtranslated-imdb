Prom Night 2 is a beautiful movie but nighttime is the best and these movies about how Queen Prom Lou in 1957 is killed by her boyfriend and return back 30 years later to take revenge. The best actors in this film are Micheal Ironside and movie stars. other actors and executive as Justin Louis (I), Wendy Lyon, Lisa Schrage and Richard Monette (I). And there's some good fun scenes like when Mary Lou kills a girl tries to hide in her locker and crushing cabinets with how one of the students on the computer and Mary Lou chooses death.For all this is a good / beautiful movie of fear and my rating is 4 out of 10.
