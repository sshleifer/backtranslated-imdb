I don't know what idiots gave this film Palm D'Or at Cannes's Festival of 1999 because it had a feeling! I really looked at anything just because I couldn't believe that someone would make that film of no meaning. There is nothing interesting about the plot, the characters have no depth and no attempt to provide any kind of ambiance and music or sound effects. Also, if you decide to lose two hours of your life by watching this film, be sure to bring them something to throw because the movie is just a person who runs around with a hand-and-hand hand committee when you can't even see the main lessons. This style has been used successfully in movies such as "Blair Witch" because it creates disruption. In Rosetta, there is no plot and there is no doubt which style would give you any credit. I had to be more aware when you arrived at 2 o'clock that would be terrible.
