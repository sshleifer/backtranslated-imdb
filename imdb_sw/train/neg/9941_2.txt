I mean the truth. This cannot help the Australian film industry to do this kind of film without any kind of code. Okay, if you are stones and have nothing to do, then maybe. I think the filmmakers from here should try to show the whole world what talented people we have, and this is not a car. Come now, this film is just tacky.
