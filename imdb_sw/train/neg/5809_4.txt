I can't see why the film artists destroyed this film. Movie of 1972 and McQueen and McGraw are very close. Steve McQueen was an excellent actor and Baldwin is an infallible actor. He is not interested in his play. The first step in the "Getaway" was amazing. But remake does not step! It is very difficult even though the film's 1972 decision was more difficult than in 1994. I don't understand how Baldwin was imprisoned from Mexico. I think this is an error in the story. <br /> So I think that there is no need to do it, or if they decided to fix the classic, they should choose the best actor for the first role, like Johnny Depp or Brad Pitt ...
