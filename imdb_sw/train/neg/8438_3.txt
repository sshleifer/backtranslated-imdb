I think Laurel bad and Hardy is better than Laurel and Hardy at all, but just hard. Unfortunately, Fox's films are free on DVD, revealing people who may not know very well with L & H for their WORST work instead of their common comedies. Once again the boys are arrayed by a boyfriend's boyfriend about a boy who has discovered an invisible ray. He likes the older daughter, who hates and loves the player guy. It's amazing to think the elite in the Fox thought this is what L & H is required in their films. The flowers of pancake boys seem to be tired and elderly. The only events that make them photographs in this picture are when they try to get rid of the bedroom window at night and a very strange place where Robert Mitchum, a good young man trying to sell Oliver Hardy "insurance" on Stan. br /> <br /> Otherwise, this script is a mess. Forget this and see if you can get a copy of "Chump at Oxford" or "Girl Bohemi" or "Desert Children" instead.
