I saw this movie last year in the Media class and I must say it completely. I was 10 years old (15 years old) so that it could have nothing to do with it. But in English this year, the 11th year, we had to read the Animal Fields, as well as George Orwell. Apart from the fact that the book is from the Revolution, my opinion is that it is a terrible book, and I also loved it. But in 1984, I think it was a very disturbing movie I had ever seen, and I think George Orwell is one of the most lost people in the world. Sorry for everyone who loved his work, but I unfortunately didn't. The films in the films were shown well, but the entire movie was set and events in it were not in my standards. This is just my opinion, and I'm sure many people enjoyed this film.
