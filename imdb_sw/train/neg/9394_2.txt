Oh, man, how serial down was dropped as in 1952! The worst thing is the type of serial that has hated Annie Wilkes (from Misery). Not just heroes avoid traps by adding scenes that were not in the original frame (and that should not be there - tell me that when baddies are clearing in section 7 to 8 will not be able to see the jump characters), but I think this serial has World Memory Stock Footage . I mean, most of them are stock photos! And not just from another series (it seems that all the rounds of the King of the Rocket People, and the cooling of the "eternal" of the 2 to 3 episodes come from the Captain Marvel's adventures, but from itself! The entire sequence of the "Journey of the Moon" (perhaps shorter, 30 seconds long and the characters have not been seen leaving the globe) from part 1 is repeated in section 8! And 10 parts are ALL events from previous events! (They wondered why MST3K had never done events 10, 11 and 12? Yes, they had to stop after 9 so they didn't have to do anything again!) \ T Be prepared to see the Sunniest Moon ever! And the people of the day who can't breathe in their own world? Were they smoking? And if this is not enough, it also speaks with stunts (usually the best thing in the newsletters) is a few and far. Am I the only one who thinks that the Commando Cody hat (or is a lemon-shaped) hat is a completely look of ignorance? Rocketeer was a lighter way, no matter how the movie was bad (and someone, it was bad). The car is not the best car, it looks like a group of children that made Halloween. The only positive thing I can think of is that the actress who plays the hero is better than the usual huncle muscles (hey, everyone has the right to be a hero!), But then it's so unappealing ... <br /> <br /> There is no even worth looking for nostalgia. See Captain Marvel instead. 2/10. (/ BTW, see the Quotes of the most memorable Quotes for a real Liberal Liberal pe).
