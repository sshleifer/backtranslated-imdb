I am 17 years old, and I still love many Scooby Doo movies and old sessions. I love movies of the 1990s, and soon we were directly treated directly on DVD Scooby Doo out of ten years, Scooby Doo and Goblin King, which I didn't expect to be as good as they were. However, Get Back to Discover! I watched certain events, expecting something wonderful, but from what I saw, I was not really interested. First of all, I hated animation. It was flat, separated by very Saturday-morning-cartoon-standard, easily the worst part of the series. Even some are shown to be hate I had the best animation. However, Shaggy and Scooby seemed like aliens, and I missed Fred, Velma and Daphne, as they added much to the old sessions, while Scooby Doo was very good. I also hated the change of behavior, because it seemed like instead of solving the mystery, Shaggy and Scooby were playing superhero, something that they would never have done in movies or Scooby-Doo where? show. The sound of the theme was not very good either, I can't remember yet, and the joke was bad and it appeared. However, I agree that there is a very talented voice, if they had the most beautiful material, and it was never told that different voices and original sounds as much as possible with humans, which they did, I would add. In conclusion, I thought it was too bad, and I did not try to despise it, so I feel myself. 1/10 Bethany Cox
