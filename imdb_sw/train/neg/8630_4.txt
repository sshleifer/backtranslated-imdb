I know that in this period there are other things besides what I will discuss, and I really think it has other features; for example, the fact, after receiving the most improper views of the Jin's view of the Sun in the "rising sun", we see the side of Jin and get a new understanding, the more balanced life of it. But there is a feature in this story that has made me very worried that it has greatly reduced my joy of the whole section. Before now, in the area where Jin appeared with blood in his hands and shirt, he had said that the father of Sun was a man who was getting rich through shady, unlawful methods. I thought maybe he was the master of the group, even; Groups work in Korea, as well as near every other country in the world, so it was possible enough. However, in this period we learn that the father of Sun is actually a master (or top executive) of the Korean automotive company, and what Jin was doing was attacking a government official (who would actually be killed) on his behalf. I can have a particular touch on this because I happen to work in the automotive industry, but I would say it is wrong with a racist to have a view that this kind of thing is going on in Korea; that big companies, such as Hyundai or Kia (which must be a model for this company's false car, as they alone that really existed in fact) work with these mafia routes, instead of like any ordinary Western automobile company . it is strange to me that the authors will be a ghost to write something like that in the story, and that there was no Korean chaos on it. It feels like "Buy America!" propaganda, showing foreign car companies as a crime, unreliable, third-party clothing.
