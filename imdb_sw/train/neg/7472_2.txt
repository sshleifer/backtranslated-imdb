This view seemed to be a good kinda. Kyra Sedgwick is a good actor and I love the police series, but somewhere in this software production went wrong. <br /> <br /> Before all, authors should have more suspects than one, you know who did every time !!!!! That makes it boring. The main character is an amazing anger and cannot be trusted in any way. I know they want to be tough, but shes means, stupid and ugly head. Crime is uninteresting and bland, and its only limping way. As mentioned above, I hate .... <br /> <br /> All in all, this was a great and very bad desire ...
