Not worried. I thought I would see a film with a big issue and action. But it grows boring and predictable after you start interesting. In the middle of the film you have a limited social game and all the tension is lost because it slows down. Nearly the best gets better but not very real. I think the director took this film just too bad. In that kind of movies even if you don't care about the plot you just want a good step. I approached the central / central part. 3/10 rating. <br /> <br /> striker.
