The original part of the film was amazing but eventually it didn't matter. Although Turturro is an actor I like, Luzhin has often resembled a bad mood of a Man and a show of skill if a half-autistic person was angry. It generally looks like this film is trying hard and it ends up looking for retirees despite very good performances.
