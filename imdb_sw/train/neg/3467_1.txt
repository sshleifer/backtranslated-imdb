The cover of this movie box has named Kyle Minogue on it, but has the same fate as Drew Barrymore did in the "Right". That's the first thing that makes this movie blind; They are trying to sell the market with someone in it for 5 minutes. Above all, Molly Ringwald of the popularity of the 80-year-old is the star of this well-written film. It's a good job to work for Molly to get money to make a crappy movie in Australia so it can't be cut in states. <br /> <br /> Any way, this dumb movie is about some dumb movie horror which was never finished because a blind creature kills everyone in it. In all movies, we have to say who is a killer. Long story, remember our little friend Molly, he saves the day ... or he? This action is just bad, renting is if you feel bothering or just breaking it on your local video store if you see it on the shelf. Do not spread fear.
