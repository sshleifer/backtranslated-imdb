My first impression of this bad situation will be when the video trial said it was from people who brought us the Blair project that was out of comparison to this piece of rubbish. Acting was on the production of the 6th grade of Oklahoma and the plot, as it was, predictable, attractive and itself. 85% of the script are the words of four letters with a non-count on them. Mama F seems to be a favorite "author" because it is always used. It should have taken 10 minutes to write this script in some dive for the last phone. Thank God I used and I could fly in many ways quickly. Don't waste your time or money with this.
