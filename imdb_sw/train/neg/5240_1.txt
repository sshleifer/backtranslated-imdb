Once it screens the screen, it destroys all forms of intellectual life around! But on behalf of its producers I must say it does not enter into any group of so-called film, deserves a new denomination of its own brand! It's a "neurological drama"! It is sad and disturbing every neuron in the human brain. It is the closest thing that will ever have a stroke without actually suffering one. It runs without saying, all your members are decreasing, your mouth falls open and it remains, and the most remarkable sign of all is that you find yourself wanting to go blind and deaf. It is not limited to a "movie" type. The only thing that comes to my mind only after I finish my problem is OUTRAGE !!!!!!
