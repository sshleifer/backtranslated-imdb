Wow, I would like to respect anything that David Lynch has done. However, this film is the same as the first film film attempt to make a video of pseudo art. <br /> <br /> Give you a few examples: <br /> <br /> 1. David Lynch is a typical movie style, however, this had modern artistic content (empty walls, "up shots "and the ceiling back) <br /> <br /> 2. David Lynch usually takes great pride in sound, however, in this you can even hear the video camera of hum. It is really hard to swallow the idea that he had nothing to do with this movie. except ... <br /> <br /> ... this is a joke, for David's bail, forcing fans to search for its site (per hour) just to get this drivel. I hope so, because at least that idea is funny.
