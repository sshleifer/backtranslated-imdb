Never exceed (paste this by observation) overturning Dracula's story (though it is with traditional tradition) and an amazing story, if it is not fully discovered of the prince of darkness. The first time I tried to look at it I could only make it just half, before losing interest. It also begins to get better (especially events and thieves and then meet them with Dracula), but on my part it didn't take a bit of time when you hit New Orleans based on Van Helsing's daughter. A good place to put it, but he did not use the advantages of its settings (despite creating a damn damn, where Dracula could grow). From Wes Carven (and they give us that name out), but written / directed by Patrick Lussier. With knowledge it had time and small photographs of dreams, but some kinetic settings and cheap jolts did not help. The messy script doesn't get very silly. Lussier performs an interesting job that remains in place of a mirror, so much blood transfusion (efficiency is achieved well) and many "Virgin" ads. No I am not meant to widows, it is a music company, as it enters into many shots and the daughter of Helsing works there too. O that is not a clear plant. Voice sound is a fun option for rock tunes. Now all exhibitions have been on the shop, but there are a few faces that recognize (Danny Masterson, Sean Patrick Thomas, Nathan Fillion, Shane West and Lochlyn Munro). Gerard Butler as Dracula did not just come, because there is no great presence of existence. She was clear out of the women of the night beauty; Jennifer Esposito, Colleen Fitzpatrick and Jeri Ryan as Dracula brides. Jonny Lee Millar's love and Justine Waddell are honored. Christopher Plummer gives grizzled changes as Van Helsing and Omar Epps enjoy its role.
