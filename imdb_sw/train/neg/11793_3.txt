The deep seizure comes as a television film: a whole trap of business quality actors, a badly created being being "bad man," and a script that is full of technical, political and predictable technology than he knows what to do with. I watched the film because of the creature (I would like to see what filmmakers think about their designs in these cheap videos), and right on the bat, I've been disappointed because the creature in the box is not one in the film. The actors that I expected because of the type of film are (quite realistic and not previously thought). Music was normal, not a thought-out of symphonic music. <br /> <br /> I loved computer format and technical equipment, as well as small design. The film came well, with leading screens to let you know what you are expecting for the story when it comes in. But there are not many stories here anyways. <br /> <br /> This movie gets 3/10 stars IMO. A terrible search and destroy the mission of blowing North Pole with these creatures to protect ... kinda blind. Even the lamer is tagged-on relationship of love between the two characters that you do not see coming. Select this to be a film that tries to find the work of executives off the bench and on the video. Don't bother.
