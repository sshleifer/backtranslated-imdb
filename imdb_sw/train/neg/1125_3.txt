I at school Jeremy Earl, which is how I heard of this film, I don't really know if it was in the hall at all. I don't remember the name. I have seen it, as one of those after the school centers. Acting is the same, not good. The plot was a weak type and the lines were good corny. So the only comment I can give this film is "Eh" I borrowed a movie from Jeremy, if it was in the position of filming, this is one that I would like to walk past and after check it I would like to recommend to any old middle school middle . I've also discovered that many times when urban children are portrayed, the seasons are over or just outdated. Often I think that what makes their characters untrustworthy.
