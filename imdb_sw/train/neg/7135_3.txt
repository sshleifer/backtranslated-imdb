Sorry to say that there is no way, in my opinion, that Enzo could be able to continue with Saleen S7 Twin Turbo. The strength of weight gain with S7 would be very good. S7 has power: the weight of 3.93 lbs / hp when Enzo has 4.61 lbs / hp. The last S7s are also excellent as well. Sorry Ferrari's fans but Saleen has made it better. Like other parts of this film, I need to say that it is too small to be pathetic. The story is a very weak way. Acting in this lemon is worse than daytime soap. I can say that even if you have a contract on negative psychology type of gem. This film is not something like a strict definition about what narcissism and social is all about. Its all about these rich punks find their rocks when they show only the remorse of the treatments made for all innocent road users caused by death or also. I can't give the film "Star 1" Vote because it did not really free me to walk out of the theater. I also think that a beautiful brunette is amazing and the blue eyes of killing as a leading woman saves it completely .... though there is no way to sing it would put on the 'Diversity' cover. <br /> <br>> ps: boy who plays Jason is SOOOOO version of James Vanderbeek.
