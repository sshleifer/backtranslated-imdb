The time spent watching this film lost time. I don't like science fiction. I do not say any kind to se, because good work can be done in any kind. This film, however, is not a good job. I can't make them an exhibition (when it doesn't involve a visitor's makeups), and special effects are amazing. The story was not out and out of BAD, for the comic book of the trekkish. But the fx pictures were clear where all the interests of the makers / attention / money went. The trends switched between lazy and mixed (one was not quite sure who was doing and why and for whom at least one important). "Acting" was really bad. There was no basis for many of the verses instead of the "It was that way on the page and the director said I should be mad / sad / nothing. All right, so it was a SF experiment experiment. appropriate in the areas that should be considered to be important in the midst of the wonderful.
