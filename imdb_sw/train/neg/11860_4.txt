If you haven't realized what is happening in this film in the first five minutes then give it a few more minutes. Lilia is a widow. She is left on the shelves for a long time and wants to burst. She has a young daughter that just shows she hasn't got any one. While watching over his daughter gets the world she was not afraid ... cabaret, where she can play dance in skimpy track track when people give us money. The film is very misogamist. It is a picture of men is bad. Which is unusual if Lilia stops to beat them, not for money, but for hell. When he succeeds in raising them he makes him feel like a woman again. He does not want to join them but he is old with caution. All other players are older women who seem like people in drag and realize when they are in the watch are short. Not short enough I say. It gets romance, however it is short, and you think .... No surprise here we didn't see coming. Although the end is good you know that you can't finish another way. Perhaps this film is not just focused on my population - 30 Male
