If you would like to be interested, don't go to this movie. If you would like to see war heroes, don't go see this film. If you would like to see good acting and nice screens, don't go to this movie. If you like the warfare of the most common warfare that only ends with a political appeal to the public on the greatness and glory of war, SEE MOVIE. Otherwise, don't waste your time. I have always enjoyed the war movies because I think that if they are done well, they can teach us something about the fights of war. This film shows a group of boys walking along the countryside, saying a few distorted lines, doing more predictable things, and advocating the oppressed with the same violence and violence experienced by the oppressed. This film is a shame to make a film with the US! What? Can you imagine being a person from Europe or Africa, or any other country and looking at this, being told how that Americans are right? No wonder everyone hates us! Please, please, please, do not waste your time on this junk piece; if necessary, try and rent. 4/10
