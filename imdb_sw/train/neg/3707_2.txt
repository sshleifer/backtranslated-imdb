It may be the worst movie I saw, (that's worse than Dungeons and Dragons and any film that attracts Kevin Costner.) , and its helpers were not seen as they tried to act. Chris Rock is a good standing player, but he can not just transfer his talent to this film, which is only possible laughs twice in the whole picture. If you haven't looked at this film yet, avoid it as a blow. Go do something constructive and interesting like looking at a weather station or looking at a dry color on a brick wall. <br /> <br /> With Chris's efforts I give 2/10! <br />
