The Ladies Man is a funny movie. There are not many ideas behind him, but what do you expect from the SNL film? It is actually better than many SNL movies (ie, Superstar or A Night At The Roxbury) Tim Meadows and Will Ferrell both were very interesting. Chris Parnell was also pleased in his short area (one of those funnier in the movie). Other than that, the rest are being moderate and are only there to help systems. I have seen funnier movies, but I have also seen dumber too. Again, it is not exactly a comprehensive movies, but it's good to laugh a few. It was funnier like skit though. But still, if you are looking for a beautiful movie, I would like to recommend this. Don't think about it too much, or you will love it. <br /> <br /> Rating: 6/10
