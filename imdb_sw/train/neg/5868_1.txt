Certainly one of the worst movies all the time. <br /> <br /> Conduct of poor production, the idea of ​​a bad story, a bad script, a bad acting ... and I can't even come up with a suitable illustration for how the poor Joan River leadership is. I know there is a special place in Hell for people who financed this film; goes down below the level reserved for the construction of religious children. <br /> <br /> This game is falling sharply. <br /> <br /> (Horror) x (infinity) = Rabbit Test. Avoid this at all costs. <br /> <br /> It is very bad, even not funny how it is.
