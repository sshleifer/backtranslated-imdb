And not quite, the script is not bad, but not described as "Mensonges ...", the artists are not generous (especially Charlotte, if it is interesting if she is common) like Edouard Baer or Clovis Cornillac, and also to be honest, still do not know how such a trick can be achieved, even by throwing Such ...
