I saw this film for the Prime Minister in Sundance 09. Since American Beauty is a movie that has something to say, I had hope of Towelhead. Unfortunately, it was a disappointment. In fact, many of the movies I have seen in the Sundance twelve ceremonies, Towelhead is the only Sundance movie that I ever wanted to walk early. The worst problem for Towelhead is that it definitely comes from a collection of "stimulating" ideas about cultural behavior, rather than a living game. Screenplay comes from a novel name with Alicia Erian. Popular quote Edith Wharton comes to mind: I have never known a novel that was good enough to be good despite being adapted to the opinion of a political author. The inquiry is very serious for Towelhead because his political views are basic and convenient. If there are any time when the male victims of Towelhead, the contempt of white images, the wonderful treatment of foreign cultures, etc., were clean, for a long time. <br /> <br /> For further review, please check out any professional reviews available online. Almost all of them beat the film negatively and delete unknown and cheating tissue depends on. On the other hand, amateur monitors are easily seen. As you read through the reviews on these sites and similarities, you will find many times over the wonderful things: "amazing," "breathing," "deep," "surprising," ... It is a shame to read it, but it is not worth it. me. In fact, I have met many people who seem to consider any book or movie related to ethnic, ethnic, gender, sex or sex as moving deep, stimulating ideas, full of great understanding. If you are such a person, by all means, make the head to Toheadhead and be moved by it. On the other hand, if you set your high standards, you can safely pass safely.
