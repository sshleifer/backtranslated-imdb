This is a weak sequel: it is not appropriate to touch and very interesting for a "Man called a Horse" great in almost every element and when compared to they seem to be not the same. The return is around the first parish and tries to eliminate the various Indian celebrations but comes as a way of trying to make the first bottle of magic. In this film the tribe is lost and abandoned, having lost their homes, modern life has emerged in paradise and they live in misery and poverty. Perhaps this is the point: the first film took us to the place where we want to be, when convenient. This brings us to the lost Indians in a sad world and the Red Holiness is a hero and a savior who opposes the whole idea of ​​the film. The first beauty to put the fact that a white man learned and discovered that real civilization is in morality rather than western materials. In this second film all is missing and so we are approaching the weak film. <br /> <br /> Great desire.
