This J-horror film was followed by a young woman when she returns to her childhood village on Shikoku Island to sell a family home and meet old friends. He finds that one, the daughter of the village priest, drowned several years earlier. He and Fumiko (another childhood friend) then learned that the mother of Zion is trying to bring her back with black magic. Already bonds between the dead and living are weak and friends and villagers see ghosts. There is nothing unique or even very good about this film. Unlike J-horror's stellar films, the doubt does not create the truth, the results do not seem to be more threatening to the end with ignorance. This game is like white rice to be cooked too little for a long time so that it is limited to the mushy. Sometimes it finds this in poor Asian restaurants or cooking your white rice for a very long time. You are about to eat, because you need food, because it is Chinese or Japanese food without rice, but almost destroys food because of glue, the destruction of all gooey. 3/10 http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies
