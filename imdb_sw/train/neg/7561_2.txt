Anyone who does not know 1973 before the British Lion movie 'The Wicker Man' of course without leaving the cinema and feeling 'Poor' and 'Peurile'. <br /> <br /> As a natural user I left with Purely poor feeling. <br /> <br /> From the worst of the inggreds haggle toothed drawing force of law and order in the web-barbaric ritual of worship on the island off Scotland, named Summerisle (original) near the Amazon-icony from Maine coast The United States, named Summersisle, remake doesn't know the feeling. <br /> <br /> This is, sadly, the case of what 'could' be the classic remake of the classic being tampered by serving the simple public mind. No more and nothing less. Ladies (or given a renewed film film) Women participating ... depend on your heads for shame.
