I have been destroyed because I first saw the 1973 edition by Michael Jayston and Sorcha Cusack so the 1983 change is the same desire. I just didn't get a chemistry between two big stars. Most of the stars and exhibition shows just did not do it to me, and what was involved in setting Tim in Rochester's role. It was the director of the cast actually ever read the book. It's amazing! He is a good actor but Mr. Rochester he definitely not! And Zela was good, well, wonderful, a bit of mixture of confusion. On the hand of the hand was good and those Lowood for me was better to deal with the situation, but generally did not receive any magic of novel. Surely he did not want to ask anyone to look at it as a true change of novel. Refer to the truth!
