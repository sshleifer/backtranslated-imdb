After a young girl of Harry Reems was raped by Zebbedy Colt (The Night-Walker), Reems are concerned and defending themselves with sex with other lesbians. Meanwhile, Colt, who carries cane and clothes as a witch, puts more women. Finally, Reems decides to follow him down and finish his crime. In spite of being shot in the film and in the wrong way, it looks like another 70 and finished pictures. Featured rape / abuse is surprising to prevent and attempt money in "Death Wish" is laughable. R. Bolla ("Holocaust of Cannibal") has an army. Colt, who is over-top, goes out in two cases, but also does well for my money. This roughie can be greatly increased.
