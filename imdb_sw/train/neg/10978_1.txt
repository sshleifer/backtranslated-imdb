Usually when the movie gets one vote is because the person just doesn't like it and it doesn't have a minimum, and so he decides to refresh it as much as possible rather than just giving it down. This is not here. Bonesetter is a perfect example of 0/10 film. It doesn't matter anything right and it doesn't have a chance because it doesn't try to do anything. There are some D&D's dilemmas of the plot that does not exist with the lack of any kind of action. It is clear that no one involved in this project gave any kind of effort, because even the hard work of the brave people would be much better. A truly awesome movie.
