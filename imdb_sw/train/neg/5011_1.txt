... And I don't think that the movie deserves to be awarded 1! But this is honestly the worst movie that I've ever seen. My wife took it because of the cast, but the right story since the DVD box was quite visible. It's not a secret, nor a young-infected film. It does not include any feeling, if the head could be lost to any of you. This is a total no-no. Don't waste your time or money unless you feel like looking at a group of young people in a gorgeous size of Gothic, where the killer follows. Nothing new, nothing interesting, anything worth looking. Max Makowski makes worse than Nick Stahl.
