After reading the first 5 reviews on IMDb I was very interested in this movie. But it's a very bad movie, when you see a visitor is 5 minutes (the other movie is a cheap question), acting on the top story, oh boy, this story? <br /> <br> The story does not seem to go in the direction, first uses the visitor (after 7 years! ). Then the girl, who works is higher, wants to walk away from this spirit, then suddenly does not, then again, does and then they don't. Then they come to the conclusion that killing a stranger kills all people (and remember, no one else has ever seen these permanent visitors) and what are they doing? They suffer and hit a bunch of visitors with bonds. <br /> <br /> This is my first opinion on IMD, I am a very clever person who doesn't write recently, so listen to my warning: this argument is not relevant at your time, don't see this film.
