Garson Kanin wrote and guided this look "modern day" Las Vegas with a gap between generations, his first attempts of leadership since the 1940s! David Janssen feels like a great casino owner who reunions with his son (Robert Drivas, who looks like an old man like Jason Bateman). Janssen approaches every area in the same way: defensive, and chip on his shoulder. Playing this cool and failing role is asking a lot from Janssen, who says to everyone as a grouchy husband who is set up (seeks Don Rickles and making him alia). A woman, a good looking for her own identity, makes hip a comment about how young people appear under Vegas (giving them ten years), and her refusal for Father's life causes one another. Brenda Vaccaro is as good as the self-made secretary and Edy Willaims is happy as the girl's exhibition in the audit. Unfortunately, "Where the Demons For" do not have anything else that goes instead of the current ethical discussion between adults and their children, the immediate shots of T&A and amusingly jaded bits satirical bits on the top-stakes gambling world - many who are covered with now, ad nauseum. ** from ****
