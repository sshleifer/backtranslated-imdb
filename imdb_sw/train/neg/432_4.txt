This movie was able to be more than it was. But it not only fails to deliver, it brings the human rights of humanity at the same time. John Cusack is even more interesting than he was on the Day of the Day of Good and Evil Day. The difference is that this time he should have a sense of south, which he loses several times every area. <br /> <br /> Al Pacino does his shtick but seems to be going through this film and collecting payments. She is as good as usual but not difficult to stand. <br /> <br /> Help cast - throw it to a romantic female interest that has added a little, if anything, for a story. Speaking of the story, a person who cares so much “who cares about the truth” where Cusack is a boy of the righteous mayor who just needs to find “something right” should be done. People do not do this way. The character of Cusack loses all trust in the end, which without revealing, is preaching and despair. The last part makes the last observation obvious. It is also very accurate but I do not want to enter the law. <br /> <br /> This is bad, and movie numbers. It seems to be interesting for the first 40 minutes and then it's really preaching, meditation, and self-film for the last hour. Better off with crap without mind than this bunch of junk.
