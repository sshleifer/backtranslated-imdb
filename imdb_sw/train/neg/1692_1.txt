Okay, if you have seen the Ring, you are grateful to the Foundation. Trying to be awesome for having a freaky camera function with a great voice, but it fails with sadness. The plan, if you call it, is weak and still full of holes, for example, how does the service center know that Yoko was not working when people who lived in the house were not there? And it's not quite clear the behavior of Bill Pullman to do with nothing. He just kind of come out of place to develop a plot. It did not make many feelings happen to the original family. Who was lying in the room, the little boy or father? And was Yoko alive or dead when the guy service center looking for? There were many unanswered questions and I was very tired to think about it more.
