"Dominique" is one of those films that "slow-like-molasses" should be generated. The most beautiful and repetitive system (how often we see Robertson walking down the stairs slowly because he can hear the piano player?). It is more liberated at the end with an amazing twist, which, unfortunately, followed by a second twist which only succeeds in leaving the bad taste in our lips. It is not a very enjoyable film.
