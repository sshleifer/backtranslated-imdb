Cage (1989) was one of the buddy's "buddy" budgets that were produced during 80 thanks to a large part due to films like 48hrs. and weapons to allow. This single star Reb Brown and Lou Ferrigno as the former Vets Vietnam which happens to run the dive internal bar. Rebe keeps Lou because he saved his life in 'Nam. But Lou was shot by the head and is now very soft. Although she is older, Lou has a baby brain. One day some ruffians throw us waiting for them in the bar and Lou and Rebb voted. But to pay for the mother. They beat the bar to leave Lou and Reb without something. That's until the two buttons entered the photo (one of them is a very good person) who has a plan in mind. <br /> <br /> The film is a waste of time. Maybe if they went all the way to make a hard step based on clicking instead of trying to drop down the difficulty of the situation perhaps would work. Alas, not the audience are left to make the bag. Oh well. It's very bad because you have all the features of the famous B. B. Good luck sometimes, I think. It is unacceptable. <br /> <br /> xxx
