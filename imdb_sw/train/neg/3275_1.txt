TO SEE THE MOVIE WANTS TO RECORDS TO THE SOMETHING OF TOM, JOHN SCHNEIDER, CATHERINE BACH, SORRELL BOOKE, JAMES BEST, DENVER PYLE, SONNY SHROYER, AND BEN JONES! MOVIE ONLY TO BE BADLY! First of all, this film begins with Bo and Luke running for Jesse. Bo and Luke did not do that in a real series! This film shows characters who do not think doing things that will never happen in a row. In the series, Uncle Jesse was faithful, and a lasting law. In this film, he is a criminal who makes pigs and cigarettes and the governor of Georgia. More, if this was an extension to the Dukes of Hazzard Reunion! and Dukes of Hazzard in Hollywood, I have one question: HOW CAN MAKE JESUS ​​MAKE THE MOON WHAT IS IN THE HAZZARD IN THE MOVIE OF Hollywood? AND HOW BOGA HOGG COMES INTO THE REUNION OF THE REUNION IN 1997! MOVIE AND ROSCO RAN HAZZARD? DOES IN THE DEATH OF DOING IN LIFE, IN TIME OF TIME OF TIME IN 11 AND 8? If Hollywood is required to make a good film, they should bring back James Best, John Schneider, Tom Wopat, Ben Jones, and Catherine Bach as they did in 1997 and 2000 and made a friendly movie with nature characters who did show what it was and still compared to the movie this disgusting, shameful thing! If you want to see the best movies of Dukes, or buy the original series, or go to walmart.com and buy a DVD set of 2 which includes Reunion, and Dukes of Hazzard in Hollywood movies! They both beat the original star, and are friendly family! Don't waste your time on a film that is not recommended CD!
