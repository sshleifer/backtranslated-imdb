<br /> <br /> Get your brewskies out and enjoy this flick action step. Kempo great skill (good to hostage, respect and sticks - a poor bed!) It is the only quality of the release of the movie that only sounds bad. The plot is not half bad; just hanging pretty badly. But if you see this film for anything except military art, you miss the boat altogether. And for the film should be made Koreatown, the way of Korean players (even extra).
