I love 80s flicks and I remember when "Night Night / Night Night" was removed from our movies, I was so desperate, so I was very happy to see some of these at Fear.net. You Better Look at what I came to expect for these types of movies. The quality of the special effects was disturbed by today's standards, the development of a very long character, but all in all was a great laugh! The events where it disappears because Santa, the father, feels his mother and later when the group is shown lighting lights - not the lights as you would in the 80s, but the real lights! - really tell my wonderful bone. However, events where he was looking at children in his neighborhood gave me a wonderful feeling of different situations. I was also happy to try to find out who some of these actors. It took a while to think that the main character was a beautiful teddy bear on Brother.
