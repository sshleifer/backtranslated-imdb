This film fails to capture any secrets and preferences that the book provides. The main point of the book, understanding, is not even appropriate to touch, leaving the viewer wondering why everyone is making a great deal about them and why they like to risk their lives. <br /> <br /> character development is not quite good. No personal history or development leaves the audience irrespective of what is happening to them, and so the monitoring of the step falls flat. The search for the manuscripts has disappeared in an instant, and without real explanation, it is not to leave any feeling of satisfaction for why all the search was for. This is one of the worst changes I have ever seen. It's awesome to waste time. If you have not read the book, skip the film and read it. If you have read the book, skip the movie and read it again. <br /> <br /> It's almost like the action of making a movie was despicable to the book, so it was done well and for this movie shame. It is also embarrassing, because it would have been good if they had stood on it at the height of its success and perhaps they could have found a good journalist and other good actors. <br /> <br /> Please don't waste your time, read the book!
