It seems that the cast should make sure at least the average movie. And so I stayed for 102 minutes of unbelief. Apart from Ed Harris no one has the ability to act. Even Sean Connery, whom I usually worship, must have a day off when publishing all of the Case Only. Not once during all the film actor can stress me. This has led to this cheap and non-commercial film. <br /> <br /> Story makes little. It is exciting, and the plot will not be expected. The only conclusion should look at this film if you have nothing more important to do.
