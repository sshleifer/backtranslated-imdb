I think that it didn't mean to produce the second part of the film as "My Girl". "Girl" was a very good movie but it is ridiculous to make the second part of the movie which one of the main characters (Macaulay Culkin as Thomas J.) is dead. The story was finished after the first movie. I wonder why someone tried to find a way to keep the story going. That was useless!
