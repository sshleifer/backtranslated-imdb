Everyone involved (and listeners) should search for "Candidate" to see how this movie would be good. What happened to the story of South America? Did Julie Christie and Kate Capshaw think to let their work be in the card. So far I have loved every Gene Hackman performance and / or movie. She was desperate (which I could never believe) or trembling for dreadly. I also loved and defended Richard Gere (and badly beaten). But here he did not "power". He was not afraid and only occasionally convincing. All in all I had been very disappointed. I expected more from this director and cast. If you can't find "Candidate" check out "Wag dog" again or even "Bulworth".
