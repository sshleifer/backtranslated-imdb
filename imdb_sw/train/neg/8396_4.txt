... but I found it well too. The story here is predicting - filmmakers are trying to imitate a horror movie where the killings occurred. Three I think happens. This is not a general bomb - cast is very good and profitable to John Ireland, Faith Domergue and John Carradine provide the best performances. It is good for you - for a small budget film. Do not expect any dirt, swearing, blood OR OR (film has a very strong PG rating). I was never too tired - it was a good night to see. I saw it on the video - it was the HORRIBLE magazine - very dark and some events could not see. However I had no hatred and it has an end at the end that you wonder - basically nothing happens up to that time so it stops you. Value to see but only if you are a full-film film.
