This is an example of the "full crime" of exciting. Full crime is done by an investigating officer, ignoring all the symptoms, once he knows who is guilty. The audience should wait around the entire movie to the infected person. The result is like each part of the "Columbo" or "murder he wrote". Director himself says the story of a hackney to show police officer to look at the part of Matlock! This story does not fill in 90 minutes but the director insists using every 120 minutes to fill each piece in the book. Skip this, you have nothing.
