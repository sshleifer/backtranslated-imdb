In fact, I went to see the film, not because of the actors, not because of conspiracy but because it was tested 17 in Luxembourg and the movie should be brutal or photographic photographing in this category. I do not believe, being a movie-freak, I have seen many cruel films in my life (This is a killer, impossible, Hellraiser) but this film was the worst and cruel picture I saw. <br /> <br /> The program is unclear, leading is wrong, acting was not even the music of music was a cheap copy of the so-called "awesome sounds". There is no single feature of mind in the entire movie, and some events are very hard to stand. (especially the area, where you see milk in glasses and hear the baby crying - awesome). I can't understand why the movie was tested in Germany, where typically the parameters are really complicated (for example the law (brutal but fun and very interesting on Asian movies and instead of a great deal) even the movie if grace status is tested 18) . No one can call the Horror film, because it was more to show the year than on public misleading (Displaying the face of "Creep" in the middle of the film was a very bad decision); for me (the exemption of my expression) is one of the director of madness who lost his awesome fantasies. In some cases you can see violence, which does not quite do with the plot nor does it explain anything. The program has holes and barriers, the dialogue is interesting, honestly I cannot mention one positive feature of the movie except for Britain and Scottish emphasis. If I had something to say, I would like to ban this film from the movie, I understand why there is not even a big production company that has invested their money in this trick. <br /> <br /> I hope to find the buttons on my thread and I'd be happy to discuss on one topic or another. <br /> <br /> "Livin" baby dream, livin 'dream' David Aames
