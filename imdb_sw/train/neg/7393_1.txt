I am a great fan of Steven Seagal. Hell, perhaps as much as he does though I have no interesting street for fret-mullet-ponytail games. Having said my intentions and my love for America's pleasant and heroic action, it is with a heavy heart that I must declare this to be its worst movie. I don't know he can make any film worse than this. <br /> <br /> In his defense great problems with this film appear to occur after production. It is very clear that this film should have different stories. That causes loud voices that Steve's voice is not appropriate to sync with that voice called. The layout is pisspoor and generally this gets worse, it gets worse, and at the end you want to come to the Da Vinci Code instead. Yes, it's bad. After this I don't know what to expect from Steve. My friends still laugh at me for listening to his CDs. Is it when I start to look at some of Van Damme directly to the nutty DVD logs? If you are tempted to watch this film, take your eyes out and find them under the toilet. The dark night is better than 89 minutes of this.
