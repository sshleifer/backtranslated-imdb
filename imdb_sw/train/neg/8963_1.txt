Murder in this movie is not evil, but certainly the movie is. It's worse than that. It is not even appropriate to wear it when you put it on your DVD player. It even makes you wear your shoulders from a DVD store, not to say money and when you use it and watch it. Horror. It is more to understand how anyone can say anything positive about this movie. It was a bad habit of mine which caused me to stop focusing, adding to the pressure of the group from my colleagues. <br /> <br /> The article is bad, leading even worse and acting it is obviously despised. <br /> <br /> I hope you don't see this as destroying your happiness, I would like to see it as a right warning: Don't waste your time looking at this trash!
