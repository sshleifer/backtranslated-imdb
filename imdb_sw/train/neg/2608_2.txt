My 10-year-old daughter, Alexandra, writes: <br /> <br /> I thought it was terrible, and I thought it was just a repeat of things from "Dalmatians 101". I couldn't wait for the film to be finished. The best part was characterized by the beginning - they were beautiful and well done. All films are not worthy to watch. Thank you.
