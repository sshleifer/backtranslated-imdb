The "color-and-number" price of monster prices, is filled with a group of conventional conspiracy material from the great film creation. It is as if someone had a card with ideas of conspiracy from other movies written on them, which were suspended, and dealt with. Such plot lines and characters who came in the program were inserted into the script. Characteristics are photographed, so that you can play "I think who lives like a monster food" after less than ten minutes on the film, and probably get one right - including the order that will be available. Most of the perpetrators are very worried, that the root of the organism is wrapped up. Some of the main characters include: Billy Idol's hippopotamus who triggers a pope, brat loudmouth who shines bankrolls, a man of Capt. Ahab's vendetta, and the girl of Ahab who makes the dance on the bar. Oh, with a huge animal, a big adult needs treatment of fury. On the way, people say a lot, beautiful girls walk around with wet shirts, spouses make foreign beaches, explosions occur, temple ruins appear, and pirate-faced pirates. Exciting, for the most part, but one thing bothered me: the absence of characters when other people were killed. After one of the destructive violence, it makes a joke of one fabric. I was almost hearing the shots of rim. <br /> <br /> Overall, OK, if you have 90 minutes to lose, and you want to laugh on a very bad movie. Otherwise, you might want to fly this.
