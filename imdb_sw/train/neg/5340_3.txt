*** OWNER SPOILER *** I can see how this is a film that can seem beautiful as a script, but it is lowered, unlikely and ultimately ignorant. I saw a fake death coming up to miles away. Rene Z. tries hard in the written part, and also Patricia Arquette. Investigation whose name I cannot remember (who is not Chris Penn) is a great sweaty on actress. See if you can't be able to distinguish between the films that the clever can not follow, and so you can't understand it. See if you like the work of a cheesy camera that makes you a seasick. See if you like to watch Tim Roth work with unwieldy script. See if it comes late at night for free. Otherwise, hiring ordinary managers.
