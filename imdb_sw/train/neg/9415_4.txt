Repeated many times and often confused, the original version of Man On Fire was at least ten years after the date it was released and the previous years has not made it better. This is the kind of film that most producers with very little experience and experience are getting a lot of attention and everyone is only paying their best alimony or their drug dealer, and Scott Glenn's defender is leaving the leg to save 12- years, the daughter of the spoil of the wealthy Italian family. Of course surprising - Joe Pesci, Brooke Adams, Danny Aiello, Jonathan Pryce - have done better, the step is thin and lighter with the unique mark of John Scott (the part that turned to the end of Die Hard) makes a good impression. One case where remake (made by Tony Scott, the preliminary choice of the director of this version) is improving.
