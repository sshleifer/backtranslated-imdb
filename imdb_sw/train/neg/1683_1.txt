It's hard to call the Grudge movie awesome. For better made me a little jump from surprise for a short time. If someone is forgetting the horrible situation (and failing) and looks on other parts of the film, he is also disappointed. Acting is the same but not good. Stories can be surprising at the beginning, when someone tries to find what's happening. But towards the end the person understands there is not much to understand. "Awesome" things appear sometimes have been added to the script without reason ... <br /> <br /> So ... (yawn) See this movie if you have nothing more interesting to do, like cutting carrots or looking at the clouds.
