I am writing this because somehow I heard that I have been caused to believe that the wonders of darkness were a good movie. While it's not the worst I saw, it's certainly not good. The weak script, weak participants, and weak leadership. Even if they can't afford a big name, can it be too much to ask for the most interesting actor? It was painful to watch an open actor out of the film with its limited performance. That story was vaccinated and scripted well. Special effects were small. Tricks "suspended" employed regularly here were hard to swallow. <br /> <br /> Being fair, dark still no worse than some of the Horrors 'episodes' masters. But it is not exactly the same with quality movies yet. Dark Summer is only recommended for horror of horror fans who do not want to miss any movie in that kind, even if it is not suitable one. For anyone else, when you should be used for something else of value - what should be very simple.
