That that I loved earlier "Caligula" even for all its weaknesses, I must say this trailer modification was bad. <br/> <br/> Listen Jovovich to say that the brutal American of the delicious "Mmm cuhligyooluh ..." makes me feel sick. Seti does not appear Roman at all ... it looks like behind the house of Hollywood actors, and the Roman clothing looks like cheap shopping at a shopping mall. It is a "charming" Adriana Asti looks like a fifty-year-old Spanish woman very afraid of her thoughts, as if she does not know the trailer of the film. Acting has to be some of the worst I have ever seen, and many lines I hear that actors of random shouting "CALIGULAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA !!!!!!!!" with a loud voice and to ignore it because of their abilities. Normal sex events fill up a good trailer 40 or 50%, with events with famous actors / artists like Gerard Butler (who likes screenshots for every three and a half seconds) don't do anything but look anxious or go out with their small lines, just wipe them down with the ignorance of their delivery. Courtney Love's section includes looking for him as his dumpy-self-mutual dependence on the door around the moon or something. You can't tell him because he has been stabbed or high or interrupted by idiotically. <br /> <br /> Black Black is just annoying ... randomly laughing, and screaming in such a way that it irritates. <br /> Helen Mirren ... was in nature, and returned to her "Caligula" has ... "CAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA !!!!!!!!!!!!!!" I especially "love" (and with love, I mean hate) line of Ennia, "Caligola ... j00 no maki I * something that is unknown * .... * something that looks like j00nalo *" It is also proud to say four Caligula's annual rule was greater than the birth and death of Jesus. Indeed, this should be the worst, powerful, fun piece of skin that is called "art" I've ever seen. Even if Gore Vidal disliked Caligula's original, it should not be displayed or given its name on this bunch, regardless of how much they paid (except a billion trillion yen). Trailer worse ever.
