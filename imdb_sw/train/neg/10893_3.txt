This is one of those movies that should be a better way than it was. I'm afraid to think what the Blockbuster agreed to should look like, because the DVD cutter had the weight of the epic number. Naturally, you do not expect to be "Godfather", but the acting class or two can be ready. Also, there were many good people in this film, but they were shocked down. I like to watch the bevy of the flaming fire around their BVD as well as the next guy, but even I have the right to expect a little bit more. It was not a total loss, though; at least we got the effort of Drew Fuller's (covered) and actually stitching the hair. And there is Huntley Ritter to look even cuter than made in "Bring It On" (and make up too). There is always a financial fabric, children. You just need to look hard for it. And from time to time, you should use your pause button.
