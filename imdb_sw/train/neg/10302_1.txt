Since "Rugrats" comes from a good and wonderful series of cartoon for a great price and really terrible for two-year-old children over the past three or four years, certainly Klasky-Csupo assistants should be out of thought. After throwing all the characters, add even a new stupider, replace the sound (though I like Nancy Cartwright, not Chucky Finster!), And have a continuous sense (ex.: In Kimi episode I watch another day, Tommy and Chucky each one got a new puppy, but after that period, the dogs mentioned earlier were not found, you will think the creators can kill a show of mercy. But noooo. <br /> <br /> All I will say about this special is that sucks! While it's not as dangerous as Kimi's events, everyone is more stupid than they were, including my grandfather (my God! He was the best character in the show, but now he has no real meaning). Finally it cannot have fluffy, and the only thing between this and other crappy periods ('98 -'01) is that children can interact with adults. Who, what joy! <br /> <br /> No star even for "All Growed Up" Rugrats. Klasky-Csupo, please SEE this show before you get any worse.
