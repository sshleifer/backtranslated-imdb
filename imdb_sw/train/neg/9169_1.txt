It gets very bad. Only half the way of redemption is the result of thousands of bullets used during the film. There are environmental errors everywhere. Acting is bad, except Kirk. The story is like holey as grail, and the belief that the movie is a video game itself just kill the movie, if it wasn't already dead. So it's all to lose your life. I would like to give this zero that that's the option at the standard level.
