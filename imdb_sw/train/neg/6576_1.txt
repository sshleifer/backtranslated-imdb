I did not fully accept these views which he said this is a good movie. This is a completely developed movie. I mean SUCKED - S.U.C.K.E.D. The development of the story is wonderful. Mia Kirshner changed from the innocent girl to the ass to enjoy the party for any reason at all times. Additionally, all actresses seemed to be too old to become college students - college students seemed like 30 years old - you know others. I just watched about the first ten minutes and started moving quickly to watch sex scenes. All sex scenes are lame, quickly and, most importantly, no round. All sexual events are interesting, based on how many clothes they had. Are you grace - put it down and defend a few bucks. Conclusion: Stories - 0, sex - 0, act - 0, score - 0 out of 10.
