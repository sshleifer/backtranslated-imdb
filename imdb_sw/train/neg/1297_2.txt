I basically took this movie because I had seen a brilliant record of Kitato Takashi of Zatoichi and I had the feeling of another story of samurai created as well as Asano Tadanobu. These two movies are of the world only. Zatoichi added humor and deepness to its characters and the traditional pictures of traditional samurai. Gojoe goes off the end of another dimension. First of all, I have a hatred of movies with other characters informing the audience what the main character is like instead of having a promotional character over the movie period. "You can't decide whether you are a monk or a hero" says almost every character in the presence of Benkei, but this problem of trouble cannot be made within its own character. Instead of character development, we find bloated, boring, gory war scenes. Asano's character has not developed and it looks like he has bored and does not know what he is doing there. I know that often it looks away from the cold and that is part of the Asano appeal, but this film does not use it. Most of the camera's movements are nausea. There is a place that goes forever where the camera surrounds the main characters until my wife and I feel like vomiting. The latter is ignorance and instead of fighting the weather. It is very bad that the good Samurai movies are not made in Japan today and this type of budget. Colors, landscapes, and clothes were good, but others are temporary waste of loooong. I would like to see one of the cups of this story.
