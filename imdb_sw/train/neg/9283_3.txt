I don't know how this movie has received very good comments on this site! I am a great fan of vonnegut and I know very well this showtime story of more than faith, but even if I wasn't, acting poor, making very badly (Sean Astin as talented, athletic, and everyone, Harrison's child A completely generic!) And under normal typing rendered this tripe barely watchable. Someone explained how good that the line of Maculay Culkin was. If you read it and thought it was a romantic beauty (sadly, perhaps it was a wonderful part of the movie), maybe you would like this film. But if you're a fan of Vonnegut or don't lose it, don't see it. Please.
