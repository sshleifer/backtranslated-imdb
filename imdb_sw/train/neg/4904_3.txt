Teamo Supremo are three children, with their leader - Captain Crandall, Rope Girl and Skate Lad, all with their own battle (question! Chika! Fear!) And dress up. They work for the governor, Kevin, and were employed after they wanted to become heroes and play in the game. They lead a normal life as well, and have family and school work, but many of the actions take place away from school fighters. All criminals have unique and unique characteristics, such as Mr. Members and his men who never know what they are but are doing any action. From a bad robot to their three sinners should meet them and stop their evil, and often extraordinary, they should get power, retaliation etc.. The animation itself is beautiful and beautiful, but the style seems easy for purposes. Nature has a color of interaction with buildings that appear to be future. Music is very good, and the show is not so bad, although the style is not what you like. <br /> <br /> The squares are almost always not worried, but after all this is a cartoon and one cannot blame for it. However this cannot be in the same position as Fillmore! or Pepper Ann.
