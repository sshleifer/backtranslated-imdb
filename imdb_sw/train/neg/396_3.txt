I saw this when it was in the playground, started out very much I say back in 1980 this was a terrific movie and special effects were best when. Now you have to be at least 30 or so in 1980 to understand this point because reading the film history is lacking intelligence at the time, expectations and other psychological factors.

I conclude I mean someone who described it to rest with a balloon of water in your hand before throwing it, rather than being a very poetic description. In my experience, it was not just strong. My wife and I were well ... How can I say this? We were angry, we said we paid money, we invested while looking at the best movie. "We both felt that we were stolen by the end that made us a possible production company to run financially and could not add enough to finish it correctly. In fact, my wife said well, was not completed, ITI WANTED!
