I was looking at this look, that I love Danny Dyer and I think Gillian Anderson is a talented actor. Origin was interesting. I liked the relationship between the two stars. Then it jumps to the main plot, which gets attacked by a group of visitors and Dyer gets severely beaten when Anderson gets rape. Then they decide to go to take revenge. Sounds good, right? Well, it isn't. The story gets boring and side-tracked, and some things get very good. I will not give any details, but things happen that I, for one, are not interested in seeing. I like to give all the movies a course of doubt, and I wanted to love this much. Didn't work out. I offer 3 out of 10, especially for acting.
