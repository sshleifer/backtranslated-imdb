The boy of trouble is one of the worst movies I have seen in the last ten years! This is a bad movie about a bright boy who was adopted by two parents, but gets into trouble later. Junior can drive Grandpa. He can harass those who carry. He can put the room on fire! It's a bad movie such as BATTLEFIELD EARTH. The end is worse. Use RICK CHICKEN instead. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 out of **** I will give you.
