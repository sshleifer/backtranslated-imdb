I watched the Malayalam movie "Boeing Boeing" made in 1985 (which in turn is dominated by the English movie of the same name) backwards. The basic story of garam masala is the same - but it has been told in a pleasant way, the classy joke replaced with the usual times that are found in ordinary Indian movies (perhaps the director did it according to the taste of the Indian audience) ... /> I have not seen English backgrounds. But he was very pleased with the Malayalam film (made by Priyadarshan himself) which was a side comedy to divide, back at that time. Of course the role of Mohanlal, Mukesh and Sukumari (who made the responsibility of cooking) was common and special. Maybe, I was also hit by the Malayalam film that I could not tolerate even the smallest in its Hindi remake. But I still feel that Akshay Kumar and John Abraham have overturned. Paresh Rawal has done a good job - but it is not available anywhere near Sukumari. But all is the same, if someone compares it to other recent Indian movies.
