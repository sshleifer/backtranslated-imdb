Having decided some time to collect Billy Bob Thornton's films (on the power of class movies like "Sling Blade", "Easy Plan" and "No One" among others), it was necessary that there would be an unusual Turkey. there. What I did not realize however, was that there could be this one is bad. I will give you an idea of ​​how beautiful this film is - funniest conversation in it goes like this: "Knock Knock", "Who is there?", "A great man smelling", "A good man who is good?", "A very good man - is you!" . Yes, people are really bad. Billy Bob is in it for two minutes (I think he needed to work at that time in his work), and the rest of the movie is painful. For some reason though, of course it is bad, I am not offended. That's perhaps because I save my restructuring for any higher budget, special effects of junk as "Fast and Furious" and not "no-budget" flick like this. 2/10 on push.
