How could I describe my feelings about this movie: hideous? head? lack of consistent writing? ignorant ignorance? Try all of the above for this storage. And that for the direction. <br /> <br /> Stories? Well I think there is a story. Two dumb blonds look for work after flight on a golf course. They are wrong with the 'world of refusal of the murderer' (fear) and 'employed' with 'two mobsters'. Someone thinks "take him out" means a date, and another gets a little drama he dreams of. And of course, the string of string for farting string, which builds and winnings of the casino. All these sounds can be fun? I think again. They try to make it funny, but its not. The filming process was not well done. I have seen the best photos in Hong Kong movies. Visual is average for late 80s film. But the problem is that his movie of 2007. <br /> <br /> It is not worth my time to look again. They still did not hit the movie "Dan" of Danny Glover from the early 80s as the worst movie all the time, but again the film is in its own class. "F"
