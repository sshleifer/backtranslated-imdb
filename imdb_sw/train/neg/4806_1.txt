I don't know what it is with these Brady children. First, Barry Williams brags to the public about being sexy with her TV sister, Maureen McCormick, then about dating with her mother TV, Florence Hederson. Then, Susan (Cindy) Olsen plays music for a porno movie group. Then Mike (Bobby) Lookinland gets trouble with driving. Finally, Maureen (Marcia) McCormick and Eve (Jan) Plum could have sex with same-sex sex. Now, Christopher (Peter) Knight is followed by a good example of young people in the early 20th years of stint on "The Surreal Life", which was the first fun to watch, and now married and in a very strong relationship with evil. The last period, where he appeared to a group of naked pictures with another naked girl to give Christopher for his birthday, was not a good step on his side. And she did it in a mature fashion, just picking up and leaving her head. I think he was always bowing to every need and now he finally took a position. And I hate to say that, but I think she uses him, in words. The way he was attacking her with an engagement ring and how she did everything little. He also speaks openly about having other women and it is obviously still sleeping next to women and men, which is not something anyone who respects should do when he is already married to someone. If this was a man talking to his wife like, and going out every night sharing and having sex with other people, everyone would be standing behind his wife to forget him. Why this should be different. What started as a slight crushing on another exhibition of a major disaster. Adrianne, as good as she is, resembles another Britney Spears and Lindsay Lohan, need some treatment because she cries like a baby on many silly things. I feel sorry for him, but Chris needs to run away, because he's a good man who can't afford to be embarrassed like this.
