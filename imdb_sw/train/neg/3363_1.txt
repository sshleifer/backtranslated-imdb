The original version (on 19th) did not have any "monster", it is only the "stuff" that scary, this version however shows every element of "mind spirit", including should be special effects. "Secret", as shown in the previous film, was the most horrible part: one had not only the knowledge that caused the strange things that happened. By showing the face of the "old man", Mr. is completely lost. If more serious: special effects (right children face face) are ridiculous. This is a stupid remake, it also looks amazing even to be almost as scary as the original
