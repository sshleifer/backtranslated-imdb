romance without feeling, a game of uncertainty (or drama) .... this film should be all this and fails every account, if not try. Or as a director / editor / scriptwriter team don't really try. Pastors are able - they need good help. One thing that is not missing is the mark of George Delarue. Good and moving. What embarrassment is attached to this film. In beautiful words of film artists and movements and music to synchronize and add effect. This editor was hit on music regardless of conversation and movement. The area of ​​love is mainly subsidized in this regard: the hatred of the leading executives. There is another feature in the film that works: the scene of the scene. Just one time at Grand Central Center. I would like to think in advance what will happen; but how it was done in those circumstances was breathing. <br /> <br /> Some of the consultants on this board said that the US's involvement of Nazi criminals actually happened during these years of MacCarthy terrible. At that time the film seems to begin to look seriously at the American community, it takes in the usual romance; before any human sensation can surround us, it is far beyond the 'thriller' journey. If only the film is offensive to the performers' talent, it scares the issues that they make (and fails) Take. You are warning.
