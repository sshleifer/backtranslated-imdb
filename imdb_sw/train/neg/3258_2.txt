DOC SAVAGE: SON OF BRONZE (1 star out of 5) <br /> <br /> Movie / Scary, horrible ... according to a series of newsletter / karatasiback series with Lester Dent / Kenneth Robeson ... about great hero The hero of adventure in '30s and his five assistants, all experts in a particular field of effort that enables them to fight evil. It was a good series of hokey ... but kinda gladly read when I was a teenager. I knew they made a version of the movie in 70 years, stars Ron (Tarzan) Ely ... but I've never had a chance to see it. It has never been played on movies where I lived and has never been shown on TV. Now that I have seen the film I can understand why. The program and characters have never been taken seriously ... it's all kinds of language-in-cheek and camping ... kind of like the old TV series Batman ... just without the benefit of being funny ... or having any Visual flair. Corny talks, special effects of cheesy, dumb views, action action and rough, bad acting. True, I see it kind of interesting in his evil ... what could they have been thinking about? Arnold Schwarzenegger had the patience to have a star in a modern remake ... but I think that it would have proved to be much better.
