It is the load of Hollywood's Leftist village. This film promotes solidarity as a hero and good if it is a pacifist principle. Fairytale ends with the character of the pacifist, played by Danzel Washington, in fact getting the promotion of his rebellion. What? What are these Hollywood tools? Is this still a reward for McCarthyism? If I feel it is wrong it is because I have been filmed by movies that do not accept the political agenda. Military copper in this film is shown as, is another? Gung-ho war mongers. Sound known? Ever seen a movie where CIA or any government organization is not evil? Think about it. However, Crimson Tide emphasizes it. Characteristics of Hackman, captain of the U-boat Ramsey, comes as a raving cycle, to the very end when, of course he comes to his mind, has a perfect 360, refuses his desire for blood, shows the promotion of Ron Ronald, and reproduces for retirement for services. Mr. mutinies, takes your boat command, puts U.S at high risk of receiving the first nuclear strike, and encourages him? What a hogwash does!
