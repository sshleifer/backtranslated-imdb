I also saw this film in the local investigation about the past year. First, I will tell you that it seems to be good. Cassella is a good talent and a popular movie style. I just want a nice movie as shown. I can't call a terrible movie. Keeping in a few shots of decaying soul does not make a terrible movie. There is no secret, no doubt, you know who did all the time. <br /> <br /> It's a drama. You know what's going on with both sides of the entire movie. Acting was the same, I think, but nothing special. <br /> <br /> With the identification, "revenge may be death" .... really? ... should look at the sky hundreds of fears / thriller movies have the same as the same line? It hurt me to say some of this, but I know many people who worked on this film, and I know they don't want people to smoke on their ass, so I give my opinion of honesty.
