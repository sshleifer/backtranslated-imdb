That is undoubtedly the movies of Rajnikanth worse than all. The first part is done with a strong comedy from Goundamani but it becomes worse and worse and is not quite possible. Our hero also takes to dig the Saints in the same name (Father) through a single string and smooth one. The first half has Rajni speaking of his usual styles of fashion and style and the second half, becomes a quasi saint after the applicant takes him to the Himalayas port where Babaji (not the famous Saints who took the digging earlier) gives him a special authority because no clear (except karma). This is actually starting interesting now isn't it? Some of the movies are about losing its powers of magic and power and fighting politicians and related black magic. The most common work and the implementation of hilarious. Oh and black magic has never worked for our hero because he just emerged to have a Param Vir ... er .... Shakti Chakra with him. The wicked and ordinary political offenders are clich√©d, working more and ultimately, they are not sufficiently sufficient for a plot that does not go anywhere. But despite all the mistakes, it was fun to kill time together and call one liners of Father's relationship during public events. It is also fun to watch others insulting about this movie. AR Rehman is said to have included his movie songs via a mobile phone. That's important how he saw it. Rajni is well known in Japan and has included two characters (one of them called Keiko ... why not Samsung?) of Japanese background on this film just for it. But the way they were shown, dressed and treated is awesome. The Japanese can stop watching Rajni movies after seeing it. This film could be a promotional material for Rajni to politics but the result of the movie itself would have killed them away from its political dreams. Happy if you skip your brain though.
