I did not see a very strange mark on the IMD, but I went to see it yet, because I am a great fan of Bible-related news. The first thing that was caused me was a little bit of Indiana Jones wannabe movie, but it also looked like Casper Van Dien did not see Jones's movies through (but should). I believe he tried the best, but the only script stunk. Music tried to be kinda Jones style as well. A great job, but for such a movie seemed like a lot of work, as part of the video didn't deserve all the good music. Robert Wagner gave his many practical skills, he did a good job, but somehow the script was bringing everything down. "Jokes" is an old school, somewhere 20 years; they brought a smile just to my face. There is an angel of the worst camera, SFX looks like a homemade and non-fiction. Kevin VanHook was probably a good idea on the story (in my opinion, but I like such stories), but things didn't work at the end. Maybe he should put it on paper when it was still fresh in his head. When I (in the first minute) saw that movie would be one of the "low-budget movies", I hoped that I would "hear" a good story, but sometimes the movies are scary.
