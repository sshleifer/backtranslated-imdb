"Extreme adjustment: Home version" is another 'feel good', so-called 'warm', and out of ratings shows that ABC has time to put together. <br /> <br /> I understand the problems that these families pass. So, I pray. But do you think that placing four plasma TV screens, three computer-screen computers, a side-to-side take-up, and full-blown lids are BIT too much for ALL family? Indeed, these families have been many. Indeed, they deserve the good things that they had before. But honestly, the things that Ty Pennington and his employees enter into these homes are enough to meet the whole neighborhood. Another thing that impresses me on this show is how Ty and its employees always have something good to say about every little thing related to family, or family status. Describing a man with wheels that he is “very strong,” or “very brave” finds past time. That may seem wrong, but you do not believe; see this show, and you'll see what I'm saying. <br /> <br /> For all, this show has overrated. If you want to watch it, proceed. These comments are only the top headings for what you will look at.
