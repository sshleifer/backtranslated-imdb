The book is amazing, this film is not. There is no reason why this film could not accept the future technological vision of the book. Hell, the total memory was released a few years later and which did a good job, even an hour-hour orange clock released in 70 years did a good job of trying to make the future world. The red color of German expression, black and white footage from the vision screens, there is no reason for this way when the film was held in 1984. The main character is in the work of writing a white collar but wearing as he works with oil and oil in the garage. This film takes the approach of communicating communism to keep the design, atmosphere and atmosphere, but the novel was not required to force the communist theme, the sub-ritual itself. This book has to be similar to the modern condition if this book is more relevant today than ever before. I couldn't look over 20 minutes of this trick. The sound of the voice is sad, the lack of visibility of bitterness, this film seems to have rejected the true or honest feeling when it is particularly necessary to clear the novel message to the viewer.
