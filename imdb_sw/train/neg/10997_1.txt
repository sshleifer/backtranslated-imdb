First and foremost ... <br /> <br /> What! What is hell? Why in the world they are trying to sell a low piece of budget on the TV at the end of the night and the pledge of disruption, the bad litter of patients that any real ordinary person and spirit cannot look at. <br /> <br /> What a trick is funny on the injured dog, the grandmother takes her head on the head ... The boy gets his hand stripes with two girls going to the bathroom? In hell this world has come why people find comedy in something completely ill. Anyone who thinks this kind of material is funny, should not be allowed to walk in the world. But from what I feel is not wrong ... so ... they promise the comedy through closed piles of sick garbage ... and they don't take even away.
