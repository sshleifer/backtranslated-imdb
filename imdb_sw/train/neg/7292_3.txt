Sunshine is the European imports set in Hungary between 1880 and 1980, is an epic story of Jewish Jews, Sonnenschein family. This name means Sunshine. The family has a beginning of humility, then it succeeds, it becomes a top phone, it changes the name, and hopes to enter the Hungarian society so the next generation can develop professionalism. Stories are told through the eyes of the first son in every third generation; Ralph Fiennes has these three responsibilities. For those who lacked WW-II and Holocaust Europe, the way of life of Sonnenschein does not work very well. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <3 Sunshine is known as artistic achievements, but it is a missed opportunity. The story line, guided by world history, is predictable and transparent; this is enhanced by the sound cover and photo information. Family way 'comes from one possible event [ie. Hapsburgs, WW-I, WW-II, Fascism, Communism, etc.] for the next to proceed a little, deep or detailed. The theme of Jewish involvement is unsatisfactory, and the small theme [the concept of 'secret' and family philosophy] that can give them a family attitude and honesty is to the end. Alternatively, film designers offer the generation of the generation by using the normal theme of the intervention / sleep. <br /> <br /> Ralph Fiennes shows caution light but its performance is far from winning equipment. The kind of "3 for 1" forming is distraction viewer and feels more like gimmick movies cheaper than good performances. Sunshine is essentially Hungarian "History Channel" material. It seems to feel the Winds of the Battle Forrest Gump morphed and Something About Sex. <br /> <br />
