Here are comments for people like me. This movie takes the beginning to the end. I hit popcorn on the screen and used the MSF2000 fun. Hinges plot on event events and depend on folly from people who should be smart. The fall of the male fall and happens to him so that he can get a string ??? And he is rich ???? And he is a famous psychologist? ONA, people. He enters the bar at the most convenient hour when everyone has gathered to talk about telling him? That was done so that it felt like a face-blowing to the viewers of even half the movies. The man of the rain would be cursed. I also agree that I am disrespectful to Mamet's conversation and the kind of enthusiasm that some people choose for meat, war fighters, and prisoners of fur. My hatred is so perfect that it fails logic. But it will give you a shot. That shouldn't sound real sound is good. I don't care. It is that everyone speaks HIS. Mamet cannot create characters; all he can do is to strengthen his voice on us faster through different actors. Not surprisingly its executives are wood. They are confused about everyone being the same behavior. (However, his future films improve.)
