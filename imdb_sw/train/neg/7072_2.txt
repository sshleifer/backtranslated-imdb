My head is about the amount of this crash I should be feeling when I saw the film Fred olen Ray - but I thought 'HEY, It could be better than his baby rubbish', I was wrong! This has to be the worst films organized for children. Acting was bad, humor was not there, The trend was worse than I ever saw & Special effects were not found outside the place on the Disney movie of 1950. Who once had such a reliable job in the 80's. The old-fashioned old and former child Russ Tamblyn was a very bad boy and the budget was too low it was impossible even as a kiddie movie. I have not seen a follow-up follower in 1999 and not the intention of <br /> <br />. /> <br /> MY EDUCATION ASA 19 YO: - 2/10 <br /> <br /> RATING AS MOVIE KID: - 3/10 IN BEST!
