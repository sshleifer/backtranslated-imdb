This movie was awesome to say at least. I was hoping to be better after seeing "High School Music". The whole whole movie was quite far from "Simple Life", it was not just a real show. Work was not quite good. Amanda Michalka had her time, when she had no fear. On the other hand Alyson Michalka was bad all the way. Chris Gallinger, who loved Amanda's interests was playing a French boy, but had a bad feeling. One good thing about this film is Michael Trevino, who was very interested in Alyson's love. Any thing to remember, if this film was disclosed before "High School of Music" perhaps it didn't seem to be bad. But it was not a comparison. Overall I have 2.
