I remember Dogs in Heaven playing on TBS nearly 20 years ago, and my older sister and friends are watching and laughing the next day. It is not bad for a film made by TV, but it is a derivative (especially of the Exorcist) and a business like, for lack of a good word. It will not find you away from the movie or good practice, but not waste time, either. It is a kind of movie you expect to kill several hours when you don't have a very tough situation. However, if you are going to the movies to look at some laugh, you have won 'lust. Early events, along with Lucky Dog's dog as a good little dog and damaged children are not threatening, and the blue color of the black dog (with ivory!). And keep an eye on the devil who was rounded in the shade of Maverick toward the beginning. It is not a great horror movie and any imagination, but I would like to do things like this for TV.
