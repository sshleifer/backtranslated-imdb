So what is the great thing to do out of INDIANA JONES Wannabe when you have an actor who is thrown as a dude from a book of adventure stories who doesn't want to go out of adventure ??? Anyone who wrote the script for JAKE SPEED was probably expelled, but for whatever reason, this movie does not have much in excitement! That doesn't mean it doesn't act, but look at the dark side of the picture. This is not appropriate to match the INDONES JONES or other actions caused by small and small actions, and JAKE SPEED was promoted through the clever propaganda so that I and many others would be interested! Besides, I have never heard of the boy's story, so who needs his attention?
