After watching the "Bodyguard" last night, I felt compelled to write his review. This can be a very good movie if it was not a work of awesome camera. It was more than a disappointment. All the pieces were wrong, it was impossible to see anything, especially during the fighting process. The buttons were awesome. <br /> <br /> Hadith has Sonny Chiba building himself as a watchman for anyone willing to take him to a medicine ring. He is approached by Judy Lee, who can never be like Chiba. Lee's participation in the drug ring is more than Chiba think, as Mob and another group of packages are after it. <br /> <br /> The story was good, and with dubbing awesome, this could be a good movie. Due to the best direction and editing, I am sure this would be a common movie of Kung Foo. As is the case, it is more than a film of action of cheesy 70. and all the film. <br /> <br /> Rating: 4 out of 10
