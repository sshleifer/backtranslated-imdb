I have never read a professional review of this film. I think I should miss something. Beginning is amazing, three main characters meet at night at an empty bar and they love each other for the invented stories. That's the best part. After three go their different routes, the film is divided into three threads. That's when evil comes. Indeed, the thread and Babushkas of Felliniesque who make dolls out of chewed bread is the first eye to open curiosity. Unfortunately, the director strikes this death, even injecting a plot of wild conspiracy that does not lead anywhere. Below below: a two-hour low-hour season. If you are experiencing sleep, look at the bed and you will have a good night's sleep.
