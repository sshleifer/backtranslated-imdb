I have seen this film on the playground behind the original release. It was painful to see Peter Sellers embarrassing himself to evil. The story was very bad and difficult to follow, and the end was ridiculous. It was just a pity to see how strong they had fallen. I will not say that I am a great fan of the Sellers of Peter, but I really enjoyed a series of Pink Panther and I felt that he gave a sharp performance in being there. But this film should not be done. From what I read, he followed this film on the advice of people around him. Good, but that still does not condemn the studio actually releasing the film.
