I can't waste my time writing anything more about how each element of this film is very bad. It's done in more detail already, more often. 'The plot' began as a young-group of the cockney non-uninspiring very quickly and it fell very fast. Anyone who pretends to see the hiding place hidden in this powerful mess is pretending. It is now 7 or 8 years since I looked at the 1 week of running on the movie before it was dragged, but it easily got my mind on the most horrible film I saw. I just do this opinion, and in fact the only reason I went to see the film, is because of the amusing fact that my brother Eddie appeared in it as a second 'heavy' in the pub area. It was his hands that reduced the lighter of the flies towards Rhys Ifan on the bar in 'Russia' (in fact it was locked in the Butlins holiday camp at Barry Island). My brother has no experience of working - he had recently joined an extra organization and this was his first part. After seeing the film, it seemed that no one needed anything to work. I remember there were 8 people in the whole movie - and this was just a few days after the release. I have never heard of another film that was not recommended and disappeared very quickly - and so forth. If you were thinking about renting this film on DVD, I would like to advise you instead of placing your two pound coins to the red to the red, then jump into your eye pockets. This may be worse than watching the movie.
