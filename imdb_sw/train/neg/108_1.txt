Pros: Nothing <br /> Cons: Anything Over / Over / Overview Summary: A female journalist runs a refugee who tells her stories about the deaths of people killed by zombies. <Br /> <br /> Review: Never in my life I've got a movie as bad Zombie Chronicles. It is listed by what appears to be about 20, TZC is a terrible horror movie that depends on the disabled, executives who cannot act to save their lives and that year is even greater than awesome. How does the film work even this? Simply put, avoid TZC as a sexually transmitted disease. My last 2 cents: Humorously enough, this film was made by a film company called Brain Damage Films. They are intellectual must have been very destroyed to come up with a film like this. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1 out of 10 (If it is up to me, this film could get a negative amount of bajillion)
