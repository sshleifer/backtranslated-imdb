Looks awesome? Certainly. I have seen a few films have been good at some time. The Captain of the Sky and the Future Earth uses the most attractive movies, computer graphics, and future creative designs to create a known world history yet something new. The period of time appears to be in the 1930s or 40 years. The movie describes a recent attack on New York City and modern hosts stealing generators and as for some odd reasons. Also, the disappearance of the mystery of scientific ideas coincides. Who can stop them and save the world? In fact, it does not take that trust to know it is the Captain of the Sky himself and his girl's author of the wisecracking always hot to lead, and in its reliable, powerful wings. Does the Captain of the Sky have the circumstances and graphics are not in the story and features. This film program is ridiculous. What it said, the film goes to the serial film of old films. They had very far stories and bad acting - but none of them, and I don't even mean one of them, had a budget and great names this film had. Two districts of award winning academy and Jude Law can keep the film, one can think, but Sky Captain sinks to a bad situation. In spite of his mysterious look, I found myself eager to have the film would end and I could continue my life. I had little interest in a story that produced a small interest. I didn't even care for any glib image. Paltrow was very bad. Jolie was a stew and almost no responsibility. The law cannot bear the same tradition of the liner as well as the shoulders. I mean, let's say, he's not Will Smith, Mel Gibson, or even Wesley Snipes. The sad thing about the Sky Captain, at least for me, was that it had many promises yet to be given very little. I had to stimulate ten minutes on the film - waiting something to focus on my interests - and it never came.
