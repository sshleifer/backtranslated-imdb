The best helper of Firestarter is faced with that it looks more like a bad TV film than a bad film feature. How to despair for this from Hooper and Dourif! Government contractors make humanitarian efforts and the Hydrogeni bomb. A boy with a couple from a test always runs a fever of 100 degrees, and when he is an adult, people in his life begin to mix. He is trying to find out why. All people on fire have been done well, but when they reach the point that they have done well in another sense, they are obviously changed to dummies. When the hot jets come out of the hands of the characters, it seems to be a fool instead of the terrible as required. Also ignorance is a fire that travels through telephone lines and comes from large jets from the recipient reception. What? How should this happen, especially? Something else that struck me as silly about the movie is when the character has a vision of his late parents. Later we see real shots similar to this vision in home movies.
