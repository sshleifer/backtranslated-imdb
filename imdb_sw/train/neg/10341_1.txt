I lost this film from the library (it's hard to find for good reason) just because of curiosity. I am a great fan of Plath and this movie was a perfect desire. Bell Jar (1979) is off one of the worst movies that I've seen. The script is awesome, not because it comes from the original text, but because it fails without target or purpose. Exhibitions are not created and have no guide anywhere. What with a hokey voice on Plath's poetry? Lazaro Lady doesn't have little to Greenwood situation; Plath's poems that have been used. Marilyn Hassett is not quite possible as Esther Greenwood (or 20 years old for that reason) because of the throw (was 32 during the filming, the Plath age was when she died) and because of the fact that she could not act. Hassett is all emotions, no trick, no skill. The direction is mediocre; the director only covers what is present, which is not too much. Just because I fear film 1 is because 0 is not an option. Sorry Sylvia, you will need to wait for someone else to change your good work in something more.
