I have made it my personal commitment to follow those involved with this film. I even got a rental company to give me my money because I claimed that they had announced false advertising. It is not enough that the film itself is p.o.s., but the cover is the one that bought me. I have done the best results of renewing my kids on Halloween than what the film shows in fact against the art of covering. Can you say "the eyes of the raccoon?" I can't waste my time more by entering the full details, but it gets, the main character of the film is LA who was born and raised in Alabama - but has German reputation! It's more than insulting.
