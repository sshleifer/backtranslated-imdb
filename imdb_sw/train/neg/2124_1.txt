This film involves the story of Eddy as described in the headline and its agreement with former friends in the sea community. The program involves a group of friends because of the light that Eddy left as a way of dealing with the death of a friend who feels responsible. But this is not good, if the choices made in production are very poor and do not fully think. Screenplays do not need to be 'chatty' always, but they must at least support the development of the story. Here one line you try as much as "just moved" or "I know you do not love to heart" just to do fully delete something of value at the time of the audience. Also at any time a messenger feels losing where to go for a second-time player for a protagonist to walk through the fields for indie mood music. Say about trying hard. If you are interested in a good film, a variety that offers quality and a top quality style only then this is not a film for you.
