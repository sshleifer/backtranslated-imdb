I will start this by saying I can't find all the way through it. I took it on the rainy day from WalMart as some of the consultants on this site. I thought no way I could regret my purchase. What am I wrong or what? Now hard, who accepted this project? They need to be forced to watch this film regularly until the end of eternity. That is the only punishment I can think of giving something wrong. The shot reminds me of the movies I made for class projects on the VHS camera. Acting is no better. I think the only difference is that there are small cold frogs. Yay, who cares ... Shecky Moskowitz is unfunny, and the comedian ship is even the biggest loser. That's about as many conspiracy as I understood. It is generally the worst movie I've ever seen. I have it on the DVD and I have given many workers a look at. Every one returns and laughs and says "Wow I didn't think I would say that I am closing the Adam Sandler movie 15 minutes in ...."
