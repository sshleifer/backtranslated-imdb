This is the kind of movie you feel on your VCR. It's some of the worst sanctions of the version of Stephen kings kings movie "Misery (1990)". I can't understand how this film got a score of 5.2, because it has no story that was ever, and when the movie finally ended, I was opened. <br /> <br /> This movie should be presented as a short movie instead .. for a lot of time it is used for the same thing. And if in every bad movie, everything happens at the end of the film in 10-15 minutes ... So, before deciding to watch this film, make sure you put some films. A new battery in your remote control, because you're going to do a lot of to send it quickly ... don't worry, you can't miss anything important.
