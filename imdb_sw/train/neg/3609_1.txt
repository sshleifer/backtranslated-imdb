This should be the worst movie of fear that I have ever seen. I remember looking back years ago when it came out of the video and for some reason I thought I enjoyed it. So, as idiot, I ran to buy the DVD once it was released ... it's a bad mistake! I can't even bother going to a plot because it's so obvious that you can see that way. I am a fan of Herschell Gordon Lewis so I've had the most common effects of cheesy and bad acting but these people take this to a completely different level. It is almost as if they are trying to make the worst movie of humanity as possible ... if it is their goal, they went. If they were willing to make a film that was supposed to be afraid or make you believe in any way, shape, or form that is actually then failed ... MISERABLY! Avoid this movie ... read the synopsis of the plot and you have seen it!
