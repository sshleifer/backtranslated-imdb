As a fan of Notorious B.I.G., I expected this movie. I am unfortunate to see it a bad movie. Jamal Woodward doesn't prove or is really enough to show the Garden without. Many stories follow the true son of Notorious B.I.G., Christopher Jordan Wallace as Notorious B.I.G. as a child. Unfortunately, he can not influence enough to pay taxes to his father. Derek Luke is as much as he feels like Sean "Puffy" Combs. In short, no one is convinced enough to play their roles here. The biggest problem with this is real people who play. It was boring, and did not give any information about Notorious B.I.G. that fans and non-fans did not recognize. I was very disappointed by Angela Bassett, a very good actor who lost here as Voletta Wallace. Slugs and slugs of films when thinking of Notorious B.I.G. fans will use tons of money on it. I am unfortunate to say that happened. There is no place near the beautiful film. I expected too much, but unfortunately I didn't get anything I wanted from this. I think you should stop this one.
