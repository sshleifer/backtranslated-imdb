While this film certainly has a scope of bad film, it is wonderful to wait for several levels. First, for the old film fans, it is interesting to see the leading role played by Dean Jagger (no relationship with Mick). While Jagger continued to play a role of respect as a supporter (even to build Oscar in this field for 12 O'CLOCK HIGH), his performance is really unique because he has a real hair head (I've never seen him this way before) and because he was the worst actress in the film. This film only shows that if the actor cannot act in his original films it doesn't mean he cannot learn to be a good actor. Another fine example of this is Paul Newman, whose first movie (SILVER CHALICE) is considered to be one of the worst films of the 1950s. The second reason for filming is all shear play. Writing is bad, acting is bad and special effects are bad. For example, when Jagger and Cambodian unknown go through the water, it is obvious that they are only going to the place and history is not good behind them. Plus, once they leave the water, their dress is 100% dry !!! The development of Horrid and unhealthy intellectual dialogue increases in all the films - so it is difficult to imagine why they did not ask Bela Lugosi or George Zucco to become a star in the film - for both of them were filmed by many grade-z movies. In many ways, this would be a perfect model for the film class on how to make a film. Therefore, when 3 goals are probably more generous, it's fun to laugh and so short it is worth looking for fans of bad films.
