Be honestly cruel ... I liked to look Severed. That's why <br /> <br /> gave the 1/10 star because of its amazing unimaginative <br /> story / publishing / acting / everything. This film was RIOT to watch. If you would like to enjoy a bad movie to make it fun, you will get it! <br /> <br /> Story does not matter, it involves someone who is bald <br /> <br /> and has a sword and goes around with random people. But he has a natural loss ... no one sees him will do it. Even when, in one of the most memorable places, he enters into a nightclub with a <br /> <br /> club and left the girl's dance with <br /> <br /> no one he sees. It is revealed not only as it was done on video - it was PHOTO on someone's home photo. The film artists were <br /> <br /> lighting skills (very little skills) and the composition of it / truly! But more you can't hear <br /> <br /> artists ... you can't understand what they are doing, and you laugh at what you do when you finish your cuts from your body. <br /> <br /> Go and rent this movie. Help the film like this - it's hoot and <br /> hollar!
