I don't understand the good views made on this film. It is cheaper and worse at all levels and I can't understand how it was made. <br /> <br /> Characteristics of the bulk cartoon - Sue of the pastor, drunk, layout, Irish father is a prime example. No one of the sympathetic actors - except for a short time, for Sue's Asian partner but even she turns to be able to abuse domestic violence! Since they are unacceptable as both of them, I don't know why Rita and / or Sue would give to the patient going like Bob - but because they are doing, why should I expect to care for them? Many reviews continue to maintain on how "true" is. If it is true, it is the pain of meditation of the community but there is no reason to put it on the film. <br /> <br /> I did not like the film at all.
