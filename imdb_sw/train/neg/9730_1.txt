Now, I hire this film because Brad Dourif was in it. She is a good actor, BILILLANT in everything ... except this movie. And I think that was just because he realized how stupid this movie was, and he wasn't concerned with good performance. This movie is a volunteer comedy. Some lines just hit. And there are lines that are useless, and it looks like Tobe Hooper just throw the lines in without thinking about the plot. Oh! BTW plot is BAD! But it is one of these films that are TAHT BAD that have actually been seen. I recommend this only to BIG Brad Dourif fans, or fans of any other actors, because the plot is pathetic.
