A clear attack on Microsoft made by people who do not appear to understand the intellectual property or the market economy in general. Most of the robbins have a caricature with pain on the doors of the bill, and it is the prestigious killing of the company killed killing right and left. Although Microsoft may participate in non-default operations, it is not possible to kill people. So, the film is high and ridiculous from the beginning. The "comprehensive" word is obvious that the greatest invention of technology should be free to the public, and not under the rules of expertise. However, this denies the fact that more innovations will not be developed if not by market motivation (and awards) offered by intellectual property. <br /> <br /> It's one thing to resist anti-competitive behavior - - that's common sense. It is another thing that contradicts the market competition for the first time, which is what the mantra of the film ("human knowledge") represents. <br /> Yet another example of Hollywood does not quite accept the truth.
