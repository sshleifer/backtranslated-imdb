What to create columns that have no value for the original film? There is no point. This is the reason why the Prom Night is the most embarrassing. The first movie is about a group of children hiding the secret of darkness that ultimately kills all, one bar, in the act of revenge. What? Can someone please tell me what the dead king died from the grave to the metal crown relates to the first movie then? Prom Night 2 had holes of continuous conspiracy which the audience wondered how this happened and why should this happen? But at the end, I think you can call it one of the worst movies, you are about to cut yourself.
