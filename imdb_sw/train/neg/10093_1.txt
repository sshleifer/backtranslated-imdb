I don't believe that the blockbuster carries this movie. IT WAS BAD SO. I was completely corrupted by the art of the box. Don't miss it! It's not worth your time I promise you. I don't know if the positive views of this flick were a dragon or what. I am very disappointed. :( <br /> <br /> The information on the back of the box is not even good! The girl with voodoo has been made up of it. That good opinion was a joke that they had to be just. If anybody really loved this flick then I have lost all faith in humanity. in two places. For the fighters have never been closer to the real uniform, saying who cares about the uniforms of the cops? zombie and all his fans.
