I would like to think of myself as a good person of mind and it takes a lot (!) I don't like the film but this is undoubtedly one of the suckiest films, of which I have ever seen! <Br /> <br /> I don't know what is wrong with people who gave a good score here (imdb is often very reliable when it comes to testing) ... the only thing I can think is that people should vote at one or more times: When they have been stoned by their minds 2. They have earned hard money for 3 votes. Under the gunpoint I do not believe that I lost 1 min 45 minutes of my life for this. A pathetic excuse for the film.
