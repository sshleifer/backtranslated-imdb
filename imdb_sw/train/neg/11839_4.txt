"Meow Cat" has a few scenes that deal with intellectual dialogue, and good performances, which are few who were surprised. Eddie Izzard is more effective than I expected to be Chaplin (part of thanks to the best hair and work of makeup for talented designer); Joanna Lumley is compelling as journalist Elinor Glyn; and Kirsten Dunst triumphs as Marion Davies (though why movies do not use her real life stutter is difficult to explain). But these features do not add to all success. The screenwriter appears to have worked hard on certain events - meetings between Davies and Chaplin focuses well - but it's not difficult for a big picture. Few characters do not need to exist, nor do you have a tendency. The basic plot is full of logic (e.g., why does Thomas Ince think it is a good idea to tell Hearst something that he doesn't want to hear?), And party events are repeated and interesting. I would like to imagine the yacht journey of Hearst was more fun than the movie shows. Davies is known as a kind of common Bubbly type, which is not quite correct, and the author's thoughts of the screen about Chaplin and love are implausible. Not surprisingly, Bogdanovich, who seemed to be affiliated with thirty in the "Monthly Paper", has no equal relationship for twenty years. He emphasized using the best manufacturer of color and black color, which offers visitors to the fake watch, and has only more songs of the period (e.g., "Yes, We don't have Bani"). When Hearst emphasizes everyone "Charleston, Charleston!" it seems like executives had a ten-minute dance before the event was beaten. <br /> <br /> The life of silent film stars can make interesting movies, I'm sure, but not this time.
