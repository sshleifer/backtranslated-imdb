This is a great Flop of 2008. I don't know what the Director has his mind to create such a big disaster. The songs have been added without a scenario, the story has been sent to fill the 3 hrs gap and the most disgusting stunts of action done by administrators are like everyone has the power to run between the bullets are hot and nothing happens to them and one person is fighting with people 100. The only effective performance was the man of Anil Kapoor she at all can play the role of the villain and the act of comic pointing to Hinglish ... Akki has also done a good job .... But the movieee just forgot it.
