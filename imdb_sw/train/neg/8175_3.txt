The nature of this movie is very good and it is interesting to feel with 80 achievements and good performances. <br /> <br /> Yet ...... The characters are entirely on the drawings and valid and full of right wing clich√©s which the author script probably saw the documentary panorama on the national front. The main problem is this movie has no real story. It fills all the "arty" boxes of right but nothing happens and at the end is left wondering what the point is. <br /> <br /> Very poor
