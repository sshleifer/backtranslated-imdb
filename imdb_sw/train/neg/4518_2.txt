Small film films have lost their expectations and I like it like Fire. The movie is good rubbish. It does not match anything at the artistic level. The only thing he could receive is prohibited in India. If it is because of the low-quality film content instead of high controversy, the ban would have been counted more. Now that I have my trouble out of my system, I am more Can analyze the film: <br /> <br /> * From the beginning the film feels really unpleasant when the characters start speaking in English. The director, of course, did not make movies to the Indian audience; however, it was under its international audience to further reduce it. Watching the inside of speaking in full English is not appropriate. Then we get a lot of time in the dreams of Radha. These events do not work very much. They come as jarring and block the flow of the movie. I am still wondering how the philosophical dialogue is linked to the story. I felt that the surgery was lost. Love events felt voyeuristic and probably meant audience viewers rather than having strong information. In any case, they do not reach one of the two. The names chosen by women, Radha and Sita, are the names of the Hindu gods and are therefore chosen to shock the audience. However, since the film did not mean to the Indian audience the first place, the selection of shock-name-not meant to achieve its goals, which are wonderful. The quality of the direction is very poor and some important and delicate events have been done well. A good director can have a good emotional game out of it. The act saw the wood though Nandita Das brought life into space, others lost. I always thought that Shabana Azmi was a good actor but his talent does not appear in this film. Male guidelines were completely garbage. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of the World and want to see more of the director, don't have this. Please.
