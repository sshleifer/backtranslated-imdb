Ashley Judd, in the first role and I think her first place of stars, shows her true life of rebellion in this slow opera of moving women. Is this a car for political legitimacy and greater freedom or what? <br /> <br /> Being a powerful woman in real life, she must have the value of this script. No wonder critic left Wing Roger Ebert to love this movie; it is similar to its political farming, too. Unlike the retired here, I am glad Judd raised himself from this moral fluff to the best roles in the movies that dealt with, not preaching the agenda of voluntary freedom.
