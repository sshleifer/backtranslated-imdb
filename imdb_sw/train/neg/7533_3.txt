The film had a good reputation. Maybe also a lot to my taste. It felt like the author / director was trying very hard to make us feel the inside of all its characters. Not once, rarely ... but at all. This is the work of the television, not the movie. The train station area was well chosen and I enjoyed the performance of Sascha Horler as a pregnant woman. I felt like Justine Clarke's performance was wan. Her ears for things felt compelled, as if the director was trying to announce the theme of the film through the words of the main character. I also can't believe that the director can make Daniela Farinacci a wonderful presence. I can't understand the pop music choice was hit by the whole process. This is a sluggish device, especially where pop music comes from an unusual part of the film and / or the lyrics of the song feel hard. It said, there is a high quality on the film that promotes Australian heat and local view and nature. It does not create warm and sunny conditions. Particularly with the use of an amazing animation system that saves the film from political perfection, it enters it with passion and a hand-designed charm. I know why the debate feels that you are working more. "Who knows if there is a god? If someone is sitting up in the sky telling us what to do" or whatever line was. Perhaps one of the most embarrassing times was a friend returning home from cricket with a bunch of flowers to announce to his wife "I quit smoking." <br /> <br /> Business combat smoking? TAC of an ad with a good animation? I had to leave movies on 50 minutes - it was too much.
