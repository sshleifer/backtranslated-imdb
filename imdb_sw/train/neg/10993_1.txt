Indeed, we all like bad movies at one time or another, and we really enjoy them, however, they were not happy with guilt, it was just stuck. Another person, a vince offer, who boasts enough to pretend to be the main character when he was probably drunk / high - maybe both - and thought it was a good idea to make a film. Then he continued to show his script to the top / drunk people. In general, this film was so bad, unpredictable, and odd I couldn't find a 20-minute way to close it. It makes you work to look like Citizen Kane. Bat Bat? WTF ... Some of the boy surrounding the bat, the real nature. Almost beautiful as calling him Fat Man, and having someone fat walking around in a superhero outfit.
