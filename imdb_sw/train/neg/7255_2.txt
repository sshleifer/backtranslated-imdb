I had no feeling especially for this film that has missing music and it takes only 40 minutes. Thank God, because I was asleep. I make good use of photography to waste time to show the time of light and shadow, people, water, clouds, etc. Unfortunately, that's all. I love it for the previous, Koyaanisqatsi made the best in 1983 for 87 minutes and to prove that good can be better than before, Powaqqatsi made in 1988 driving 90 minutes.
