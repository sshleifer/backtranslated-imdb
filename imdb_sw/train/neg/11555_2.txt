The biggest film of the worst is the manufacturers and not part of the script. Summary of the basic plot - a person with a red fetus invites women such as flat only to go to a certain type of freakish coma and is found in giving them with different degrees of success. Rejected students on the screen should think that the movie was like advertising as I did and choose it out of the movie. No flowing, you are lost on which redhead he has when (he didn't have one off before ??), and when it looked like a camera man passed out and again the movies when he woke up. Not that I can blame him I've passed out 2-3 times and I had to go back and start trying to try again a little non-existent program. Warning when you see the end do not try to connect with anything that happens before - you will only find an aneurysm. It's not worth time, effort, or God to make money. The only reason to get 2 instead of 1 - a small chance that hacking occurred between the release of the film and the awesome version that I watched.
