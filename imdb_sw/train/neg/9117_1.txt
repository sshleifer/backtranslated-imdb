... or maybe it's just this bad. The program is the first rehash of cheap, which is wonderful, since it is supposed to be prequel, not good. Pretty much the whole movie looks like a cheap remake first, and scenes mimicking things that happened in the first, just a lot more ridiculous and unlikely. Where the first had very cast, this comprises the B's list and refuses. Acting is particularly bad. Half of the good lines in the film are taken directly from the first, as almost every main character, including those who were not in the first movie. I realize that this was created by a series of TV series, but that's not the reason. They didn't have to turn the photo (bad) to the film. The only thing is good, and that's an erotic procedure. However, since these are not near good as those in the first place, even this does not go beyond the mark 1. If you have a chance to see it for free, and you are a good person, it may be worth checking, if you want something that is not porn. If not, try at all costs. 1/10
