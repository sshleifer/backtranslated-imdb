Well, so, Chuck Norris somehow found a way to get this produced. I have one question - why? Who read this script and said, "The sound of the voice is original!" This movie is regurgitated crap that I can not remove my bowel toilet with. Of course it is another story, following the tradition of MIA, the US invasion, Walker, Texas Ranger, Delta Power and so on which Chuck Norris, of course, is one person who can America similar from bad people. You don't even need guns many times. It is a stupid stupid neighborhood which focuses on mind. The great surprise that the only person who will lead this film of Norris is the son of Chuck Eric. Eric Norris has worked on all of his father's films and television shows. What? Does this not have any conflict as a sign that does not have a talent to lead? After that, he guides the same people as before in the same story as beforeâ€¦ the only difference is the names of the characters. If this should make me a patriotic and happy for the United States, than our country is in a worse shape than I thought. Hope, this will be nails in the acting coffin of Chuck Norris.
