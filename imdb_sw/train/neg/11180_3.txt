The only thing about "People I know" is that it serves as a perfect example of movies that Al Pacino should avoid doing. The first major exit I was on the way that Pacino tried to mark the talent of Georgia; it was often weak and inconvenient while in other groups it seemed to be overturned. The interaction of dialogue and behavior was terrible as well as a weak plot. A supportive support did a great job by setting up an attractive film, and within an hour I still didn't see a sign of a solid plot. The general story is a real birth, and I had to lock myself on my face a few times to get up. <br /> <br /> This video will also produce you too ... avoid at all costs.
