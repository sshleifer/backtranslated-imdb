I watched this on the pipe last night. The athlete was first involved in my mind. The first events were careful. Some surprisingly some sad. Development of good behavior. I felt that the third part of the last film had decreased. If it wasn't for the first part of the film I would stand watching. I kept looking at how it was connected together. Unfortunately I see that it has never happened. I really did not like the expansion period which several behaviors speak acid (?). Was that other shoe? <br /> <br /> What! I recommend? No, I don't think. As other critics say a lot of slang is dated (60 jive) but it didn't have much distortion. It completely ended me.
