The movie begins with a promise, but it lasts a long time in the world of sepia distance and division. We have been left hanging, but without anything else it takes the shades of languid of the tombs of the grave and the male to smell. Certainly there is no string on the wall to help us climb up. It is a shame, because the concept is not worthy. <br /> <br /> We left wondering why a couple of love - a father and a child is not less - they should be very far from the real world that their own world is better when claustrophobic most of all think. This lack of presence in the real world is, is also obvious and unnecessary, compared to a child who has entered into arms. Why not circus, so we can at least appreciate some color? We are left with a sense of loss, but sadly no lights, which are happy with the film are obvious about some kind of access that is not available to all of us.
