I like 30 and 40 pictures in the film. I love Salma Hayek. I was more willing to love this picture. but. . . <br /> <br /> BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! ! ! !! ! nobody, no matter about this. The only aspect of my entertainment is the character of Colin Farrell is a secure writer with this screen, despite the tackle of the racist, the approach of the ABC Afterschool Specialist. The only person who did not have a voice if he was "doing" was Sutherland, and his minutes was a few. The stale way to the stale plot.
