Jack Black can usually make me just a snicker by breathing, but in this film ... The camera), and the average player's .050, was still a waste of time. The concept seems to be promising, but what was presently missing for the lack of comedy and some of the worst trends I have seen on this side of your tube. I continued to hear that this film has been shown to very bad Mexicans. Although that's really true, we think this movie really means being a racist. I think that's the result of the "creative" team trying to find something good in this mess. You can almost hear praying from behind the camera: "Let's see, it's bad Mexican! Laugh, people! Please, for the love of everything to be passionate, LAUGH!" <br /> <br /> But put the color charges aside. When you reach the bottom, it is anyone who has lost a good money and when looking at this pot of translated beans that should be criticized, IMO.
