I am usually a fan of eight years with an early nineties of the ninety-nine years and now it has a beer ... but this film is so awesome that it was a real test of patience to stay. Young people dressed as girls have been made to death - but they never have pathetically. Corey Haim's performance was normal as usual, Nicole Eggert was not much better. This does not contain redemption features, even if you are a fan # 1 of actor / actor in this trash - stay away!
