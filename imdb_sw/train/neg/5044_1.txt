I expected to see this film after reading a good review in The New York Times. In addition, I am also Shanghainese so there was more interest in passing on the issue. However, after looking at it, I was very disappointed. The film's speed was slow and very gentle. The director lived on certain occasions for a very long time. There was no enthusiasm or chemistry among lovers. There was a close conversation. Negotiations were required to pay compensation for lack of action. At the end of the film, you did not feel compassion for the characters. This movie had lost everything. Script was weak, acting was poor, and editing was not available. The director tried to implement some films of films but failed miserably. A good movie is one that attracts you, it holds and has successfully concluded without feeling in the past. This movie felt like it's not the end. Don't waste your money on this film.
