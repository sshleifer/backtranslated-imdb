Everyone seems to be dealing with the subject, and not realizing how the movie was made. The deaf, the cripple is good, the pastor of success - that's good, the cricket feature is good, but the movie is generally generally. I think it can be made better than it is. The plan is also expected for a film that is not based on a real life event. I am sure that movies can be made more interesting. These songs are closed out there, and I had to develop events where one thing will be displayed from different angles. <br /> <br /> Good act, though. It seems.
