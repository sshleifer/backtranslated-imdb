There is a high level of expectation when you sit to watch comedy and cast led by Cary Grant, Jayne Mansfield, Ray Walston and Werner Klemperer. These expectations have been further explored when the film is led by Stanley Donen, whose touch to a romantic voice was very clear, among others, DAMN YANKEES, BEDAZZLED and CHARADE. For the first five minutes, or so, it seems that such prospects can be found and then? Nothing. What should be a light comedy, plunges in leaden, heavy melodrama handed, and nary chuckle being. <br /> <br /> Brother guest Suzy Parker has often been criticized for his performance, or lack of one, in this film, but in a movie that even a great Cary Grant often appears flat and timber, Parker attacking seems right. Even if the bright light like Audrey Hepburn or Doris Day can change the luck of this script, the dreary and quite useless, which creates itself with drags the interest of the viewer and perseverance under it. <br /> <br /> Others cast, especially Ray Walston, continue to try to breathe life in case, but the bad script is more than renewed. The amazing, half-half-heart effort from the number of listeners in the last time of the film is only used to add to the injury. This video is not just something that is great at all levels.
