The major effects of CGI and Oscar's effectiveness for Gary Sinise as Lt Dan. <br /> <br /> Tom Hanks is one pony of trick in this movie, how he got the best Oscar the same year on Morgan Freeman was a crime. This film is an interesting love letter for the baby's generation, and a shortage of the right left wing, from the Forrest service in Vietnam until the "resolution" by Jenny at the end. That, though, is a great entertainment and movie of America through and through. I have seen some parts of this film very much, Zemeckis forbids down this movie next to the level of Gump himself. . That is why he tried to do. Look at this film and ask "What is Robert Zemeckis saying about what makes America good?" It seems that it has made a "right" choice and has been in "good place" for the past 45 years. Those who are wrong according to the vision of the director seem to pay a great price. So is Zemeckis saying that idiocy hides as guilt and ignorance is patriotic, even AMERICAN quality?
