There have been very few films that I couldn't sit. I did through the World Warfield without a problem. But this, this is one of the worst films of EVER to be made. I understand Whoopi Goldberg tried to get acting in it. I did not blame him. I would feel embarrassed to have this to start again. I belive is a common event when almost every gag in the film falls flat on his face. Well happens here. Not to mention the SFX, check out the dino and the cables are closed out of its end !!!!!! Half the film I was still looking at the plot. I never had one. Cover the problem of this rental and save 90 minutes of your life.
