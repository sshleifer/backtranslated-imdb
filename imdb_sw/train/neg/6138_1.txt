This movie was bad-God, since the pregnancy until it was implemented. The United States needs to establish a website of "Star Wars" in this remote country? Is this their foundation? The way to find, the United States concludes, is to win the course of the obstacle as the race of the country, where the winner can ask anything of the leader. And who is better to win this race known as "Game" than a trainer? Without doubt! Gymnast will be the perfect choice for this mission. And do not forget that his father was the operation. Lucky for our hero, there is to be a sports equipment practice in lucky areas, like a stone stone stone in the middle of the square (for no reason) in the center of a flawed city. Ideal. <br /> <br /> But above and beyond Judgment, HORIBBLE Cluster, is an awkward fumblings of romantic, very ninjas whose work seems just to have a flag to show the way of running, and the worst peak. After winning the race, our hero offers the requirements of the US government. And behold, behold, all efforts were worth, because the United States gets the website of "Star Wars"! Huzza! IS YOUR TRAINING? Wow. <br /> <br /> Instead, be a bad movie like that, it might be nice to enjoy. The only cover, which shows the ninjas and machine guns, was enough to give me this film. <br /> <br /> But if I would like to meet Kurt Thomas (star of practice) in real life, I would like to catch him with a face after twice a deficiency and twist 2 1/2 in the layout position.
