This film is a mish-mesh-mash of clich√©s from a recent movie. There are other promising ideas there, but when the director was aimed at promoting an uncomfortable film, what he went through was a mixed mess. Leader Daniel Wu is doing a good job but without the main theme it seems to have no work. Additionally, the movie is not very popular (though, precisely, there is a certain time of interest in the middle of the hard). We are a wonderful death of a distant role, diabolical readers, spiritual interests, a combination of identity, death of savage monkeys, conflicts oedipal, father fathers, homosexual homosexuals, and a group of crime. The actual realities of these things seem to be that it makes the main character to express an incomprehensible feeling of confusion and absence. Perhaps the most desperate thing for this film is that despite the death of the brothers and monkeys with power over the DVD cover, the act itself is not shown directly. Instead, director Julian Lee uses what appears to be photographs of monkeys - they are not very afraid. <br /> <br /> * ENERGY ENERGY * <br /> <br /> Avoid this. For the best psychology, the awesome scary story, see the Korean A Tale of Sisters Two (2003).
