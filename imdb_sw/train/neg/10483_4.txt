I saw this film on the aircraft of the West American. It was so bad that it made the birds look again. The plan was unlikely (who did not like a movie about a woman who accidentally kills everyone who meets Elvis who meets her) but has grown up a million times differently by writing the poorest. To the end it is a disgraceful situation where the Elvis people who pretend to be on the roof of the casino that suspends the sky will come back, then the star group joins together to form the "Elvis" group, which is looking for a quick electrical bolt for the audience, taking them to The way to the roof. Bad ... TO THE GOOD. Which is the theme of the entire movie. I would like to avoid this at all costs.
