It is very sad that Lucian Pintilie does not stop leaving movies. They are getting worse every time. Niki and Flo (2003) are a disease of injury on the camera. It is unfortunate that from most movies in Romania every year, the worst is sent abroad (eg Chicago International Film Festival). This movie without plot, acting or script is wasting time and money. 0.02 out of 10.
