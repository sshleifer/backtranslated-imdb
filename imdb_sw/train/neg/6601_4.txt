I can see why Laurel and Hardy purists can be offended by this gently 're-implement', but this film will be the best way to introduce children with the classic pleasure of L&H Bronson Pinchot and Gailard Sartain to devote themselves as much as The duo of comedy and there is good support for use. I enjoyed it.
