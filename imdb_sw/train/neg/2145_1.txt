I have a question for those who thought about this idea. Why? What made them think to make the second film of this. As a servant's memory, Cinderella did not end with "All lived happily after all"? I am sure I did, or it was explained. Waiting a minute, if all lived happily at all times, how can it be good? Unless they are trying to make the most interesting story in history, it could not be good. I mean, they could have Cinderella singing about two hours, but why? The film that ends with "happy forever after" cannot be good; if it does then does not live happily ever after! Something should be wrong that causes problems and end-end! Why? That's not right, it's bad. That's my last word on that.
