It is a little relief to make New Movie presentations. I am ashamed to call New Zealander when this movie is present and currently plays on New Zealand's satellite TV (August 2006). The source is composed of a large number of local soap stars. Shipping, in real life, is one of the domestic-ferry fences that have daily travel between the two main islands and even the company's logo (dolphin) still on the set including on the funnel of the ship. Ships should be a ship / cruise ship between the United States and Mexico. It has obvious signs of rust and old age yet they should be a luxury ship on a young trip. One of the events shows the peak of the snow-covered New Zealand island of the back island for God! It should be a very cool time in the USA / Mexico area! The story is weak, acting is weak and New Zealand / America's voices are not working. I expect a New Zealand tax wage contributed to the production cost of this film and that was to lose more money using real production. I know of high school children in New Zealand who can make the best movies and their mobile phones. Goof: There is a truck holding and writing on it and holding the Taco Company's sign at the truck door, perhaps making it look like it was America. But another sign is on the label - you'll think they would see that in the props department before closing it. I would like to keep going but it is not worth any trouble.
