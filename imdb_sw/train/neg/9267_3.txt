After having the "Conflict Conflict", this series is hit under the rock and enters by four. At least the third film attempted (to fail) to continue the story of Damien, while this is only emphasizing only copies of ideas from the "Omen" (animals that fear the Antichrist, one death is the same as the death of the photographer in the first film). But what seemed exciting and creative seems to be dumb here. And the little girl looks just like a destroyed child.
