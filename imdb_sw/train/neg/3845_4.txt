Although Bette Davis worked on WONDERFUL as Mildred, I felt that the film was not the best I saw. At the end of the film I left I felt like something was lost. Bette Davis did a full job, though, and made me love and sympathy all the time. Leslie Howard did very well as lovelorn Philip Carey, and I was very sympathetic to the movies for having love with dame as well. It is a sad thing if a person finds himself in love with bad seeds. And especially if it's a person like Philp Carey, who is the person who has a sense, though he likes it. At the end, the acting is the one that came and not the plot. The last part was very good, but I'm not giving it. Although some may get this beautiful film, I was one who found it. I should recommend this movie to those who love bad seeds so they can see what can happen to them if they find themselves in love with this terrible person.
