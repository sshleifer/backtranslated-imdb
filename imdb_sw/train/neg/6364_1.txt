Absolute waste, the worst incidents of fighting than the 20-year-old of van damme or the US ninja etc.. In fact it works, not the knowledge in front of its entire movie as a cast of wooden statues. <Br /> <br /> Just looking at how this film is so bad, it may have been accepted in the 80s but this is a 2006 movie, I don't have great love for this movie if it was not born in 80s. If you like real fighting movies then look at the real tony in the bak and the guard, these are military military films. <br /> <br /> look and see today you can see unintenional humor in how bad.
