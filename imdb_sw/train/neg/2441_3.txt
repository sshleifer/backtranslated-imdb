I thought "Care Intensive" was very serious and unusual. But at least not as bad as I thought it might be. Sometimes it's a celebration, but never a good shocker. <br /> <br /> SPOILER EXPLORER <br /> <br /> Good lack of despair. But all the time of the classic time is: Peter (Koen Wauters) is beaten and beaten by the killer. Sorry right at the corner of the hallway. Amy (Nada van Nie) kneels next to him and asks "Poor Peter, will I get you fake?" <br /> <br /> This movie was shot in Dutch and English. For spare parts, all license plates are the US, and the history in the news studio is the rock of Manhattan. Very good if you are a Dutch and look at the original version in Dutch.
