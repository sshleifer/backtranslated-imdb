If there was a ZERO level, I would give this film. Today was the second time I tried to look at it and still couldn't do it from beginning to end. I can not believe many stars offered by others and can only assume they do actors or are an advertiser for hiding! Acting is angry around around, the script is blah, the child playing Nichole shows feelings even when he is threatened. The words "south" from the actress act of Amber's mother are laughable - I'm from Georgia and have friends from Texas - you believe NOBODY talks like that! None of his feelings seemed real in any area. This lesson is very great and deserves better treatment.
