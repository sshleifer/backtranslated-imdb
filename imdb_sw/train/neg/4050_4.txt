That is an odd movie that aims to show young people freely in the UK destruction school. Oh yes like an army, you learn to obey and do what you are asked. It's a little dream of something else but it breaks their dreams and causes their hopes on the threshold of life. Great. Basically you can wait for good intentions in If ... Good intentions should not be the challenges of the movie: the result is a lovely movie. Do you see how I say? Although the oldie has helped Kubrick to give McDowell in the Orange Clockwork, the movie has a real satire of social and no feel comfortable.
