Recorded last night. Opening (2001) fled the AAAAAAAA for a very long time. The spot area does not serve the purpose. Other attractions were too late. I knew before, Chevy Chase was about less than 2 minutes. No trouble. Here is the best place: <br /> <br /> KOKO, URANUS, BABS COMMERCIAL, Curtis Mayfield song Everything else was unfunny or stupid as hell. <br /> <br /> I would like to give you advice: If you want TV and films films, don't lose "Kentucky Fried Movie". If you want TV and low films of non-dirty films, lease "WORKERS IN MOON" or "UHF" <br /> <br /> Otherwise, don't bother to rent this movie. You will save $ 2-3. <br /> IMHO: The best movie of Ken Shapiro is STILL "Modern Problems"
