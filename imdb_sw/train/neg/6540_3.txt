I can't believe that many compare this film to Argento. His work is more than a thoughtful and frightening - and more fun. <br /> <br /> The director is not able to create real tension. Scenes killings - and let's face, that's what this all about - not interesting. It was not hard to think who was a killer, and I didn't care when it was revealed. The movie is not memorable, and the Gothic's 19th-centered status has not been popular. Most of the actors are the best (especially the leader of the leader and the brave girl who puts herself on young students), but we have been given very little to do. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are infectious tips, sadomasochism, and lesbianism, but surprisingly, it adds a little spice or insists. If you are looking for a good movie of fear, look elsewhere.
