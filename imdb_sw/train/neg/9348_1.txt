I have seen this film shy look. I felt like it was to hit the headline under my throat if I was not able to take the tricks that I needed a voice for calling them all for me every time. <br /> <br /> Having a father who is still alcohol, I don't really feel it was a film on alcoholism as well. Drinks, real drunk people are very alone people, in my opinion of course. They find it difficult to talk, something that the main character had no problem with the truth, but he had trouble saying I love you one time - which was a little effort in establishing his cool behavior. He was surrounded by people too! I felt that I think that of course we were only alone with a tendency to get the truth of his own loneliness and trouble. I could not connect with the character and I don't feel any relationship based on my father. I did not feel anything when you finished, only forgiveness was gone. Kevin McKidd is a good actor but not a tough leader to guide the feature! The orange clock was like a trick like a brick. McKidd was too old for a young man, they should have three different characters or avoid youth action and concentrate on McKidd's adult. With a good note, I felt a little boyfriend was very good at the beginning of the film!
