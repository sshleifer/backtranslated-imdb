Film without conscience. Drifter agrees to kill the man for the money. Then they cross twice. At the same time he loves the wife of the dead man, and, without knowing he is a murderer, goes with him. Then he "accidentally" kills him when he sees. Then, in the TALL WALKING kind of courage, he takes revenge on the groups that have doubled. The first problem is that, by accepting the assassination of the lease, the drifter loses all feelings of compassion, merit, and courage. We cannot accept any good in it and all its results have no moral center. We can't take care of that kind of guy. And the wife (well played by Kari Wuhrer who is stirring - a seven-year-old woman), a high-class woman who runs a message to homeless people, also loses a sense of mercy by jumping by bed and drifter (despite her seemingly weak after the death of her husband). And, when he knows he's a guy ?? what does he do? He binds him in his house (as if all the houses were locked they cannot open from INSIDE) with him and continue to despise him. Stoo-pid. George Wendt, however, is severe in the role as a beefy pig. Director Stuart Gordon did very well with RE-ANIMATOR and DAGON.
