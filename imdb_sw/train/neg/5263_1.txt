This is the hands under the worst movie I can remember to watch. Everything was small and delayed. Acting was awesome too. The camera function was not bad but could not redeem it. The author / director of this film should have a low risk if he believes that this film will help his work. I want an hour and a half of my life that I have lost watching this trick. I would like to watch the video of the leaves growing than this. I don't believe the IMD is making me write 10 verses to write this but I feel that this film is so bad that I must keep warning others about it. The reason I came to this film is that my girlfriend asked from a local library to think that it was a movie Kris Kristoferson which was finally entitled "Disappeances". I don't know what fault was in this garbage that ended on my DVD player but I feel someone gives me at least $ 20 for my time, pain and suffering. In conclusion, the director / author of this film is the best hope I ever recognize on the street.
