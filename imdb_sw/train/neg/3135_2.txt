What a piece of junk this movie was. The cluster was the same, but even at the beginning of the effects of crappy mixing in a giant with ordinary people size (even the effects in Hercules was the best) I knew this would be bad. But the worst part of the movie is chat. Not at all, not stupid. I felt like written by the 9th grader in the creative class and getting D-. I want to beat Casper van Diem and other actors by following this film through. <br /> <br /> I have had my share of cheesy and bad movies (I would like a series of earthquakes), but this ... I just don't like it. It's silly and the bad conversation of flabbergastingly will make you enter.
