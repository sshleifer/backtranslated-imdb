Who really created this piece is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life is wasting time and money. I hate how it creates low budget sequels that are collaborating with D-Lister administrators and stories of the same story. <br /> <br /> I have found this film on bargain bin sitting next to Wild Things 2 and Death To The Supermodels for $ 2.99 what is a fool I really thought that this could be good rather than I look in shy like poor practices implement the ripped storyline with script from 1 first. Everybody thinks that this automatic video-video actually was even a half-decent film should be on a crackd or something because I think what pretty much more people who have seen this film thinks What LOAD OF CRAP !!!
