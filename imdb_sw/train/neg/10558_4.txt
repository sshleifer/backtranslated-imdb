I don't know why this has a fan and I don't know why I have given the score I have. This is proud. There are many scenarios where one can stop unbelief, then photographs and find it somewhere before being happy with a police officer is required to explain what we have seen. But, this has very little for him and has an overlong system where nothing happens and they have no importance for anything when we should listen to more repetitive sounds, even with Italian standards. Not a giallo, this is a perfect mish full of horrible ideas with Klaus Kinski in one of his 'phone calls' more. I see she turned out, did the work of the day and stopped leaving for Mr D'Amato to enable others to fill. Ewa is really good but there is not enough, and finally we have seen so much of his presence to the whole place, after a long time we lost interest in this useless and defensive lion. Maybe I wasn't just in good condition!
