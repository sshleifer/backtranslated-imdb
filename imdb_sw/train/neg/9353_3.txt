I was hit by the head ... I expected a wise and surprising journey in alcoholism, instead of I had a fascinating and surprising history on Scotdy rowdy. Leadership behavior is not widely available deep in physiological, unless you like to classify a teen's poem as chelogia. It was embarrassing, because the story of the story could be good, and the best efforts to show the feelings of a person who had to live with alcohol and abuse from his youth. Unfortunately, the general idea seems to be more like "I am so because I am so". And an unprecedented attempt to give some kind of rhythm to a small class makes things worse. To get involved with a little more used of the "po√®te maudit" of the quick fix, the cheap way to make an improper film seems to be intellectual, artistic and meaningful. But "16 years of alcohol" is not very smart, very much or meaning ... the leading behavior does not change completely, and a sufficient attempt to change is failing without a good explanation. Just as an initial attempt happened instead of blue. The movie is very interested in artists such as Clockwork Orange and Trainspotting, but ultimately fails to restore their greatness, even for a few seconds. Jobson put a lot of emphasis on the artistic side of the story, and stopped relaxing, giving us a film that is interesting to the eye but not stupid to the brain.
