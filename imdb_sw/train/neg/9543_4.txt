Let's talk about it - if you have hired the STDVD line of the forgotten 80, and you expect to be better than described earlier, then you're idiot. Wargames: The Code of the Dead joins the long list of unwanted sequels that the DVD market has easily filled. This movie doesn't need heroes, because you already know them. <br /> <br /> "The plot" of this "film" is as follows: Nerd meets the girl; girl likes nerd; nerd loves girl; The nerd is facing an accident and a secret computer of the Secretary Government; nerd and girl go to another country; The nerd and the girl end up suffering from government suits in other countries; The nerd and the girl meet an old man who dies for an important step in the "film"; The nerd and the girl are taken; The Government's top secret computer gets things; the nerd has been employed to hijack the private secret computer; nerd beats On the computer secretly using the same hidden secret computers from the first "Movie" Wargames; nerd saves the day; The nerd finds a set. <br /> <br /> Last. <br /> <br /> Acting, script, effects, logo, and movies are what you could expect - B-grade. Other known faces are here, and unless you are a fan of mega Colm Feore, then you should avoid this. In fact, the film will not make them enough to eat your own fingers by seeing it, so if you like the cheap STDVD seconds, then you're home. <br /> <br /> Sadly, Mathew Broderick is also involved in the second "tropic", that he can not even make the second five coming in this one. But can you blame him?
