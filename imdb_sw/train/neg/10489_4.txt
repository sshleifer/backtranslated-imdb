I don't know the author Phillipa Pearce or his novels and if TOM`S MIDNIGHT GARDEN is an example of his work I would probably have little interest in his books as a child. When I was a child I didn't intend to open unless the soldiers are fighting with the perfect men and the counting of the body of the body of the TOM`S MIDNIGHT GARDEN. The middle since much of the story of spinning protagonist Tom Long moving home without a garden then suddenly find one of the metaphysical. Since your own garden was undoubtedly something that the working class did not have in the 1950s, I think there is some political class that has emerged somewhere else. There is also a romance involving a little girl named Hattie but it is also stupid children involved with love stories? Probably a rough quarrel is that very little in the way of excitement or adventure occurs within the story <br /> This is a children's film that seems to be dated and its source. It doesn't matter but I am surprised at its high level of IMDB voters. I wonder how many could give them many high marks if they were 10 years old who just saw the trilogy of the Lord?
