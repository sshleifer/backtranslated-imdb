Be a great fan of Corman's horror movies I expected from the west to a little more than I had. Yes, I was well welcomed. I was laughing almost like watching Saddles of Mel Brooks 'Blazing'. Look at the tracks of the mobile tracks on the old western scene. You can kill the time by counting if it is possible to have a more serious condition. And horses seem to have jars in them too, are considered to be immigrants. See also the bedroom room's swinging room of the traditional wild party to make a number of recipes from the 1920s, here decades before the fashion was found. Hope the saloon around them will not be crumple. <br /> <br /> In the midst of all of these displays the main actors do a good job. Ireland, Garland and Hayes are quite well. A special glory for them to do the best they can with the material that appears to have been raised from 'Johnny Guitar', but it is not quite the same way. But there is nothing wrong with the west right like this. If only a bad old movie of fear, it can fail one way but it succeeds in any happiness. That is one of the reasons for Corman's work for me and that's why I'm trying to recommend you to experience this film if you have the opportunity.
