1 watched 2/16/2002 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Arne Glimcher): Secret? / Thriller with a great deal of ignorance. Despite these talented talent, this film is also possible and surely under the estimates are the audience. Public-going public will not hide and I hope you will not keep filling some bags of stars in spite of what they are dealing with. We think that this film will be on something with Connery's guilt against capitol penalty at the beginning but it turns into something but standard, contrived for viewers, run of the mill, let's never get to, thriller. We are provided in every silly change in character, as they are shown to us when needed in the story, and we're ready for this to be further before the end. There is a good acting here, especially from Blair Underwood, Fishburne, and Ed Harris in the role of psychology but the story does not work from the beginning to the very long term.
