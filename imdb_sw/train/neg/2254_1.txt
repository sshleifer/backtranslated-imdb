Okay, people, honestly ... this gotta be one of the worst movies on the biz show that ever made, but I've been laughing myself silly (which could be why I enjoyed). Basically, it's all about sex, sex and the way to get 15 minutes of personalized popularity. Have I said that sex was a big issue in this movie? If you have something to go to bizzzzare and easy entertainment, watch this movie when you have the opportunity (and nothing good to do). <br /> <br /> *** Wise traders !!! *** The funniest thing on the movie is someone who asked Jerry if he could marry his goat (!) On the show and flashing his wallet and his love picture. A three times for bad taste and fun!
