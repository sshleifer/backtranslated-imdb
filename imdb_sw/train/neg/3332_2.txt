I bought this film on the boot car, so I did not expect to be a horrible film on the same level as the Night Way at Elm Street (1984) or The Hills Have Eyes (1977) but I thought it would still be fun to enjoy. However, it was not quite enjoyable, but instead of working with the general film it was surprising, such as the 'killed' method killed its victims and how all killed people just happen to be young blonde women. It was a terrible horror film. I say this because of the following reasons: <br /> <br /> 1) The most dangerous blonde women, many are killed. 2) A person lives by walking around in the dark while being expelled by the killer. 3) Surprise surprise, help comes to the form of shot! By using three simple points, I have saved you for two non-standard hours by shortening this unfavorable release of the terrible movie, so now you are lucky enough not to look at it.
