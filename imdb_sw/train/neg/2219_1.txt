Perhaps one of the most well-known commonly known horror, Halloween includes memorable Michael Myers and some good work with Jamie Lee Curtis. However, the reason for its renewal is very close to zero, as there is an undisclosed amount of time spent on shortages / events. This is a kind of movie you can walk to the microwave popcorn and don't forget anything. <br /> <br /> How it has produced many sequels, I never understand. <br /> <br /> Thank God Rob Zombie is this remaking. And in general, I hate remakes. It will surely be more compensation for all random-filling gaps and some quirky points of interest that nature did not exist. This is the movie we feel we should love, as we are taught that we should be happy with Dickens. Do not take this as normal.
