I am surprised by some of the views of this film. The only part that seems to tell you the truth is RottenTomatoes.com. This film is bad. The plan is too lazy. Not afraid either. People out there who think that because Sarah's Sarah Michelle Geller is somehow like The Grudge should forget about it. This film is like Dark Water, but it is more predictable and slow moving than that. I was shocked by this film. It was not afraid I did not mind me either. Let's talk about it, this kind of plot has been attacked to this point. The dead are trying to communicate with the living - Dragonfly, What Under, Word of the Spirit, Dirty Water, Darkness, etc.. It seems to me that only those who wrote the original movies of fear are Japanese and Koreans. Movies coming from Hollywood, like this, are a romantic practice in making money without shred of respect for the viewer. They are just being churned out
