There's a lot of love here. The actors are the first level and the script provides a good conversation to get a picture of a linked family, interesting. However, because the film is not really good. We see Leo, who just seems to learn about his HIV disease, is essentially touched in a way that cannot focus on the support of which he finds himself. Also, the film ends up suddenly avoiding what Leo, his brother and others of this close family should be addressed with the light of their love for him. The little player who has a brother of Leo, Marcel, is very interested in the cast. Unfortunately, the authors could not decide whether they wanted to translate wisely on the impact of HIV on a working, interesting family or what the impact of HIV was affected - so it just shows for both. While this film provides a mindset that leaves a more demanding viewer than it suggests.
