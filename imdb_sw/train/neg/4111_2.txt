Consider the version of the Chinese religious budget led by a film student who is involved with John Woo and you will find 'Power Play.' The idea was good, but the implementation, acting, and dialogue killed the whole, without mentioning a large amount of violence and disasters that were used to compensate for the lack of substance and the development of interesting parts of the movie. > This is the story of a journalist examining the disappearance of three members of the guerrilla activist group who secretly disappeared after breaking into the power plant offices that are accused of causing an earthquake. The author of the cavalier, who fights with what should be a group of more competitors, is chased away from the city (with anyone speaking to him) to "clean up" any evidence that can stay with the plant error. <br>> <br /> Unfortunately, there is no real sense of emergency because the characters interact with many hesitancy, as well as idiotic conversations and a lot of acting statements. Needless to say, the viewer, who can only attract a film for a referral form of action, has to endure the counting of the body and a large amount of shades of violent shooting as well as the earthquake events. All directions were placed in the wrong place for apologizing for lack of direction and the most interesting sequence of events that should spread the story. It may be better for the artists to concentrate on the most exciting, and pay more attention to developing corrupt elements of this story. Critical criminals, journalists and fools, and those who try to inform the author of the mistake. It is a formulaic, but at least it would entertain.
