The first step in focusing on "Forever Mozart" is a lack of summary of the plot in IMDb. The details are simple since there are no stories, screens, conspiracy or anything that can remember the bottom of the film. Jean-Luc Godard is one of the most trustworthy and cautious directors of the film industry and this useless trick is among its many tent films. I believe that even she has understood what this story is about; but there are scholars who come out to justify or describe this evil film, and it's funny to read their views. My war is one. Headline (Brazil): "Para Semper Mozart" ("Mozart Milele")
