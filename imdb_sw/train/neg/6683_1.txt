I am happy the people of the IMDb could identify what kind of this video is coming in. I had no doubt that it was trying to be a comedy, but since it also seems to be wanting to be dark and safe melodrama I am not sure. For comedy it is incredible to fail even a small project within humorous areas - until up to "deviation" to the abolition of the abolition, which proves losing quite a while when the whole movie actually. It is difficult to describe how the work is true. Does anyone involved in this film have any idea why they should do it? It is really important to watch so that you can drop on the screen in the absence of jawed-jawed in a terrible way.
