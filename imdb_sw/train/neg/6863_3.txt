oh my god, I give this film three stars out of ten for the following reasons. The last sequence is once again effectively dealt with was completely hilarious. That's what it gets three points. moreover, it was angry. he did not mean that this interesting thing, that is obvious, but dubbing, acting voice called, the conversation they said, where they often love. actions, and / or not done also lead to multiple hilarity and / or throw objects on screen. as the whole city dies by one group of people standing on balcone looking as they look at the glasses of cooking, or the "attempt" runs out of the church that is emerging. <br /> <br>> bad mayor: I think something going out so you should go to the apartment and check out the window. <br /> <br /> hero: ok. <br /> <br /> The evil mayor: now it's my chance to make some idiot go out and flail around the fire to be completely useless and get hacked up <br /> <br /> insert a chain which this happens <br / > evil and I'll sing it! to insert a sequence that this happens. <br /> <br /> The hero (apartment): tries to escape again, the fool, and has left the door open, he is stupid, this is a good view. <br /> <br /> woman: where is my daughter? <br /> <br /> The hero (below bottom now): I don't know, I can't see him and he was not out because I couldn't see him despite being out there for me the whole neighborhood view and he's standing out, where on earth could he be? It doesn't say, anyone would be throwing things on the screen after 10 minutes of this. therefore, look at the first film with a few friends, with a few drinks, and make sure when you look at this, you are a drunkard and you can just look at all the folly. and there was no year of honor, that shame.
