Explain it. I arrived on the 16/27 second minute, and I gave out. I would have given a review of a bad number if that was possible (although 'pissible' is the most appropriate word). Unlike sizzle you can see and feel emotionally between MacMurray and Stanwyck in nature, the chemistry between Dicky Crenna dumb and its face-what here is just does not exist. Pig becomes a chunky bracelet not attractive. What? No smoking-lights-to-finger? And I thought I'd be a SICK when they were watching (and indeed, I believe) Lee J. Cobb as Keyes practically hitting / upchucking his way through the definition of "Little Man" to Mr. Garloupis. There is no mistake for the blind, but it seems like the possibility of blind people fled amuck with the layout of the houses of Dietrichson and Neff. Similarly goes to the pants of evil that Phyllis wearing. And crikey, how much of $$ does Neff does, that lives on a huge marine? This, people, again, all happens in the first minute and the first half. If you can get more than that, you have a much more powerful constitution than I am, or you are an opticalist. But please, get Alka-Seltzer first, or you will develop your own "little" person who can never go. Continue carefully, clear.
