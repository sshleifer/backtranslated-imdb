Although it is early to say how series will change, I can say that the trials were less than I thought it would be. There is still the ability to series, however. Of course when I first saw Voyager I thought it was able, too - but it was very disappointing. My intestine tells me the Company will not be as bad as Voyager, however. <br /> <br /> For a test view ... <br /> <br /> The test had good ideas and good themes. I liked the introduction. Opening display documents were attracted, and the search and search for the right theme. Scott Bakula is the best in the role of the captain. <br /> <br /> Where it was reduced to me so much that the story did not "feel" to put on a great adventure. The part of the program itself was more than a "generic" story of Trek and the theme of "screening" and "first step toward space" only small and small. You were editing this memory for the first comprehensive message, the plot would be difficult to distinguish between the Enterprise eras, TOS or TNG. The main secret did not show or do justice to the main theme of the series. <br /> <br /> The program to launch the first message would be large enough without "action". Instead of a unique search for referrals, they could have been a story. Find out more about definitions and filosophones about it (oh, for a TV festival that once again would make us a THINK). Let us feel the excitement of the "wind" and be on the "sea" rather than bothering us with the rescue and plethora of gunplay. There were many guns. <br /> <br /> We had more feeling that people were "freshmen" in a solid school. New children in the barrier, contrary to entering an unknown world. Sadly, Klingon came to our door rather than we got. The meeting would be more historic and more social. How do two different communities interact? Just don't worry about it, Show it! I had to think more like 'Trek and Akward's employees with small technology' as opposed to 'the first steps of confidence in an unknown'. I wanted to see something new and not exceed. The series promises to have a new concept but so far I have not seen this new, beautiful concept. <br /> <br /> I will conclude and repeat the feeling that the series has potential. There are some interesting characters. Bakula is amazing. Blalock has potential. The overall theme is more interesting since we have seen Kirk in the world before Apollo 11. If only future events can do justice to this great and wonderful theme, we will have a show that will create new stories. <br /> <br /> You hit the arrow inside the air ... Good luck of Capt. Archer. <br /> <br /> For producers: FIND OUTSIDE AND OTHER US * FUNGIA *! : -) \ t
