Well, how can you measure a movie like this? What? Even has the value of movies especially? It's a movie that tries to get closer to being a hot movie as possible. Basically the whole movie is a group of boys misleading a little girl. It is not very appealing and on this too is not true. It is clear that the movie tried to be as real and amazing as possible. However the movie is just too fake for that to work as planned. Blowing and throwing are looking for gentle and fake, as well as shouting. They often beat only on the floor, rather than being a girl, in the open. Also how the girl responds to all the suffering is tame good. I mean if this was true, he would surely cry. There's more moaning than shouting in this one though. The movie is definitely a low budget and it is an attempt to try to try to achieve something amazing and realistic and original and stimulating, and very small resources. Do not think that this film made a lot of effect though it was then released, although it must do something well, since the total of six sequels was released after this. <br /> <br /> Fans of the shock and the year will be likely to be disappointed with this film, although there are still people of fetus out there who will get a kick of this movie. <br /> <br /> 4/10
