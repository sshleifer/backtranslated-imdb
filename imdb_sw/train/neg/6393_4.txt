I will admit that I have not given this movie a great opportunity. I decided very early that this was not just my kind of movie. <br /> <br /> For the most part, it has a better look at movies. The Manhattan's 70th events appear to be very beautiful, like a leading actress. It is crisp black and white, which can almost make the movie feel unated and clean. However, some of the other filmmakers represent the bullet that expects all the hell. The mixed order is of the late 60s, somewhere between the surgery and the new wave. The story also feels like it came out at a very special time, somewhere between free freedom and experimental. The next movie a little girl around the city looking at someone who had an unknown sex phone with. When he meets other unusual characters, he reveals his heads and reveals them. The movie seems to mean as far-of-the-wall, irreverent comedy, but adds avant-garde feel. I would like to expect that if you like the movie Andy Warhol, you will be very happy to discover the Book Number. Other challenges I have: Near the end of the film, one character describes the run anecdote that lasts more than twelve minutes? - cruel to stay. Also, there is a series of explicit animations that I have found in general and young people who serve as the top of the film. I laughed four or five times, and I loved the last (do not remove the animation ignore). And when the film sparked for the last phone-night sequence, I really liked how it looked better. It was one of those experiences where I felt like I could love it if it was a little different. But these were the films. Obviously, very much, and the left way to dial, but none of these are the reasons for suggesting it alone. I did not find it unique or very creative as compulsory and engaging.
