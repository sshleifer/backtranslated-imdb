Expect a mixture of scifi and films about Ada Lovelace, Charles Babbage, computer history, etc., I was disappointed with this movie of nonsensical pseudoscience and a mix of real and wonderful history. It gives the impression that its author (Lynn Hershman-Leeson) has no real understanding of Math, technology, or history that makes the subject of film, but works instead of the artistic art of the art. This has a profound effect on me, if I have been angry with the art of art to spread and misuse the words and ideas of science to the time of confusion, for example: Emmy Coer: "The news of the news contains half of life", Fee: "I don't really know that half life is better than any life ". <br /> <br /> This movie makes it worse than failure - it makes bad news. The only value of the redemption I can make is that it can impress the reader to learn about the matter that is so misleading. It is more likely, I think, to develop a sense of superstition of science and technology of any development as unknown and magic.
