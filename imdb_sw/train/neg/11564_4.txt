An uncomfortable films about a rich English master who runs bars and tanks for red-haired girls like Evelyn's wife recently died. You know that he must love his wife, because he brings them to his home - a great, decaying pot - and makes them suffer and then tortures, tortures, and murders. The most amazing feature of this film for me is that somehow by the end of the film, we see this man played with Antonio De Teffe as HERO's film. However, recently, under the advice of his uncle's boyfriend Roberto Maldera, De Teffe sits down with a girl who meets his uncle's party. He goes with amazing things begins with De Teffe's mental state. He begins to see and hear his dead wife and finally, just look at the head if you still wish. Also, family and friends begin to die in many fashions of violence. Poor Aunt Agatha (looks like she might be less than Deffe and have him in the wheel and trying to look at the past) meets her fate in the style of foxy. Another person has a needle and then buried alive. And in fact, there is all the details about what / how Evelyn did what she did. Director Emilio Miraglia does some good things: the film in the film is good for this film though it tries to make us believe that Britain is very bad. No characters look at English. Many have black black hair and a mixture of Mediterranean and dressing in English can not be caught dead. Cars run on their bad side of the road. But no matter what, the crypt area had been shot and I liked the resolution of cheesy as well. And of course any red color, with red head Erika Blanc is always included. There is a misleading streak of sex; however, which I have found so much with the idea that abusing women was quite similar to health to reduce one of his mental powers. C'mon.
