I see from the view that many people who are talking about this movie emphasize their views on the MST3K call. That is fair enough (that is, after all, how to get its greatest potential), but, after having the chance to see the "last judge" in its original form, I'd like to share a few ideas and comments on meaningless version. First, we must admit that the original version is more smooth than the MST3K division, because especially for the exhibition area between Rossano Brazzi and Venantino Venantini (I can use the names of characters instead of actors', but I just love to write the words "Venantino Venantini"), explaining why the Venene's character of the refugee can not only leave Malta immediately. (It is not a point of CONVINCING, but at least the film developers tried to cover it.) If this area was cut off only on time or because it did not provide high-quality riffs, I don't know. Another action of the previous plot of the previous plot: The infringement of Venantino Venantini to Joe Don Baker, which appears to be unknown in the MST3K version, is described by the original, non-exciting area of ​​which Venantini entertains in the shower . While this gives him the reason to turn against it, the whole situation is really ... icky. (There is no other word for that.) Over the MST times (long-term "Son" and "sheriff" sheriff shot) were just a print-out of TV-print and they were not in the original movie. One place I wanted was made to be MST3K version: Before entering the bar to ask some people, Joe Don asks the Police Police Police to lead him out, because "they see uniforms, they won't collaborate." However, Joe Don himself dressed in his cowboy-slash-sheriff dresses, full of shiny badges! I can't imagine why they went through a great opportunity to surprise him ... <br /> <br /> One last study on the original, non-"Last Judge": Why, why, why? feel the need to put the butt of Venantino Venantini on the screen?
