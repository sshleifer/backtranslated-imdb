I will not spend too much time and energy on these comments. I just want to add because all the comments were very good I felt like we must enable people to know that not everyone is so happy, let alone be mentally stimulated by this attempt to create a very interesting movie. Other events seemed to be promising, playing with visual tests, but could not hold the rest. I felt like I had been stoned for the first time, and had a semi-philosophical conversation with his peers. It is an attempt not to add Dutch movies to new heights. I would like to look at Jesus is Palestijn, without having to do it all in a straightforward sense, also raising questions about life and the realities we are building ourselves. Gert de Graff is not Jean-Luc Godard or Tarkovsky and it will never be.
