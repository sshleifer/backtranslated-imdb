I watched 'envy' last night, on a DVD, at a friend's house. The cluster of this film is quite promising, Jack Black and Ben Stiller in comedy with great potential, but it fails completely to deliver. I watched it with five friends and no one laughed for the whole film. Jokes (which are few and very medium) are not funny in any way ... The story line is crap, and they never answer the question ... WHAT SH * T GO? Of course the answer to that is not the ONE. This film has no kind of comedy value, and as a few other users said the only thing it does is even closer to view is Christopher Walken as J-man. No characters made, the squares are thin are almost transparent - and is the same song in the film that thinks funny?
