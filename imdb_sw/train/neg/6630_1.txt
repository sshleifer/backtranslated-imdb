This so-called remake is awesome. I went to see this tonight. The first day if you expect and hype was very much to me to handle. But within the first half of the hour, we knew that this is a tragedy. Not only does not match the created links but it also profiles the original blog. The script was loaded, editing was untidy quite a few times. Mohanlal is the best actor. Amitabh was the same .. The director wanted to show how his bad behavior was but he went a little bit that led to a stable. Ajay who is very soft in these roles is also disappointed. It allows even to start on a new person of Prashant. One cannot proudly start work with something like this. Rajpal Yadav who was thrown to a few laughs could not even get a smile from anyone because of his powerful humor and amazing sound. Nisha Kothari confirmed that she was one of the worst managers we have today. All, RGV I thought was one of the most talented and talented directors India has been. Failed to sadly. He took the biggest challenge and responsibility to restore what is known as the best Indian movie ever making it a mess.
