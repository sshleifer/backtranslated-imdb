My child makes the video better than this! I feel bursting $ 4.00 spent leasing this thing! There is no date on video, visible designed by Wellspring; and, it's worse, there is no production date for the original film mentioned anywhere on the film! The only date released in 2002, leading an uninvited host to believe it gets the latest film. This game was too bad to consider that it has never been time and no sense at any time but correctly when it was done, that I wonder if anyone could take the time and cost of selling it as a video. It may be useful for students to learn the culture contrary to the 1960s, the fight against the war, the fight against the introduction, the entry, turn and stop culture; but when you read behind a video case, there is no indication that you are getting it. If you make a mistake of leasing however, it probably looks good during drugs, so that your thoughts will be closer to the scope of the directors, Fassbinder and Fengler. Regardless of your mental state when you look at it, I can tell you that it is not more available after the first location; therefore, knowing that, I'm sure you will sleep before the end.
