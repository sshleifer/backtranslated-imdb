I couldn't believe when I put this movie in my DVD player. I thought I would like to laugh good, because I played D&D for half of my life. I had to wipe it as I was with the company and were amazed at what I was investigating. It was completed later, and I must have left it off on the porn-soft sex of the clown start. No, they run a fate joke, joke, selfishness, racism, wear like KKK ... This movie is flat out meaning for anyone who has ever played D & DD The real can not stop them using their game. Who would want their name to be associated with this?
