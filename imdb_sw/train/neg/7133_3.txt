I felt like I was looking at Fast and Furious again, but with different actors and a slightly different plot. I will say cars in the film are very cool. So, if you like fast cars, then you might find this attraction. I also loved Nadia Bjorlin because I have seen her from our days of life. She is a very good singer, but it is very bad to give her songs of pride to sing this film. I mean songs about cars; not exactly what you would like here on the radio. Since it is a Hollywood film, you should give this story a little way to the lee, but in real life I don't think any moderate joe will come as a hot as Nadia Bjorlin who can drive a race, fix the car engine, and become a leading singer. It's all very silly. The other side of the note, anyone who loves 25 million dollars in a car race is a nut. But it was kinda's cool end when Natasha stops right before the finish line with Michael's screws over. Valuable. <br /> <br /> VERDICT OF FILIA: This movie is for car freaks. So, if you would like fast cars, then I would recommend suggesting this.
