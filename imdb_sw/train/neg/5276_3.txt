No, this is not about a fairy story with a pig coach, a godmother of fairy and glass slippers, but if I had to explain it, I'd like to destroy you for you, which I can. But do not let curiosity get better for you, as this film is not fantastic. It is one of those movies that begin promising, before betraying its audience with the most expensive and unusual stories. And that's a real fear. Yoon-hee (For Ji-Won) and Hyun-soo (Shin Se-kyeong) are your best mother and daughter. A successful plastic surgeon, sometimes a beautiful, humble, and beautiful girl. Their relationship is as a hand in the immune system, almost as much as their siblings rather than parent-child. But things start to go wrong (not always) when Hyun-soo friends, Yoon-hee have worked, begins to go berserk. Perhaps it is a warning to the audience, and for those Koreans who do not fight the eyelids when they are under the knife, if the news reports are reliable. The only shocking times are plastic surgery gifts, though somehow, I thought of Kim Kim's time there was a year when you interact and describe what is going on during the surgery itself. It is a half-story story, a fist being an attempt to scare the audience with the most common form of horror, which, I accept, they have received me from time to time. However, the second half has caused the movie on the romantic-jumbo style, and it was completely closed to push his mind under your throat. Some things begin to be misunderstood, and when trials are presented to explain, perhaps you don't buy it, not that awesome movies start. All routes are good, and there is a lack of variation of male presence rather than a military military role. But hey, I can't complain, although the story can be very good. I would recommend you look at this, only if you are a fan of the worst Korean, on VCD. Beware of those who witness the time!
