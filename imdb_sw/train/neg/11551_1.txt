Hardly, there is absolutely nothing good about this fest crap completely. Randolph Scott, a homosexual person who lived with his Cary Grant Assistant for twelve years, is in his more timber and triggers in the lowest role. In 57 he was very old for these romantic roles, although it does not matter much here because Gail Russell looks much more than his 31 years and he is very serious due to long-term alcoholism and smoking. Lee Marvin has his usual criminal responsibility but not enough to save this trash. Thank God they do not get west again, they are just dated, old paint movies that attracts guns and murder. 0 /.
