Uh! Another gay film. This time is to show the black side. Call your last dollar will have the end of fun! But why? For more than half the half, all gay films should live in death or finale "addio". It is like all of the European film Noir films in 40, 50, 60, and 70. The leader ... The man or woman must do or leave alone with trouble. Why in the name of God should the writers, directors, and producers have listeners from the hearing hall? After all, it should be homosexual ... not glum. Perhaps the group should be changed to the 'glum' film. A large percentage of gay relationships make the last and the couple make a trip away along in the sunset! It does not matter who writes or provides, shows only the lower side of homosexual life and gives a proper sense of homosexual life. This movie proves my point. If you rent a DVD, take a barrier, for here comes another movie 'gay'! This is WRONG!
