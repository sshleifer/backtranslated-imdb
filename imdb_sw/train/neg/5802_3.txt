Nikolai Gogol's story "Viy" has been reproduced and released on a home video in the United States through Faith Movies. The original story relates to the priest who should look at the body of the witch and his only faith to protect him. It has been enlarged and put in America, although it seems clear in Russia (houses, clothes and accessories is all wrong despite the English sign), this is an unusual film that doesn't work really well. America's backwoods but obviously not. There are also some weird, deliberately oblique as the main character being the author at the beginning and the priest shortly later. I do not know why they did it, even after looking at the formulation of a piece on DVD) Another problem is dubbing which is much worse. It has been done so far that everyone speaks when their lips are not on the camera - or if it is inappropriate to even match the lip flaps. I do not know whether His Film Imams or the producers who made the film are expecting to give the West (revealed in the form of a piece). <br /> <br /> Movies are not very good. As I have said it has all kinds of technical issues that only makes this not strange curio. In spite of very scary photos the film does not work as a terrible film. If the film to strengthen his faith is also confused in this voting, it will make anyone even laugh at anyone. <br /> <br /> Due to the choice I will give, even for bin business price. My advice would be to find the 1960 edition of a story called Viy that will bring two problems and knowledge about faith in God.
