Well, I thought to know this was a "dog" defense "Lordi Motion Picture"? I mean, I realized this when the "dinosaur" dress was shown and when the lead was seen when I was singing "Hard Rock Hallelujah" ... even though I hate the song. "Dark floors" is about a young autistic girl who is in the process of escape out of the hospital and she on a protective father when they, and other people on the elevator, are shorter ... When they get to their apartment comes as a surprise completely see that no one else is around. The hospital is empty ... Except for the various creatures that seem to crush because there is no clear ... They walk through the hallway and stairwells, meeting all the members of the band of heavy metal bands in their foreign shock, shock clothing clothes. .. Nothing remembers here, except the main act, the lack of a year / weakness, and the exciting stimulation edge, reminds me of "KISS Meet the Phantom Store". Well, remember that dud? I would not come ... I would just recommend avoiding all of this House of the Spirit House as a fungus and not listening to Lordi since they are Gwar ripoff band!
