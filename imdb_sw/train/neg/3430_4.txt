Maniac of blood blood and improper compulsion demands a woman. He was shot by two police officers and then rose from the grave because of the devotional worship of the devil made by evil rebellion. Women's hunt goes on with this zombie-demon. The donated child returns from the grave and wants the maniac to die again, but only with the help of this police will be fulfilled ... <br /> <br /> Hunger 65 minutes of blood ... Horny, doll -Babies, S & M , lost and corrupt police, who were disobedient who fled before Jesus Christ and three screens at the end of the film tell us what finally happened to the saved police (yes, we should know!) ... Two good shots to ban cannot save the situation. I have seen the worst, but this was too bad. It is recommended only for the very die-like fans.
