One of the most powerful films I ever sat. I have never taken time to write one of these but I felt compelled to witness this competition by making a film and feeling a certain amount of waste of time on a piece of turd being honest. There were many places that irritated me for their complete deficiency and lack of intelligence (for example, when police fired a shot with people suffering from infectious diseases?) When would the hospital have time for these people because of lack of treatment? Why did the boy who saw him spy his wife walking out of his dressing clothes while carrying a gun around his bed?). Also, the reputation - if we have come to expect in these films - were bad (for example a blonde boy - I don't remember his frickin name and I gave him no desire - absolutely turned out against his girlfriend and ran away from her) and I finished persuading all to finish the end! The production was very popular and the film did not write at home.
