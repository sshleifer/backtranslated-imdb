What was really going on during World War II in New Zealand when the US forces were there? <br /> <br /> This bad sister's 4 story was sad to see. What? Can you imagine giving Joan Fontaine as a great sister for Sandra Dee? Fontaine looks more like her mother. Even the funnier was that Fontaine becomes pregnant in the film. Piper Laurie and Paul Newman who showed great as to the screening of the screen 4 years later in "The Hustler," have no scenes included in this film. Laurie has another sister who goes to Wellington to go around there, despite the fact that she is married. Woe to her husband when he returns from the battle. Jean Simmons is a widow and finds romance by Paul Newman too much. There is even a romance for the young Miss Dee here. <br /> <br /> Photo doesn't have a little meaning. What? Are they trying to say that it's all the same in love and war? If so, they did a bad job in selling this. <br /> <br /> Conflict of interest with Newman and Simmons is quickly lost. That's what should be done with this terrible film of 1957.
