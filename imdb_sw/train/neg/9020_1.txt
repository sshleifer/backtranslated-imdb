I mistakenly spent the night at night looking at this. About the only thing I can say well about this awesome film is that it can be used by filming schools to show how to make movies. There is no positive development of behavior, waiting, I don't even know they are characters. Setting settings was hokey and inches, and misuse of split screens was lost since sometimes they could not even connect with alternative shots. If I could give this zero or reduce the rate I could. Unfortunately, it is not even appropriate to play a few times. It is a sad example of the lost money and Hollywood, and now I lose my time even thinking about it.
