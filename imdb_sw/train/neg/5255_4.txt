Talking to the eyes, this film is wonderful. It has a wonderful time of beautiful black. But in general, the plot is very clich√©d, as well as its visible message. If you are a fan of high-up violence in the usual movies like a hostel or you have seen it, you will love it. If you are looking for anything up, select. I saw it as part of the Edinburgh Film Festival 06, and I chose just because I was looking for something that was confusing. Finally, not distracting. Just grind and not recommended to stay. If you want to have a real challenge, go see something as lost. If you want to be deleted, or tell your friends about the film that caused it, then this is for you.
