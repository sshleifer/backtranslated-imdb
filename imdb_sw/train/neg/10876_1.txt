What is the D-Movie hell? Bad work, bad effects and bad discussions / stories I have come to. The only cool thing here was Coolio, who had a good cameo as a lost soldier. However, all parts of the film are bad and boring. Not too bad, you can laugh about it. Just a clear number. And anyone who compares this with the evil evil series can also compare Tomb Raider to Indiana Jones (well, alright, at least there was Angelina Jolie in Tomb Raider)! 1 out of 10
