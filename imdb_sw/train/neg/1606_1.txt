In this film, the followers of Chávez (either venezuelan and non-venezuelan) speak only about the great situation in our country. Nor did they say that the conflict began because of the announcement of Chávez that struck many of the PDVSA best workers on political issues. <br /> <br /> They did not say anything about over 96 TV disruptions approved by Chávez during just three days in "CADENA NACIONAL" (a kind of closed O TV signal private). Each and 20 minutes of time. Nor did they tell us anything about the announcement made by General en Jefe Lucas Rincon Romero, the General Inspector of the Army, who is the traditional assistant of Chávez. Even now, with its advertising, he is the Interior Ministry and Yusticia. After returning to Chávez made the Association of Ministro del Defensa (similar to the Secretary of Defense in the United States). They did not say anything about Chávez's orders about shooting against people who were involved with pacifical people who claimed for the election. They did not say anything about people in this crowd who were killed by the followers of Chávez (or civilians and military forces). They give certain facts to the wrong order, to lie. They did not say anything about the citizens of the venezuelan community who now claim to elections to resolve the Chávez crisis and to avoid the election. That is why I tell you… This movie is just a lie or a great lie.
