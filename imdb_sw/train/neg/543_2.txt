very well Cant b waste time just because the star-cast .. I think all I can see is a group of talent losing their time on the big screen and some pathetic humor that appeals to me I don't know who? pathetic songs that will be heard by? other sudden hurdles have right with who? race against time? Do you mean waste on time? OK first to take your child away, then teach him a lesson we are so I don't know this fact who has said that a new brilliant idea is probably another kind of humanity but I would like to comment as people who make a good film message given but can be given by The guest sitting over you in the bus instead of going to the film loss to learn Indian movies have shown that already ready and also do not know how to waste my time on the waste anyway!
