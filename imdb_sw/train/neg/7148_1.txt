Before watching this film I had very low expectations and I just went to see cars. I finally decided to go for that reason. Plot is almost nonexistent. Character development does not exist. Many clich√©s and many ambitions to stop jaws existed in a movie that I could just watch and ask how it was released. If it is not for exotics, I would even have seen this movie 1. The test of the proven line of evidence is corrupted by the great degradation of this tribal ritual of racing and laughable characters who make its members. In fact, the film's plot is predictable and simple that the average child can predict a large number of stories. Bad work, bad plot, bad joke, bad movie. Don't see it. Play Gran Turismo HD instead and you'll have your thirst to install fast cars without stopping after evil.
