What? How has this ever been? I usually love sci f / Bigfoot or any films etc. . but I still expect to be written without much cheese like this. The effects were sad, the lines were sad. Avoid at all costs. I just ended up leasing because it was in the worst case (I was looking for film Sasquatch and Lance Henrikson in it - still haven't seen it one). The idea of ​​the film is really good. There was a lot of power to make a small movie here. I don't know just how something like this is approaching like this. Go to chat with students / art / English students who are interested in any high school and you will find people who can write the best script.
