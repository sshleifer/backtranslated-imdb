This is one of those movies where I would just sit on the bar. The video is really interesting. What the story is very flimsy and you pretty much and I think at that. The film enters into a cameras' technique that seems to be interested in causing migraines and makes it as a student film. Did I say that it was already boring? If all the characters had died suddenly at the end of the movie I would not be concerned if I had no emotional attachment to any of them. <br /> <br /> There is almost 4 minutes beautiful in this movie, but that was about it. This is the first time I have ever seen walking on the movie during the performance, but I believed that it had to be better. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> Type of film can threaten innocent children.
