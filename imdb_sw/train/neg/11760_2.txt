Amen to Magsel. There was so much confusion. First, how do you know how you use the film? Henry Cele stars in each of them. I bought this movie to think it was a service ... WHAT TO KNOW !! It would be a comedy but for a little girl raped. David Hasselhoff (spelling?) It is similar to popcorn TV but it was not reliable in this film (where it had English characters?) AND WHAT IS THE LOVE? The movie was supposed to be on the rise of a young military force - not the captain slave captain to get jiggly and the English girl looking for his father ... <br /> <br /> If I was paying more than $ 7 for this movie, I would call The police - for that reason will be a crime!
