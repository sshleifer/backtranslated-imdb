It's not a new story of a story, but this romantic comedy makes the concept work. The boy (John Cusack) and the beautiful woman (Kate Beckinsale) continue to meet the luck and wonder if they mean each other. Although both are promised to others ... odd they still feel that their soul mate is out there somewhere. A little bit in a certain place, but a viva of love. Being a partner I am almost forced to be riveted. My favorite part is where Cusack is down and the snow begins to fall. Finale is close to sweet, but most suitable. This is not one of the deep roles of Cusack, but who in hell could not be beaten by Beckinsale. The most popular help is provided by Jeremy Piven and Molly Shannon. John Corbett has the most important role I have ever seen. On the other hand Eugene Levy is quirky and funny. Look at this for yourself.
