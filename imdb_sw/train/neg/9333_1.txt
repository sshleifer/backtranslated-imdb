Awesome !!! I don't want to be very bad but this film has IQ's stupid monkey. It's a tragedy. I can't just believe how bad this movie is. The Arabian, I just watched this film to see how much bad it could get. On the side of the "kick" characters are a total of disaster. Harvey Keitle is a good actor but who knows maybe he's in financial trouble to participate in the film's fiasco. . . . . This movie should be presented to all students in all the film schools to teach them how to make a film
