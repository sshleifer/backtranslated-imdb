Perhaps he was inspired by his "Orlando" people, Potter here provides a car for himself in the worst way: writes, guides, stars, and actually writes music, including the love song of mawkish. The film is very similar to a high school or college project and a young man believed that his closest love with melodramatic obsessions is as interesting to us as his. Potter's behavior is as irrelevant as the object of its romantic deficit cannot be seen, and the whole film is a disgrace of the narcissism pretending as celebrating cucumber. Maybe if he did not devoted himself could be working. He can not only do it, either he or she does. Surprise, over-hub, anger, and silence.
