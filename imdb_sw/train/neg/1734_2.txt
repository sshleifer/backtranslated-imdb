I am a great fan of the old west, and I do not believe that Hollywood has the ability to capture its former glory. But even Ronda Fleming and Stewart Granger can support this 1957 movie that carries almost all the western features of the adjustment goals turned out to be a good man. A fallen but wise woman, people with big cities who should turn to warriors for salvation, etc. I can't help but see the last names of the author and the little "actress" who plays the Granger son. Any preference there? I found it best to act in high school sports. Chill Wills has a cartoon character of Chill Wills. Have I reached 1000 words yet?
