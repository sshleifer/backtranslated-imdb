I found this film to be interesting research because it has a little effect but a little more than that. The basic strategy follows the lives of a few people and how their actions (intentionally and otherwise) affect the lives of others. The film cover has a great promise but I feel unable to deliver its promises. Most of the time is used to tell listeners on the theory of chaos and very little time to show. As a result, I have never felt true to all the characters and never been properly connected to them. At the end of the film, I had a "view" what about all. Strong trends in character development would have made this film good, but if it stands it just so-so
