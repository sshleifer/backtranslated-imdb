I expected to watch this film and then I realized that any hopes of interaction between the executives were beaten and swearing unnecessarily. Now I am not rough in any way, but by screaming everyone is not a good film. Ewan Bremner is definitely one of the worst actors in the world at this time (witnessing its performance in the worst life of the Stuff Life) and its emphasis on "Cockney" is almost as bad as its inspiration of Edinburgh. Avoid. How many more of these films "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang", "Good Creatures" we should suffer before the film makers realize that f-word, c-word etc does not replace the right conversation.
