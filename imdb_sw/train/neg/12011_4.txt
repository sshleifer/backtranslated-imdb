John Pressman (Micheal 'I shoulda called Ditch' Lerner) works in the doctor's office as a command. His mother (Rubelstein 'Zelda' Poltergeist ') recognizes him away from people who feel they think they are wrong. But this turns into a film in the film, but recent lines look like John goes to the cinema to kill. Encourage someone who looks at the film to do the same. Lerner fits up on this, but Zelda repeats the lines of regular conversation. That feels you quickly. But not as angry as the two girls who watch the movie inside the movie. For this awesome film fails, it is very busy trying to be clever, trying to give a message and apparently forget the slasher film should inspire the feeling of tension, or at least a jump or two. No, what we are here is the worst kind of slasher: One gallery. <br /> <br /> My bridge: D +
