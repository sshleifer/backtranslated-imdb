I have read the book around 'The Time of the Time' and then I saw the movie. The movie had everything in the book but since the book had a 190 page and the film was 2 hours that felt very good and had a lot of harm and acting on it. <br /> <br /> The effect of time is on a girl named Meg, Charles Wallace, and Calvin should join together to find Meg's father and leave the island Camazotz. <br /> <br /> The beginning of the film is a real stinker. Acting is bad, the trend is laughable, and so far the situation is not necessary. In fact I was broken to see that Madeleine Engle who wrote a book and created a movie, made a good book, and a horror movie. Acting is worse than any direct-video-acting. Yes, I had to admit there was a cold effect. But with all the weight they were done so much and not in any way possible. If you read the book you will be broken by the movie. I would like to give them 0 but sadly I can only give 1. Half would be useful.
