In addition to the movie goes, it's a true modern science fiction. It has a lot of cool stuff in it, and some quality events. That said, it's not good, and some things are so close to search ... <br /> <br /> If you call this this cube movie is perfect and perfect. This is a very definition of hitting a great movie and of the original innovation ... All feel for it can be translated to some extent in the first foundation, but the introduction of people / androids as part of the "team" behind the cube itself is a little stretch. .. <br /> <br /> I paid this 3 *** because of the original backstabbing. This should be safe in many parts of the film that are out of place or when you mention all of them ... <br /> <br /> It seems to those who haven't seen Cube & Hypercube, but it is not available for fans of the series ...
