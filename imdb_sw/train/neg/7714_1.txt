Awlright, of course, MooCow will tell the truth: I've been like this cheap, cheesy 70. The idea that many tomato tomatoes kill the United States is a great idea, and in spite of itself, moovie offers a good bottle, a place in front of threats that are running away from large tomatoes, are obviously fake. This film, along with Kentucky Fried Moovie, is one of the early experiments in the spoofs, which was very popular in the 80 & 90s years, with a huge thanks to the Birds. This, as a moost spoofs, is very poor. A lot of fun humor is a failure of destruction, and it will convince them. But thanks to the tomato thanks, the "Love of Youth", and the horrible area of ​​helicopter, Attack of the Tomato Killer provides products, though largely for inappropriate reasons. There are sooooo many bad things with this film ... and so right, it's hard to explain. Sufficient people should also have enjoyed as Tomato emerged in two moore films, and a series of cartoon! The great tomatoes of the time spent away from tomatoes are very good. With digging 70 clothing, dude !! ; = 8) This tomato is a seed and cheesy, but worth a chuckle or two; MooCow says grab pizza and pop in Tomato! : ??
