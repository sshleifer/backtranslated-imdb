What happened to Peter Bogdanovich? Once a brilliant director, blazer of the trail ... now builds too low ... Is this the person who led "The Show Show Show"? Here, he takes an interesting point (even if not known), and turns it into a bubble gum that loses a taste when you hit a bite ... Dunst is not bad, but Izzard is hidden as Chaplin, and all other actors seem to have been beaten with "looks" , and not because they were correct for that part. Very bad. I'm going to hire "Paper Moon" again.
