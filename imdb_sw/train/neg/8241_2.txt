This movie has a serious problem with that which makes it as a low class budget project from someone in a film school. I must give credit to his clan though. Often in the movie I found myself laughing hysterically. It was always bad for it was a delightful, which made it look enjoyable. If you are looking for a small low-cost film and losing to psychological fear and dash of the camp of ignorance, then beat a popcorn bowl, invite other friends, and rejoice. I agree with other comments that the voice is very bad. Dialog is close and impossible to follow a lot of time and voice sounds are just kind of there.
