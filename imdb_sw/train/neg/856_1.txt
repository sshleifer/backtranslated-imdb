These scriptures write about the end of the plot not read it if you have not seen this waste. <br /> <br /> I saw this rubbish film in the panic that has made me think it would be scared. If I had a video store I would have put it in the BORING section. This film is a trash that will make you laugh if you have lost your socks. <br /> <br /> This film has permanent shots of people driving like that was awesome. Yes, I work and go back (and sometimes in the shop or visit my cat) almost every day and believe me is not scary. It even starts with 20 minutes of other people driving. Even a little child does the same. Round and round goes and never stops. What motivates you to watch a young child riding a bicycle for hours? I think NOTHING and if you look at it you won't think it too. The family in the car comes to a big castle and is given a tour around it without looking at the kitchen. Then one turns around for an hour and tries to kill his family without cause. That's all that happens and if you can see it's garbage.
