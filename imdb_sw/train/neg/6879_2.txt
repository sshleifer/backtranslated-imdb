Rosie lost a lot of TV time talking about Tainos as if they had a great influence on the day of the Puerto Rican day. They were not. The fact is that Africans and Spanish were with him. What counts me is that he is standing on the screen looking like some light red chick (with a father obviously father, cousin and uncle) pretending to really identify the real nature of what makes them modern day Puerto Ricans, but hard to say how Africans influenced the way Spanish, food and music. He is ordinary and I have lost much respect to him and will not help anything else he does. Also, because he wants to move around to Africa, he did not need to take more roles in black (Lackawanna Blues). We can find during the second pride of Black Latina (thanks Zoe Saldana, Gina Torres, Gina Ravera and Melissa DeSousa). To Puerto Rican here who said they are Africans and not "black". ... Thank you. We "black" certainly do not have the same thing as "you" so no love lost. But, since you are going to the Nations and have benefited from the civil rights movement we want by rejecting any good human treatment you received with respect to blood, sweat and tears from behind the "black" partner. If I am right Puerto Ricans have bad pictures in the media, but we blacks do not use our time to try to grow them because we know that the media likes to use low standards and the behavior of a few of them to maintain an infinite rule and meaning. However, you have certainly been fed into the odor that someone is white or better ... you are not. Also, somehow you feel compelled to believe that black culture is BET ... again you're not right and you need to take a holiday out of hood. Try visiting Atlanta, Ga., Houston, Texas, Charlotte, N.C. I believe no one of those whites want to claim your "culture".
