You must confess that you have seen a few of my time, but this is up there and worse. Plot of trouble follow. Sex and harassment are healed to destroy and disrupt the film's improper films. I can only think that the cast will look back on the final product and want to connect dust to the non-worried shelf for a generation or two. Sadly, in my case, I have a DVD. It will sit on the shelf and watch me regularly.
