What can I say about the evil motives of Cruel 2? Well, I can honestly say, I will look at this film again if I am locked in a chair and my eyes open at an hour-of-orange-style. Robin Dunne 'film stars' No, I've never heard of him either), whose impression of Ryan Phillipe has made me round. In the case of a cast for a horrible, experiment of Dunne (and failure) take to play a beautiful charismatic, charmer. Since the rituals are not good, neither angry or charming, the character is never completely gone. Amy Adams, (once in a buffy period), tries to take where Sarah Michelle Gellar left and brought Katherine's life to life ... However, Adams is not a good player and her performance was flat and lacking any real emotion, often he looked like he was reading only interesting cards away from the camera. There were two good actors in the film, however, Barry Flatman (Saw 2 & Saw 3) and I Rogers (Mrs Kensington in Capacity Austion), performed beautiful and interesting performances like the parents of Sebastian and Katherine and the only reason was rated. 2 films, not 1. <br /> <br /> The film itself is the original version, which was like a copy of the discussion of the discussion and published events that had no original film. <br /> <br /> I think that as a TV show, it would have worked, but it would have been planned by people who can actually make the main part.
