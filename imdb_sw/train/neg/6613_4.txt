I am a big fan of Mr Ram Gopal Varma but I did not believe that he made this film. I was desperate. Ram Ramopal Varma Ki Aag does not come anywhere near real Sholay. It does not give a lasting impression to the viewer. Ram Gopal Varma fails to create chemistry among the characters. There is no relationship between Heero (Ajay Devgan) and Raj (Prashant raj). There is hardly any picture with more than two people in the frame together. The sequence outside the court room and Amitabh Bachchan and the face of Mohanlal is amazing. Amitabh Bachchan should not make this movie. Ajay and Sushmita sen were trying better but no use. The voice of Rajpal Yadav - is not good and not meaningful. Mohanlal made perfect justice and asserted that acting is on the expression of the face and body language. The cast rest was under expectation. The beautiful condition that was taken from the first shadow of falling on this flat. Ram Gopal Varma could work on the script but because of the controversy surrounding the movie he used and just because he did he made this aag. But there is no fire.
