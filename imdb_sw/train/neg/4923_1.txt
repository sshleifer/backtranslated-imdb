This should be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. This movie has nothing positive about it. Some of your people like this film! I have seen many movies of Dracula and I love everyone who I saw, but when I saw this film I said to myself, "Is hell this?" What's a stupid movie. Now they have Dracula who she is because she is Judah. For those who do not know who Judas is, he betrayed Jesus Christ and then felt guilty he was bound himself. You should beat me. That's the worst reason why I've ever heard why Dracula became bad. Who asked for it however? It's a piece of sh ** this movie is. Who came with this sincere excuse for the movie should be beaten. Even Dracula is awesome. If you've ever seen this film you can't even think it was Dracula. Wow, Dracula 2000! Is that position being taken to please me? Don't waste your time or money on this trash.
