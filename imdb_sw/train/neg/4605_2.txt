This film is written by Charlie Higson, who before this made the "story" of Fast Show and its own show according to one of the Fast Show characters (Tony's car's car). He has also written James Bond books for children. True I have seen before Gordon's movies that only depend on Lovecraft stories, and each one of them is amazing. Here Gordon tries to do something different. Fashion is "modern", which means a shaky camera, cutting fast and amazing, cool music back. It works well here, I think, but it still has no meaning and cheap. It makes me often think of a camera who isolates its dv-front camera in front of the administrators / supervisors and trying to make a stylish step in the picture (hope that something deserving is going to happen). Searching is good, and there is a whole situation, which is a leading result. I think the main character, the boy of "zero", is very interesting in his "zeroness". This oil is also good. And the husband who looks like Alec Baldwin, but not him. But pretty soon after starting the movie becomes something that is not interesting: In this case I mean the endless line of suffering and disease. There is not much humanity in this film / story: It is totally disappointing, and everyone in this film is disgusting and hopeless, or recently dead. Not to say that no humor either. It is 1'40 breast long without any apology at any time. However, Gordon stays with me one of the most popular filmmakers who are working today, and think of this movie as a quiz, and as a failure in it. Everyone needs to get lost sometimes, just learn and find their way again. This could be the work of Gordon's less attractive and unemployed.
