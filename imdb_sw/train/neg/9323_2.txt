What was I looking at? I spent 90 minutes of my precious life to look at one of the less movies I saw. The clown concept of the serial killer is really awesome to see there are many people who are afraid of clowns .... but that is 300 pound nursery nursery records of clown killer makes the embarrassment of the genre. I'm still wondering how character Mark could not run from the clown ... he's 300 pounds, he's gotta get tired finally. All of it made me stand up and say in a loud voice, "What were I looking for?" It seems Brandon is a cousin of Denise .... and they found it around the middle of the movie means he had sex with his cousin ..... that's something that people want to see * shudders *. Something else I got hilarious stupid was the opening area where the clown hits the woman and says "What did you do?" In fact, what do you think he did? The last thing that was a stupid thing was the second time the main character clapped and called ac * nt and then 5 minutes later saying that violence did not help anything .... wrote the author of the script to the wrong person? Not one of these films is quite clear. <br /> <br /> The movie was more or less under budget budget that I came to buy (all 3.99) and I had no entertainment out of sexual events. I wonder the clown of oil did not join orgy, it would be quite suitable. I expected the movie would have a value of entertainment such as B movies that could have, but I was wrong. This is a piece of garbage that should not look. About 1 out of 10
