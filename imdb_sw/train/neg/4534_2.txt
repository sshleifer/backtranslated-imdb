The book on which this film is based on my life change. But saying this movie was desperate is ignored. Acting, leading, movies, and stories were awesome. I can never recommend this film to anyone. I have told people who have no number about the book but now tell them everything that they should not see the film! I did not expect a conspiracy to follow a book, but have left many of the features of the book. The movie tried, but failed, giving powerful and inspiring messages and just stretched the main theme of prophecy. When I placed a place that he did not read the book, I saw the Celestine Prophecy as a hoaxy B.S. I am completely disappointed with Redfield through this film.
