I was also fascinated by the high quality (8.5) of this film, and I had a heart. I had seen good foreign movies and I was expecting to make it three in rows, but it wasn't there. I went with a Spanish language friend who felt the same way. There is not a lot of conspiracy, if any. I don't need to be in the movie, but it needs to somehow make it or give it to me. The best I can say is the prospect of becoming an Altman-esque film, though it includes a very small one. Indeed, there are times, but the shortest time is easily accessible to the slowest 97 minutes of the object. I don't know the high level of this film. I offer 3.3 /> <br />
