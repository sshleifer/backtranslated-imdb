The road to road road with comic aid presented by John Cleese the best (although he is actually sending his performance at Fawlty Towers). It seems to walk from the top of the top slapstick to a normal penny in a drop of hats, and the worst part of the film is that Martin and Hawn should "find themselves", who, etc.. Look for your risk.
