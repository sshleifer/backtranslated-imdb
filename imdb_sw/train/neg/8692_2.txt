I think Elisabeth Rohm, though she may try hard, is not quite good. I think it was because of the budget that could be the only one that could get that price. I actually looked at the performance of Myron Natwick, whose work I know very well. It was more reliable and of course it is more compelling to watch. When he was not screwed, the thing died. This was done Vancouver. He gave me creeps, but be sure that in real life he is gentle, funny sympathetic person. He said he even played that role gave creeps. <br /> <br /> I'll look at him in it, but Elisabeth Rohm - never again. He had an exciting as a button on the Law and Procedure. Maybe a very good person, but no actor.
