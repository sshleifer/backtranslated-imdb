Okay, I have tried and tried it, but I DON'T find this thing for Guy Maddin. Stories From Gimli Hospital has helped me cool, the film about the Austrian people and one about Ice Nymph were good looking but not in the story department ... and this movie go about pregnancy and hockey is just boring. I enjoy Maddin thanks to the silent film, but I do not like his films for the same reason I do not like Quentin Tarantino movies: they are empty rituals for more excellent films, more creative - films that develop a form of art or breaking new lands - and are fashionable and no substance. There is no reduction in the jump and the corners of an unusual camera can hide the fact that Maddin is a man David Lynch wannabe, although he has one advantage over Tarantino: generally does not write a shameful conversation, because his many films are based on news headlines. Under the foundation is, Maddin's contribution is a clever choice of films for popular films.
