Well this is the first post that comments on IMDb., Do you get it, this film has made me and warned all good people who will stand forever and try movies. they have given their views of what I saw to watch this film because it seemed to have other dignitaries (though they have been reading the most critical critics against this film) I thought trying to make it a flick of comedy. .... then all started to go pathetic ... someone can believe yourself, you wud feel going to banging your head every time a woman looks pathetic named the heroine of the movie is made without help. ..Huh ~~ Well how one can dig all the sick KOSI witch kinda tries to do all he can to get you out of your way. Another second thing about the movie is, the hero of "ZOMBIE", that's losing his partner around like Goat, and the black color u and his eyes, and with the sister of "brave fool". and blood from head to toe if you have tried and succeeded by looking at this movie!
