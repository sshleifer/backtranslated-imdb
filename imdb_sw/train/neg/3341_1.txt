I lost this movie to see Dolph Lundgren, who I have never seen in any movie since Rocky IV. Unfortunately this movie was a great disappointment. Acting of all parties was bad except for Mr Lundgren, who was the same. Dob√≥ County was a delightful thing even though its stupid dress and make-up. The program is not quite clever, it is something that is repeated several times in different movies. The pieces were improper, and Lundgren's character was not deep in it. I did not expect the film, but unfortunately this is not a good step. Each turn in the plot is very predictable and the probability of the highest on the unrealistic and comic-book as the characters begin to begin to mislead me pretty soon. I would like to recommend this to young children who want some act like comic, but only if nothing else is available. </ 1/1 / / 1/10. (I think the current average 7.0 votes and 6 votes must be caused by someone involved in making this film)
