I am a big fan of Ted V Mikels and the original "Conversion of the Dead" is the main reason but this is a very bad movie I have ever seen. Even giving us the talent of Liz Renay ("Can't Live") could not save this piece of value. This film should be used as a lesson for all old, current and future filmmakers ... when you have a successful film as "dead cats" you should first leave a sleeping dog and you should definitely not try to strengthen over twenty years later. (unless you have financial support to pull the best shepherd as well as Herschel Gordon Lewis made by "Blood Festival 2: All You Can Eat") Even if you decide to do so you should spend less money than you did in nature and for god ... CALL movie films on video ... Why do filmmakers even try to do so when everyone knows the quality will leave ... but see one film made in this way that has a pound value to beat hell .... if you can't afford to do well more than your original film then selling film rights to someone who can ... and Ted V Mikels was thinking about (or smoking) when he wrote this god-a wful script? I mean coming, dog and cat "aliens" from another planet? The cardboard box has been seen as a destructive machine that can recycle human bodies ... bones and clothes and all? If any of these actors, apart from Liz Renay, were paid more than five dollars for their worst exhibition than they lost more! Avoid this film at all costs and look at nature.
