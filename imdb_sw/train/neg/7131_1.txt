I love bad movies. I like to rent bad movies with my friends and beat them for their time. Then there are films like this. The last number is not just a bad film, but a sign indicating that perhaps the American film industry should please, for the viewer, at least the documentation to prove before funding the movie. <br /> <br /> As a discrimination occupied Fanya, this film could eliminate it. Story of the story can not be connected, and act everywhere is delicious. Nadia Bjorlin and Eddie Griffin have, perhaps, the worst chemistry I saw in good time, and even one of them should be isolated from humanity and be beaten by an orange fund until they change their work for street traders (just about something they can qualify for legitimately). Additionally, how Angus Macfadyen believed to make this film is far beyond me that I can't even think of an example. I am a faithful fan of his, but this has led me to ask him. <br /> <br /> Counting. Several people want to take revenge for a different reason (and if you care enough to know what it is, you're a bigger person than me), so much that it turns to violence (I think). The movie is like Ouroboros, a snake that swallows its own tail, for it is the last cycle of chaos and conversation is not the same for human ears. This movie is basically a big business business for the first half, and a non-performing movie for others, should be avoided at all costs and costs. I wish I could find one positive feature for this movie, and I think it stays in the fact that ultimately the reputation continues. Nadia Bjorlin, if you sing those two songs on this film, then you are hack, and I hope you have an old age. <br /> <br /> P.S.S. If you are missing this movie you are looking for a good experience, listening to the sound of Nadia Bjorlin's amazing songs.
