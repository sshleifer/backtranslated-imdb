... when it reduced BILL Broadway (1934) as a RIDING HIGH (1950). Reducing Bing Crosby as DAN BROOKS did not help the screenplay which was 'dated' in 34 except the 50 alone. Although the elders were not considered to be important to the Director. Nor did cars and Clothes in the back row from 1934 not match the 1950s as well. No 'der Bingel' singing can redeem this effort. <br /> <br /> We tested all of the original and refer to IMDb four **** Stars. Frank's touch was long and all that was left was CAPRA-CORN. That didn't stop Mr. Capra though. After going around around 50 years of doing some of the educational document, he cut down his work of fixing LADY's work for the JUMA (1933) as a MIRACLES (1961). Again a good cast was revealed on the IMDb six ****** The quest of stars compared to the nature of eight Nane ******** Stars. Sometimes it is better to stop when you were still, after UNION STATE (1948).
