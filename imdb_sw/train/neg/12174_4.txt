This is a great step down after amazing amazing original. This end is not as good as one part, and instead spend a lot of time on the development of the plot. Tim Thomerson is still the best thing about this series, but its wisecracking dropped below this entry. All displays are sufficient, but this time the script reduces us. The step is just normal and the plot is just interesting, so I need a lot of laughly laughs to stay welcome during the movie "Trancers". Unfortunately, the laugh is few and in the middle, and so, this film looks for the best.
