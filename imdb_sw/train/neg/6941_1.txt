This movie is not only interesting, it has also been done well. Graphics are very bad, not the second level - it's bad. Characters do not show face displays, voices are empty and without any soul, and the plot does not quite .... well ... anything and everything. My 5-year-old child loves it - but he thinks it's a little boring. I agree with him.
