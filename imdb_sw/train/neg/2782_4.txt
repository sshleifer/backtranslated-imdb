Just see this movie at the end of last week, I am angry, and I have a heart. Basically, the movie tells you that immigrants, those of the former Soviet Union in particular, come to this country, bringing everyone with them from the old country, and affecting and taking what Americans have been doing. What is the worst way to check the migration, and the worst way to tell people about it. That's the main thing. Another thing, to write in general, to guide and hide the image is on the level of the youth of the village. Workers did well, but it was not on them to save this group of decoration. A few jokes were delicious, but most were bad and cheesy. Couldn't wait from the theater, you want to return my money.
