This is the second time I left the video / DVD section through. <br /> <br /> I wanted to give this film a priceless course at first, although it has become inferior, clich√©d and ignorant. It was like after a special school headed by a nine-year-old child who thinks no one knows ... angry and sad, by hearing the boy's voice of deceit will explore poems ... and sing for some, and ... no, indeed, the suffering of the poor child ... \ t And I called him to sing? This is not the worst film I've ever seen, but one that I felt must be sitting. I do not recommend anyone.
