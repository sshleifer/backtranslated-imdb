I looked at the first 15 minutes, thinking that it was a real document (with a good “camera”). When I realized it all happened I thought "why would I like to lose my time looking at this junk?" The characters don't make a reliable way. very much emotion. for a guy traveling half way around the world in a country broken by war, made like a child. and I do not believe it is because "his behavior was very interesting on the bombing of the business center". very much and stupid. Do you see "lost city children"? French dark fantasy film about a guy who kidnaps children and steal their dreams ... I loved it!
