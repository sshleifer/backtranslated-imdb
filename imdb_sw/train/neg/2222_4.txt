Carlo Verdone once was able to combine superb comics and smart analysis with social craft and resistance. <br /> <br /> Then something happened, went into just another quick "holy-than-you" director. > <io io ico io mu or or or mmoja or or or or or or or or or or or or <br /> <br /> Like a trite cliche for such a smart director. It is very real to talk about in the film. Each character is a stereotype walk: self made a man forget his roots but who will be "good" again, they rebuked the wife, the rich rebel girl who is located honestly - but poor guy ... Acting is hardly average. <br /> <br /> Severe desire under every sphere.
