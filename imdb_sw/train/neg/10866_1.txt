Let's see where to start ... a bad acting; I don't know if I would like to call it, as much more on the line of the unsupported script. The characters did not appear to be in their place and seemed to be alive and useless. Surely there is a place or two for dirt, but that didn't save this film from lifeless characters. The main phone is a rapper is an insult to people who are doing it. These words had no rhythm or flow and were more visible in the ulcerative lines. <br /> <br /> Budget? Does this film even have a budget? It seemed like they used less money than I saw on YouTube's video shoot. Bad lights, props, poor production after production. Special side effects, if you want to go away now call those. The story would have been good if people really seemed willing to do it, but there was no life for this flick; I don't care who led it. <br /> <br /> I've seen some very bad flicks last year and this is obviously below. Don't waste your time or you will want to listen to this inappropriate inspection. Check out the dimensions, you will see 1 of the spread of 10 full speed and of course any center. I would like to look a little closer before losing my time. What sugar-fest!
