The movie was not waste except for some boring scenes in the middle. But the women threw it gave a better display than men who were laughable. But Krista Allen screamed at the movie. His voice was stimulating and pleasant. Krista's couch pictures should be reduced but made it to be seen by sexier than anyone can do. really is one of the best in these roles. It also made a calm as baddie in the last 5 minutes, which is an interesting part of the film. <br /> <br /> Burt Reynolds was not good and this was not as good as a star of action.
