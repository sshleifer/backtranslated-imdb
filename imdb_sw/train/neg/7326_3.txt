This film has an interesting plot, but acting is quite bad and the script is poor. I was shocked. The emphasis on ethics facing the main character is exciting, but because of the poor writing and forming this foundation to win the possibility is taken. 2 of the other 4 people in the playground were left after 45 minutes and 2 others were laughing how bad the film was. I have put it at the end, but I must agree to play Blackjack on my mobile phone to make the last 30 minutes.
