This film had nothing that I could not put my finger first: charisma in the direction of the leading actress. This translates into a lack of chemistry while sharing the screens with its leading man. Even romantic events came as they were involved only in play. It is very likely to be a director who did wrong what he needed from administrators. I don't know. <br /> But can it be screenplay? Who only was a loving shepherd? He seemed to be more happy with his skills and restaurant, and finally himself with his youthful use, than anyone or anything else. He was not sure that he was in love with the king. I was shocked in this film. But, don't forget it was chosen for Oscar, so make yourself.
