This movie offers NOTHING to anyone. It doesn't work for each type. Acting is awesome, lighter with strong winds. They exposed to the height of the last sex area were trying to amazing but just ended up being pretty much parody of what the film was intended. A full garbage, I can't believe the cracked movie that was. And I'm sure Rosario Dawson has finished this film even though this will be his stopping off one, the NC-17 awesome movie. The problem is not an adult who will hold a stick with this film as the film looks like an impressive part of OC or something that is aimed at youth. Pathetic.
