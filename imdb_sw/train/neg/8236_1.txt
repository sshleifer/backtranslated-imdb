I can't believe this is on DVD. Even below was available on my local video store. Some say this is a good movie if you consider it with only $ 4,000 budget. I see this funny. I would like to get the most at any time of the budget. It is still more funny, reading the following in another review: "Blood away, if you like fear and love something along the Duel line (1971) updated with a little more stories and other beautiful girls have been healed, you will love the movie this. "<br /> <br /> What?! This is a shame to compare the two movies. I / I give "1", as I can't give "0". I don't see just any way this film can be of entertainment.
