I loved the first movie, but this is an example of the model of the series which would be better left on the drawing board. The main idea in the first movie was, if not great, then at least very interesting. Finally he tries to build on the idea and characters from the first movie, and although Christopher Walken is still as good as Gabriel, the whole idea suddenly finds a little. If you haven't seen any of these movies, then you get the first movie and forget about the sequels, they can take off all the fun from the original.
