Surely it blows my mind when someone comes to a movie like this and claims to be one of the worst films out there. That's not one of the worst there, it's still not a good movie, but it's not bad yet. Go to see something like a Death or Blood nurse and then return to me and tell me if you think Night brings Charlie is worse. The film has a good function of camera and editing, which is a way more than I could say with more films not very clear. <br /> <br /> The movie is not suitable for the death of the screen, there is one death where you see his prick stick, but all the other deaths do not. But the lack of sexual abuse on the screen does not mean this is not a slasher film, it's just bad. The movie was scheduled to be very unpopular. The film came at the end of the second round of slasher, so it was certainly a reflection on the traditional elements of the slasher, done with the tongue in a cheek way. For example, after the assassination, Charlie goes to the city's 'welcome' sign and a low score of people. This is something that can only laugh. <br /> <br /> If you become a slasher film, you surely give this film a look. It is quite different from your typical slasher film and possibly two killers, but not to the extent. The comedy of the movie is very good to tell listeners to relax and not take a movie so god get great. You can forget the film, you can remember. I will remember it because I love the name.
