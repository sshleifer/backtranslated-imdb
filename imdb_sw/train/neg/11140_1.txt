I thought I was going to watch a scary film and ended up playing all the way on the film. In a place where man was transformed into gold animals I thought they were playing. Today the computer games have ten better drawings. The low budget, is the correct opinion. I would recommend Wolf (1994) and Jack Nicholson for a good movie of waswolf. It has special effects if they should be (human change for waswolf). Unless you want to have a good laugh I won't welcome you to watch this film. This movie is a joke.
