I feel a little bit of snob when it comes to everything and although the movie's experience is more suitable for explosion than the top game, I can very much reject the film, too. Not all art movies, however, are better than King Kong. I am quite likely to give two stars of Kong, twice this film of haul. <br /> <br /> I think my people are so excited about this because it was similar to the style for what you see in play. For a less familiar image of art, films like playing are 'beautiful art'. This video, however, was useless. It was not any story so it was dependent on the top game. The only ceremony in this film is like a cat will descend from the roof or not. So, good and meaningful discussion, then? No. It's not difficult. It is fair enough: Some settings were interesting, though: Communist Apartments, city city (Petersburg?) and Soviet trams are still being used.
