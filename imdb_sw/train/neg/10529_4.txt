1 looked on 12/6/2009 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Walter Lang): A breach of the attitude from the development perspective, in my opinion, from the piece of Rodgers and Hammerstein. There are good songs and beautiful pictures, from time to time, of the King of Siam and Yul Brynner - but the film does not do a good job of presenting conditions and settings. I can only blame the screenplay and maybe some acting as to why we don't fully understand the behavior and their circumstances. I know it may be a bit too much to ask for music that means to enjoy the music and play, but even this part was not very extinct for me. The basic story is about the English woman who comes to Siam to teach children about European top matters. We see later that the King is truly a great student. There is a protest against the repetition of the new King's wife, played by Rita Moreno (latino as Arabic - come !! !!) and an old partner who causes other problems but there is no real thing added though. Deborah Kerr, as the main character of the female Annie - is the same but not to influence either. The king learns some things because of his presence and then the movie is getting worse as he did. This is a story of animation and songs and play but not a great experience for a real viewer.
