The killings are a film directed by Andrea Bianchi (Ground Ground) and produced by the famous Italian director, Lucio Fulci. Now with this combination of great talent you would think this movie would be the fest of the year. This can't be more from there. Murder falls on his face as one of the most boring films I have seen come from Italian movies. I was struggling to stay awake during the film and I have never had a problem with the Italian fear films. This section was used in Fulci's Nightmare concert. This is not a bad place and raises your prospects for the film as an ax. Unfortuanitly, the next hour of the movie is awesome. The movie goes to a set of awesome films to be movies and there is a lot of character development during all these events but the characters in the movie are lighter and bad did your interest start leaking away. The last 30 minutes of films are not bad but they would be much better. Gore in the movie was exciting and since Fulci spent more scenes of the year in the concert of Nightmare nothing new here. Finally the film left good but still had many answers and continued to fall through the floor. This is not a very good film but in fact the Italian fear of fear (like myself) this movie must have it because it is very rare. Star 4/10
