Leave this film. Even with this film's B movie this movie is awesome. It is also bad in that theme. The main theme is that people who reject the community and have no respect for anything is cool and should accept it. People who treat others with dignity respect. Guncrazy is a movie talking to disenfranchised better than this movie, see instead. <br /> <br /> No ordinary child will do Trent. Government traders do not work as they do in this film etc. Seeing this film lets you identify why authors use the hook-and-heart-of-gold cliche. Mija is a senseless worker, yes, has had a good life. However, he is a very bad person that listeners cannot recognize. There is usually one thing that can be proposed by the film, in this case no. It is an unfortunate movie that insults someone who tries to identify with the main characters. Acting is sufficient for the standards of the B movie and the trend will not give something new or interesting.
