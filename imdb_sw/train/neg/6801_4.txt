First, I will not tell you what I lost this film, and still confused ... <br /> <br /> Rage of the air is like any film I saw when the plane was scheduled. There is certainly one important person in the plane, and the kidnapper wants to take revenge. Unfortunately, some of the methods of preventing criminals have already been used in other movies. Are we really not the fastest people? Even though it is Ice-T (for some reason it makes an experimental pain in ACTING when it doesn't work to put a "c" back in front of the rap) who is honored on the lid, the movie really star is less awesome Kim Oja as an advocate who is' Awesome 'SIGNED by five artists, which usually return to their haunt. For all others, the only person I could recognize was Steve Hytner, better known as Kenny Bania from "Seinfeld". I can't forget to leave my favorite movie movies, while the kidnapper used about POUND PLASTIQUE in order to blow up the door ... IMPORTANT. The plan was not targeted. . It reached a point where I could say something, which I felt stupid, and it would be the second line in the film. <br /> <br /> As for special effects ... The only thing about this movie is that I have lost electricity costs to run my TV with VCR for 100 minutes. And the title - DID of the film takes place on Air. But because of the less stellar displays, the only Rage in the film was that of the viewer. Therefore, if you have enough conditions even take a film, because it is bad. Please answer, do not select this.
