Chris McCormack (Margaux Hemingway) is brutally abused by teacher (Chris Sarandon) of her sister Kathy (Mariel Hemingway). He brings charges but it is completely free. Then Kathy! inappropriate and illicit films. This movie was announced as an important festival involving rape. What is badly written (and in many places) the effectiveness of the act. It should be sympathetic to the victim of rape but it lays a chance in our face. To be completely honest however, the act of Hemingway is very serious in the same sequence that loses any real effect that may have. Experimental events were interesting and predictable. And the movie went too far when the 15-year-old Mariel was raped (with that thanks was not shown). I accept though it has led to a great end when Margaux is looking for guns and draws Sarandon dead. But with weight - having a little girl raped is just a rebellion. <br /> <br /> Acting does not accept. For example, Margaux was not an actor. In fact she was a beautiful woman (and a real example I believe) but her acting is too much for her. Reduces the film. Mariel was the same but this was one of his first films. Sarandon does what he can as an opponent. He was not bad but a terrible script worked against him. I remember hearing that in the back inquiry back this year 1976 other women stood up to rejoice when Sarandon was killed so maybe this works for some people. I discovered this disease, humility and truth. A 1 all the way.
