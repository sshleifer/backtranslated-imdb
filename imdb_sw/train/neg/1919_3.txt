I have read the book several times and this movie is not appropriate as well as it should. I would like to allow this slide, it's after all the movies. However I have serious issues with the movie environment. No one found to mention that this film and the book is based on the actual events that happened in Nebraska. I live in Nebraska. I grew up in a city in which this movie should be based. First, the "little" city spoken as set, is the third largest city in the state. With a population of nearly 50,000 people. Grand Island is the largest city between Lincoln and Denver. Second movie settings are correct. Grand Island is located in the valley of the Platte River. Which is very flat and very few trees. I tried to watch this film, but it distressed me to see my city being treated very well. This was a true event. Most of the city was stopped. In the book they talk about cycling riding from Mormon Island to Fonner Park. I think you can if you don't care about 15 kilometers every way.
