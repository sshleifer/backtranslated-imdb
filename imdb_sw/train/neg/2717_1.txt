Do we need any garbage of narcissistic on the generation of Baby Boomer? In fact, I am Boomer, although at that time "all" "60" were reading Marx, making their drafts cards, and generally expanding the war that destroyed thousands of people; I was still in a grade school. But I remember well, and 9 out of 10 were just morally ignorant, who would believe anything as long as it was destructive. <br /> <br /> This is just another definition of personal importance from children who have not really grown up.
