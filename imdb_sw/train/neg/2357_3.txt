Let this hope be the last dream. This is the image of something good that was bad. Okay, there is still the joy of having, but just in a common sense. Rachel Talalay was there for the time of this franchise, she was in production workers and was even produced. I don't know he was thinking, but this desire comes full of a human video game boy and the appearance of visitors and / or <br /> Tom and Roseanne Arnold! I would like to have a clue what he thought when he wrote / explained this piece of despair. He even tried to disrupt his audience due to the fact that this film was nothing more than a movie of popcorn's more glorious than carrying any resemblance to fear, and the use of ultimate 3D access. What? Not those glasses? And you get their KEEP! It's okay, you just spent $ 9.00 making me rich. Here is 10 cents. Now, don't feel special! Sorry, but for me, it didn't make us feel special. Freddy had another face to lift the face. This was very bad, I think. All the beautiful beauty that came into the "look" to him in the original films have been changed and completely clear, low-depth cosmetics. He looks ... under the burner he should be, and more if he has skin problems. Changing the leading makeup as well as so far in the series is on the same level and changing the leading actor. But wait! They did it, and did it. So I think it doesn't matter. But it was important to me. Freddy hayu again again. He just ... another monster of low taxes like Leprechaun. <br /> <br /> More ... comedy dark than the classic fear of the promise of this series; filled with what you can only believe that the authors thought they were one publisher and clever repartee (sadly, fell to both accounts). So there is nothing to say more than grab popcorn and prepare to laugh, because there was not one time of horror or anxiety in all this film. <br /> <br /> Reduces 3.2 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fienda :.
