Good young people, we know why we look at the film as "invisible Maniac" (see just the lid, man!). T and A everywhere (and much more than T). But ... shouldn't have a story to go with? "Yes," I can hear you say - "this is just the girls who have been naked! Who needs a story?!" I had no problem. But since these people come out of the "invisible person", they need to have a little story of story, you know, to keep your mind right. However, all they can do is how this creation physician creates an invisible serum and, while describing, uses women's naked women to finish killing many young people. And when you see the seemingly angry people going after him, you will be grateful. One star, for T and A, but there is very little violence for fans of the skin, so proceed with caution. <br /> <br /> TIDBIT - yes, it's that Savannah.
