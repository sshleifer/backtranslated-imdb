I have read all the comments on this film. I am a great admirer. So, I read a book that this film was / was created. Film is a false lie and a real deception. Scroll to <br /> <br /> change small details or events for great purposes; it's <br /> <br /> is not a document. But the script changes the effect, answers, <br /> <br /> the actual situation, and changes in the main character. It changes the true relationship between Harrar and the youth of Dalai Lama. From the competition for ignorance to the Tibet woman (which undermines Tibet's culture) for the gift of Harra's music box, Harrar <br /> <br /> heart, everything about the movie this is a lie - except <br /> <br /> for amazing pictures. I understand that shots of <br /> <br /> Potala (palace) were removed out of Tibet. However, <br /> <br /> change the real story about the relationship between two people, <br /> <br /> one of the most important ones for this world, to create <br /> <br /> film star it's sad
