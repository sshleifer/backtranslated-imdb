I was able to get a picture of this with the help of MST3K, and oh boy, even with riffing this movie was very bad. Imagine someone whose ability and camera can be made by a monkey. The most important things (a little bit) came from special effects, which were "similar". Acting in large part was also "OK"; although there was nothing special, it had a much higher quality than other B movies I had seen before. <br /> <br /> Some of this movie is very bad, The camera work often looks like just putting someone on camera on a roller skate and kicking it together. The story (as it may be called so) is full of holes is almost funny, It never never explains why Hell lived in the first place, or the human body needs to survive. Script is well written and discussion dialogue on just a fool of the airplane. The movie period (if there is one) can be quite interesting. <br /> <br /> If you can't find the MST3K version, try this at all costs.
