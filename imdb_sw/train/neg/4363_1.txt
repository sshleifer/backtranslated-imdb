It's hard to find any good in this film. It seems like a producer is required to make a buck without much effort and therefore we are treated with a full display of the Galaxy which is an excuse for the film in history. Police girls seemed very sexy in their small uniforms. The more items of the two cops actions and the lower galaxy would have been the way to go. This would undoubtedly add to the budget so they could decide to fill that position with the wrong return. Mrs Albright looks very sexy and acting her first level. Mrs. Stabs I had heard but I haven't seen on the screen before it also seemed very desirable but apparently lacking basic talents. Apart from Mrs. Albright this is a real trash.
