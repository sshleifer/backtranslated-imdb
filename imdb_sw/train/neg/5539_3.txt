The shirt created by Armand Louque (blandly played by the former actor Dean Jagger in a rare lead role) joins a group of researchers who want to find and destroy the hidden techniques of creating zombies. Armand is in favor of Claire Duval (wanting blonde Dorothy Stone), who uses a lightweight sample to find his colleague Armand Clifford Grayson (Robert Noland who had no hope of wood) to marry her. In anger over the use and rejection of Claire, Armand uses his voodoo skills to take revenge. Exciting sound? Yes, certainly not. At the beginning, the position of Victor Halperin (malware) position enables the story of a non-verbal and non-fiction story that emerges rapidly. And yet, Halperin do not accept any tension, atmosphere and speed for fun cases. More blah's work from the massive cast does not know anything; George Cleveland just as Mr. General of Duval and E. Alyn Warren as irascible Dr.. Trevissant can enhance little things by inviting and relaxing hammy history. The stock of the library's library library, a clear set of interesting action, and the amazing text of the film is very good and also inappropriate. In fact, this weak excuse for the fear of shock is a shock that even the unseen eyes of White Lugosi's star can reduce brain deficiency. Dud.
