Script is so interesting ... this in turn, makes the lines of executives sound bad and unrealistic and not reliable. There is a repetition of the words - "My beautiful daughter of god" and a small variation of that line coming to mind ... and it's just a modern opera dialogue. <br /> <br /> Still, music is WRONG! Plus, the main bluesy "theme" is very bad and quite bad for this. And it feels that it has been widely used because the tool, texture and system of this theme have not changed, even when the emotional state of the environment takes. Later, whenever it appears, it sets as a large cover as a major change from one place to another. <br /> <br /> Corny's music, and it's like the author wrote music for soap or sitcom - a budget of less than 80 of Canadian sitcom at that time - and this makes it feel like we're always on the edge of the throw business. This is a miscast, there is a lot of mixing and it is a real stretch of fact that many of these characters use only one type of NY priority - a narrow Bronx drive. I do not know whether it is a question of the ability of the younger participants to know only one of the NY's priority - or if it is a matter of the ability of the director to identify the sharp damage. <br /> <br /> In the end, it is an amateur script and a leaden line that makes the "movie" all ... blow. When any foundation is unstable and unsatisfactory, it is impossible to build on it without his own mistakes in self-destructive and unfavorable ways.
