In the lower budget history. This movie should be one of the worst. The real ther is a humorous sides for the movie, but in general it was just too bad. I can only understand who the person who could not out run a group of slugs. I mean they should be one of the world's slowest creatures. The only place suitable for this film is close to the attempt of slugs to swallow someone's finger. This was rather exciting.
