At least between these movies and 100 votes or more. Selected for better screens written on the screen? Brenda Blethyn has been chosen for the best actor in the lead role? Selected for the best photo? I always agree with many of Oscar picks, but this movie can be better movie worse than all the time respected by the Academy. Writing and acting were all scary. Blethyn's completeness is one of the worst I have ever seen, and maybe work for a full time. Bad movies, not suitable for a large screen and not suitable for any cable or television station that has ever played, including HBO (where I saw it). I am just thankful I didn't really pay to see one of the most tested movies of all time.
