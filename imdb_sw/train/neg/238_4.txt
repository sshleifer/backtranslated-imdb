Cinderella's story presented to adults who live in dreamland. Romantic is unrealistic, fluttery, lovey dovey, etc. The perfect Cinderella conspiracy to the end with Shahid Kapoor is the only reason for my stars. If you are looking for a romance and misleading romance, this is definitely you are a movie, but for others we are real people of the real world, I would recommend saving your three-hour watch. Wake up people! Four out of five people saw the film and I did not recommend the film. We had plenty of time to photograph things that were not true. Maybe I'm missing something. I can just believe the movie like this can beat the classic like HDDCS!
