Film begins with other pages of pages that takes about five minutes. It provides a basic summary of what is going on. This can be done easily by doing but instead you get a text effect. Once you have been bombed by characters that you learn a little, remember that this is ALL you will learn about them. The program begins to shut down and then fall through the entire movie. Not only does the plans change, but you may even wonder if you are watching the film. I have never played a video game, but you know people who have. From my knowledge if you have played a game or not this movie is not available more. Save your money unless you want to sleep on the movie.
