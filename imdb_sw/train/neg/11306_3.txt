Return (again) in Scotland, Lassie is (again) in the case for her life. Because a faithful dog lies in his master's grave, he must be put to death, according to the law. Then, it is also explained that Lassie did not have a "legal" owner, which is, too, also against the old Scottish law. If, after three days, no owner is present, the dog must be destroyed. Edmund Gwenn (as John Traill) asks Lassie's case, which leads to long-term adoption, showing the adoption of Lassie and Donald Crisp (like John "Jock" Gray). Although it depends on an interesting, original story ("Greyfriars Bobby"), "Lassie's challenge" repeats several previous Lassie cases; and, it does not improve on them. By comparison, this is surprising and incompatible; and, is to follow the thickness of "Sun coming" (1949) *******. Geraldine Brooks (like Susan Brown) and several other artists can be charming, but they can't lift this. Little Jimmy Hawkins (from "It's a wonderful life") is among the most popular supporters of Lassie; later, he will marry "Dark Shadows" "lighting" Angelique "(Lara Parker).
