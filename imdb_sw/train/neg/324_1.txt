The worst mistake of my life. I chose this film on Target for 5 dollars because I thought, "Hey, it's Sandler I can get some laughs at cheap". I was wrong, not exactly right. The middle path of all the film my three friends were asleep and I was still in trouble. The worst secrets, the worst script, the worst movie I saw. I wanted to hit my head against the wall for an hour, then I would stand up, and you know why? Because they felt good. After blowing my head in i stuck the damn film in microwave and looking at it burning .... and that I felt better than anything I did. It took American Psycho, the Dark Army, and killed Bill just to get on the crap. I hate SANDLER to effectively go this way and destroy the whole day of my life !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
