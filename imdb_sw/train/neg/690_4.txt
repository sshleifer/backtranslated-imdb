If you have ever seen a slasher of eight years, there is no great reason to see this. The fact is often not one of the power of slasher movies, and it is something that this film has been very low. There's really not much that could say about Pranks, so I'll do it quickly. The film was one of 74 films linked to the DPP Video Nasty list, and that's the only reason I see it. The plot follows a group of children who sit back in the dorm at Christmas time. When they were on the slasher, someone decided to start taking them and this leads to one of the secrets of the dullest found on the slasher film. The fact that this film was on the Video Notes list is amazing because, despite a few film events, this film will not undermine or despise anyone, and gorier sounds than this (Friday 13th, for example) The last ban. But again, there are banned films that are no longer available than this (the wizard who came from the Sea, for example). However, the conclusion of the cinema is the best thing about it, as though the audience could not have a little worry which the striker is at this point; it's rather made well. In general, this is a dreary and sad sreher which even a few fans will do well.
