The only reason I have looked at this is because I have seen it in my local library (and will break them in anger because I have lost public money on it), and despite the plethora of tits and ass, it did not take long to realize that the fast-forward button was my friend . The horrible orientation, the function of the camera of the feet, the adverse adverse-pass-pass, the effects of chintzy, and optimal screenplays the worst I was angry to see brought to life (as it was, very bad and damaged) in the long run, time long. The best laughs actually happens in the "Making of ..." feature, which the poor wounds involved in this HDV aggressive attempt to justify their attempts to lose if they had worked on something special, rather than something that would not be completely forgotten next week. Wait! Except for the fact that somehow someone liked Tippi "Birds" Hedren, of all the people, doing a little part, with Kane "Friday 13th" Hodder! How this happened, I will never know, and be honest, I don't care. Look at your own risk, and do not say that you have not warned. This is the choice of films on its voluntary, very ambitious. It gets only 2 from me for having beautiful women's naked, and yet, just barely.
