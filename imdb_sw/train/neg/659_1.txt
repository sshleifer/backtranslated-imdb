This movie is a good example of the lack of good writers and directors in Hollywood. The fact that people were paid to make this piece of junk shows that there is a lack of ideas and original talents in the entertainment business. The idea that the audience was paid to see this film (and if the idiot I created the film) also breaks the heart. The teacher looked at (3 years before) kills the young family because she wants him. For any reason he kills mother, father and brother. From the first five minutes you see a bad act and direction. Many years later, the teacher who appears is in prison. HMM - typically write bad - nobody in the city he threatened knows until the last minute. The thoughtful teacher emerges as a Navy prince and can spread around, beat people with a knife and a great killer. Indeed !!! Now an angry teacher kills a slave girl without reason, a bellhop knifes for fun, and starts hunting young friends. Now there is a perfect way to find a girl to love you. The thoughtful teacher leaves out of the hotel â€” again ignorant, the eternal soldiers would know his face - but it might go to them the same. Now he kills two soldiers outside the boy's house and somehow gets into his bedroom and kills his girlfriend. It is nothing positive about this waste. If another profession will provide the quality of this low quality, they will be excluded. However, these make thousands of dollars by writing and leading this waste.
