Nothing like watching great robots make war on desert desert, and Robot Wars does not give. Indeed, acting is lousy, the conversation is small, and the characters are one-dimensional, but it has great robots! Special effects themselves are really good for that period. Of course it is not like today's color, but has a low level of computer graphics and instead uses miniatures, so it has a good old age. Its shortcomings are easily ignored due to short-term films, and have a certain-in-cheek humor language in the most enjoyable places. I would recommend this for any fan of big robots or cheesy sci-fi who wants the hour of heart loss.
