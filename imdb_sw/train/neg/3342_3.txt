I did not have too many expectations from the film directed by Sidney J. Furie and star Dolph Lundgren but in fact I had much more expectations. One-user-user view - a standard 2 standard rate - didn't seem too low for me to Lundgren film. On the other hand, I had no trouble watching this film if its standard was less than 5.0 but hey, the film had 5.9 out of 10, which seemed to be very good to me for this kind of production. Now I understand that 37.5% of the people who scored this 10 film (best) was clearly stunt because DETENTION is a regular search Image Nu has seen, from time to time. Lundgren does not persuade the former military to turn a teacher of history given a bad school. His work is just awesome, senseless and unfolding. Lundgren's ability to act becomes more apparent in events and emerging infants. Others are good actors or, compared to Lundgren, seem like chief executives - just because they seem natural and trustworthy. <br /> <br /> DETENTION has things that can be interesting to this low budget movie - closed for a week-high-security high school, four young people bound by an old war instructor and a group of criminals. guilt attempts to enter - but the story (something like BREAKFAST CLUB meets with HARD, or is a PANIC ROOM?) is full of unreliable situations, many images and characters. And let's not forget Dolph Lundgren is a great actor. Alex Karzis and Ward Dob√≥ plays a couple of Bonnie and Clyde with love and offer the most popular films of the film, even if they seem to be less-than-budget version of Sam Rockwell and him, Milla Jovovich wants to be. In a film where everything fails, their laziness and style are given fresh air enough to prevent my interest from leaving less than zero.
