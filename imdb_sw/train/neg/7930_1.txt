This piece can be acknowledged 60 years ago, but it is one of the many tribal movies that have been done by Indians of the Americans beaten by white people. The Republic of Justice James Stewart was a great racist in real life, like his close friend John Wayne. In 1971 Stewart had an actor Hal Williams was expelled from "Jimmy Stewart Show" (a short-term series for sympathy) because Williams was black. If that was not bad, this film is very dated and stirring. See "Dance and Wolves" instead of a limited view of racism. Stewart was in forty years when this bad movie was made, and even with his stupid wig he was still seen as a son of pedophile after 16 years -old Debra Paget. I wonder even allowed. 0 /.
