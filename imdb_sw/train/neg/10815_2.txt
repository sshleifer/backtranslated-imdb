I love the book, "Jane Eyre" and I have seen many versions of it. They all have their strength and error. However, this was one of the worst I saw. I didn't care about Jane or Mr. Rochester. Charlotte Gainsbourg (Jane) was about to tolerate and certainly was visible to the open, but she had no feeling in any of her lines. I couldn't imagine what Mr. Rochester saw. It brings us to Mr. Rochester. William Hurt had a little feeling than Jane, if that was possible. How two unwise people may fall in love is a mystery, but certainly did not mind me. Perhaps the director (Zeffrelli) fell asleep during production. Timothy Dalton (also good for Mr. Rochester!) The most reliable version of the book, but Ciaran Hinds has perfect Rochester in A / E version of 1997 (which is not true for the book). Try to find something positive about this movie: Geraldine Chaplain was perfect in his role.
