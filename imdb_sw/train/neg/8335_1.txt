Pakage means Warren Beatty and Goldie Hawn remove the big bank robbery, but that's not what I got! I found nothing! In the first half there is a new character (without introduction) in each other area. The first half of the hour is quite incomprehensible, others are only one long, irritating, they have removed the area. There is always an irritating sound behind it looking for a loud voice, siren of blaring, train blows, or even a bad score of Quincy Jones. There are many places that are bad, too. Like, bad people drive Beatty into thin ice and CAR! Or, the police arrive in the area about fifteen times. I hated this movie completely!
