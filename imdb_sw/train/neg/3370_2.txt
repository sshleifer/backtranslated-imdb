Just a dumb movie. Stanwyck's first wife gets his foot in a dumb way, and then her husband gets his foot in a non-dumb way. In an effort to save him, Stanwyck gets unlucky, again, and comes guilty of running. He has a chance to kill him but he fails in a very silly way. Finally her husband is saved, and Stanwyck tells us through the details that the dumb's message is. They are all better than the dumb end. I can never know how a woman who does not like Stanwyck did so as a leading lady in the Golden Era of the Hollywood color; that nose is very good? So photogenic ?? The film is gentle, it takes less time than an hour. It is as the director saw that he was doing damage, so he thought it well to keep short.
