The comparison is perhaps the right, but it is inevitable. Those interested in intimacy and intimacy of Umbrellas will be afraid of discovering cutting-and-put music in American style - awkward, interviewed by a number of song and song. The French model of Gene Kelly was very poor, that the bad work of dubbing was altered (if you remember, the dubbing was completely cut off in Umbrellas). French translation (for lower versions), also, refuses what is needed, although this cannot be attributed to Demy. The film also has several moments of self-awareness that come from us, as well as recorded in LeGrand's own songs. And dress - well, tight pants / white shoe mix, and freakishly irregular colors, reminds one of Austin's powerful film. . But Demy enjoys the viewer for Umbrella tips; remember, for example, a suit shipped by Maxence in his departure from Rochefort - this is the suit laid by Guy when he left Cherbourg. Also, see "Brunette's Convenience Solution" - Madeleine in Umbrellas, and Josette in Young Girls. In general, those who expect to feel the nature of Umbrellas (secure cycling surroundings), or to find more detailed questions and end up as severely as in Umbrella lesson, should probably adopt this b. Those who are looking for the French version of the thin 60s of American music will be very happy.
