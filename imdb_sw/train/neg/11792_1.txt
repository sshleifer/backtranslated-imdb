This should be a cheap film made in the 21st century. It is the lowest way, but the end falls down ... everything. All the cheapest tricks - like flashing and dark - are used to hide these computer effects of crappy. <br /> <br /> All characters are below average, especially the main character Anne Fletcher (Simmone Mackinnon). There is a place, where Anne is asked: "Why do you seem to be uncomfortable?" The correct answer is, because it can not act. No matter what happens (the world is about to be destroyed, his friend is dying, he is expelled), who has a stupid fool like his face. <br /> <br /> Not just a movie, which is B-horizontal. It is also a description of the back cover (at least in Finland). The text speaks of things like Lorica Gray -vessel, Capital Capital and the main character Garrison Harper and Anna (not Anne) Fletcher. The description looks like a different film, all of them characterized by Fletcher and sea monsters
