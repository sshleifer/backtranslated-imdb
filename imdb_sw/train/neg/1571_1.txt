Watching this film makes me think constantly; Why do they do such a problem out of broken pieces? There is a million choice to slow down the car! At the authors of the authors a few ideas of the reason why the car cannot stop ... <br /> <br /> There are many good things to say about this film; All the common stories of cliche make their appearance, the participants are very bad, the story is like skulls such as shaving etc. That makes this movie a waste of time and money. <br /> <br />
