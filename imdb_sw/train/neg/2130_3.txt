I think I'm coming late for the party. I saw this version of Bye Bye Birdy of 1995 on Sky Sky. I didn't know it was there and was ready to prepare the 1963 film version when I cut it down. Played with Albert long ago and I think putting a homemade to show because I remembered it was very fun to do. I was not impressed with this new version. It was not enough fun. It was not color. It was not fun for young people. The lights were bad. No one found to mention this fact. This is not a lot of music, it is bright and beaten. The lighting decision was a bad choice of creativity. Bye Bye Birdy is farce, comedy of error. I don't mean that in this version. The lights were bad and dropped the general exhibition. Dance numbers were also seen as blood. We have music videos today. At least the number of drums should be tested up to some of the best of those, or how about the best of Broadway. The painter was lying on the wheel was seen. Though all participants were talented, there was a good choice of throwing. Vanessa Williams is not Latin, and for many talented Latin singers out there, it would not be more appropriate to give them one of them in the role of Rosie. Vanessa is Africa's Africa, beautiful and talented, but giving wrong. Alexander Alexander Alexander's efforts was remarkable, he always does a mental job, but he's not just Albert. She was misled and I think that's obvious to many people who see this version. The film is not between action. There is a need to translate from one to the other. Enjoying the size of stage music must be released on the film. There is no merit to be faithful to the script of action when locked. Spirit, the essence of production should be kept. For me, 1963 Bye Bye Birdy production was bright and beautiful, while 1995 production was as much as lighting as well as a number of drums. It was a bad waste of effort by many talented people.
