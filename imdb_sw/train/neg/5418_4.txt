This movie is like S.E. material. Hinton was writing in the 1970s and Copola was changing the screen during the 80's, and, indeed, Trueblood has been a product of either, the results can be better (especially in the acting department). Instead, we find the worst-funny-piece of mediocrity. Jeff Fahey plays Ray Trueblood, who was a refugee on the street, I think is the correct explanation. This was in the days of practical movies that used young people in the 40s and mid-30s to wear a greaser fiber or some of the most efficient batch of the group and fought with 80s of lousy music. Ray, however, is the guardian of his younger brother, Donny (Chad Lowe in a place where he screams very loudly), who is forced to leave the wrong way at the train station while, fleeing from the fighters, bound and forced to serve at a time in the water. The front level of presenting with Ray has gone to the city and sought his brother who has also been part of the road gangs, although in the group that was the enemy Ray and now the old symbols should be interrupted (and again, the fighters should be dodged and this time , the respect of the woman advocated in the opinion of the action film before Ray could continue with normal life with his brother, Donny. For the most part, the film is very ridiculous. For me, a lot of these relate to a lot of confusion, though not to Fahey or Sherlyn Fenn who plays waitress to be friends. The boys in the group and Lowe themselves seem to make a small amount of scarcity of scarcity like New York's difficulty. Although, the great hanging is the foot of the recycled foot and perhaps the type of film that had been reviewed as the head of 1989.
