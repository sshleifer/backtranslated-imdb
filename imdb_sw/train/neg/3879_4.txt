Rebar is a astronaut who is going to the first mission of world space for Saturn, but in fact this is that the horrible things of the movie are getting worse and he returns to the world as the only one. He faces a strange situation that leads to a decline and lose his mind unless he regularly uses human body, kills what is seen as the only nurse in the hospital and runs to the neighboring city to kill more victims. I liked the columns and the effects of the monster and the danger are really good, but the events of the space are being thrown out of NASA's stock and hospital it looks amazing as a warehouse. The script is very weak, the development of small behavior and poor practice generally makes this continue to increase on anything except a very flick with the authenticity of having a living light as a killer, and more or less it has its impact on interest. Over 1 out of 10, strictly for most fans of the movie squad die.
