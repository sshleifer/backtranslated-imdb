I don't understand all of these good user directions. This movie is a very bad movie I have seen and I don't want to be disappointed. <br /> <br /> Eva Mendez is hot but it's bad in this film. But I don't think it's his fault but directors. Somehow he was able to do everything to look fake; their acting, idea, decision, everything. The stars that I fear are just the idea behind the film, which was very bad. Don't look at this, see Fellini, Woody Allen or some David Lynch.
