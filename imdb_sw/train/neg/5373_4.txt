This is a typical example of the growing problem of film. Why is the sounds of nature and the sound of the voice more than the talk? What? What does it do? This movie is not unique. Many movies seem to do right now. For 2 years, I wondered if it was just something wrong with my TV, but then I've got a new TV and there it again. The sound of the voice that may be blocked the city block behind the actors activates the conversation. It was more exciting in this film because, in the English version however, the woman always includes. I continued to expect Jean Reno to say "Forgive me, you could say or get marble from your mouth." If you look at a DVD and have a secondary French, I recommend the French version and headlines. I have given 4 because Reno was very good Leon. People say about the environment, but I saw it on TV and sat in Rockies for a few years, so "Enh".
