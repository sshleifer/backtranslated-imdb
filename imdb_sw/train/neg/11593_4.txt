I think this film is one of the worst in the series of Nightmare. It was so boring that I couldn't remember something after 20 minutes after the film, and even bothered me to write a review. Well, # 4 was a joke with Freddy was a joker. # 5 tried to return to the root of the series. It was black and more sky than 4 dreams, which is a good thing, basically. They tried to beat the awesome movie instead of comedy. Unfortunately they forgot to add forgiveness and horror. Because of the 5th dream: The baby's dream is not funny or afraid. What we find is a boring movie and casual worst actors (maybe except Lisa Wilcox). Plot (Freddy to kill Lisa's friends using a baby's birthday Lisa) has a good base but not enough for 90 minutes of film. Sometimes the story is very misleading (perhaps because there is nothing) and you can't stop wondering what filmmakers were targeting. Screenplay should be more hollow than Swiss Cheese and the film was very fun (I would say that I don't like cheese though, even though I am from Switzerland). Even the special effects were as good as for example in Section 4. Do not take the rent / purchase of this film if it is not in full, it is quite a mess. My rating: 4/10 (use it, # 6 is also worse ...)
