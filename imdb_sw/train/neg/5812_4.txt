"This story is dedicated to women," according to the introduction, "who have been fighting for their rights since Adam and Eve began to form the leaf of freedom." When "Politics" took place, the nineteenth Amendment, assuring women the right to vote, was only ten years. And, the film deals with the use of political power and women as a polling group. Defending the prohibition, and fast closure, was an important thing for women at that time. Good-nature Marie Dressler (like Hattie Burns) is working politically, after a young woman is shot and killed from the speakeasy. He wants to sell alcoholic beverages; and, it is written as the Mayor's race, after giving a powerful speech at a women's meeting. Mrs Dressler is shared with her tenants, best friend Polly Moran (like Ivy Higgins) and her southern husband Roscoe Ates (like Peter Higgins). Runler's run to the mayor of Lake City draws resistance from men in the city; so, Dressler instructs women to go on strike, refusing, "everything" in the "room, bedroom, and shower." <br /> <br /> Movies look better than described. Humor, in fact, is not very good; and, it shows unwanted and bad conditions ("You look like Madame Queen" refers to Amos and Andy's behavior). And, the combination of bullets and slapstick is not available well, this time. Manufacturers could focus on making the film more rapidly, considering only the dressler and characters playing with William Bakewell (like Benny Emerson) and Karen Morley (like Myrtle Burns). **** Politics (7 / 25/31) Charles Reisner ~ Marie Dressler, Polly Moran, Roscoe Ates
