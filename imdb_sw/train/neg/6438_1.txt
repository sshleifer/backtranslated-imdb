I did not know what this film was when I walked in the theater to see it (thought about Satan and so on etc.) as tractors in the last film I saw seemed very interesting. <br /> <br /> O lover, Catholic mythology? It's not my fearful and honest idea, I just felt like watching a pretty, awesome movie, not a non-emerging religious party that tries to beat the cheapest for having a certain chick getting blood every few minutes! <br /> <br> I will try to eliminate the perpetrators! I mean, he hangs out with the lost people, does things to lose, does like rebels and al, and here shows the wounds of Jesus Christ? Come! The head of his crucifixion head, the back head, shouting, blood everywhere, became very bad after seeing several times. It was not horrible or horrible, just disgusting. It did, however, be very painful to watch - those flicking events were sad ... <br /> <br /> EXAMPLE: If your Catholic, defintly does not see this. If not, you still don't see.
