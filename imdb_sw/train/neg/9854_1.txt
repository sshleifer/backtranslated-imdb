This document (or I must say mockumentary) is a good example of how ignorant people can be, when they have a strong desire for something like that. In fact, I hate Cryptozoology. It's bold, it's just destroying. However, the good thing in this was the result of seeing (dragons were good), but some information in this mockumentary was quite fake, and that's really discouraging because it was coming from scientists, so that's why it suits 1 of 10 and not 0. Example of false information will be the idea of ​​hydrogen: It is true that, according to Chemystry, hydrogen is produced in the stomach but it is impossible to be done in the same amount, so in this case, you need a good definition of what is happening in the stomach dragon. There are many odors of water in nature but it is not necessary for animal sounds such as flying, and hydrogen is not visible to nothing, so it is impossible. However, there is something worse, the idea of ​​platinum: This feature is harder to get more than gold, and I can express myself how dragons live according to that. It is uncomfortable, they present dragons as creatures with little chance to conquer this world, but of course at least to explain why they have died. Perhaps the so-called crystals are scientists, but not. People like them say lies like this in this decision, and it's worse, some people give it. But I don't think that someone who cares about Science will believe in dragons after watching this. These artificial scientists lose their time.
