I had great hope for this film, although it had a bad review on the paper. I was very patient, and sat on the whole film. I felt sick at the end. Though I am not too small or too sensitive to inappropriate movies - I have enjoyed 'Woody Allen's' All That You Want To Know About Sex, ... 'and Michael Hanneke' Funny Games' - I have seen a deficit of ten-year-old directors who want to drink women's milk to be completely ill. And when the film was finished in the "orgy" where the boy drank his mother's milk, and also the woman who had been fond of the whole film, I was vomiting and hating with a misleading and interesting paper that it was. Do not make a mistake, I enjoy great European movies, with independent films, so this flick should be very fun. Avoid this film at all costs, should be transferred to History history as a lesson on bad movies.
