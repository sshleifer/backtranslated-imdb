This is the worst movie I saw. Let me say again: This has been what has been been seen. It had all the bad earmarks of the bad movie: the continuous error, the bad writing, the bad act, the bad production, the bad music. I thought there were several points for awesome movies. The first is that they have to worry enough to frighten them. This movie gets with F in this field. The second step is that when the character falls, or something bad happens to them, we should care. This movie gets F in this regard too. The first story, a woman gets a bullet and a wolf after the fear that this will happen to her. The next story, the OCD boy dies from lack of attention and talking to his dead friend. Oh, and then there is a horrible story, of the nail to sleep with him. Come, can you take the most interesting and unusual subject than being alone at home, having an original consideration, and sleeping with him? It alters all of these stories that are used, the real reality from the Doctor who also uses himself. Wow, stupid. I would like to describe something, I am happy to watch horrible movies and laugh in bad situations. I couldn't do it for this. It was a great pain to sit and watch. Don't look at this film under any circumstances. You will grieve.
