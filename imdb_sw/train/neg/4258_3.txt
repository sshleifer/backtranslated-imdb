I would like to give this film 5 instead of 3 if it was at least at a time ... I saw it the first time what you could expect from a job that is not based on the artistic ability of directors but on morals or I would like to mention the worldly practices of our government ( Kazakhstan ... It is a shame, because 'Qazaqfil'' was releasing a good film when it was disrespected by the name of Shaken Aimanov, but it was really running with him. Style like 'Konec Atamana', 'Kyz Zhibek' or even 'Aldar Kose'. But after the death of Mr Aimanov the production of the best movies declined dramatically for 10 years when there were very few films produced. However, at the end of the 1980s, 'Assa' was shot, it was a film about the first criminal groups in the country, one year later Mr. Rashid Nugmanov filmed another film with the cooperation of one of the actress V.Tsoy, at the time. was already a reporter of the Soviet / Russian rock, - a movie called 'Igla' (The Needle or something) was quite new, a man called that period as a revival or wave of a new Kazakh. Unfortunately today we do not have high-quality movies, our directors are filming on French and Japanese support, and so movies are not available to the public but for professional experts, some of them get prices on international filmmakers, but there are very few of them become commercially business ... And again repeat our 'journals'. The movies are proposed because of many things. The effects were with 'Sibirski Cyrilnik' of Nikita Mikrikov about Russian tsars, which were also presented to groups and foreign partners, I think were French or perhaps Britain. Nobdy liked it, even for the Russian public to be the main theme of partners and comedy shows as 'KVN'. IMHO
