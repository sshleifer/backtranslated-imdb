"The little man", now on DVD, is the Wayans Brothers flop. It is a small story than a midget crime crime played by Marlon Wayans, who hides diamonds in a woman's bag after a salary. She and her boyfriend Tracy Morgan cooked an innovative plan to hide Marlon as a child and give birth to a woman's home. Then it goes through all sorts of "Home alone" or "Baby to play" as mayhem to get the stone back and treated as a child. I was amazed at how humor it was down in this film. Jokes occur in other places often, that is not cute or funny. I almost think the movie could be funnier if they didn't use CGI and used a little actress whose Marlon's face was pasted over. In watching the deleted scenes (minus CGI) this actor was funny in Mini-me as a way, but chose a different way. A few descendants and Tracy Morgan make some amazing screens .... Love your $ 30 rental fee at Borat if you want some really laughing today. <br /> <br /> http://mcmusicnotes.blogspot.com
