Six different couples. Different stories of six love. Different secrets of love. Number of eight viewers in cinema movies. Take a look at the eight parts of different screens. <br /> <br /> I sat somewhere in the middle of the screen to find out what's going on in the film. All stories have no link with each other, but somewhere under the line Nikhil Advani tries to show the relationship between them. I tried to find a few lines that I could write as corrections but at the end of 3 hours 15 minutes she didn't get anything to write. Film is a poor copy of Hollywood blockbuster LOVE HERE. <br /> <br /> My comment. Don't watch the film if you want to watch a good film.
