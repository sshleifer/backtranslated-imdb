Sometimes when you are at a party and someone asks, "Another day I heard the words" Love of the Author. "Does anyone know what it means?" Ask them to stay 'King over Water'. Diaz's only way to live on this film was through this device used by bad writers. There are some comic pictures and you will have a few few. However the film does not stand up with a little more logical analysis. Why did Keitel put Diaz's hand in front of her rather than back? Why so can make flat chainsaw course. For me the most beautiful part of this film is that I saw it in the cable station instead of using four corners on a video store.
