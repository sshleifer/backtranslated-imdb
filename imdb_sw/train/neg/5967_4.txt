Imagine, it costs a total of $ 250,000 to make "Authors". How hell did $ 45 million to make this video of the glory of music? Casting is unknown, two or three sets, no special effects that I could see ... I know, it must be used on a full-screened, economical, and turbulent screen. Shoot, the bar is installed must contain the cost of the passage. However, I think Jerry Bruckheimer can't be buried dead by producing anything to the bottom. I just wonder you didn't hit anything. <br /> <br /> However, it wasn't a bad film I guess. The woman seems to have a good chemistry and the sound of the voice was the same. IMO It seems only a pity that this proposed political project could be made for 5 million dollars without any loss of production, and more than 6 million 5 million indy of indian films can be made too.
