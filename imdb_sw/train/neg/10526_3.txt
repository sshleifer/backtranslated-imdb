Skeptical-school-school girls, who resemble a prison movie. Chris (Linda Blair) has run away after fleeing his bad father. Once in prison, he is in prison raped by his "fellow" colleagues. Over the top (even for 98 minutes), and the uncertain end that makes the whole film look useless. <Br /> <br /> 15-year-old Linda Blair does his best to avoid showing his body when he is bound, but lets you shoot at the bottle during the shower area. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 out of *** *
