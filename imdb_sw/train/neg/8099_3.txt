This was a good book and the possibility of a good film really was definitely there. But the decision to throw was completely broken. Hanks is a good actor to be sure, but they do not have the moral qualities required for the lead role. Jeff Daniels would have been my choice. Keeping Melanie Griffith inside, because of eye eye, it is understandable, but again, it doesn't show depth or ambivalence, so you need to pull this. <Br /> <br /> This movie is a good example of how each decision, even the first in the production of the film can make or break a file.
