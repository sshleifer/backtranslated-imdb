This movie is similar to Falls Falls, and The Boogeyman (2005) but is also more graphic than both, and not as good as either.it also slow and surely predict.it also got the shades of Deliverance and Amityville Horror.plus, we get a taste of a new age of cast into a mixture and some of these events come out as exciting / interesting sermons, this movie is hodgepodge of almost everything. Even though it is gory, the effects of preparation are not true to look. in fact they are looking at cost-effective from everything, there are some real-time chat talks and I can't say when, but there is a point where small behavioral behaviors are not trusted or credible, based on the environment. no one in their right mind can do this in this way. You will watch the film, you will know what I mean. it is also an improper weakness for the illusion of the reason. The good news is that Acting was very good.better than this movie deserves s.so, after carefully testing the evidence, id says that this film can be approved, but not good.my judgment for Fairy Tooth: 4/10
