This is not the fault of Michael Madsen, he had no trouble in it. This movie was very bad. If you want to laugh and get tired, continue and watch this film. Words cannot describe how idiotic is. Sorry Michael. The movie was black. All other artists are not known. When looking at it, it feels like a soft picture, but without pastoral or strong scenes. The film had a gender disorder, as it refers to the lowest S&M actress was wrong, except parts of Michael Madsen. He seemed like he wanted to laugh. I hope you earn well for this lousy movie. It's something that I am not proud of. Not even B's cable, it's more than F and should not be displayed, forever.
