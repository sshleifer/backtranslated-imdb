The Good Land is probably the most interesting film I have seen in my life. The plan is slow and non-existent. Acting is a combination of boundaries. When I love Paul Muni, I can now say I have seen a film that does not make its real power right. The only grace to save I got with this film is worth the production. The use of hundreds of more in all films creates a reliable and attractive environment. Also, the positive effects used to create the illusion of millions of wasps sell easily and were a revolution at that time. Other than the production value I can say a little bit of which is good or entertaining about this film.
