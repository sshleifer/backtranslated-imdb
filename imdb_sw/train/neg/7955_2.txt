Carrie Fisher has said more than one incident that made this film during her life when she had a serious cocaine problem, and did not remember much. That will explain why he made this film, but it does not explain why anyone else has been beaten or staff; I can't believe that everyone had a coke problem. This should be one of the worst films made, and that says something. Lawa can not put under the feet of "director" Tim Kincaid or "author" Buddy Giovinazzo, for it is evident that this picture was not written or directed by anyone. Apparently they are just one, because there is little evidence of cooperation, cooperation, design, conspiracy, mind, mind or anything else. What is amazing is that there were true experts who were involved in this shell. Star star Robert Joy has done a good job in other films, and Jimmie Haskell and filmmaker Arthur Marks are former industry officials, also being a director, and not bad. Why they participated in this bunch of crash for destruction is more than a consciousness. Tim Kincaid, "the director" says, has done several low and terrifying films, and, after seeing many of them, I can tell you that it is not one of the best. This, however, is far from the worst thing he has done, and that's the great thing to achieve. Everything, absolutely for everything, about this movie is the 12th level - the best. The movie is awesome, acting is laughable, "special effects" makes "Layout 9 From Outdoor" looks like "Spider-Man", the story is trite, derivative and stupid. Don't waste your time even looking at the video box cover, don't let the lease. Full, complete, angry, general dud.
