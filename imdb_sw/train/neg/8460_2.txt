I lost this movie just because of William Davoe's promises, by Robert Rodriguez. I thought that after seeing the RR's name on the lid (as an actress) that this film would be good. It looks like a film that Rodriguez would do if he went to lend in his name, than it was right? WRONG WRONG WRONG. For worse editing since "Manos Hands of Destiny". The modified route has no sense and has made the film impossible to follow and after the first 30 minutes you might even want to try again. I don't know how David and Rodriguez were involved in this film, maybe someone else, but it's a good way to do it. Besides they were just in this film for a minute and Rodriguez did not even talk. So if you want to see the film with bad editing, the worst acting, and the story of confusion than being my guest but don't say you didn't warn.
