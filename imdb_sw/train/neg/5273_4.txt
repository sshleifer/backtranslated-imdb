*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** When I saw the preview for this movie I thought it would inileast the storyline little admirable. But if most of the original natural films are left to be left. This lost family is now running through this "abandoned" city to break and get this video camera showing people to do everything their clue and see that it eventually disappears, the family goes through these amazing stages and never found or shows what the load is . They are more limitations than I could count and do not tell you anything that happens or how. It is the end where the family gets a car accident and gets a posest or a brain or something (which has never been told). Another thing you know you expect to somehow find out how it all happened but stops you from completely confusing.
