I watched this film alone, in the dark, and it was a full moon! I did not do this for the purpose, it just happened this way. So everything was there for this horrible hell film out of me! Indeed, it was not, I really wanted to install a DVD window after only 8 minutes, but I thought coming to give an opportunity, unfortunately I did. Acting was very bad, only one and a good acting was Samaire Armstrong. The plan is not original, if you are a fan of fear then it is just the same thing you have seen many times before. Other events were not quite meaningful, and you feel that the director wanted to make the film again! Monster was a great disappointment of the movie. The most spectacular showings are as they are of a terrible movie from the 80's when it didn't have enough technology, but some good movies were made at that time! I was surprised to see the name of a large production company at the beginning of the film, I thought they could not put money in this and make it well? !! I could not agree more with the testing which the movie has found, it is also my rating, 3 out of 10.
