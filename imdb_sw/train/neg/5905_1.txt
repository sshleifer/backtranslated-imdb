they don't see this. this was one of the most movies I saw. it's hard to be Mormon sometimes when there are movies like this out there. it is a sad view of the life of Mormon. I can tell you if you saw this movie not all like this in a special district. if I didn't think I would do it. it is so bad that many Mormon movies are made by a group of people who have nothing to do. Acting was so bad that my wife and I could hardly do it. I think you could say that it had all the signs of the movie B. or there are C movies? however ... I just thought this movie was facing was full of cheese. I would like some of the Mormons will begin to make a high-quality film.
