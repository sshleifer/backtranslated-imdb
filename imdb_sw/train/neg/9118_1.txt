This is absolutely true, the worst movie that I have looked at in my life. It may be the worst film possible. Some movies are so bad that they are good; This movie is so bad that it goes to a fun campaign and it becomes very bad. It is anti-enantiodromia. We bought it with the intention of escaping, and my whole family gathered in the evening of the cheerful talk of cunning; instead, we sat quietly, walking down the poor Peter Sellers. This is worse than the beautiful Lord of the Rings. It's worse than the Matrix sequels. It's worse than Krull. It's worse than any movie of Batman. <br /> <br /> Isn't it in any case, letting this film in ten feet of your television.
