I am a fan of the Harlow of Jean, because he had the quality of the stars. I don't think her movies are good and I don't even think she is a good actor, but certainly she was the greatest in comedies. Everything of the comedy in the Girl from Missouri is very good. But this film is probably like a love story. Jean Harlow is amazing in this one and you can forget all others - their performances did not bring something new. It always encourages them to think that Harlow's body was a sick woman. Well, in this movie he looks beautiful.
