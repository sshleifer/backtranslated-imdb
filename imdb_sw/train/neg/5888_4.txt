I saw recently on the old VHS tape, and remember it dimly. Watching now, looks charming. When it was first released, it was recognized by every good man as a spoof of coming out as a gay boy. In order to hammer home, the mother appears to read a copy of "1 Teenager In 10", a so-called book of the time. David Warner eliminates as a vampire's oppressor [= pastor-hostile evangelist], who is actually a bedroom case of self-interest. A list of visual and jokes that are included in order to ensure that no one missed the point will be too much to interfere. Manufacturers were happy with nature, and with hope, of course, open it and shine. But I don't know how young viewers will watch this film, today. In other areas, where there is education and culture, the traumatic torture that young gay men had to go through is an old thing. But I am sure there is a lot of dark corners, which is as bad as it was.
