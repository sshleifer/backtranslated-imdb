I paid this movie from the library I think it might be interesting. What? Nikosea! It is a very bad movie that I write something about it. Mira Sorvino is very bad in the film, it is very painful to watch the area with him. She is a beautiful girl, but in this movie, She does not like it yet, but I will need to witness her extraordinary attempt next to all other great characters. It is folly. And the film discussion is engaging, and they have no interesting facts that make it acceptable. <br /> <br /> Failure completely.
