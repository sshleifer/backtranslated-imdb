!!!!! FOR PEOPLE OF SPOILERS SERVICES !!!!! I am sure that this project has started as a workshop to write screens on avoiding clichés in awesome movies: Female protagonist - Look at the bad things happening to drug addicts - See Heorine finds out the villain - See Heroine does not know a shortage of loss - See Frame sequence so we see the villain have been made behind the heroine - See Unfortunately the man has sent this list to cliché on the film studio instead of using it for class. Dear oh dear as only London transport was regularly as a clichés turn here. In fact there are many clichés and all the appearance before that time that no one really think about going to detail as what eponymous may be or how long he will be killing people underground. I am led as a result of human trials and perhaps not until that night he decided to take revenge on humanity but all of this is very clear that it is not so bad I am very doubtful if the producers thought they would be making a film that will get Oscars that year and always The market of awesome movies. Similarly I doubt whether it would have a great crop and I had one eye on the DVD market instead of the distribution of movies and I would say it was better than 1972 of DEATH LINE which also shows the killing of cannibal murder in London's underground. it's just that when you think all the clichés have been used in this film, another picture comes along with promoting its bad head
