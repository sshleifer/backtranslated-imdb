I happen to be the nephew of the director. I took many years to get my hands on a copy of this film and I can prove it is the worst of the worst movies. My uncle does no longer copy it (I asked). I hope to bring him a copy. Currently, the average film is 1.9 / 10. As far as I can say, this should put it somewhere in the mid-30's at IMDb "less than 100," however with just 206 votes, it is still not set . It is sad that the film does not get even the lowest title. However, I submit copies of the movie to family members this year for holiday gifts. Best / worse gift ever?
