Each generation fully believes that it is alive in the end times. This has been true for thousands of years now. And movies like this feed. How did they get Orson Welles to charging the collapse of this train? This is a document about the biblical prophecy of Armageddon. It tries to unite prophecy and it is also possible for what happens when it was done, making it dated with silly forms. Visible displays appear to come from "Uncategorized" but without high production values. People should be embarrassed to participate in this. <br /> <br /> In short, the film is dated, silly, reactionary, and useless. Good if you want to laugh good, but not enough to actually look.
