A close car trainer close to Yuma's free break of his chain group and leads to a retired sheriff who is responsible for killing his wife (with the remaining stash of gold remaining a secret thanks to the scribe's author). The attempt to bring modern western forms and the abuse of the 1970s and brutality is not the same as the league as the new west came from '60s'. It is very difficult with the square, and only female characters almost like clapping bags and rape victims. As a former director, Charlton Heston gives one of his most beautiful, very low performances (he has a good time, trying to read letters and hitting his glasses). James Coburn, as a half-mad-half-breed, is pretty much in an auto-experiment too, but Coburn has a way to turn even a hoariest conversation with the situation in something prickly and unnerving. It's showing him all the way. * 1/2 from ****
