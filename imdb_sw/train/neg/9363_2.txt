This film has some of the bad obstacles in it, how a person can walk through the back door of a safe health facility is impossible. Then this person is around the center and joins the office of Dr, is just a bad writing or bad editing. <br /> <br /> The very best possible game. I don't know how this film has been made, unless it has been done in Canada, and may receive government subsidies. I have to say the person who plays Aaron, Cory Monteith, did a good job. Unless you are too tired and nothing else to watch on the TV then I would say it would kill them at some point, but otherwise, it is no film actor who would want again.
