Look at this movie when it happened first in the 1970s and hated, hated, hated! Easily the movies of booooring which I have seen in my life. He does not know where Leigh got inspiration but this is one of those movies where you want to put the characters to open their mouths and communicate. The head says all because there is no time to save in this film, for a long time, long-term silence with people who can't explain what they feel (probable). If you want to see something that drives you to drink then this is one for you. If you do not have anything better to do for two hours then fast in the flat: the experience will be more enjoyable than what you will get from this! Yes, Leigh came with the most valuable things later in his career but to give him this miss.
