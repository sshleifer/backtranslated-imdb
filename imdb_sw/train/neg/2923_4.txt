The plan was very interesting, and the history of the Russian revolution. I also enjoyed seeing Budapest as the movie was a part held there. Sadly, there was a chemistry among the two main characters so it was difficult to believe the story of love among them. The events of love were forced by the clouds. Jordan kirckland was very hard, close to the color. Rob Stewart was very good and a boy, so he looked like his older sister instead of his girlfriend. Finally, when we finally know who was behind them, he was very weak and did not make any sense. I think I would enjoy this film very well if the relationship between 2 actors was more sure.
