Yes, this movie makes me feel real nervous, when I realized that I paid and spent more than 1 hour of my life trying to look at it. The bald boy only gives me the feeling of being a psychologist - Junkie and the girl is the worst actor I ever saw. I don't believe if you want to know your time to avoid this movie, I understand that the movie needs money to create and other movies that do not have money but it is not the right to a stupid plot and bad acting. I always help independent movies, when they deserve help, but this movie makes a bad name for this kind of movie. I am still frustrated. I will no longer see any good barrier.
