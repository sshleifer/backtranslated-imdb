Recap: Ron is almost married Mel. They are deeply in love and surely they are perfect for each other even though they met a few months ago. Todd, Ron's relatives are very unhappy. She is afraid of marriage is a threat to her personal work in the family business and decides to arrange a plan for Ron's players. But his true plan is to put Ron in a compromised state, to find evidence and break Ron and Mel on. <br /> <br /> Comments: It seems to be a good classic comedy but not quite funny. It is more than a show of pubertal and excuse young people to show themselves. True, by the way, it is almost interesting and many you can put in, because it's everywhere. Unfortunately this is also one of the signs of the film that cannot be self-reliant. Not just enough. <br /> <br /> It has three points of redemption though, or actually three executives who have a better script value than this. It's a leading actor Josh Cooke who can actually give a sense of common sense. Sara Foster I know that it has more talent than making movies like this, and Emanuelle Vaugier seem to have more talent than this film. What is sad that there is no good joke. True, bad joke is also a shortage. It's not just funny. <br /> <br /> 3/10
