Tim Robbins and John Cusack are two actors I appreciated in all their work, and that's the only reason to choose to watch this film. Well, all I can say is totally responsive! These two main actors are self-inflicted by making a number of useless, thoughtless and kitch violently (not that this is bad only) drawings that should be laughing at people, but they can't do it. The only reason I can think is that the director was their friend, and they decided to support his film with stars in it - I can't think of anything else because this film is so simple! Fortunately Tim Robbins and John Cusack did not despise me ever since. I would like to recommend you avoid this film, unless you want your comments about two executives destroyed.
