Unfortunately ... worse than TV shows. I can't believe that Spacey and Freeman were in this flick. For some reason the attitude of Morgan Freeman speaks constantly and says "pussy" while pointing to a girl's girlfriend NSync. Morgan Freeman calls women "pussy" is just wonderful ... Was hell the people behind this film thinking? A lot of conspiracy to think together with a horrible act, the confused camera cameras, the crippled script and the music of the music is not suitable for this film. I lost this towards the lowest .... but. .. well ... it's really laughing.
