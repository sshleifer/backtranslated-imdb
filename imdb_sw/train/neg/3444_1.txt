That is by far the worst movie I've ever seen. From the plot, though shots, "special effects", acting, and did I advertise the plot? Everything in it stirred the ass! This is a good example of what to "do more" means and I will try to describe it: <br /> <br /> I understand what the creator of this film was trying to do; this was supposed to be one of these movies you can not really say hell continues until the end. You are surprised, not knowing who has died and who is alive and who was killed and why and only when you think you have the right time line you see you're right and the movie is approaching - leaving you with the opening mouth for the next 5 minutes! Something like "Can't be damaged" or "Job" if you know what I'm saying. But Olga Levens, author of this junk, yes, Olga? Author, Director, Author, Author of Screenplay, Caster, Creator of Production, Director of Art, Creator of Costume and also twice for the same characters are events ... this is just one woman's woman and when it comes to Olga Levens from " Levens Productions "you can't go wrong :-) <br /> <br /> These may come as a shocker but" this time "Olga top did this great moment, jumping from location to location, from dream to reality ... but waiting! all this was a dream after all ... or was it ??? The photo has ended and I realized that nothing happened, the girl was alone on the ship ... in fact there was no ship ... no waiting! There are ships again, and boys! They are alive! Thank you God! No one calls him to join the cruise ... but then the ship is lost so maybe they have died after all? or maybe they were not alive to start with it / it <br /> If you understand what I just said you would like this film - otherwise it's a boring job and the only reason I have put through this trick is to know how hell can end this film ... <br /> <br /> Don't look at this if you value time, ever 90 is desired in this case ...
