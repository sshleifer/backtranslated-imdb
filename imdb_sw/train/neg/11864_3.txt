The characters in the bottom down barriers. you have seen all the characters in other movies, I have promised. The script tries to be mixed and sweeping but fails to sad. gives us in some hangover meets a superbad comedy but the joke is a way out of the left field, completely forced, and is completely blocked after the burst. Chick fire is old and has no personality, he is some thirty years old ass blonde and a few asses of donkeys who are not underwear wear a joke which is less than a love. The attraction between Molly (chick fire) and Kirk (dorky love interest) is difficult to communicate. The attraction in no where is his full connection to the extinction and the abduction of the seat-breaking kiss occurs. Additionally they are perfect on the relationship with its just very badly. The main purpose of this film is not a relationship, but a failed attempt to make a powerful-catchy film with an interesting plot. I was able to compare this with a hangover, in its forced form. I can't get into it. I could continue but not meaning. not just pay to see this movie.
