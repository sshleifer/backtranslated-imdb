as an actress I really like an independent film but this is an excellent amateur. <br /> <br /> Boys going to Vermont for civil service while still landing plane on palms - were directors know that palms are not in Vermont? Pines yes - palm no. And the same for the wedding service - again a beautiful garden of palm. <br /> <br /> When boys leave VT they seem unable to get tickets on any major plane since the flight was made by the Express Express. Did they handle themselves one night in a string? Come on young people a brief description like this separate film film from the very amateur. Christian brothers are more widows than Arthur and her hair color and tribal bed. Two should change roles. A few characters laugh and edit something awesome. Request for directors to do a gay film but focus on your locations and casting next time
