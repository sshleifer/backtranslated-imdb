This is the worst movie I have seen since "I know who was killed" by Lindsey Lohan. After watching this movie I can assure you that nothing but frustration and unintentional awaits you should choose to go to see this. Hey, Tim Burton, I was your great fan ... do you? Have you opened this movie? I mean very much, what f% # k? Without giving anything away, here is a brief story ... What wakes up, does things, works and decisions are useless. .. and the movie ends. Ongoje ... here comes the spoiler ... <br /> <br /> Observer observer! Spoiler alert! At the end of the movie .... rain. I think part of my soul died while watching this film.
