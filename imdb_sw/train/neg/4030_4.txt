I remember watching "Missile lost" (in fact cast until till my brother and several cousins ​​in their house I was a once-embraced visitor checked me - I was, constantly, Eric Cartman of the 1960s - sorry, guys) and being embarrassed some time when a long wave of millions of heat emerged as a plot of conspiracy - even if the second farmer knew that just a missile could not carry the energy around the heat or more damage over time and a small nuclear radius damage. I made that Turkey for loving families is a crime of defense. The films of film production were very good. Acting is not bad (except for Shatnerism of an actor who played an assistant governor that someone else said here) <br /> <br /> But the idea of ​​a missile Simple-cook the face of the world through the exhaust temperature ... no. <br /> <br /> Do people in the "Mystery Science Science 3000" have missed "Lost stress," however? <br /> <br /> It is a good classic of unintentional comedy - check if you want something to drink beer at the weekend.
