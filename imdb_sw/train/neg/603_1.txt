Film is quite laughable. I live in London and the plot is very bitter-bitter. No one could be threatened on London Underground. For a short time there is no service every night there are teams of maintenance workers there checking checks and making repairs, etc. That there are people who have no homeless living down there is not enough. Or it is possible to get locked up and not able to reach a mobile phone in this day and age ... \ t them. Although this has been subject to control due to a large number of security cameras on the Internet, another thorn on the side of the story. (Note in London we generally have more security cameras than any city in the world.) to me and try and enjoy with a small banal story which is. I could give them 0/10 if it was the same score! It might be a desperate film I thought I would like.
