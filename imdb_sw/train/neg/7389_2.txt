I buy or at least watch every movie of Seagall. He came with a nice little movie then descending on the bad story, the work of a bad camera and a walk-thru persona, almost lost me. The last few movies remembered how to make a good movie. Now he forgot again. This film is very dark (at any rate you care about). There are many slash and gash developing here without adequate purpose unless it means that it is a military warning. Seagall can have a position in many cases as it was often too dark to tell and another person's voice was used a lot of time. Unfortunately the most interesting character was the evil man who was killed by his guards and then he continued to raise it everywhere. Well since when did we put armed guards in the room with the prisoner? However this bad man was at least a color, and very focused. There's a lot of a year if you like the king of that. It seemed to me if the bad guys had drawn the same gash every time. I am so glad that they did not shed blood from their innocent victims. I found you back in my summary. Basically it's a horrible movie hidden as a film of action.Dec 6,2006
