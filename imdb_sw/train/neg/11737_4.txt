Indeed, I don't think the picture is as bad as many comments make it. . . but there is no denial that there are problems. <br /> <br /> To a large extent, the problems are on the script. There is a plot story - but not much, and certainly not one that one can call it plausible; draws any number of wonderful characters and / or characters, lines, time, you have and, at the end, you haven't added too much to this department. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but I was not worried about anything "social disease" Farnsworth might be trying to deal with; there will always be a sector of people who want to do just about anything to mislead their minds, even if it needs to run around the maize fields to try to steal ammonia, or whatever it does. So, like the film, you will see I will call "Iowa" "useful." But, with a stylistic rate, the image is more interesting and some of the Farnsworth choices in displaying the meta-head-out situation are good, highly hilarious, bothers and - yes, I'm going to say - led. <Br /> <br /> Acting is not recommended, but that may have the injuries to reach the previous stylistic. See, Rosanna Arquette is a good actor - but not very good here, so a member of an audience of discrimination needs to ask, "What happened?" It is amazing that Diane Foster can be wise and gracious that a few other characters can come anywhere near. For example, I may be able to consider clearly any information that Farnsworth could offer to the top of Michael T. Weiss as a pilot officer, but I doubt I could sell it; It doesn't just work. <br /> <br /> Then again, it's more alive and time that I saw John Savage seen in years. So go look at it. This is a kind of interesting job, but it doesn't promise - and that's okay; nor Farnsworth nor anyone else needs to make movies. Therefore, if Farnsworth has no other films in it still has to be seen, but if it does, it seems likely that it will not be papu. In the age when people plan their lives near the recent "American Idol" phase, perhaps we can allow, not ignore, Farnsworth's legitimate and unreliable film. Additionally, perhaps we can invite you, not to reject, his bold and sometimes blessed ideas.
