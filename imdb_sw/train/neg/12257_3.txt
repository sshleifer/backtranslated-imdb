"It's not like a big toy machine", says the early character, talking about "Jaws". In fact, the "Surf of blood" would just want to have a pet as a lobby as a shark of "Jaws" series. In other words, the digital effects of this movie are TERRIBLE. Making and leading is not better, either; seem to be more suited for modern or harder business than the awesome movie. The view of people who worked on this film shows contempt not only for the type, but also for the audience. To say "you loved" this film encourages the film developers to give us more than this trick, and to destroy the most kind of bad fear. (* 1/2)
