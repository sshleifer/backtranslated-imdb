MY GOD! Just because I fear this film 2 instead of 1 is because Tom Hanks is funny as Elvis-in-the-box. Besides, how does this semi-decent offer a sign on doing such a movie movie? Maybe it looked like a good idea at that time ... No laughing mention, the exhibition is pathetic, cast is passed, the direction is amateurish. Now that I think about it, many of the blame goes to the director, Joel Zwick. He offers anything except a flat display from all involved. Don't waste your time as I did; but then, I enjoy the collapse of good trains. Geez, now the system tells me I need more line - here's going: This movie should be called Return to Sender. Okay, now that was funnier than anything in the movie ...
