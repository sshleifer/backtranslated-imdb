I am sure that people on the Texas / Louisiana border should have a good or two laugh at the time of the Paramount B image that caused this during the civil war. The only place on the Sabine River where the film is opening is a cotton country such as all of South South or at least South Africa after the Civl War. There is no great authority there, it's far west in Texas, far more than Richard Dix and Preston Foster can rise to establish their rule. The film begins with their two partners in the sea and when Leo Carrillo tries to steal their services by not paying them for their cattle, they keep cattle. And that's the beginning of the great Ponderosa as ranch starts. The Foster Widget Dix's sister played with Frances Gifford and feuds with her very small neighbors. They also have more to run with Leo Carrillo. Still, we in the east who like western are not worried by geographical desires and are still a beautiful west from the production mill of Harry Sherman who produced all those Hopalong Cassidy west to Paramount. The season is fierce, and I mean that the real, gun wars that should be ready to be used in production. But I didn't have western fans but they watched it.
