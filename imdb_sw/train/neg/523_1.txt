It is amazing to me what goes through the entertainment today. maybe I am a dinosaur from fifty years, and I am not out of contact with today's generation, and it seems to be the case with this film, since many people liked it. I saw it foul and vulgar. I haven't told you about many movies in my life but this is appropriate for the bill. Humor is sophomoric and improper. I am not a politically correct person, and I have even got a gay joke, not just funny but bad (not gay). The main character in the cinema is not a pleasant person, just pathetic. When the movie was finally on hearing the comments people about how they were broken at what they were just paying good money to see.
