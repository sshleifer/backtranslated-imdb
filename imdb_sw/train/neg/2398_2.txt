Become a fan of movies like "Fire of Sale", "Poppa where", "Birds" I saw this because it is well named in the context of real comedies and satires as described earlier. Yes, FOR THE WRONG! Not only is this not fun, it makes you angry because it is not bad in a good, interesting way but in a very bad way. It's bad-bad. The script doesn't have a single line of funny which is instead of the way you try to entertain your audience with humor. Adam Arkin's speech barrier is probably one of the most offensive in this film. This natural violence still does not prevent him from being interrupted in movies and has a hard time without looking into the camera. This amateur without charisma looks well with the persistent mistakes and continue with the story - if you can find one. Ed McMahon - I had to think of Jay Leno, another person of the night talk show, who always refuses to call an actor. In fact, I have seen Leno movies and Laurence Olivier compared to McMahon. <br /> <br /> Kenneth Mars is good, though. In a few lines given. I am not so afraid of the bad comedies so I kept looking and checking every quasi-joke every 5 minutes or so. <br /> <br /> The movie really becomes a kind of quick comedy Alan Arkin takes over - he really does: Starting from 75 minutes on the movie he is in every area. But it's very little, it's too late. When movies try to distract you from believing their lack of professionalism is the reason you should love them because they have good intentions that remind me of students you have not prepared the test. In these cases you should remain strong and the bridge should be 'F'. (But please do not think I am a teacher. That's a profession and respect somewhere between politician and child molester). <br /> <br /> If you really are looking for a schlocky horror / scifi movie which is fun to watch and makes joke try "Man and Brain Screaming" by Bruce Campbell. Or look for Sunshine / Core if you prefer modern SciFi Schlock. Those are also funny, however no matter what.
