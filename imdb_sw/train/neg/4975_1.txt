After seeing the Canadian / British / British 2004 "Beowulf & Grendel" production, which I thought was wonderful and wonderful, I witnessed this - the first of 3 new Beowulf films from this year - for fear. Immediately after hearing "Viking" and seeing the helmets, I cried. These were Israelites Immigrants and Danes, not Vikings (came later). And even Vikings did not wear horns on their helmets (horn makes it easy for your enemy to knock your hat off and then the brain). Then there is Hrolfgar, which looks like a film for Greece or Rome, not Denmark for the 6th century. Swords and weapons are seen as left spaces from the original films placed in various historical periods. I saw weapons that could be used by Donors in the "Kingdom of Heaven," and one character was with a Windlass reproduction sword from "Beowulf & Grendel"! In addition to the basic plot of the original epic poem, the writing was unhealthy and makes the work of both wood and non-inclusive. The great Yuk was a bow of hidden weapons, complete with scope of appearance and estimation of burst, which looks like something bought from Iraq's rebels. The period of special effects with his mother were on the steroids that Beowulf can never break the arm, as he did in the poem. Thank you gods for a bazooka flowing! I could continue, but I can't.
