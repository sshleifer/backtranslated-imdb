This movie is a good example of how to destroy the book for 109 minutes. Except for the names of the movie characters carries very similar to the book. A book full of strong Latino characters and represents, for the most part, and non-Latinos. There is no development in the film and we have no reason to love or hate characters. And erase the full generation is innocent. Isabel Allende has written a book of strength and book to be counted!
