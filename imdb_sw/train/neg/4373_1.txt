I think I myself have a blame for the great quarrel that is "Entrails of Virgin". You are already looking at the movie center when you see the juicy and proud headings like this and the first feeling gets additional confirmation during film recognition is in mid-80's from Japan. Now, there are many of the demented filmmakers and patients working in Japan, but Kazuo Komizu is doing all for his trilogy-borne trilogy but sexually violence and abuse of young girls. Do not even try to tell a story, "Entrails of Virgin" provides only a hodgepodge of the UN-sexually enjoyable sex with the real effects of the poor that is not even a big fan of cheesy worries 80. Photos of a group of photographers and their model models is an intercut unintelligent and contaminated cases of sexual intercourse with a girl who seems to be young. He throws him a minute after he is (usually) and asks him to go, even if he should share with other women. I don't. What? This should represent the male fantasy? Because it is clich√©d and bad. Anyways, return to a group of horny photographers with effective models. Surprised by the upcoming mist at their home home, the group enters the house of a abandoned country where they have the most horrible sex and eventually being exposed to a mad-mad spirit who kills them all. Acting performances are amateur, indoor and first instructions and Komizu are weak and unsupported. I can tolerate all of this, including a woman's non-sex image, but I have come close to restoring the film during a non-complicated sequence. One of the men brutally kills, kills and throws around one of the girls and calls him a dirty prostitute until she feels good and weeps in pain. This sequence is, in my opinion of humility, the lowest level of the use of Asian movies. One to avoid and maybe even attack.
