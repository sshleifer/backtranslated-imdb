Removing this movie off is like a shooting fish in a barrel. It's very simple. So I will try to accept the good things of the little Man. First, I am attracted to special effects. It looked like the head of the Marlon Wayans connected to the body of a small person. I have never been in doubt for a minute. Second, I liked some unexpected wasos. David Alan Grier played an angry cafeteria, and his "Havin 'Baby" show and "Movin' On Up" were very valuable. John Witherspoon, who, unfortunately, played the father of the Grier in 1992 Boomerang (if you remember, "corrected" mushroom and mushroom jacket) now has Vanessa's father in Little Man. So it was fun. Additionally, this film is almost reliable as Tiny Black. What? Is dumb even when a doctor cannot tell him that he is 40 years old and not a child? She has a full set of teeth !!! What? How can no one seem to be a child? The little man is so bad that there is Rob Schneider cameo. And please, if you are a fool enough to lose $ 8 on this film, at least I love you and do not bring your children. This movie is a sexual way for young children (lots of jokes and sex feelings, going down, eating out, etc.), and I felt embarrassed for parents who brought their children to the study I had to endure. If you insist on seeing the idiotic film, at least save your children pain and suffering.
