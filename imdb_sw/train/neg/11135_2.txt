What more can I say? Acting was, almost without exception, amateurish. To direct and develop there was mercy. Sceenplay predicted to the very last location and interesting conversation. One of the features on the DVD was called "Gag Reel" but that could be a view of the viewer's response to multiple films. One of the most interesting things was in the view of the DVD director. He said, with a direct face, that he had made a film with high production standards and the name that was beaten - and that he succeeded. With the illusion that it is easy to understand how the movie turned out like it. Probably something desperate was a monster. The darkwolf suit was a modified suit (to 'make' a feature on the DVD) and instead it looked at it. Mask and claws were much better than the shelf work from any clothing store. The effects of the cgi were very clear and of the same quality as the free video game.
