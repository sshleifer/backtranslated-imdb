This movie was very bad. Acting was worse! It was worse than the student film. Super cheesy, and I think the worst actress was an old woman. At first I thought of myself, well is an old movie. Then I remembered that was not the reason! I have seen old movies and the best way to do so. <br /> <br /> Music was awesome. It was a choppy. The editing was bad (more than the conversation was not syncing). It was just laughable. My left grandmother's grandmother can make the film better than this.
