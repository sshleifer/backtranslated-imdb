It is not confused with Lewis Teague of "Alligator" (1980) which in fact is the best film, this "Il Fiume Del Grande Caimano" with hard exhausting trilogy foreign Sergio Martino made around the end of seventy years (including watchable "L ' Isola degli uimo pesce "and not good" La Montagna del dio cannibale "). To diligently monitor the plot of "Jaws", the script fails to create any doubts what so ever. The creature is proud and its victims are despicable. Stelvio Cipriani's drawings depicting the tourist attractions that have not been moved from the beginning as obvious diet of the reptile. There is no pleasure from here, instead of laughing true!

Recently, frustration leaves you with a feeling of sadness to witness a similar view of consideration. We can forgive films made by poor FX, but it's not a kind of thought. Never!
