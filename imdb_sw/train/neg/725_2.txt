This was a bad movie! Not for the issue, but for delivery. I went with my girl at that time (when the movie came out), hoping to see a film about the victory of the human soul on oppression. We saw it was 2 times the brutal abuse of the police, without being lifted at the end. Reviews and ads made NO mentioned for this! Further, for all they played on the goldop of whoopi, my memory is that he has been arrested and killed in the first 20 minutes! Again, the preview didn't say anything about this! (not that you could expect it, but it's just a little more trouble). If I knew how this movie would have caused, I would never see it. Or at least, I would have prepared it. It was a bait to change the ad campaign, and I can't see this film again!
