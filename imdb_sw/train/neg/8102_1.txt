Oh, I heard good about this movie. It came to see with my best friend (she's a woman, I am male). Now please let me have different views from the district. After the first couple "put off your clothes," we both felt a wonderful mix of silliness and boredom. We laughed (therefore, not so), we did (and it would be better to sleep in bed), we believed we had spent money free of charge. And we were. The plan was unusual, and the participants were a group of people who were not easy to maintain. Loss of money, waste of cellulodi. This movie is not even worth one of ten votes, but that's the most available. I don't know why this film has features that make it better; I do not recommend anyone who has even a taste of taste or mind.
