Bruno Mattei's former female actress is again experiencing this exciting exclamation of 8MM of Joel Schumacher. But, as expected, Mattei is making his film on a small budget - so that it is ready to be visible when released soon. After his daughter is cut off, the mother enters the dark world of the underground world, because the buttons are an international organization that leads to filming as long as customers only pay well. The search for his daughter is not only to lead the mother in Europe, but also in prostitution. He goes to sleep with some people to get his symptoms. When he finally gets in touch with an organization that is led by a Doctor of Wonderful Storytelling, he is in great danger himself. It's not too good to say about this, even though it will start promising. The problem is that the movie is by far not as evil or clear as a person can expect from a director who made a film like BLADE VIOLENT. SNUFF TRAP (which was first opened in Russia!) Not enough nor does it have a lot of dirt and sex to focus on the viewer. The program is not special, except for most amazing places in Europe. The end is very desperate. Acting is not surprising, except for Anita Auer who plays Doctor Hades: She looks and makes it very hard. You don't want to meet him like this in a dark place (or your bedroom, for it). All of them, SNUFF TRAP is just an appeal for Bruno Mattei film collectors. But it is good to see that man again on helm again: It was his first pleasure since 1994 GAL OCCHI DENTRO.
