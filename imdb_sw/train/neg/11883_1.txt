After getting up at 3:30 am and not being able to go to sleep, I decided that I could also be happy when I was deprived of sleep. This movie was on HBO and I decided to look at it. What a mistake! Here is a conspiracy (potential criminals, if you don't even care about): a person with neurotic sweets (Josh Kornbluth) works for the company's time of concern. Suddenly, it is given the opportunity to “go permissible,” which seems to be the beautiful words of this movie. But for a safe and secure job in his knowledge, Josh decides for any stupid reason that he doesn't want to do. He includes a few tasks and his laziness and lack of desire made me despise. His lack of sending several letters "very important" within a certain amount of time should be hilarious, but it is just stupid. Josh meets and cheats a lawyer lawyer and they get out of bed together (it's definitely fantasy of Josh in real life, if such a thing will never happen). A group of other things happens, but it also appears and opens in now. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that this movie feels like a comedy, I just laughed twice at that time; The first time was the shot of Josh Kornbluth (my initial reaction was one of the terrible fears) and the second was when he had a bed with a beautiful woman (yes, right). Josh Kornbluth is perhaps the most horrible person I've ever seen in my life. He is an unpleasant, overweight, balding Jewish man who must believe he has sex with beautiful women. I can never hear the character of Josh. She is lazy and was not strong and I just don't know the failed attempts in humor. Skip it, even if your life depends on.
