I have two words for you. Mouse Bean. He is the only presence of value in this film. But nevertheless, don't see this movie. Although he is as good as capital, you don't want to waste your time. I was not worried about the characters (except the little boy) and in fact, I didn't care if the stars crossed or died. The movie did not make me care or believe that these people worry about each other. I have read many "classic" novels after watching the movie and this film did not even create a book read. The story seems very bad. But I go ahead and read it to try to redeem stories in my head. <br /> <br /> Relax away from Lorna Doone. Migizati who played Lorna was also in Sense and Sensibility and was much better in it. See Sharpe, Horatio Hornblower, A & E has great novels like novel and Destruction. Or miniseries like Forsyte Saga. Look out, don't be distracted by Lorna Doone.
