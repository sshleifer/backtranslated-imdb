Other differences with improvisation on popular stories and loved children, La Bete (1975) aka The Beast tries to imagine (in a very graphic and what can be seen offensive and distracting but in fact rather silly and comical way), what really happened between Beauty and black? I am pleased with the new ideas and views that seem to be very popular in this film. I'm not going to even say that it is a serious and dark study of subjects such as sexual confusion, lust, completion, or a rejection of the Catholic religion. I can't even call it a fear-erotic film. It is more innovative on all types that affect or say even though they have an amazing time in all departments that will surely stay in your memory. <br /> <br /> Long-term (long-term) amongst the young Aristocratic women and she is thought to be nervous but desperate which I have seen in movies and really amazing ... well anatomy, is installed on the clavichord music of Scarlatti and is modern. My husband and I all laughed loudly on the news of the meeting. Ethics of the area is - beauty can and defeat monster. Who is the question - who is the audience of the film? For erotic pictures, it is also a well; for the art of the art - it has a lot of jaw-dropping great spiritual events and I would say a sudden end. IMO, the creator of the film did not mean it is a good game. As a technique of gallery / fear / frog, it's funny and really original. Have a good laugh and try not to look for a deeper meaning. This wonderful story of Beauties and craving creatures certainly does not suggest in collaboration with children. The opening section that can accuse a non-prepared viewer of the horrible sexual scene can be used effectively on the accessible software center as "In the animal world - a characteristic link with horse rides".
