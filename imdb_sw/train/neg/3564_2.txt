Pet Sematary, although it is a good 80 movie of Horror, with a good director and atmosphere, is a copy of the Italian ZEDER film and Pupi Avati. It is clear that Stephen King has published almost all ideas from this director (movie Zeder was made before King writing a book) <br /> <br /> cat, land, everything that was given, this is a case of preference, but, for Stephen Kindly popular American writer, it is quite common that he can overcome this, it is obvious from the great difference between this type of Italian movies and no-feature (and in part, pretends itself ...) but the original idea, I repeated , is the director of Italy Avati <br /> <br /> Let the world know
