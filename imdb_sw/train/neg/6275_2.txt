Very unpopular movies and characters who are doing so with concern that I was not worried who could get better (or was the purpose of the film, showing some of the people of New York City's cold heart?) No romance here, no comedy either. Work is very flat and a very predictable plot. What worries you most is this regular skill and quotes from classic movies. Man, can't you see that more pushing, under your own movie becomes important? Try it yourself! A small budget is no reason, the director of the first time do not. Crappy, crappy, crappy. It is not surprising to buy one bag ...
