The film took place in 1942 and in World War 11, the film industry decided to ensure that the investigators were near. The video is fun to watch because of Eleanor Powell's play. Miss Powell's late was certainly a great hoofer in every word meaning. She is also linked to a little boy looking at Red Skelton here. Both were also surprised at "I Dood It." Moroni Olsen, who was 3 years later, was as good as a police officer questioned "Mildred Pierce" again as an inquiring officer for Powell to provide a item. The problem is that Olsen and its rogues are Japanese spies. Bert Lahr is a natural brilliant man here and gets great support from Virginia O'Brien.
