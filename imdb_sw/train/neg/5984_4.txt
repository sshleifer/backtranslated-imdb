I was one of a few "Americans" who had all the amazing Gerry Andersen. Thunderbirds was a great series of time and would have made a great movie action / adventure if only authors could decide where to focus. I expected it to lose, but I did not expect to have a goal in a young age group. If you lost in space, this can be all interesting and exciting. It should focus on further steps / adventure with the aim of the original series ... save people in trouble. Rather, it focused on Alan to save the day instead of his brothers (who were also thrown on young people against the original). Part of the outbreak was Lady Penelope and Parker. I didn't care too much for the characters in nature, but I thanked them in the film. Stealing show! <br /> <br /> I always enjoyed more Thunderbirds for high-tech than the story, and even that didn't have enough screen time as I was worried. I would enjoy watching more of cool gadgets. But, I am a whole child ...;)
