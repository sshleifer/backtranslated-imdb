This newborn, bland flick is effective for young people in the old mens, desperate to relive them of hormonally challenging young people. How? By burning gas and comparing a fast car, or reckless (or airplane) and freedom. The plan gives me a lot of money from Mr. Rogers' (if I am running a lot of oil) and Logan's Run (if you were sitting too fast and had no clear sense of style). <br /> <br /> Contact Lee Majors and Burgess Meredith this film has been installed in the post-gas-world world where a powerful government does not want you (* ahem *) to drive your car and burn gas. The opposite type of Enron-and-Bush today, grab oil, SUV-pushing government. <br /> <br /> This juxtaposition alone makes the film be lighter. But wait ... there's more. Although the film has been installed in the future, we are not shown any sign of future technology, more than the return of bicycles, golf cars and horses. You will believe that the future seems ... especially like today. The same clothes, the houses of these cities, the green leaves are the same today and the film is made. No solar panels, no air panels, no renewable energy agreements. <br /> <br /> Acting is flat and not available. Even the events that could have been false or moving, buddy-flick, decent, romance, panic ... all fall below the fabric paper under the cycles. Overall progress / lacking - the jet passes by Meredith's character Burgess changes color and configuration from time to time when the film representatives curse our minds for unlike the most frequent videos. The plan is like half of the concepts and half as exciting as the Dukes section of Hazzard. Even the die-hard film of films and SF fans should avoid this film as an old moon road, unless you like to enjoy Exxon actors trying to make a film like an empty gas tank.
