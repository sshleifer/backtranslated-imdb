I saw a trailer on this film and it looked good, so I came out and bought it. What an error, acting is a shambles, special effects (if you can call them), see if something that will not be a place to play in school. Some characters are ignorant in this film will hit their minutes on the screen, which unfortunately is repeated. As a story, forget it. This is a warning, don't waste any money at all on this film it must be one of the worst things I have ever seen. If, for some reason, you like this film looking at Troll 2, you will also enjoy it.
