This movie could not decide what it wanted to be. There were a couple of few moments that made you think all of these things would gather at last ... but they didn't. If you want a "visitor to a green waste", stick to the 1950 version of the THING (not an abomination that had been developed in the 20-year vision). <br /> <br /> I could not get on the fact that "stranger" looks very pretty recycled from INDEPENDENCE DAY. The "less-set sets" would be more effective if they had employed executives who could actually act and implement a sense of purpose. A lot of chewing environment for less money.
