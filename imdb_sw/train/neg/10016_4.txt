"Ghost of Dragstrip Hollow" was one of the most '50s' hot young people involved in an unusual situation. In this case, young people can not pay taxes to their hangout and expulsion. To wherever you go, they decide on the house looks haunted. As you think, as soon as they arrive, other strange things begin to happen. And there is a final move. Nothing is in this film that you haven't seen in other movies, but it's a good entertainment however. My favorite character was a foul-mouthed parrot. Yes, I repeat that: he did not speak as a character in the movie Quentin Tarantino, but said things that we do not expect out of the plane. Clean the movie, but it doesn't matter.
