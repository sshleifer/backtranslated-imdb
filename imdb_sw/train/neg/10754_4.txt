Waiting to enter the ticket and ticket in my hand, I anticipated a fascinating film of sci-fi fantasy that could ultimately feed my film about the robot technology, instead of despair and every element, once and to confirm specific effects can not help the plot stimulating, which in my opinion was worse this year. Working in this film also was not satisfied with me, Will Smith did not show anything new in this film, but I have never seen his work of switch since "Men in Black" which was his only success in my opinion. He had to retire since then, not to destroy his name by name as "I, Robot" and "Men In Black 2". 4/10
