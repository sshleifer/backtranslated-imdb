I admire 'Kissing on Mouth' for its transparency ?? haircut and ignore, especially from the director / director Joe Swanberg. They were not afraid to show the truth to the daily "private" events. Unfortunately, the film is under the 'Bunny Brown' area, although with a small plot of jealousy. Yes, it shows 'Bunny' with anything going on, or many movie shots focusing (or sincerely unfocused) on anything? feet, hands or joints. Again, unfortunately, I can see why this film was released, and why people are lost: the sexual events of real life and full of sight (same, both male and female) weaknesses. Other than that, it was a complete waste of time. We learn quickly about a male / female male post after a university where a man has a strong impression of a woman he sees as a friend only as he continues to have sex with his ex-boyfriend. Other than that, we are subject to everyday events of their boring life: he works for his parents; works on a gender awareness project uninteresting very on his computer. For all this work, the discussion should be interesting and realistic. It doesn't work and it looks like watching someone driving at an hour, ie 'Bunny Brown'. The only actor who stands is Kate Winterich, and he even makes a statement. (The extra DVD with him in front of the mike is actually a watch / audio.) Again, I praise the film monitors, especially Swanberg, to stop them all and do not be afraid to keep themselves or the bathing habits, but generally the film falls flat. It has stories that do not match events, many daily boring and enough events to do that you are wondering, rather than because of soft-porn, why you rented this.
