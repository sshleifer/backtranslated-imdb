This is a very old and cheap film made - the most common B-Western budget in many ways. Gary Cooper was still a star and this film reminds them of John Wayne's original movies that have been done by the "poverty line" label. For both actors, their typical style and persona is still not created entirely. The end of Gary Cooper does not appear as a Cooper for a few years later (speeding in the original film, among other things). However, unlike the average B movie era, there are at least some interesting features that make the film visible (if not good). If you want to see a woman married to Errol Flynn for seven years, this is your chance. Lili Damita star as the love of a woman's interest and this is a very strange choice, with a heavy impulse (was French) and was not even close to being a "good film star". Unfortunately, she also married the director Michael Curtiz. <br /> <br /> But for me, the most memorable and proud feature of the film is a visible subplot with gay - kind like BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN from the 1930s (and we thought this was a new idea). Gary Cooper's behavior was awakened by two men who hate women and do everything they can through many films to keep open Christian women. This misogyny alone does not mean much, but there are many signs in the film that shows that the creators of the film really were trying to show them as a gay couple. Specifically, toward the end, when one of them was killed, another was struck by the arrow and stopped long enough to enter the body of his fallen friend and then fell - and his arms around him! This was a good time of time and I think this makes this film very impressive today! In addition to Cooper and the plot go, the film is a bit of despair and very jump. Unless you want to know about Damita or gay homosexuals, make yourself a permit and reach the best Western.
