This series would have been much better if they had done one simple thing: Ian McShane Name Name: Great Diamond instead of Name Code: Trees. Diamond head character requires a person who can handle the role of the lovable rogue, which McShane has shown he could do with Lovejoy series. Roy Thinnes, the real head of Diamond, is really just so - in the role. McShane is not as good as a bad tree. French character Nuyen, Tso-Tsing, can not seem to create his thoughts as he is a bad victim or a tough-and-ready-fight woman. In fact he got his pay at the end when he had to play the role of the Diamond Head. After looking at a place or two, I ended up regardless of what happened to anyone. The tree gives us much to hate, but the Diamond's head gives us anything to love. Unfortunately, the type of spy in the 1970s was not exactly the same as it was in the 1960s.
