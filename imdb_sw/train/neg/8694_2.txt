The female leadership was a terrible actress who made the whole movie to have fun. He screamed as he was going before the camera talking about his daughter. This would have made the police prosecute him. I would not be able to change in the same situation. She seemed a quiet way to a mother who could not look for her daughter. It was like she didn't want to even be in the movies. Jennifer Aniston could play the game better. And it would have made a lot of money for the issue of controversy, important. Everyone else was better. I don't know where the leading actor is but I'm hoping he has acting lessons.
