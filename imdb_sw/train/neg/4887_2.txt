The first movie is very good. This is very bad. It repeats many images (including opening and end credit) from Crime Input. New footage, shooting on video, actually mentions out as badly. Exhibits do not have the proper lighting, the sound is sometimes almost inaudible, there are even video glitches like rolling pictures and so on. <br /> <br /> As all bad rows, basically just repeat the first story. Ethel kills everyone who shares his living space, often because of them to find the way he wants. It is only a bonus on the first DVD, which also includes the film's director of Black Black. The worst does not include the deaths of the Death Nurse though.
