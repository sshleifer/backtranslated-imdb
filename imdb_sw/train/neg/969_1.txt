I was rooted for this film as a remake of a series of children's television series of 1970s "Escape to Night" who, though chaotic and frequent was normal, surprising and disturbing. Acting in "Paperhouse" is a river, without fun. They also added to the tension they only reinforced that I had been looking at the bed. The search has led to a dreary discussion that led to an unhealthy relationship, chemistry or belief. As in many films of non-welfare people there are few actions that help these people to be comforted, comforted and reassured. Of all that is possible to end up, more anticipated was selected ... lamer than I could have dreamed. <br /> <br /> "Escape night" deserves a proper remake, written by someone who has life experience and directed to mind trick.
