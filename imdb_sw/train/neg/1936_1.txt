Farmer's warning. When the sister of the main character faces down the stairs, the killer breaks the vodka glass around him, to make it appear to have been drinking. But before he was killed, he tells his business partner's sister (Teri Garr) on the phone that he did not drink in 4 days. However, the police did not report the results of the toxicology report! And, the characters talk about his drinking when he fell down. Huh? Very serious error in this film, which is very bad, in general. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly bad, considering the cast. Some errors: writing is not very good, music is done on bad TV, and there is no tension just because we know the secret answer from the first place on the film.
