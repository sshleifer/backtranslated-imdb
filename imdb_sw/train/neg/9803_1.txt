Power Rangers are definitely showing a bad television with a stupid stupid line of too much in American history. Nothing / even a remote attraction about this TV show is quite bad. <br /> That is just a very bad display made, with evil actors, wear in different colored spandex colors that appear to be quite stupid. The owners of this show should be ashamed of themselves, for there is no value for redemption for this shortage. <br /> <br /> Today's children should try to look better shows the Toy Toy movies instead of this garbage.
