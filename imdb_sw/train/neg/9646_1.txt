The lack of content in this film is very interesting. First I though people would like to compare this with Rock! but I am very surprised to say that this was worse than Rock! The story of it so awesome awesome Ajay Devgan Jamming and Salman Khan and Asin you gotta be my kidding. Music was the same as Khanabadosh was a bad film! Vipul Shah has not yet learned from Singh is a primary comedy based. Now Asin has come from the pole for the fan of Asin out there but he spends a lot of time in this film very hard doing he did not look good at all the discounts of doing! My last decision to look at Aladin and your family instead of wasting your time here.
