"Kicheka, Clown Laugh" released in 1928, star Lon Chaney famous as clown circus named Tito. Tito has raised the founder (young and beautiful Loretta Young) to become an adult and calls him Simonetta. Tito has raised a girl in the life of the circus, and has been a perfect ballerina. When Chaney gives her normal normal performance, I couldn't pass on the fact that Tito, now in the middle of the middle, has a chance of little Simonetta. Although he is not a biological father, he has raised as a daughter. This type of "ick" is facing all the films. Tito agrees with the advice of Simonetta and young and beautiful 'Count' Luigi (Nils Asther). Simonetta is open to the boy, but he feels guilty of leaving Titus (faithfully, not romantic love). The entire cluster of the film is ridiculous, and I find that no one in the film tells Titus what an old fool is (until he reveals himself at the end). The film looks just because of Loretta Young, who would continue to do a good job. When I like the beauty of Chaney as an actress, this whole film looks to me and it's amazing.
