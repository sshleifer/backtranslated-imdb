Beware only ... This is the worst movie I have seen in the years ... I can't look at it to the end ... It's a waste of time ... I feel sorry for the snipes he endured on the film. There really isn't much to say about it. Acting bad, very bad lines, stories, everything. The only reason I can advise you to watch this film is if you want to see how the film should not be. In order to tell you one incident: the police are looking for Snipes, and they are nearby building with helicopters and cars, they are shooting around into the building, but they are still whispering so snipes does not suspect something.
