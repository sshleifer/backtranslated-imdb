Another fan of the British movie banner. The real waste of giving here again. I can't understand (and I'm UK) why this on top, worldly patriotism was ever made. IT IS seven years, since the second world war was over! Some publishers here have described in editing and clear use of memory images. This is very badly considered. Footage memory is bulk. A typical flight spinning from the wire on "action scenes" as many children's kites in the wind. The typical mapping system makes a movie tattoo to get us to the entire event of Malta. Guinness must have its worst performance to act forever. Featured failure to stop the dog shouting. Hawkins gives us all to die in the area of ​​the map. Ealing made many beautiful films. This is obviously not one of them. They should be sitting away and around like that!
