I read about this film in the newspaper and I was surprised. The woman, who one day sees herself driving her own car. Well, I thought, this could be interesting ... <br /> <br /> ... but not. First, head. Are you broken? Done ... what? What was broken? La ... oh, wait ... I find, the name itself is "broken"! WOW, clever! Unfortunately, this is the only thing going on. <br /> <br /> The columns are not bad, but I think Kiefer Suderland did better in 'Mirror'. The cross between the Body Attendance of the Body and Mirror, and instead of direct at that time. The most suitable title will be 'Boring', since it provides every single area for the age of blood. Or perhaps 'Confusing' because it does not describe anything at all, not in a story or a story itself, only an idea of ​​a misconception about the bad and somesuch, which has the cheap scares and events used to die, but nothing is seen. Destroyed. On the other hand, acting with special effects are very good, but again, it is not a difficult task to act. After looking at the movie twice, I still feel unworthy, a little confused perhaps, and not a kind of way to EA Poe or Stephen King. Make yourself a permit, do not cover this. Simply put, there are the best fans out there.
