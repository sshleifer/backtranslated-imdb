The idea of ​​fun, but it is not good. Except for the good effect of makeup, there is no very realistic. There are obvious problems; for example, after taking what appears to be a week and week to get fat from normal size, the main character seems to go from size to death to death in a day ... and once thin death lays pretty much similar to death on the chest for what seems to be long. <br /> <br /> In any case, the film has more serious problems than it - movies shows the lowest budget-show and most of the acting are good bad all around. Robert John Burke seems always trying to some kind of fun for Charlton Heston's beauty and it's a sad thing to see ... another terrible thing is that Lucinda Jenney and Kari Wuhrer are all worse. The only reason that I give them this movie is as high as I am that once the movie enters the end of 1/3 or so with the character of Joe Mantegna takes, the movie promotes a feel, fun, and fun things The gangster of humiliating gypsies completely feel it very fun to look at. Finally, as far as possible, you also mean. Avoid unless you are a King-o-Phile or actually considered the thoughts of Fat Tony's voice from the Simpsons awesome gypsy camp.
