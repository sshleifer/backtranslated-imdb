Very unpleasant movies. While the special effects of Rick Baker are quite amazing (if it is a turn of the stomach), it does not have any other features of redemption. Like many 70s movies, it makes you feel like you need to take a long shower, and take it away from yourself. The characters are very safe, and the plot is useless.
