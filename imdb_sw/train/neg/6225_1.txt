I am sure this will be even a religious film. I liked Gram Parsons to be sure and didn't expect too much from this film and I got it a bit. What was clever and moving was kiki. It had no music that made Gram and more saturated than cheap dog food. There was no history on Gram or people of the time. The characters displayed did not know me even if the Gram fan and all versions of "after the adventures of the adventures" have heard. Rock and rock are full of stories, good too but should be taken with salt cereals. They can be a good story though they have always been exciting. However, this film took a good story and it turned out. Having any body and the following events should never be a bad story but they made it bad, somehow. I am tempted to steal any copies of Grand Theft Parsons, out into the desert and burn them all.
