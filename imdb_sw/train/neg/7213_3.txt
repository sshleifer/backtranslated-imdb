When I certainly focus on the Exorcist being a classic fear, I must admit that I do not hold to the highest as many horror fans do. As a result of this, I have not seen a lot of the reduction of ecosystems, and if Exorcismo is nothing to go, I will say it is a good thing if this film attracts like hell and certainly not worth spending ninety minutes on it! For freedom of other expeditions to the expedition, this is often considered to be one of the worst, and so perhaps it was not the best place for me to start. It is not hard to guess what the plot will be: basically the same as the one in the Exorcist and sees the girl to find the spirit of the demon (which happens to be the spirit of her dead father). The village priest is called then making liberty. Like many films of Spain, this one star Paul Naschy, who is pretty much better thing about the film. Exorcismo was led by Juan Bosch, who previously led the Spanish essence of Giallo 'Killer Killer'. I haven't seen any of his other films, but on the basis of these two: I believe that nature was not one of its powerful points. There are many good things I can say about the film itself; especially it is only plods and the area of ​​evil is not recommended to wait. I certainly do not recommend!
