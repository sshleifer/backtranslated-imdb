I really enjoy Christopher Lee, but this was not about his other exhibitions ... and was one of the best artists. <br /> <br /> The film does not live to its base. It's not that terrible, it's high melodramatic, and it's draaaaaags. Every time I thought, "Oh, here's a good place" a good place hasn't come. The wicked are not quite sure. Most of the other characters were also not in depth. <br /> <br /> Maybe if I were in the right mindset, I would enjoy MSTie-fication at the cost of this film, but .... Naahhh ... Don't really seem to be worth the effort. It wasn't very good, it wasn't so bad, it was special.
