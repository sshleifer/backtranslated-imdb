All of the X-Men movies were beautiful. And I mean all, including long-term people X-Men 3. They had powerful characters (Magneto and Xavier were better, in my opinion), and arch good news <br /> <br /> I was all excited when I heard this film was on production, and my expectations grew bigger and bigger until I saw the movie. I was despised. Hugh Jackman is not a good runner (his best movie is a fountain, although you can't hear about this film when they talk about the actress), and his acting is not what is running the film up. The entire film is faced with many uninformed characters who have nothing on the plot (like Blob or Gambit), which was hit there to make fans believe that the creators of the film read the original characters. <br /> <br /> I am a XMen fan, I have read many stories, and this story did not respect one of them. Nothing. Not continuing. It does not respect the X weapon project, or the relationship between Wolverine and Sabretooth, or Emma Frost, the push of wolverine is very foolish and seen in millions of movies: revenge for the death of a loved one. Oh! What I was expecting all the darn movie was during Berseker for Wolverine the same as he had in X2 school when the Stryker people came in and he alone took the enemy forces, but hey, this is Fox, this is a flick of the family and you will not see clear violence from the fierce and sad hero. <br /> <br /> Besides, I had always a natural feeling for this movie because the Wolverine publications have already been described in X2, we know how she got her bones of adamantium so it's not kind of useless to make a movie of something that we already know. <br /> <br /> I personally believe that wolverine is one of those few characters that do not need to back to the story because the secret is the nature of the character. Do we want to know how Joker got his scars?
