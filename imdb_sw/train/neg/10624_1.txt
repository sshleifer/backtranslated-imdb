In another good review, the loleralacartelort7890 says "The fact is that Americans are using the aluminum-anti-radiation-alloy aluminum. It is not known. And the exact details are hidden. Where is the place in the space competition with the Russians, then it will be very difficult to show that they had new technologies that could protect workers against radiation. "This is not quite correct. There (and did not) "hidden" for the protection of radiation in Apollo. The design and construction of Apollo Command Module has long been available to the public. It uses a "bee" lighter of aluminum and stainless steel. The entire outer part (except the windows of course) is covered with a heat-made resin with a phenolic resin, the root below the front faces during re-entry. These devices are really the best * in the drop type of radiation we have in the position (charged particle) than the lead, which fits most to stop ionizing photons like X-rays and gamma rays. <br /> <br /> Radiation radiation is a definite problem for * long * space to run because of the risk of large solar flares. But not only the biggest threat to the astronaut of Apollo. The Command module provided good protection during a short time (1/2 hour or more) passage through Van Allen's belts. They all carried dosimeters so that we knew how much radiation they received: no more than 1.5 rem, and very common. Of the 24 men who went to the Moon (12 of them arrived), 18 are still alive. Only two people have died from cancer: Alan Shepard (leukemia) and Jack Swigert (bone cancer). Others died from heart attacks, sugar (Roosa), and a motorcycle accident (Conrad). This is a very good figure for a group of men now in the last 70 years (Shepard will be 86).
