I just hit four dollars for this movie! Why Alliance Atlantis could promote such a little exemption of films than me. But even more surprising was a very good review which several critics of the Canadian newspaper presented this film. I am exhausted by our media proving only because it is a Canadian budget and a low. It is as they expect Canada's films to be stupid, so it provides a good review regardless. Now about the movie: Acting was less than the average (except the male character guide, who was really very good). The quality of the film was bad, which I think can be expected from a very small budget. The script was quite awesome. An example is a story, which refers to almost one of the leading characters, a drug dealer who deals with one of his customers to get employers to fix and steal a bike for his group, whose aim is to destroy randomly SUV's. Of course most of the cyclists of his community have been destroyed in these activities (I do not know how they can only afford to buy new, since he needs to be a strong drug addiction from Vancouver to Toronto). However, the story of the story (not even more than half a movie through the movie) is that the drug dealer builds fire buildings in the Toronto area to try to build more affordable houses - if no one lives in the area. <br /> <br /> - I want to say more. The shock at the Toronto Film Festival by accepting the film, Telefilm's support, and Globe and Mail with Georgia proper print by commenting as proposed. <br /> <br /> The film should not get special treatment because it is Canada !!!!
