Death Tomato Attack is a "technique" of the worst monster movies that are getting worse than the leading movies. The story (very small) says about tomatoes who rebel against those they mistreat. Basically, it blows and grows (yes, it screams) and something else you know that person is wrapped in ketchup. Officials are not names that did not make movies after this, so there would be no meaning to call them. There is a boy hired by the administration to try and stop the risk of tomatoes. She accompanies a black man who is a master of hiding with a girl and a boy who hits. However, there is another woman who is spies on the first boy who works for the government. if this doesn't mean much to you, you understand. This movie has never been very good at first place, but even inappropriate to laugh on stupid attacks. The movie is bad cheezy, which though being all the point, really really hurts what could be (cause) entertainment movie. At one time, large tomatoes of wax "slides" on an unknown plank of wood and wheels on it! Maybe I would recommend a movie if it had a value of camp, but even this lacks from this awesome film. 2/10
