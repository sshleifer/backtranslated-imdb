I am a Columbo fan, especially on Saturday's rain, and it was fun to see Oskar Werner after Fahrenheit 451, but this part was not there. The original plot plot and conspiracy was obvious and could be assumed in advance, even years before today's modern detention. But it was exciting to see the bed of high-quality and modern electrical equipment and, of course, the unnecessary suburbanite humor when screaming in the modern art of selling. The top house is Jetson or Disney version of Tomorrowland, and it is fun to consider the authors who create those "way out". <br /> <br /> If out of the sun outside, go to play, for there are better pieces of Columbo. Still, we should be grateful for the Cable TV which these events are announced.
