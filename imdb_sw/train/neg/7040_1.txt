Purchased VHS on this film for two bucks, What? I lost my money! Hey, I dig Adam "West Batman" and Tina "Island of Giligan" Louise, but hello! This third-rate production is the filing of twelve film biker; A bike bicycle group climbs into the city of tanks, beat everyone with everything, and then fails within a man with a dash hero. Adam West looks at that part as a hero, but he lacks a cape, with his Batman uniform. Sorry, it's not okay. Tina L. looks very scared and afraid of the whole show, but at least we know what happened to "Ginger" once rescued from the island ... Bicycles are a group of motley, and they are known to them again or at least they should not. The hell of hell is Hell of Watching!
