The first scanners may not be a great movie, but at least it was natural. The article is even worse, in my opinion, and the story is slow and no specific.i also did not like the discussion. and special effects are no better than the original. The only thing different from that, is that it's big and chaotic sometimes. But that doesn't make a good movie. not more. In addition to all of this, there are more bad movies. In a generous atmosphere, I will give the Scanners 2 4/10.
