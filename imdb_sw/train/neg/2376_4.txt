George Brent is a writer sent to interview with heiress. He should be the successor of the lucky face of the cream. She interviews him on his yacht. They fall on each other in a bathing dress. <br /> <br /> It turns out (very early) that he is not heiress. He is part of the advertising campaign for winter cold. <br /> <br /> The movie follows ups and downs of their romance. <br /> <br /> Hold support does not have a bit to lift. Davis and Brent bear pictures. Although it is certainly predictable, it is also a fair recreation. It is far from its ability. But, especially considering his attention in his oeuvre, not one of the worst, either.
