Well this is a short and sweet review ... Something that the movie should have practice has made its life very short and more interesting than it is. <br /> <br /> This movie is $ ^ @%. There is a good reason with a request and more than 40,000 ++ signatures requiring Uwe Boll stand to make movies from the people they liked. Blood Rayne have biggie there. It is a good joke ... if you've never heard it before. That makes it natural but you can really just blame the script for it. Even in a short time they wonder if they are using the script. <br /> <br /> Movie has a bit of NOTH to do with previous games. HELLO if you have played games you know the main character does not have a real incentive outside the homicidal killing as a massacre because he stubbed his or her simular. There is a very good way to this stupid movie. as I said. I can't even steal this film. Anyone who says this is the 'Funniest movie of 2007' .......... requires a close look, the news is better than this.
