I like to stimulate the feeling of horror. I don't care if acting is small-or or if monsters look corny. I loved this movie except for the most beautiful feeling all the way from the beginning of the film to the end. See, I don't need the key to page 10 or the letter with a large letter that tells me the plot. But the dark floor takes "what is this film?" something to a new level (amazing). What's this film about? This is not terrible or terrible but if you have an hour and a half to kill and / or want to end feeling and frustration, lease this winner.
