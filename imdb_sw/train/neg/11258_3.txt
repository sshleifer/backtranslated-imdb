I have spoken this in another opinion, without a story, you can give all the smoke to the audience and the mirrors you want, no one will give it. The director appears to have a great eye for the 30-art deco (which I like), and I think the idea of ​​using all of the digital backgrounds and such can be a future wave in filming. However, it is obvious that the director got an interest in the filming of his movie, forgot many movies that could help this amazing film planned. (SPOILER) To cry loudly, forgotten to have a villain in this matter! Well they have one, but he has been dead for 20 years and when the movie is being done. Conran miss miss to have a villain. In addition to the going process, let's take a look, Sky Captain (Act) draws down the ONE robot, two or three of the wing blowing (before Dex (Ribisi) tells him to stop beat down !!!), and two robots, but actually spend time Her watch dashing and get others to fight her war for her. Paltrow like Polly or Peggy or Punky or whatever was completely lost in this film (the commentator who has a comment on it and the lack of chemistry rules is correct) and I for one I was a little ill to see regular shots on his camera, showing that he only has two rounds, both loses later in the movie, straight, one quite funny, though I saw it come from 70 years away. No one except the Law and Paltrow have at any time important on the screen, and that's the real feeling of the film. The audience do not know and robots, they need a hero for the roots, and they look, despicable to hate them. Without it, with a good story of engaging, CG all around the world will not help.
