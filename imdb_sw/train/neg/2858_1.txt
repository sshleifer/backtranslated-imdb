This should be one of the worst movies all the time. Photos were bad, acting was a b-movie and the effects were just Nintendo 64 only qualified. You would think that they would put more effort into it. Of course, it's Scifi movies so you expect to be a minimum, but this takes a cake. Hell, I still laugh. So, as the head of the shake-head of unbelief, this does well. Although it seems to have other 'known' actors and practitioners in this, it is difficult for me to believe that they did not realize that the quality of this film was worth the time and their efforts. <br /> <br /> Images can be good '60 or even earlier' 70 but come, this is 2009! I do not give the importers outside, let's just say if you have played "Jurassic Park" on Nintendo 64 you will have a lot of knowledge and what you see in this film <br /> It is obviously not worth 2 hours it took to stay for that
