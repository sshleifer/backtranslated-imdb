I saw omen when I had 11 on tv. I enjoyed Trilogy. So when the opportunity to finally see one on the movie came close I did not. I came to the movies I knew I was seeing what was not being offered to the movies but it was for a television film. However that fan can not resist. But this Omen movie which I saw during the midnight observation did not bring the damage that brought laughter. An open debate such as "It is written that if the child cries during the baptism they deny God". What's the feeling. Faye Grant so nice in V has been destroyed by this script from hell. There is no issue and no fun. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the many times we were bad. In fact it is Pathetic.1 out of 10
