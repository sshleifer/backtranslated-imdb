We should be suspicious of discovering that for just two minutes shining out we were only alone. Five others joined before the movie started. Nothing to redeem this film. Acting is bad (especially Ms. Hurley). Script is banal. Side effects we've seen a million times. The worst trends we have seen. Scheduled and inserted. No one laughs including children. We left after 25 minutes. It would have been as soon as my wife had not gone for a hot dog! Do not lose your money on this film. If there is nothing else to look at your movies then connect the drinks, popcorn and hot dogs and make other people look. You will have a more enjoyable time !!! <br /> <br />
