One of the first Frances Farmers' movies; at 22, he is quite good. Bing Crosby is a great voice, but the songs are not the best. Martha Raye and Bob Burns are fascinating, but their comedy, perhaps the greatest of her time, is actually corny today. Roy Rogers also appears - in the role of singing. In my view it is only important to watch if you are a fan of Frances Farmer, and maybe a Bing Crosby partner.
