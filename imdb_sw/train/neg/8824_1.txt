What can say about this movie except, "viewer". The evil of Christmas should come up with a warning label as a cigarette, because this was dangerous to the eyes and my ears. I rarely have enough to flick the "b" of fear, but this film could not even bring a little fear for five years. The perimeter of the sudden and thirsty blood flow in the film is that he should be seen close to the god-like, if nothing can stop their fury of evil, but in this psychopath film he finds himself stumbled on the chimney in an amazing attempt of his The second and actually follow along with all of the famous legend of santa claus, it is thought to the viewer that this person is not at any risk because he is very foolish to be dangerous. All in all the film waste.
