Nothing about this film I liked. It was very clear budget and bad lighting and camera function (next to Blair Witch Project, just didn't think it was so). There was not so much for the plot, and only the movie is a continuous drug. I actually spent it at the end of 1/3 of the movie, but that didn't help many things. It seemed like it could be good from the box, but I must say again: there is nothing about this movie even the same as good. No good actors, special effects were so fake, the camera function was awesome, and the talk was terrible. On my own level, I give this movie 0 out of 10. Yikes!
