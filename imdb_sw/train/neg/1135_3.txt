I did not read Lincoln's biography, so maybe this was a picture that shows ... \ t ..... But why would they make a film representing Lincoln as a buffoon? When Henry Fonda made Lincoln better, showing him as "aw shucks, I was a simple boy" it seemed to have a little contempt. [In fact, that was Bushie Jr. The campaign, making us think he was "just a guy" so we don't care that he is rich and privileged - but that's the whole story.] <br /> <br /> Not only a film to show Lincoln kind of a simple guy (very simple), The film says that Lincoln received the law only by accident, and that however he was not interested in the law - only with a simple false idea of ​​the law being on the right and wrong. In the film he is not a very good prosecutor of defense (he surrounds his feet on the table and hates the witnesses), and the result is known for fortune / fortune. Additionally, partly because this was sponsored by the Republican (by responding to a sponsored by democratic democracy) and partly because it was just a sense of time, the film is unfortunately religious , of color and conservative. Don't waste your time on this film!
