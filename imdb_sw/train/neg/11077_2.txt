The only reason I chose to give this flick is due to the presence of Oscar Ernest Borgnine winner. All I can say is, it was a great waste of a good actor who ever put a film. As far as I could say, Borgnine was the only actor in it. Other exhibitions were very frightening, I wonder the label could pay "artists" to appear. Couples of this level of talent in the acting department and the story to plodding and fraud that I thought my eyes will begin to spread when the credit is over, and you have a full-time movie. To open the movie was made to appeal to the audience of children, and for its credit, it was better than many previous programs at the Disney Center and such a child-centered network. But honestly, that's not much to say.
