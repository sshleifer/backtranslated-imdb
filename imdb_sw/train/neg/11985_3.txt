Did you want to eat germs? Here is a 'document' to show you how! O ... baby eats germs! And that's a very interesting part of the film. <br /> <br /> This movie has been described well by old critics as rather interesting. I totally agree here. The movie just doesn't go anywhere .... unless you are an experienced bug eat! This is one movie is hard to write a spoiler for .... because nothing happens. <br /> <br /> Now for technical terms: They should give the baby a haircut. Who is trying to look like such ... Bozo Clown. It was almost fun ... I was about to turn to the shaggy dog ​​or something. <br /> <br /> And about it; The child was on the way too much to appear hungry! It should take away junk food for several weeks before opening the image. All of them, this film puts me closer to me. And my children could only handle 15 minutes before leaving the scene of something more interesting. I will admit that the environment was very awesome. And if you had a good story to go with it, it would have made a hit. It seemed to be safe for children to watch: scenes of carrying and 'eyeddball' eyeball were very weak for fear of many children, and a short 'cracking' area did not show anything. I gave him this very young.
