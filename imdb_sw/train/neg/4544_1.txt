This movie is not worth your time. His confidence in the New-Age lies is used as a half-destructive demolition. The program is one that has been reviewed regularly. <br /> <br /> I had to even spend time commenting when I noted that some have tried to pass the features of this drivel. Their activists and procedures are amazing, because it encourages not to look at the movies of the movie, but for its good intentions of the New Age strategy. Islam reinforces positively about movies / television that supports their views? Despite the negative characteristics of production, or the lack of truth in any of the supposed historical history? I don't hope. I am sure the followers will come back to me to describe the flower stories about this movie, despite the truth.
