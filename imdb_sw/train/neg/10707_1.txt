Where to start? This may be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The editor is worse, the sound effects were bad and the voice editing was hit. Many of the films that can be here are the effects of refusal, and talk back. I had to turn my volume on the perfect blast for him just what was going on ... and what did I have to hear exactly? Probably one of the worst texts ever made. I can't believe people really put green for this film. It makes me think I could take a pot in the box, and serve it to manufacturers, and then give them money for me. <br /> <br /> Dolph, was common, Dolph. There is nothing else to say. Criminals were bad, the characters were bad, and the movie was stinker. If you really want to know not necessarily do when writing, guiding or editing the movie, check out this!
