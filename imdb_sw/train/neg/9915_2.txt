I have completed the "Dark" Party "Under Monitoring" and I am happy. Surprise, not for the film, but for some rave reviews I used that helped to look at it. The story had been destroyed by the holes of the conspiracy and many of the acting are flat, making it as comedy seem appropriate. To a large extent, I found myself shaking my head and laughing in amazement as I endured this film. Justin stands in the hiding of a home with a pained mother to go to live with her father though her mother warns that father is not good. When a young woman is found to be killed, Justin accuses tenants living in nearby rooms. With the help of two pals, she installs the covert camera to put tabs on these people. As the truth begins to open, Justin reveals the unexpected secret. The best way is that Felissa Rose is HOT! I would like an extra star or two over here had explained a bit, but no luck. It would be the ability to save the favor of the film. Eric Conley played Justin very well, I thought, and I can't be surprised any more to see him in the future. The overall column of the film, though influenced by the clich√©s, may have been made if it was not a "exhibition" that emerged from the concern of key members, especially for Alexandra Eitel (Kayla) and David H Rigg (father Justin's. Fear! (remove the pun). I don't have anything against small budget films. In fact, I believe the independent film is our only hope of deciding on films in the future. I will minimize the lowest budget films of the slack when it comes to special effects, lights, even the color and quality of the overall picture. I do not give you an opportunity, however, to act on the stick of the stick with the script swiss lover's script. There are a large number of low budget films held out there. Sadly, this is not one of them. I can't help but the suspect that at least the publishers who are grateful for the "Dark Association" here is somehow related to its production.
