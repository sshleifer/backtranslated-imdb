What's a bad movie. I am so surprised that DeNiro and even Snipes will be associated with something like this. If you do a movie that involves baseball, and shows the scenes of the baseball, at least make a point to look somewhat realistic. Why was the crowd standing for any reason during sports? *** THE WORKER WORKS *** With the last place in the movie .... What was it? Somehow we are led to DeNiro who has found his way to the field with the uniform, and that game is also played in the rainy rain .... one of the worst events in the film. 3 out of 10 stars.
