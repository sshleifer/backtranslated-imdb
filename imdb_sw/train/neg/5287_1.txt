I do not know why they did this version of "Influence" when they had a good mini-day with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds. I think they wanted to make a long version, but of course much had to be deleted; alas, what ended on the floor of the refusal room was a good magic and humor, leaving a film that was just melodrama instead of exhibiting the characteristic of English and mores. Also, characters were poor and unattractive. They had Anne's poor dancing and declining down the road after Captain Wentworth as a modern modern boy (and if you happen to be a modern teenager to read this, I would like to tell you: run after a man as a woman in the heat is not cold). That is the case of a well-born woman of Napoleonic era never did, and certainly not this heroine led by the standard. Some have said they found this interesting antique; My response was not laughter, but angry. The very idea of ​​corruption as Austen's work is under contempt. It was a sudden.
