Although this is not a "great film," there is something that is compelling and memorable about it. As another provider on the film, I saw this during childhood. It has been thirty years since 1952, but I have never forgotten the story or the head of despair. See if you have a chance. You'll like a voyeur of a small town life as it continues for decades. More than any film, this brings the human face to the historic "development" of the twentieth century. It is involved enough for a small viewer and memorable enough for an old man. Additionally, it is easy to love the characters and watch their passage on time.
