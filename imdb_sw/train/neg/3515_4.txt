Basically a propaganda film of the last war. But there were a few things that hit me. First was the use of mouthed diseases. In two cases Scott's mouth, once at the first time he throws his bomb away from the target during a bomb-off ("dammit") and immediately when trying to bombardier be pilot ("s *% t"). I would be wrong on the second example but I used it again and again that's what it seems to me. The third step is when the character of Anne Shirley seeks the behavior of O'Brien to be fortunate ("Give 'em hell") on the sound of the engine. He should have thought that it was unladylike because he clearly says "heck". I have also seen behavior that has moral and bombing problems, especially civilian bombs. A top avuncular officer ensures that military targets will only be hit due to the use of bombsight. From what we know about the future of LeMay's strategy to kill the Japanese cities based on this area is not a bit. I remember being taken by the McNamara of LeMay in the "Fog of War", which affects that if the US did not win the war he would be tempted as war crimes. The latter is the destruction of the way, based on the film. Reminds me a little bit of the White Heat (I don't compare the film, just end!). Maybe it's because he is beaten. Strapped on beautiful beautiful!
