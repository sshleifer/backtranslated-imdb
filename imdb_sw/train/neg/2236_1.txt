I don't know where to start. Acting in this film was awesome, I can't remember seeing many 'characters' in one film that they could not act. Not just the worst act, the characters were too stupid. <br /> <br /> Then there are steps. I believe that even children know that when a person is shot, there is blood involved. But when someone is shot in Snitch'd for ten times (!!), there is no blood even. Well, I think it's just me. Making a short story (because I don't believe, I can continue for several hours about this film), of course it's a very bad movie I saw. This film should be a number 1 less than 100 of course.
