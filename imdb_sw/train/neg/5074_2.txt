I saw this film two weeks ago at the "Japanese news festival" in Paris. Although I did not have much expectation from them, I must say as much as many people in the audience ... if I wanted to count how I felt, I would say I compared it to the mononoke princess and nausicaa from beginning to end. Of course it's silly. But I couldn't help. The story is very different, but the worlds are shown very similar. And from this perspective, "the palme tree" certainly cannot compare with the work of Miyazaki. Even though it is quite good technically, boredom remains ... at the end its complete lack of nature makes me advise you not to look at it. I rated 2 out of 10 (slightly complicated, I think it deserves 3 or 4)
