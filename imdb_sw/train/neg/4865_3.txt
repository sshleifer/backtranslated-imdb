I just don't enjoy this film. But I love Babe, Urban pigs and ruined and talking about animal films that have been done well every way. Animals were not found. All were particularly offensive to the Rock Rock pig, but how to expect, it's Chris Rock. I believe I am thrilled once or twice in a few lines, but that's it.
