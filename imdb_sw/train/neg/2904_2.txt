If, in the first 10 minutes of this film, you do not realize that the main character, who writes an array of life advice, will have a very oh-so-clever-turned table and learn the lessons of life itself, then there is probably something wrong and you. Setting it so predictable as destroying the movie, even if all the film was good (which is not) <br /> <br /> There is almost no chemistry among the heads, and Stalker-ish's Steve Carell character is embarrassing, not funny. It is difficult to believe the character of Binoche would have any interest in him. Then they are all locked up and everyone lives happily at all times. It's not the main America!
