First, to give you an idea of ​​my taste in the cinema ... <br /> <br /> The 2007 squares I enjoyed: Superbad, Knocked Up, Hot Fuzz, Blades Of Glory <br /> Almighty, Brother Solomon, Good luck Chuck I had to follow my first instinct and shut down "Fire Rod" after I came to the point of 20 minutes. Script is quite cruel - I don't know how this monstrosity managed to delete 6 on IMD. Anyone over 10 years of age who enjoyed this should be some kind of mental damage. It does not come near anything with Will Farrell and it is clear that Andy Samberg cannot carry anything more than 5 to 10 minutes to YouTube or SNL. I don't know how they created Ian McShane and Isla Fisher in making this movie ... they should have a debt or something. I came to know that it would be a dumb movie, but I thought it would be at least to be funny. I didn't have too much smirk. <br /> <br /> I don't usually comment on movies in IMDb, but this was very bad, I had to warn people. This is just a 4th movie I have seen that I've been forced to measure the 1/10 rate.
