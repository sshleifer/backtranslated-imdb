I lost this film for a few laughs. I've never seen SNL skit, but for hits like Tommy Boy, and Waynes World, it is impossible to be bad, can it? Answer: it was. This movie was not a relaxing way after a hard day at work. I continued to wait for a strategy and a wonderful part, but it didn't have any. The view was tiffany amber thieson, and that's just about it.
