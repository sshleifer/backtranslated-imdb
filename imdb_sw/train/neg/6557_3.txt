True, They called it BRAIN in credit, not BRIAN. Well, they didn't have a player's spell budget. All production funds went to old cars. There are at least two visible Packers here. One is Darin Convertible. The Packard yellow marker turns out. The film's events show that there was money spent on clothing and decoration. Old cameras, out of Ciro's, a road sign and whatever was needed to make a visual image appearing. Written badly and led. My DVD says it runs for 104 minutes, close. It was about 85 minutes. It came to the end without reaching the conclusion. There was a collision but no conclusion. The movie just hit on credit. 99 dollars for this. I paid 99 cents for this. I could have bought 3 cans of cat food and look at my cat's face as it stirred more excitement. Just a few seconds on the Ciro area after Darren McGavin call, it looks like, maybe. .. This film would have been a surprise surprise that would make an impressive film. Then it was just there. The Latin Latin player played by Steven Bauer (Tony Montoya) could have a greater share in all that has continued here. This is made can be a good film. I think if they use part of Brian and use Steven Bauer to place it and change the script and put the Packards and lose band and add Johnny Otis sound the same band, then they have something.
