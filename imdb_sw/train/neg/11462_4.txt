I love monster movies, in general. Even if it is implausible and silly. But it is difficult to make this film impossible and feel and tries to get in itself at the same time. As with the true way. Though the idea is true, as Orcas is known to kill the Great White White, it is very difficult to find it scary when I can't help but just see the hail anger destroys the objects. Especially is the same area where another building exploded the cause of Orca to do ... and when it exploded, the object jumps out of the water and I feel like I was watching the show on the World Sea and fireworks. Plus they kill a lot of horrible moments before they know that they will happen. On top of that, it takes a few jabs on JAWS. It's like "hey look, we are truthful and we can come up with the most good reason why Orca is attacking". <br /> <br /> Yes, you ignore your outrageous **** ups in the course of course. But JAWS had one thing your movie is not recommended. It's awesome. It would have been implausible. Yes its somewhat terrible. But the reality, fact or not, Shark's Killer is not close to being scary like White White. And the poor attempt in the development of character and writing only hurt more. Even JAWS revenge is more severe than this.
