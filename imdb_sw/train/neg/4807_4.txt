"Ambushed" is not a common flick step. It's too bad to be normal. One man is walking towards another with a machine gun. Another person drives the round and tells the man with a great fire of fire without even nick from the rain rain. I think it's a good person. Duh. That's "Ambushed" through and through. It is not a good step, not a good game, not a good film, "Ambushed" fails at all levels and has been beaten by B-fighters who are making the way as close as they know they are really losing. Not recommended for anyone. <br /> <br />
