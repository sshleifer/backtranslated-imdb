This movie is about a very good Olympic tracking star which has been employed to teach a basketball team of high school boys. Similar to WILDCATS of Goldie Hawn, it's star Cathy Lee Crosby in the role of the head, and does as well as the script allows. I think Racquel Welch would be the best choice, but based on the film's visual film film, perhaps they could not afford. Cathy Lee looks good at every shot, but we can't see her completely. Stories are good predictable, say at least, offering no. Michael Biehn is a young and lucky man has a role to play in the male. She is a star on the team and also a passion for love for Cathy Lee. Keenan Wynn has a few interesting events as a rich man who runs a sports program and doesn't think a woman should teach sports. This step has brought in all the film, and, without saying, it's a date. Surprisingly, Cathy Lee did not set up his team through any inappropriate exercise sessions; he doesn't have any male coach did not. There is a strong player who plays a long and non-aggressive player who enters hypnosis to get his classes and play as a basketball player in Sydney Wicks. It seems like everyone had a good time to make this film, but the only reason to see it is Cathy Lee Crosby. He is not a good actor, but he has an amazing smile, beautiful hair, and a very tan body.
