I love music but if a Dickens fan I hate this. ** INVESTMENTS OF LOCATION ** Hungry boys who have enough energy to sing and play in workhouse? London's poor come to sing? Fagin and Dodger are going away the sun? Not faithful to the novel. I remember, Dodger was tied to the public by Fagin and went to jail. ** The End of the Few ** <br /> <br /> Oliver Reed is very weak like Sykes, doing a bit more than growing to show his evil. Worse, it is Mark Lester as Oliver, who often comes very responsive to the wonder if he's the main character. His performances were not helped by the fact that the best they can do while singing is dub in the girl's voice. I think they didn't realize that this boy could be found next to every British church. Respecting Dickens' fans: stick to an amazing 1948 movie of David Lean or the BBC's change at 6th -80s. Avoid this beat of white music.
