What a desire! This movie seemed to be trying to hit the comedy 'cutting edge' but the direction and script was sloppy, sick and feeling in the worst movie. The work of Jack Black / role was independent and engaging with ... and other characters were similar to unmasking and uninteresting. The voice of sound was stirring. We are (WERE) Black fans but none of us did more than forcing the titter for a while. Why did she feel she needed to make this mistake? We cannot watch other films without reading the first review carefully! Did you drink it when he read the script before signing it with this drivel?
