This was for a short time very bad desires. Far from the worst reform of my favorite novels. The discussion was very frightening; I can't hear feelings behind the words made by the characters. Lines were given very quickly and feel rather than place. They can also as described by the image. Chemistry between George C. Scott and Susannah York did not exist and watched American Rochester saw the wonder. He would have at least tried to make a British accent. I love George C. Scott as an actor, but this didn't work. I felt like I was looking at the highlights from Jane Eyre, where the main pieces of information were placed with us regardless of the flow of stories. Good and all music were very good, but I can't feel no passion and love that should be between Jane and Rochester and the movie has left me completely without unmoved. If you want to see a new edition of Jane Eyre I recommend watching the 1983 edition of the BBC and Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke or the 1997 edition and Ciar√°n Hinds and Samantha Morton. Now these two are a brilliant change.
