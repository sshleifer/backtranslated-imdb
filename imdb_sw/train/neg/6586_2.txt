If you appreciate the fear of Asia, do not bother with the Branch. The film deserves to mention along the list of functions such as Ringu, A Tale of Sisters Two, Treatment, and Ju-On (or even good material like The Eye or Inner Senses). Such films are subtle, anticipated images, rich characters, and for non-Western decisions take what it takes. The branch is closed with the remaining ingredients and the organs of everything that has caused lousy of America's fearsome twenty-five years ago. The movie tries to combine the story of the Asian spirit with the Flick's Hollywood film, but it's bad. Aesthetic one must smother the other; guess what? Nor do they have their own story telling the film representatives lose Ringu to the blow of the evil child, but the situation is hopeless. Clich√©s, crap characters, plot plot, light soul, hum.
