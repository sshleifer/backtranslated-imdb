The old mentality talks about what he is looking at in the movies. You get your Hitchcock, your Chaplin, Bergman and other items before 80ies. To hide that they have no clue going on the movies today, he gives us in the Matrix. But it is not just a film-of-the-art event that has emerged again. This speech has been reduced to the physiological behaviors of the past: it is ego-super ego, anal phase, lack of gender. It is decorated with the good effect of having Zizte edited on the movie he takes. For someone who should know a lot about movies, he is himself, speaking on movies: yeiks. Try to put it in the words of Zikhali - I saw 5 - 7 7 screens, last night, or in the words of the most famous movie player: <br /> <br /> Mr.. (Zizek), what you just said is one of the most trustworthy things I've ever heard of. At any time in your flight, the most unusual response was almost anything that could be considered an intelligent thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for being listened. I give you (two) points (only), and God be merciful to your soul.
