Tobe Hooper is the most likely type of fear that should give. As another fan of panic, I loved the Chainsaw of Texas, but I think that in order to put your name on the front of the film, you should have at least one movie to hit. I can't think of any other Hooper movie has made (alone, not counting the calculation of the Poltergeist) that has helped a lot of kind of fear or the world of film. With this film, the Night Terror, it just returns on my point. <br /> <br /> Bad Robert Englund, I give him credit for at least doing good work with bad material given. He did what he could. And for the film itself? Dure bad. Non-compulsory events every five minutes, a story that must be written in our environment, and very strange, music, and movies. Nothing in this film is being redeemed. Don't waste your time. Overall, 1 out of 10. I feel sad for Hooper, his job seems like it was up before he had started. I hope that he can push out at least one more beautiful, in that way he can make his state of justice. <br /> <br />
