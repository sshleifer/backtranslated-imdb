I think I've seen the worst movie, but that could be becuz I am jaded so to what extent these horror movies are. Something to kill an animal is very bad, essentially its young in a suit of green suit. There is much worse to work as B to go, but don't think for this second was anything, no gehenna. In fact he had a plot and substance, but he was still a fool. Basically it's just a bad movie of the terrible budget. But at least its not as bad as titanic, that movie takes the balls, this just sucks. The blood looks really fake in this film. That is one complaint I have about all the fears of a new millinium, a minimum of year, seems to be a fool. Wonderful death scene and a real fake blood is stupid. At least there was a good swimming area
