I went to see this film and the best prospects. I saw the original movie Jacquet (penguins demonstration) and I have heard a very good review of this on the radio. However, I was very discouraged. Above all, this movie is very boring. In fact nothing will happen. I tried to explain the contents of the film to a friend, and we all ended up laughing because I could only strengthen things like "well during the winter coming, and then, and then there is an eagle, and a river, and one time is dark, and a girl goes to the cave, and sometimes the fox has children ‚Äùand so on. After about half an hour I started to buy, smell, stretch my eyes, and criticized the inspector at the radio station, and was sure it would soon be. But the movie continued to continue. When it finally ended I was very low in my seat that I must have looked like Stephen Hawking. The most traumatic parts of the film are (a) a girl, who is obviously there to give a child to recognize. She wears the same clothes in the whole movie (one year), and shows two face words: Fun and Great. He is good, no question about it. However, movies about the beauty of nature like this would have done well without its all-and-human presence. I found myself always hoping that he would be killed by a shoulder, taken into a river, or something terrible. (b) Definition of the voice of a young girl, which tells us anything but simple, obvious, positive, things. (c) Music, which does not know fraud. When a girl rides around, the music jumps around, too. When the fox is threatened by eagles, music threatens, too. It reminded me of the very early days of film making, and it was also predictable to enjoy. In fact, many of the children who saw the movie and I made it clear like that, at least they have emerged somehow. Therefore, my warning is only about adults: If you are over ten years old, try this film. You can get better sleep (and cheap) in many other places.
