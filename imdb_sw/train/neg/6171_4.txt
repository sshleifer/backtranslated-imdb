Well. this was not surprising. Many people will tell you this is gory. but they all speak "shiztz" this film is very slowly <br /> <br /> It starts with another person who makes a concoction to hear the pain he calls "son" there are some gory events but i see them weak. you can also fly 40 minutes of the movie and get to the eye area that was awesome and despicable. there are some really stupid scenes in this. and they beat on hits and beaten with the sound of a fake hitting sound that makes a laugh! I would not recommend. look at the hounds of the year. Look at this if you want the last 20-10 minute that is not surprising and has a random location for someone trying to rape her mother.
