Hello I am from Denmark, and one day I had a movie evening with my friends. Someone brought this film to him "Russian Terminer" and was very bad. After looking at less than half a minute we decided to move on to the "most important" things or I should say "important things" on the film. In fact I was very surprised to know that this film was released here in Denmark my country ... which must have been the biggest mistake this country ever made.
