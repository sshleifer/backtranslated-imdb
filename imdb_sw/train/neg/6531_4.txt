First, I would like to say that the comments of the user only left me with tears in my eyes for laughing. One view that the bad SF movies are good comedies are right on the score. MST3000 made it live from it. If you look at the PLANET PLANET, like a 10-year-old reader of a book from 1959, you will have to deal with this sauce. All components are there: pseudoscience, frequent logic, often often hilariously synonymous. The boy's perspective on sex, and the captain of the "gigolo" (calling on one man, boys!) Making his eyes on the "scientist" of the buxom and the hair so red is amazing is not recommended for hot alarms. Mars's deception of the planet as a planet is a stranger that everything eliminates red, but one alien animal has the face of a mouse, and a visitor of a blob has a round eye like a baby's toy. Comic support, an overweight astronaut (!) Who looks like he did not finish the eighth grade in Brooklyn and has a psychological fixation on his ray gun. And of course, the only fact that the alien = dangerous risk. If these people met E.T., they could stab him in two seconds flat! "OW" really! Do not do it wrong. I tested this movie below. However, it has never been bad (unless a scientist tries to define everything - just make it more louder and more), and you must confess, in your little child, lets you fly a few times. Well, then don't accept it. I think he never ever 10.
