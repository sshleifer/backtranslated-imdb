First of all he had nothing in this movie that has helped me completely. It was not a bad movie, just another movie where I said "Well, that wasn't something special" after I had seen it. There is a possibility of a game with things, but it just didn't take, but more locked by half. As I said in the headline has opened a cheap way. The quality of the film itself (photo) is seamless as the lowest quality and reminds me of the cheapest made for TV film than the most popular English film manufacturer. Camera angles and shots were very amateur as in my opinion. He did not have close shots or similar effects to produce interesting events. I have not seen many English movies and what I have seen are not much more interesting than this and have made such as the work of the camera, color and so forth. "The game" tried to be more cool, hip & smart (see my comment "Lola Rennt" about this if you want), but it didn't work for me either. In general only a small movie that was not something special (better, I'm afraid) and basically unfortunately more than two hours to pass.
