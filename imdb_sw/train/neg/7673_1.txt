I don't know where to start. Tara Reid needs to be stopped before putting on another film. Stephen Dorff looks like he got the impetus from Val Kilmer on "Top Gun". Slater sleeps this way. Trends, editing, sound (we need a real metal video in the middle of the gun?), Clothing (shooting and muscle fabrics on them), and hey, no plot known either. It is interesting that nobody was involved with the project stood up and said, "hey guys, this is not any meaning, let's start over". Hope the work of the slater can be increased from this tragedy. Hands under the worst films I saw.
