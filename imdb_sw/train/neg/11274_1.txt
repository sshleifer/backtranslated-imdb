In order to get fellow filmmakers to find out about this film, I have decided to write another review. I missed a few things last ... <br /> <br /> First, the script. Second, acting. Third, Jesus Christ were thinking of making a piece of rubbish like this and then expecting us to enjoy when no items redeem any from the beginning to the end unless Joseph Fiennes finally gets fired into a very scandalous scandal !!! <br /> <br /> I can't believe I lost my money on this when I could give someone without shelter or busker or something else! <br /> <br /> What! you get a picture?
