There are movies that are bad, and there are very bad movies that seem to be reserved and unknown. Also, many violence and bad things (not just cheesy items, you know what I mean) add a mix too. What are the consequences of bad movies and such a good content? Why, "Last Judge," of course! <br /> <br /> Remember "Mitchell?" Joe Don Baker was the star of the movie, and that was taken by Joel and Bots on "The Secret of Theater Science 3000." Now this time, with Mike taking Joel's place on Satellite Satellite (but with the same bots), the trio enjoyed the second of MST3K's Joe Don Baker movie, "Justice Final". Of course, many of the wrong things I mentioned were removed for the release of television, but still, I want to look at that part (and "Mitchell" too), why Joe Don "hates" more? Why, no one except "The Secret of Theater Science 3000!" <br /> <br /> P.S. If you have Big Lots around, check out the shop with uncut tape! LOL Happened to another user!
