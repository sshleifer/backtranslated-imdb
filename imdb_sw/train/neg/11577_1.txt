The director is trying to make Quentin Tarantino, journalists trying to make Tennessee Williams, Deborah Kara Unger trying to make Faye Dunaway, late James Coburn trying to become Orson Welles, Michael Rooker trying to get Gene Hackman, Mary Tyler Moore trying to get Faye Dunaway (old age) Cameron Diaz tries to leave it as quickly as possible (can), don't ask about Joanna Going. Eric Stoltz and James Spader are trying to hide their shame with these crappy things. It provides useless and useless discussions and very small steps. Tulsa is an ideal city for elevating elevator, a modern art church and Bruce Goff and a beautiful, decorative house with Frank Lloyd Wright. Visit Tulsa, don't watch this film. It doesn't make the right place.
