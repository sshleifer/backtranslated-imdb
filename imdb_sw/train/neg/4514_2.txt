The problem with the book, "Memoirs of Geisha" is that it had Japanese faces but under the faces it was the way of the American man to think. Reading the book is like watching a wonderful ballet with music, sets, and many clothes are still carried out by animal animals dressed in these garments? So far from the Japanese ways of thinking were characters. <br /> <br /> The movie is T about Japan or real geisha. It is a story about a few ideas of American men on Japan and a filtered geisha with their own ignorance and evil ideas. So what is this film if it's not about Japan or geisha? What? Is fantasy fresh as many people have said? Yes, but why make it a fantasy of America? There were many lost opportunities. Consider the culture where there is no puritanical inputs, no relation to sin regarding sex. Sex is normal and normal. What? How is sex treated in this film? Right. As it was dirty. The closest thing to the sex scene in the movie has to squeeze its nose and destroying with sores for five seconds as a person trying to fetch him had dropped a few bugs on his hip. Is there anyone who enjoys sex on this film? Don't. One character is said to be evil but whatever we see is dismissing her partner because it looks like they don't want to be infected to do something dirty. Traditional American culture has no place in the movie about the Japanese geisha. Does Zion enjoy its first pleasure with the old codger after its cherry hit auction? Don't. He is lying there as a cold slab of meat on the block. Of course he should not enjoy. And that's what I mean about this movie. Why couldn't they give him something to enjoy? Why should all sex be sinful and improper? <br /> <br /> Behind the Chair of the Chairman was the secret steward of Assyria, and thus was behind the auction of his virginity. He could conquer the auction and conquer himself. Nobu did not even go. So why did the chairman leave the old codger to win it and, reeking the old-man stink, get his fingers on his naked body? What? Any woman who will really forgive someone for that? Try to understand this. Since the back of the Chairman the debtor received a debt for the training of the geisha. In order to repay his debts the Chairman had been sold by Dr Crab. Through the Mayor the Chairman bought the mercy of Zion for the old geezer so that the Chairman could give money from him. The chairman was not his supervisor. She was her pimp! Some stories of romantic love. Yes, the film is good but it's like the beauty of a very interesting transvestite, whose voice, appearance and every touch is exciting. But under the very same female surface is the secret of evil. Under the unfavorable face of the Japanese film hides the secrets that the heart, soul, spirit and the basis of this film are completely American and male. It is no better if it tries to be contrary to lies, distortions, and innocence. <br /> <br /> Some differences between Japan and MOAG: <br /> <br /> Japanese style? Refined, elegant simplicity. MOAG style? Peking Opera. <br /> <br /> Japanese geisha ?? Hair has crossed. MOAG geisha ?? Hairy hair that should certainly be filled with gunked up in a good vein of white makeup. <br /> <br /> Japan carving ice - Japanese is very strict about seasonal celebrations. Artificial ice is to treat summer. MOAG shaving ice - Chair buys Chiyo, Little Sayings played by Suzuka Ohgo amazing, this is treating during the flowering season. The thoughts made my whole body cool. <br /> <br /> Japanese geisha ?? Skilled and skilled workers. MOAG geisha - sluts. > ch - katika kiv kiv kiv kiv MOAG wind chime - bell door! If someone stood in front of someone else's house and shouted the wind and the wind would be considered to be at the end, not to enter. Japan / Japan? Emphasize on human relations, the target group. MOAG ?? "I want a life that is mine" American freedom. <br /> <br /> Japanese traditional dance? Elegance refined. Almost the geometric accuracy and mechanical. MOAG ?? Martha Graham returning out of LSD wearing a shroud of Japanese funeral is not surprising. It is done by geisha under the ramp where it looks like a strip club? Ha ha ha! Is a strip club where they did their most research on geisha? <br /> <br /> Japan fire house? Setting or even allowing a fire break is worse than murder because it creates a serious threat to the community. Fire can break through cities, towns, and cities that destroy hundreds or thousands of houses and kill as many people. MOAG's house - Great around the battlefield but there is zero damage and because it does not need any extra fire outside it. Essentially the movie ended here because in very little Science it would have been closed and united with her sister among those who had never heard it. Where Arthur's Golden and Rob Marshall should be transferred. It is enough. The movie is facing.
