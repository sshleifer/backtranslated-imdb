The actual blow of the real film. This British film is boringly made. <br /> <br /> It is an exciting plot! Fighters place bombs on the train. How do the authors and producers of this stinker become a bad story? Glenn Ford, as an expert who wanted to eliminate a bomb, has been given a bad writing tool to work with. Usually, as he is called, his wife, Anne Vernon, is about to leave. No wonder we never heard of Miss Vernon's news. After the film, it will be enough to stop its work. The old man who loved the train and the intervention is the 1953 democratic edition. I thought it was sad to show this person, even at the end.
