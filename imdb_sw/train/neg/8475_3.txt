(NOTE: I thought I would be just one writing what I did down here, but I see others agreed. I think it was clear - this had led to a bit bait. for two weeks - a trip to California - leaving cats (Sylvester) alone and locked inside the house. That means no milk, but the cat, for its pardon, gets a bunch of tons of cans. However, in his despair, he can not get the application. <br /> <br /> Turns a little mouse into the house has ... and it cuts the cat with it. This is a useful mouse that continues to hate Sylvester and opener and then leave it off for the second second. Sylvester tries everything possible to open the capabilities of the but we can't do it. <br /> <br /> This is an exciting story, and why they make the sad "good" mouse is more than me. It's like some of Tom & Jerry's cartoons where Tom's poor gets very bad even though a small mouse often starts a crisis!
