This movie was the same, but it actually surpasses the claim that homosexuals are “born that way,” especially when a woman can overcome unhappy marriage and fall into another woman's hands. It's almost as if the gender preferences of Kate turn around and turn off as a switch, and make this film look very easy. Also, as is the case with films trying to move the agenda, it was unfortunate that those characters in the film who had questions or refuses on homosexual life were called as "bigots." And there was no middle of happiness. It was Kate's friends and his brothers caught him or they totally rejected him. This is not usually a partnership between marriage and non-gay relatives and friends. It is usually a combination of feelings and values ​​used. It is possible to love people and treat them with respect while not necessarily approving the choices they make. Sadly, the film did not show any of these types of partnerships. With a movie trying to show patience and acceptance, it struck me like a non-stop movie! Then at the end, Kate seems to decide after all these years she wants to have a Mac and everything is hunky dory - is that what being gay is really all about? Come!
