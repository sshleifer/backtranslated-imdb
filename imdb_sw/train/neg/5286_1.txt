I am a great fan of Jane Austen and I ordered a movie from Amazon.UK so we can see it without waiting for ever to come to U.S. I had to save my money. Does it include Anne driving after Wentworth? All of the behavior of Anne Elliot's behavior was that she was calm and cleaned. He is not an inspiration and evil. And Mary, was she suffering from a stroke or something? His words were not ordinary, and he was going to normal. There was no chemistry among the two main characters who did all their "romance" impossible. In the last area they also have Sally Hawkins dressed in the same dress as Amanda Root wore during the letter area. The clothes don't make the movie. In my opinion they did not look at the 1995 edition, which was wrong, was close to the book. The book, I don't think they read it. This is kind of a movie of Cliff's Notes of Persuasion. Dial on all the above points without explaining anything.
