I bought this exciting film for beauty, high up, beautiful for blood. I didn't find one of them. This film fails with each level, not horrible, or awesome, just awesome filming, and does not give the audience anything. The worst is that apart from being as raw, violent and cruel as it has been, there is little violence. There is almost no blood selected, and no excitement. Working, leadership and discussion cannot fail. True, it is really laughable. I could hardly sit through this garbage immediately; I certainly never want to look at it again. Do not waste your time and waste of celluloid like this; it is certainly the worst movie ever made. If I could give a star, I would.
