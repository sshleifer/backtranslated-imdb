I wanted to watch this film, but a strange event after another forced me to close. Character does not seem to touch anything. Consider this: Heath Ledger walks at night (through the graves I believe) when he is struck by a spirit, which drives them away. Once this trouble she walks quietly and meets a friend who saw it all. When asked what happens says blandly "attacked by demons, nothing big.", If this is a little more exciting than a flat tire <br /> <br /> I close when they go to ask something - a demon or something, I stopped managing answer. The answer can only be borrowed from the person who has the power of their death, and the priest looks at what seems to be an unconscious anger if someone is bound and beaten and they ask his question, the question of the body of death. <br /> <br> 0 among **** stars.
