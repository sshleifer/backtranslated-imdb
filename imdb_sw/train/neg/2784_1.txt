My husband and I are the parents of the little boy who lived in the same town as the author of this film. We were so angry that JCC brings this film to its Jewish film festival because of the way that Frankie's mental disability is shown. We went to see this film at the playground when you left. We demanded money again. We encourage the scribe to provide a financial contribution to the Achad's JCC program to apologize. We don't like to see Frankie - mentally disabled and maybe even an autistic boy - as part of a joke that he keeps leaving something to watch the breast of nanny. <br /> <br /> There was no guarantee for Frankie's behavior rather than saying "hey, being disabled mind is funny." Challenges such as Frankie are a great thing. Families like me are really suffering. <br /> <br /> The screen saver needs to describe. Does he know families with children with disabilities? Does he see families with children with disabilities a week after week at the JCC dam?
