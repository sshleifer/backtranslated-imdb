Christopher Durang must have been taught by a memorable nun, because he can not only allow the concept. Playing, "Sister Mary Ignatius Explains All For You," was presented - at least in Hollywood - with the same sounds as Diane Keaton's writing here. Sister Mary was not stirred, shade, satire of bitter nunely courage, doctrinaire and very judgmental - and if played by Lynn Redgrave, was hilarious. But the movie insists that we take this shortage seriously - when, as described, to maintain the same voice in "all things that describe". These two ways are facing the head and in the last twenty minutes, the movie goes off and tracks, climbs into the river, and explodes. No victims. It can work, like the sound of events with the four old students, and meet them with Sister Mary, beaten as the events of Sister Mary. Or if Mary's festivals were more presented in fact. This method does not work at all.
