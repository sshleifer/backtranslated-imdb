The Naschy's 1974 error is led by Leon Klimovsky, and the salary outlook on photography and broadcasting can enable you to believe that this long-term collision is between "Inquisition" and "Sadomania". Unfortunately not. This is the only thing of PG and the torture process, there is no dirt and slight edge. Naschy (who I am a fan) drives his things like Gilles de Lancre, "antiguo Mariscal de la nacion". Sadly he is hosting more than everything else. Someone gets the impression of this film that we have seen (and that) has made it all before. So absolutely with Naschy completed only.
