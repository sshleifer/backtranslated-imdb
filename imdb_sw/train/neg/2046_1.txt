I can't believe that this film has made it a video, and the rental video stores like to put it on their shelves. I literature requested the restoration. Remove the fact that the movie has no historical facts, and it is still the worst movie found in the video store. It is not very good called a movie B tested. Don't waste your money or your time on this film. Just a top voice list and awesome music make me sick. Anyone involved with this film should be drawn from the coalition, gives the industry a black mark, but after looking beyond this film I think anyone involved is a member of the union.
