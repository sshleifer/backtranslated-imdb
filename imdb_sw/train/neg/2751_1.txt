I hate even losing time it takes to write 10 lines on this hostility. Hyung-Rae Shim is fortunate that the bad decision of the film is not a big crime or he could be killed twice by writing and leading these disasters. I wonder that this film had a budget of 75 million dollars, but it really enjoys because it was so great, which Shim would trust, never get another film all life and therefore, not to lose any more than the film time. I would like to think the actors would get together and give him lynched at the moment. <br /> <br /> With the impact of resources available to them, a great film can be made with this budget. Typically, failure must have been seen at the beginning with a bad script and story. "Transformers" was another visible feast with a weak script, but this makes it seem like "Citizen Kane".
