I was browsing it via Netflix and I was hit by this film. After a good book reference as a child, I decided to investigate this. This is the film you should adopt. It is not just worth seeing. It's very boring and not interesting. I feel that it will even be that way for young children. You have no magic who has a deep book. This movie is not bad, but you will only find it ten minutes in it. <br /> <br /> There are times that just come as weird. The character of the witch is not very good. The family does not make a big deal that these unusual things happen. I know this is a children's movie, since the older audience should not look very much in things, but the whole movie feels like written and produced by people who have never had experience to make the film before. <br /> The DVD that I had jumped at the end of the film, and instead of trying to fix it I just turned it off and took it to Netflix. I didn't care how to finish. Skip this film and read the book instead.
