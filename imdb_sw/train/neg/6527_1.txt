Certainly no Saturday morning TV show of children has never done it wrong. After all, the producers had to count the return audience. In fact, in this bad offering, they could at least count the money stored on the set. Script may be refusing from long-forgotten space serial opera, and a few smarmy lines added to the cool-dude Gerald Mohr murmuring to Naura Hayden. No director can do anything with respect to the story of such a loony, so the only steps plods boringly together. Props spaceship is amazing - Bulova's wall clock and printing style, for example - but a set of planets should be worst in movie history. Many are non-hygienic drawings, and all are given in red light that is not made often. Even Mohr's smell is used as prop. And it's bad - like tip-thin as a plot. Any observer who can do this at the end of this film will hear a message from the Martians - and perhaps agree completely!
