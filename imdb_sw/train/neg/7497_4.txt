After seeing the trailer of this movie and finding Spike Lee leading, I was glad to hear about this event. I was not living then, I did not live in New York, so I expected more of history than anything. I found it an interesting act, a lot of sex, and about 30 minutes of film that had anything to do with Sam's Son. I think the film was not about Sam's son, but it was special in summer '77. Write my passport. <br /> <br />
