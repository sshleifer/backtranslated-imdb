if you did not live in the 90s or did not listen to rapper in !! This movie may be the same for you, but anyone for any fan or anyone who has ever heard this rap film was awesome and there was no uncertainty in the film where I said it was interesting or not. The other thing that seemed to me was seen as anything in his life made it was so easy there was a struggle that made the jail looking easy, selling drugs, and even forbidding it was not true. I think if the movie released for 15 years now can have more impact maybe !!! Good rap movies come out and come out, get rich or die without trying to be bad
