If I was spontaneous in this script with a text form I do not read and maybe I will laugh. I can't, however, laughing in the movies where the director seems to want me to laugh. Although I still don't know where they are. I don't care if this is Woody Allen, this author cannot write a discussion, or at least he can't write a discussion and then draw a show from artists who can draw laughter from even more clowns. For example: <br /> <br /> (paraphrase) "I am an artist, I am looking for work in art." Well, so it says the truth but honestly, you know of artists who would say so? How can you respond? <br /> <br /> "Really? The gallery that would have thought?" <br /> <br /> The entire script is full of tawdry quasi-intellectualism that I could not expect from the respected author. I agree that I don't know any other work of Allen, and to judge for this I didn't want to start learning. The characters are disgusting without discrimination, an attempt to show that we are all facing humanity conditions? Or really write the odds? You have to be a judge.
