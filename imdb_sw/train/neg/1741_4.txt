Priyadarshan / Paresh Rawal combo has become a gold pre-interested in HERA PHERI and so I entered the film (in Multiplex of Hindi) with great hope, especially after promos. Unfortunately, as HULCHUL before him, this film was a great disappointment. As others said, the film's foundation, which has started starting, is available and continue without any development or additional layout. After a while, you just want the movie to stop so that you can return home (if I was looking at this home, it would be very easy to reduce my losses). The performance of Akshay Kumar is more moderate and John Abraham should not try to make the comedy again. The comedy issues of the movie were generally a good week. I just remember mixing as a whole film twice. Of course there is no mutual mutation that used me in HERA PHERI or even a little at AWARA PAAGAL DEEWANA. Paresh Rawal had a very short time to expect, but in general, because his role and behavior were not given a great opportunity to grow, he had no significant impact on this film. <br /> <br /> Neha Dhupia, who just makes a look at the film, was happy to watch when she was on the screen. And some songs are fun. Especially the opening and closing songs of ADA and KISS ME BABY, respectively. Otherwise, you are better off just passing on this film.
