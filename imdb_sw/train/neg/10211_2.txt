Except for accepting some good movies, I can't say something positive about this film. One real issue is the problem of the protagonist if you remain with his young friends in a troubled world or leave them to take his own life. Many "strong emotional" incidents do not go with this plot and, because of bad behavior, also fail to create the expected conditions. The director can only set up an problem with Anthony and eventually bring a simple solution. The characters don't seem to turn, though it's difficult to talk characters ... maybe except for Sonny. Besides, actors don't play much and when some of them should be, they emerge as they prefer to isolate themselves. I wonder what destroyed the movie more: the top script, giving us all the potential of the plot, or the worst acting, disrupting any appeal that can be left.
