Sorry to report that I have seen this film several times. When you hit the bomb at the box office, it was repeated at night for HBO. And I watched it regularly because the TV is generally bad - or it was then. No more, so it may be strange now - like Samuel L Jackson says about the pig, "It can taste like a sweet potato, but I will never know you because I can't eat a bad shepherd." Let's see. Dudley plays Arthur walking in the wilderness, always a few steps behind Moses. It came out after Bryan's Life, so you can assume where this inspiration came from. A few good bits go too long until you close your eyes and stretch your teeth. There is one place that Arthur and Dom Deluise met in the wilderness, both of them found out and give, thirsty. Then they meet as old friends who did not know very well, promising to eat lunch. It can be interesting. But the place that I have clearly remembered is the meeting with pharao which pharao is a black street boy made in the full King Tut. He must have read the verses directly because at some time before the release, they exceeded his area with the same Hollywood Hollywood number given by Jimmy Walker wannabe (Kid Dyno-wannabe). Or could it be Jimmy Walker - who knows? Who cares. They could turn into a basically boring base within a very, very unpretentious racist, a very long piece of dirt, one of the things that will not be able to blow, no matter how many times you want it, so get away from somebody else to handle. <br /> <br /> That's my opinion. If you rent this movie (don't know, what you are doing!) Prepare a tequila bottle with six packs of Corona. Now that you have changed Poseiden Adventure, this one is probably top on the list of remakes. Maybe they will employ a comedy writer at this time.
