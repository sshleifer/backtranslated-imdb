Nell tells Theo to let him go by his hand because he hurts him. Nell then looks at Theo, who is several feet away and knows it is not Theo holding his hand. In the latest version, Nell sleeps alone in bed, when suddenly he leaves and blows slides on the floor. It is only when he says that the power that seems to stop him from recognizing what happened. And anyone can describe what Nell's last words means - "It's about family." It is always on the family "? It is one of the liberation systems of Lili Taylor, but even this can not store the film. In the beginning, Claire Bloom had persuaded her sexual influence. Zeta-Jones, however, it is appropriate to announce it, for example, by asking Nell if she has a partner - or a partner. and the meaning of remake.
