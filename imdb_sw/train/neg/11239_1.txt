Listen to the background of the scenes! Many people leave a good comment on this film should get credit. This is an awesome film every way. Imagine high school children without money and no sense of humor to make a video of slasher / comedy. They would receive D for this. College children will receive F or ask to leave school. Since this monstrosity was made by "Experts" I believe that there is a prison time or at least a movie screening. I enjoy watching bad movies like "Outdoors 9 From Out" but, this doesn't even happen in that category. Script, acting, voice, and lead are very bad to be unknown. If you like to enjoy bad films that hit the stick with Ed Wood, the printing, or the 1970s.
