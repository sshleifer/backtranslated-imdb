It seems that the intention of the film was to show the odds (maffia-like) of the Russians, or at least one of these Russians could travel outside their great country; that is very easy to steal the bank in the UK; and that the British police are not so good that they cannot see someone who robs the bank even when these subjects come from the air. In addition, Nicole Kidman and his Russian-speaking colleagues spoke a language that has not yet been recognized anywhere, perhaps spoken by Guests in the Ural Mountains, but far from being one of the Russian. So Nicole, if you want to speak Russian, kindly go to Moscow or St. Petersburg and establish yourself and learn a lot of Russian grammar and pronunciation.
