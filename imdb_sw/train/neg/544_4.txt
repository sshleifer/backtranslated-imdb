PROS: Akshay Kumar's performance (is it just me or does this one manage AB in their movies together?). Some touch scenes in the second half. CONS: The entire 1 hour (joke is flat to say a little). Each area involving Rajpal Yadav. The worst in the decisions of AB. Let me do the same, he believes cruelly to insult his son's every way (possible to destroy their relationship more than rehabilitation) is the best way to make Akshay finally take responsibility and tell the truth? WTF? He sees Akshaye is too soft to bear the fact that his old father will soon die of cancer, but he thinks insulting him will make him stronger? What? Am I the only one who doesn't make sense here? Easily the largest film of the film. <br /> - Akshay being human. LMAO! We are told he completed 1 college each year and has a degree in MBA. But when you come to join yourself, with his pregnant wife, she becomes a cheat. LOL !! Are you actually asking for a normal job in the field of ur? Or Heck, anywhere else where ur life does not live in danger? This is some dumb writing. <br /> <br /> - Last. I hate this kind of spiritual values. Everything pushes down our throat to feel sorry for AB's behavior, which I couldn't. Another thing reminded very little Srk in KHNH (which I hate). This "Please feel sad for the person who has the disease". I felt more like puking than sympathy for an old man. Couldn't check at the end of 20 minutes or so because of it and so you had to install fast. the whole thing. <br /> <br /> Underneath: Waqt is also dumb being called a good movie. Its direct director Vipul Shah stressed this for emotional and chicas emotional and oldies who can care less about the story that really is meaningful. Give 'picturizations of a decent song, fancy dress, a lot of events filled with glycerini and the power of the stars and they will be happy to blow-up like this.
