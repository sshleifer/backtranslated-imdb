When you get your hands on the UK film you expect some quality. And when it comes to acting, camera function, lighting etc; This film has a business. It is made by highly skilled students. That alone can bring you one and a half hours of fun. But when you look under the layers of profession, you don't get anything. In addition to making you feel comfortable and advocating for freedom of drug, there is nothing here. The script is mediocre, the plot is predictable and the end should be one of the worst east of Hollywood. In all of the English beauty, it's just a shy and stupid effort to make another "Full Monty". Why did they make this film? I have no clue, unless you make money of course.
