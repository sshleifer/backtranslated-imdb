Entertainment of the comedy solid, with the importation of music, producing fast speed that runs the case along with tempo zestful through a maze of humorous and chiller problems. Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosi and Peter Lorre create a strong villainy power. The script contains all the contents of the hidden films, secret fabrics, thunder and lightning and toxic arrows. Karloff, Lugosi and Lorre go with strong ingredients and definite melodramatics of the gas era. Kay Kyser and his band offered great entertainment to people living in the 1940s who were trying to forget about the terror of World War II.
