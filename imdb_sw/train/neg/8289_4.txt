Sorry, but this is a very bad movie is hilarious. Football fighters compete in travel lodges? Suti? Includes? Alan obviously had no idea what he was talking about when he did this, it's far from the truth as you can get. <br /> <br /> Compose was angry ... Gary Oldman as a football koligan? It will not seem to be frightening, frightening or even coming as someone who would like football. And to Yeti? What? What is hell? Suits, shadows and stay in travelodge children when they meet for "for a time on your time". Please. Is the Yeti group breaking the ICC underwear? I don't see how anyone can take this film seriously! <br /> <br /> 4/10. His most unlikely possibilities of the nineteen years of crisis I have seen.
