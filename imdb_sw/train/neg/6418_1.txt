I would like to start by saying I'm not a fan of awesome movies. I've never looked at them. I would like to tell you about my experience ... <br /> <br /> The only reason I watched this film is because my girl and friends wanted to see it nice. <br /> <br /> ... I've never seen the Legs of Fun, but I'm sure it's better than this movie ...? However, we did not expect to be good ... we just went to laugh. Cool with me ... I have the problem of destroying the movie for others in the theater but because they were just other couples talking and doing, he didn't mean. After 15 minutes, 2 other people who went into Borat, the movie could see again on this. The movie was not scary, and not so stupid it would be funny ... it was just boring. It was not as horrible as "Baby Genuises" of horror, it was terrible as ... not entertainment at all. Avoid. <br /> <br /> Now I'm not an expert, but it seems a problem with the panic industry these days is that you can be afraid of PG-13 which is boring and not afraid, or you may have a bad movie of fear that either blood too much or too hateful to people. <br /> <br /> You want to fear PG-13 which takes but it's funny? See "Anger." Avoid this movie as a blow ... because it can actually kill you. 0 /
