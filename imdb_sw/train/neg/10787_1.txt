Let me do another way: balls. Or, how about bollo * ks. That's worse, more shameful than what it tries to erase. Julia Roberts is a skilled actress, and usually her job is of the highest quality. This movie does not exist in the direction even strives to look at the expertise. He is usually a professional practitioner, but I swear that in his eyes, there are surprises and disappointments. One thing that could have this rescue is the idea about the director (Chris Walken) to turn the movie into a secret document about executives. Unfortunately, the head was not searched for its full potential. Little thing, it's too late. Zeta Jones was a wooden, Cusack was Cusack, and Crystal should stick to do. The two stars with the old Buffy talents had different experiences - Unfounded evil, and Balfour less used. It made Julia well to prevent this only being a bad film made.
