For a great story like this, the environment (place), Grendel was desperate. As the author, I blame the script which completely lacks great tension. The title of the club's story is important and it would have offered to take a new to the classic literature. Because of the wonder that rubric has dropped earlier. Knowing this was shot in 21 days telling me, "he ran" and unfortunately shows. Now we will have to wait for the Hollywood version on the big screen. Word on FX, I can tolerate the true CGI of crappy but the script should have a rock and this was very slow, odd and was not in the game. I would like to be blamed for actors but ... because I know more writing than I do, I will choose my partner.
