*** Has Spoilers *** <br /> <br /> I didn't like this movie completely. I saw it surprisingly surprising and instead of being made, regardless of the importance and depth of the proposed theme: since we should eventually die, how should we go about life? By the way "lighter", like Tomas; for "heavy" method like Tereza; or should we look for ways that will not address the question, like Sabina? How much trust is important in the relationship? How much of a professional life can be destroyed for our loved ones? How much do we need to participate in the political life and social issues of our country? Unfortunately, I've never read the Kundera novel but after the cuts and the movie I am certainly going to be: I want to understand if the story was damaged by the effectiveness of the film (which is my guess) or if it was not red from the beginning. I disagree with many positive comments described in the film as a masterpiece. I can't see why. What I see is a lot of errors, and their sample follows. 1) The three main characters are healed to you and it is very difficult to understand what leads them when making their choice. 2) The "second" characters are filling the gaps but they don't have anything in the story and you wonder if they are very important. 3) I did not do as Tomas was asked. There is nothing good for him. He is involved in selfishness. He is not a man, somehow. But when his self-confidence fails and he knows that he is dependent on others and it is emotionally connected to someone, I do not get a reliable interpretation. <br /> 4) It is impossible that the artist like Sabina could survive his life in the Communist country in 1968. On top of that, all three major actors have been very successful in their field, which is very interesting to me. a) How can Tereza become a great photographer? b) How can they do well in a non-economically motivated country that encourages people to succeed? <br /> 5) The English fake words spoken by the actors are delicious. And I am not a mother tongue. Additionally, the letter Sabina receives in the US is written in Czech, which I have found so much. Most of the comments that praised the movie that says that Prague was well-adjusted: I think most of the movie was shot in the place, so it is not difficult to give a East European film, and given the beauty of Prague is not even harder to make it be nice. <br /> <br /> 7) I saw the end kind of meaning. Tereza and Tomas, finally enjoying the countryside, away from the "city" experiments, apart from the social efforts of fellow citizens, have been prevented by their professional life, die in a car accident. But it dies after realizing that they are happy, indeed. So? If they were to die without joy, would the message of the movie be different? I don't think so. I saw that it was a kind of cheap trick to please the audience. The only thing in the film which is the infinite light is the way the director has shown the characters. You see them for about three hours, but finally you have nothing left. You feel responsive, involved with them, you're left in your bed to watch the sequence of events and events that you don't say a bit. 9) I hated "leaving music in a restaurant area (some of the views were highly recommended). Why has Sabina found such answers? Why does Franz agree with him? Indeed I don't see the point. The only thing you learn is that Sabina has been very angry with a very strong man. ”Is it special and special about it ?: /> <br /> After all these negative comments, I would like to say everything that there are two events that I liked very much. (That's why I have given two). \ t "Women are in Photoshoot", where envy, jealousy, and security of Sabina and Tereza are well presented. \ t After the work of Prague and Russians, pictures of Tereza, taken to inform the world about what is happening in Prague, are used to identify people who participate in the demonstration. > <br /> Finally, there you can The little kitty that the movie was deliberately "designed" in the form "Tomas kind" are going to love it and "those Tereza" will hate you. If that's the case (I'm very doubtful, though) my opinion should be adjusted faster.
