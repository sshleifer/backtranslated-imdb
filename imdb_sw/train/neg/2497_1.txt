There is only one problem with this site, you can not give a negative rating. Additionally, the partner has reviewed this as a D's grade movie. I say he was very good. The piece of wood can show more emotions that the actors in this film, and the money used to produce this film would be better used to start the fire. This is quite horrible, two hours of life that anyone who endorses this bloodless disease will never come back. After watching 5 minutes, I and the boys wondered if the sinking depths could do so again. Half of the carto and a 151 bottle later I finally reached the bridge of this amazing G bridge. It is insulting to all this planet which the director thought anyone could find anything useful from this more, he should go and buy a string. And for executives in this flick, I hope you earn well to be in this joke because I doubt you will ever work again. In summary I am good everyone in this 100 grand movie and 12 stop giving your license acting.
