I can see young girls enjoy this show, but this call to show family is worried. I wonder how well memorable is after all these years. It is a very showy and cynical about fatherless widow of three children living with his dead wife and his stupid friend from school, and others as the season continues. The whole line of conspiracy generally has a dumb lesson. In the middle of each place a person becomes mad to someone else and every part they do and approaches the wrong joke. For the characters, I didn't like it too. Bob Saget had loved the course as the father and the role of the mother. Dave Coulier is a single player of 30 years old thing that makes sounds of cartoons and acts as a child, and he is bright. John Stamos was a more tolerant character but was so clich√©d was hard to watch him. The old girl, DJ, on the show was a real bad actor and did not show any emotion. Stephanie's middle girl was also a very young sister. The little girl Michelle demonstrated is the worst drama of Olsen's twins. You can always tell him when they turn off. The lines of the plot for many verses of the story were very foolish to hold. This is a demonstration of "family" that tried to replace any good substance and reduce it with love, and although these are needed on the show on the family exceeded that very way. This will remember as my favorite sit-com from 80 years to 90. <br /> <br /> My rating: A terrible show. TVG 30 hours.
