Monster River Crater is one of the worst and amateur films that I have ever seen - the top title and Manos, the hands of futures on the part of poor performance, improper leadership, and production standards of kindergarten. In this film, the dinosaur visible to the deception / stop-motion climbs after the meteor hitting the lake in Bumblebum, CA, and begins to eat in local foods. At an exciting peak, a creature, described by one village as "a large alligator and strokes", draws a ponderous quantity on the ground to expel its lunch, before the bulldozer bothers several times and dies from boredom. Each character in this moovie is a perfect moron. One useless subplot shows a hick going to a liquor store to buy 4.75 dollars of Ripple; instead of just buying a bottle, idiot draws a cashier with another player, shoots to the soldier, gets chased to the lake, all so that it can be eaten by a monster. The bad monster park proves that it is nothing more than a styrofoam piece. There is a magician of deception associated with the British concept of deception (to make him a more successor), the boat's most powerful redneck boat, the great "art of the original cave" made by crayon, and sadness of banjo-pickin 'background moosic. In one sad area, a fake witch and his dopey wife / boyfriend / girl offers a movie pad for 4 minutes to shrink how the stars can see in the night sky, although it is clear during the day. Even on continuous speed, this moovie hurts, and it hurts bad. MooCow says the call of fumigators, because this pig's cow stings! : = 8P
