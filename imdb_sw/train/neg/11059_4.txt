"Dahmer" is an interesting film though I will not use "fear" or "exciting" to describe it. It is more than a study of a small character that seems to be the fury of the killer. Jeremy Renner shows a killer killer Jeffrey Dahmer, who was stunned, killed and broke her male victims. The film shows the relationship between Dahmer and "Rodney", which played well with Artel Kay√†ru. Rodney is almost the most interesting character: enjoyable with Dahmer and immediately run the attack, returns Dahmer to sex and keeps the second attack. I think the film is closed because it is not good to describe the dahmer years of creation, how events can create a human being we see on the screen and not give insight into Dahmer's belief that he could create sexual organs of his victims. <br /> <br /> The responsibilities are well played but the story is thin.
