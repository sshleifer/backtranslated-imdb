102 DALMATIANS [Walt Disney]: I was not a fan of the original phase and these efforts have all the weaknesses of the first, the most mysterious, horrible story of acting with Glenn Close, who eliminates every area as it plays for its own amusement, and actors the guest leads. Sometimes dogs are the only "actors" who seem to be "real" and that's stretch. Another effort lost here. GRADE: D
