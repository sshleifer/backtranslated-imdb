and not a fun way. is very bad. It's amazing that people have sent good things about it here. The story follows, acting is bad, not threatening, special effects are not special - oh no! The board has hands from it! oh gee - glass turned water! hair, clothes and makeup in pictures of '50s are not correct, and they have a middle-aged man with a hair orientation to play the version of high school. this is like a future-on dream on the street of the elm. I enjoy sitting down watching the movie cheesy horror as well as any other person, but there is better bad out there to choose from.
