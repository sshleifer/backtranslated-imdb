Let Paul "sex on the brain" Verhoeven comes with an irrelevant and juvenile version of the MAN story. If he could lead the film of Pokemon, I am sure he would put it in some kind of orgy of different types. I don't know sex or even reduce (see other reviews) on the film but in fact, it is obviously the director has thought of one song and could not see interesting things about someone's invisible story than the kinky results it comes with. It is embarrassing because it would be nice if the film doesn't spend too much time with Kevin's invisible non-women. <br /> <br /> The game's organized actors performs what can be with a single script of cheesy script but I felt bad for some of them, including William Devane, who was completely lost here. But how can I expect from the director of SHOWGIRLS, which, btw, is more entertaining than this hit and bad film.
