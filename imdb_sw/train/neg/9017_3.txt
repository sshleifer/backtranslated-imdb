I got this movie in Sci-Fi before entering the work. If you are interested in seeing Dian Card dive and avoid increased fire at least several times, this film is for you. If this is not appropriate for your interest, therefore, I am afraid you will be the one who is planned to be hot, because this film is very bad. Acting, to begin with, is bad, bad, bad. All characters are quite worried, and talk is worse than your usual Z-grade, movie Sci-Fi. To the end, the movie began to remind me of 'Sneaky' (complete and run through the elevator shaft), except the dragon, not naked, invisible. Unlike other similar flicks, however, this was not very bad ... it was very bad.
