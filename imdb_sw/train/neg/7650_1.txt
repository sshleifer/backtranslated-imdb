I know I am a few, but ... <br /> <br /> Be Boll is close to talented as a frog. Not even the fabric; just a bottle. He remembers on some one hundred hack hacks who churn out one of the crap-fest meanings after another. <br /> <br /> This movie? What is the fence to decorate. Slater's gift is only a small one used to lead a person to believe he has other things (if his relationship has failed) on his mind. Reid does if he has forgotten his practice lessons, he has been hit by the head and forget his acting lessons, or has one of the worst directors in the film history. I'm voting for the third choice, I, though two others are always possible. Uwe Boll has never done one thing that I've even got a little pleasure. In fact, I am glad that you made this stinker. I was worried by Bloodrayne compete with "Underworld: Evolution" for ticket sales. Now, I'm sure that Len Wiseman don't have anything, and I mean NOTHING, to worry about.
