I think this is one of the worst movies I have watched for a long time. Trying to get 'same characters' and different people are * bad * idea. If they couldn't find Sara Michelle G. and Ryan P. in this, they should have lost their losses and said they were faced with it. Instead they find new actors who are awesome for what they have done. I felt so much like I was in High School or (bad) College to play with a lever to act these people to give. <br /> <br /> Where are some of these people? What? This is their first movie? It certainly looks like that. <br /> <br /> This movie also resembles nature in a few lines of speech. I had been looking at the first one and entering # 2 inside. I enjoyed getting the second hour and it was the worst show I saw for a while. I am not hard to EVER * EVER * turn off the movie, but this one will definitely leave after 30 - 40 min.
