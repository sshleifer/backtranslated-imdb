Making movies like "Thinner" bad is like calling the world round or Pauly Shore with talented. There is no news, but how they got that way what people want to know. <br /> <br /> Apart from this movie .... The book was good, even if it happened a little bit of another story from "be careful what you want" genre. Burke has an overweight lawyer who kills a gypsy daughter and is cursing her father (Constantine from TV "Room 222") for several pounds a day. <br /> <br /> As I said, it starts well, but why does it include a mantegna? Why firearms very straightforward? Why turn it into something that depends heavily on FX? I thought it would be more effective if it focused more on the craft solution of weight loss, disease, death, gypsy loss and such. <br /> <br /> But no, it shouldn't be. Remember, this is Stephen King we're talking about. <br /> <br /> And last ... almost the same as the book, but a little too talky. In fact the whole movie is talking too much, it hears all the spells we turn to us. Not that I expected "Death Zone", but I could do without another "Pet Sematary", thanks to nothing. <br /> <br /> One star for at least trying to try to do a good job of making makeup. However, all the films left to be ... say to me ... "Thinner".
