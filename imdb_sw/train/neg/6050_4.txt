I can only believe the number of people this comparison well with the first film. It gave me to leave this comment! This is just an open cash test on the success of the first film. The talk is awesome and no like as real or compelling as the original film. <br /> <br /> Story story is ridiculous, a French demonstration of the right and the reputation of Doyle kilometers away from the first film. br /> <br /> Where are the drug addicts you think going to the docks within someone to see the shipment coming? Convenient where Doyle gets his guy is just pathetic. If all French police were drinking coffee until Doyle came out of America and did the work of the REAL police. It's a joke. Try to go to a foreign city and go to a place where there is a lot of travel and travel maps and some tourist brochures. Pathetic. <br /> <br /> Last bad, anyone who thinks otherwise is mad.
