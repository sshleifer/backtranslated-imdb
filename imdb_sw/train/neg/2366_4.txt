I am a fan of a series of dreams but this is terrible. Death has taken place very much. If you were looking 20 years later, the whole nintendo area cannot be time. I acted as dirty. I think they should do just prequel about when it was still alive. That would be more interesting. This is a movie you can take or stop. It depends on a lot of spare time.
