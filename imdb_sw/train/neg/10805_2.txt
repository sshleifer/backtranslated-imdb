Just because I DVRd this movie is because 1. I live in Cleveland and Shaq has basketball for us now and 2. I've always heard how bad it was. The movie was not disappointed. The best part was the Shaq dress. The worst part, well, just about everything else. My 12-year-old son and I just fought and we couldn't watch the screens when Shaq started running and we kept wondering why Max didn't want Kazzam to make this tooth! But for all it is just a panic we can't stop looking at it, the story looked like, like a black hole or a hurry or a pit of pitch, it was a feeling. But it was worth to laugh and just say that we actually look "Kazzam".
