The hg is usually a failure, and has never hurt me before - I liked the "2 blood", but I don't like the pseudo sciences or play on heuristics. The whole movie depends on the person who has esp caused by an electric accident and witch. I do not resist witches, and I loved "carrie" (novel and film) but this bothers me. I think it's because of the main character developing esp from the electric line. also a university professor loses his time learning trial sessions. I was not alive in 60 years to know the first hand whether or not it was a common lie then, but I think that any natural theory would just be reduced. what made me so miserable is how police were describing schizophrenics as uncomfortable, ignorant to predict who can be seen as ordinary people 99% of time and then just snap. nothing can be more from the truth. I hate these concepts because they add to the public idiocy. Many people still think that schizophrenia is a dissociative disease identification. anyone who wrote this script did not know much about psychology. <br /> <br /> There was a decent idea for the movie. I loved how the witch used men; it was a good change. I loved how he could attract, but he did not have when he was near his forced lovers. I found it interesting how her second partner was also burned. had a script taken for a few weeks before production and not just focusing on making its audience a dumber, this could be a good movie.
