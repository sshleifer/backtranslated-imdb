I am a big fan of Michael Madsen, so I don't have to say, I bought this film without even leasing or anything ... This movie was so bad, I didn't go back to the shop, I don't want anyone else to be under this human poison, I just throw in the trash, never mind money, it was worth the price to be able to throw away. Acting was not bad, it was not good or nothing. The story was terrible, and the end is something I despise. He was a broken man, a drunkard. his life was a junk group. I thought his horse, nuts, was a horrible instrument of childhood, the dog would be better. I also hate religion, so at last this irritates me. Jesus heals all ... I hate that I know such people who are many Christians and Catholics, and when it will show that God does not heal all, or anything. It was a bad movie, if you had the opportunity to see it, pass it, or better still buy, or lease, and give it into the trash, leaving the coffee grounds on it in the morning
