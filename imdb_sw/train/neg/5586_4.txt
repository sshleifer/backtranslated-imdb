Someone for a person tries to be a good film: it has its heart in the right place, it wants to be an epic and has a message that no doubt everyone will be grateful. But there are also some problems with this picture. It strives to be good and to get its message in such a way that sometimes the viewer should make fun of the free. So it is only enough that the pictures used by this picture are simple - the person for the person does not allow the viewer to decide what he thinks is correct but motivates his message on his head. Joseph Fiennes shows this example in his role: he does a good job of looking at the worries, led to the truth and all the other feelings that you can talk about with a single face which the repertoire should give. Add that the film is high and loses its speed towards the end you could make the decision that Man To Man should not look. But there are enough points to protect it: it is entertainment, it has other exciting events and steals show Kristin Scott Thomas. Of course it should not be compared to human works like the Elephant (David Lynch) but will leave the theater. Trying to grab your heart (even if your brain thinks it is very clear) and it works a lot of time.
