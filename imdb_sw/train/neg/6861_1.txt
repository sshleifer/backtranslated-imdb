My first access to Templarios & is not good. I was surprised to find this title between the Anchor Bay video, which brought us another class of worship as "Spider Baby". The quality of publishing is excellent, but this alone can not hide the fact that the film is very bad. There is a series of opening that the villagers give no more than over the Templars (and put one thing in motion), but everything else in the film is slow, thinking, and finally, not recommended. Adds insult injury: The movie was called, not the head, as promised on the video jacket.
