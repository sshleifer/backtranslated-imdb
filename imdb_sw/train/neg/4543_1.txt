I read the book and the book was exciting. <br /> <br /> This movie, is the direction, screens, and acting cannot be completely defeated. I broke the lack of a screen that could not follow a novel, a novel that has all the stages, simplicity, and courage to show the size of a possible realistic story. I can see why this film was not given to the general public in many cities. It can never recommend this film to anyone who knows. Only, one of the worst reforms I have ever seen has been transformed into a little heavenly observation. The movie's path was only true. But, how can it fail when it was hit in a beautiful country like Peru. <br /> <br /> For prospective viewers, do not waste your time or energy on this flop.
