This movie shows its age. The publication I saw was bad because of age, but it is possible that there is better out there. However, this was not the main problem with the movie. The problem was that although the film was made in 1933, it was a silent film with the barest of the dispersed dispute (judgment alone) in the film in a more fashionable manner. Sometimes the characters were converted or were talking with their hands on their faces - all in an attempt to hide their lips and "cleaverly" (?) To hide the fact that the film was called. In fact, it is true that this Czech film would need to be incorporated into many languages ​​but by doing so this way was true and stupid. It seemed just cheap. Overall, the film was seen a low and silly budget. It is embarrassing though, because there was a grain of good news - a young woman who married an old man who is gay and / or not interested in women. But in the 21st century, a few people would be ready to sit in this old mess. AND THE LIGHT OF NIGHT (and somewhat chunky) Hedy Lamarr, is not recommended all the series that was accompanied by the film when it started. Even at 1933, this film was dud. About the only interesting thing about the film is to see how different Lamarr was seen in 1933 compared to the beautiful Hollywood photographs made when he came to the United States - he looked like two different people. Invisible and low-tech films, I don't see how it has found such a review. For technical problems alone, the film cannot measure 10 or anything around it.
