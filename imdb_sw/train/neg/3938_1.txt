Even Timothy Hutton or David Duchovny could not save the dead fish film. At the beginning, the document was written to be made on the B film, but somehow Duchovny (looking for a star car to elevate himself on television) and Hutton (looking for "two" of "one blow" was hoping he would explain his work after Normal people ") was tied to the picture. The cheesy line, the worst badge from area to area (Come - who uses oil after grade 12 of Telecommunications phone)? Even Duchovny is not a defensive problem with this film. Timothy only Hutton increases on the material at all. I must agree to hear the pain of Duchovny reading the verses that are high-pitched. When I found myself laughing when I was sure the director wanted me not to be afraid, nothing prepared for the closing line of Duchonvey's voice: "If you need a doctor, make sure you call 911." If only the label had called 911, this motion picture dog has never been made. Avoid at all costs. <br /> <br />
