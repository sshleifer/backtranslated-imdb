Many things are explained when watching this film: 1) Acting is awesome. Tom Hanks and Wendy Crewson are so-so, but the parents' dispute with children closes opera-ish soap. The other two boys: the youngest boy and your female-but-me-true-sensitive-indoor blonde dreamboat; 2) The general film is hurt and despair; 3) Robbie's dreams and inconveniences (done by Tom Hanks); 4) The first inclusion of love ballads is an unfamiliar choice ("all of us are special friends"); 5) Wonderful lines and side plots do not make it better for bad acting; and 5) this is a very bad movie. He expects to be disappointed - and perhaps sad.
