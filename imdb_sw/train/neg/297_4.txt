For the record, this film is surprising but not natural. Back in 1998, Talia Shire's film The Landlady was close to the same plot but for young children. The story is Amanda Lear has had a bad life, a father of insults, a gold doctor, a house of intelligence, etc.. He is finally taken home with joy under the guidance of his deviated doctor ... who he abuses and murders the poor man. (now that was the original) The doctor had given money to the house before killing him and buried him sucker in the fields. After moving she likes a student named Richard, who just happens to be married to a blues singer. If you have seen Landlady you know others, he kills or tries to kill anyone who gets between him and Richard (including the roadie). Much of that idea came from a film, one piece that holds its nose, the detective on a boy with a popcorn bowl, similar to the body fly. It had original equipment, something of beer bottle was brutal. The view of the film was the best milk milk in the hot area. Some amount of payment but not a waste of time. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
