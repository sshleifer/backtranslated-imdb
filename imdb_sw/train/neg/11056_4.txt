I was very disappointed in this film. I don't know much about the true story, so I was interested in looking at the film and learning about a small piece of history. For a truly powerful story and chief executives seemed to be a mix of sure. Well, somewhere the screen has won. Was it spread - is this film about her childhood? his love of life? its own disability? its ability to speak? his passion for the disabled? I am sure there is a way to put all these things into good news, but this movie was not. I was left to look at the characters who were not seen because of their disability, but because of their behavior. Other small gripes: 1. Sound sound load. It's seventy years - FREE! 2. If he is a wonderful public speaker, why were we treated more than snippet here and there - and even more so in montages?
