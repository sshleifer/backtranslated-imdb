Dave (Devon Sawa) and his friends Sam (Jason Segel) and Jeff (Michael Maronna) have attacked the campus. When the creepy Ethan (Jason Schwartzman) discovers their secrets, he blackmails them in helping him score and beautiful, beautiful and cheerful student Angela (James King) <br /> <br /> Stupid and accordingly "comedy" - We are suffering much more - contributing than laughing-inducing. Modernly tries to entertain his audience with its disgusting objectives - but there is no work to do. What's more, it is full of meaningless, useless characters - and Schwartzman's behavior is so amazing it is the main shutdown. Modern even attempts to use 50/60's sexpot / actress Mamie Van Doren in the movie's largest movie. Yuck !!! <br /> <br /> The most bring down is its great point and waste (still again) of veteran talented actress Joe Flaherty's - when is this guy going to stop accepting every role coming along and doing something? worthwhile <br /> <br /> Overall, the only thing I liked was James (aka Jaime) King, who was very appealing - and deserved best <br /> <br /> This gets no more than one. out of ten from me.
