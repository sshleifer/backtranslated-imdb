Although I have never studied the movie in two years, I especially remember what made us go down as they did. After loving the original Mermaid, and after being considered successful as a child could be, I decided to take the time to sit down and watch the surveillance. <br /> <br /> Disney, I have a little message for you. If you do not have an original director and a few executives ... you just want to find your stripe. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, our story begins with Ariel and his daughter, Melody. My first major issue is that Eric and other employees sang. Yes, I understand that Disney is great on the number of singing-and-dance, but in fact, that's what made my beloved Eric. He was quiet, gathered, and a real gentleman who knew how to have fun. And she did. NOT. SING. <br /> <br /> And then there is a woman. Oh, how can we forget the less shivers under our explosions when Ursula went to the screen, awesome Ariel and viewers around the world? Unfortunately, the gene was not given to his sister who is not the best, Morgana. Nothing, EVER said about Morgana in the first movie; he just pops out of anywhere, trying to steal a child. Oh, how good. A little sister has been removed and instead of following the trident, she decides to breastfeed a baby one month. My Gag. Besides being a flat character without a sense of origin in it, Morgana was just too improper. The same plan as his sister, the same workers (who, by the way, did not fear anyone. I was three years old on my veil when I watched this movie, and laughed loudly.) He had a purpose to be in; I would like to see Mom to be a villain. I'm sure she would do better than Little Miss Tish there. King Triton did not have any respect he received from me in the first movie, nor did I get started on Scuttle, Sebastian and Flounder. Triton was a strong but loving father in the first movie, and secondly, it is almost as if he has lost his will to panic into the hearts of his scholars. Scuttle, once a comic aid that has made everyone laugh with his 'dingle-hopper' (yes, I will; In this film, Scuttle all but forgotten. Characteristic help even in the first, at least added something to the film. He was rich and some others did not have them, and on the other hand, they all took him completely from him. Sebastian was still the same, but twice as to be concerned as before. Disney, don't do that. Do not even try to mix with our favorite crab. Or our fish of fish who loves the father, who becomes a father and has many frightening children. He is fat, and he is bland, and he looks like he is going to the next flat line. <br /> <br /> Walrus and penguin were not opened, and over time, you start to start to challenge everyone. Especially Melody, who has no depth for anything. <br /> <br /> And one of these days, Disney, I'm kicking out of my life. <br /> <br /> If I did not love your very nature.
