I don't know who is crying, Miss Leigh or her director, but her performance as Catherine is hard to look at. Ben Chaplin on the other hand works best - against all obstacles as I am concerned. Her character is very attractive and interesting. but they are certainly not shown to have enough desire, considering the character of Leigh's character. Chaplin seems to be hated by what he cannot understand as the shame of Leigh and lack of grace, but rather an unsteadiness of bones. There should be an element of belief in his interests, but if the play is incomprehensible. Exhibition is not a jibe. Maggie Smith and Albert Finney are, of course, wonderful despite any attempts to destroy. Support is also fun to enjoy. It's sympathetic, too, the trend does not work together because the production is good looking.
