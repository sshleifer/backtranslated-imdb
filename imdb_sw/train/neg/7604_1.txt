Indeed it happens in the west, but the head makes it as it has the western size. Instead, it is a movie of a woman sheriff. Do not make a mistake though this is a bad movie about a woman sheriff. She becomes a sheriff when her husband is shot; he is just tad bit upset with this. Its main goal is to go to a woman who is also a woman, but villain employs a boy to kill him. So this is what happens, the hero loves the killer and vice versa. Surely it is foolish, as anyone killed in this film has a new sheriff to thank. He had more opportunities to put the killer behind bars, but I think because he loved him he can't do it. The killer is also after the mayor of the city for personal reasons which is also dumb. This movie is very boring and not very valuable to watch ... not one of the best MST3000 sessions did. I can't imagine anyone seeing this without them because it would make it more painful. Corman is a limited budget director, but even he should know better than having people going to one place and coming out another.
