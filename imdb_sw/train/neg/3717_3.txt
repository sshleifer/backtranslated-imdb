Chris Rock, it seems to be desperate for a star car that can appeal to the white and black viewers, leading to voting in 1978 "Heaven Can Wait" with the agenda of cities. He plays an active player who is involved in a car accident that his soul has been removed very quickly from his body - therefore, his angel must give another body to put in, and he can only come with that white businessman. Restoring the movie as bland and feeling like "Heaven Can Wait" shows only that the Rock's eye was in the box-office (this was a cooperative action organized by many Hollywood players). Why not try something great or more memorable than the life-giving comedy that reaches the evening in Apollo? Awesome help (including the usual Regina King, extraordinary Mark Addy, Wanda Sykes, Eugene Levy, and Frankie Faison strict) are doing what they can, but the Rock seems clear and does not know at all. * 1/2 from ****
