If you have seen friends, the scriptures will feel very much. Particularly last 3 or 4 friends often share the set of comedy. The show is about a group of people whose relationship is that they shared the same class while still young (about 10 years old I think). Now, they're in the middle of the twentieth century, and they meet again in class fellowship. This is where the series begins. The most common part deals with many lines of story at once. They cannot be connected in any way. Each story line is cut in many places, which are displayed in a mixed order. The diagram is where my problems are with this series. As in the future of Friends, it is often very difficult and difficult to believe the situation. One of the main characters makes something stupid to be hard to believe. The situation is too salty, if not enough. If you are in this sense of humor - then you will probably like this series. For me it's great to turn off. The reason I started seeing friends is because of the first season season. There are interesting and more reliable verses, and some love that makes root for the characters. Risk doesn't have this thing. The characters also have to be forced and the performances are too far away. So it is impossible to tell them and like them. At least with friends, it took several seasons before running steam and characteristic of all behaviors are exhausted. But at Risk, it seems to leave the steam before it starts.
