An exciting and authentic original series by Fox has been undermined under ban. In the first season, the Dark Angel was on a weekly "must see" list, and not just because of Jessica Alba. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the authorities-to-be on Fox decided that they needed "tune well" program. Within 3 seasons of season season, they were completely lost as a viewer (even seeing Jessica Alba!). I have seen new characters who were added to the second season to be very stupid and ignorant. The new parks were spreading promotions and credibility of a thin show. On one of the second periods of the second season, they even ate Max's sleep and germination - where the first season said he can't sleep. <br /> <br /> The story of the story (which Hollywood does not get): If it works, don't hit it! <br /> <br /> azjazz
