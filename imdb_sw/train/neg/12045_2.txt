Okay, this is my first post in IMDb though I use it as a long-term memory. So I would like to greet you all. The fact that I am Greek is the opposite of my judgment that I believe is not your anger. I spent two years of my life, (all Greeks did the truth), analyzing Omirus epos (and not men as you see everywhere), rhyme by rhyme. I remember well the Iliad (Iliad) on the 8th class and Odysseia (Odyssey) in Grade 9. Iliad epos is one of the best works of literature made. It was included by the Greek poet Omirus 400 years after the real war. Historians place political wars around 1200 BC, and the real reason for the war is not to be the beauty of Helen but the key role of Troy. He said one could now understand that Omirus epos not present real events (if not historically incorrect) but this was not the purpose of this work. Trying to read this great poem, a person can see himself wondering with a lot of reverence, love, anger, hatred, hero, discipline, trust and so on. The best part and education was also a long-term dialogue between the warriors before the war. None of these were revealed in the 'Troy' <br /> Troy's Warner was cheaper for my eyes, and for other English-minded people of English and German colleagues as well. It is embarrassing to spend millions of dollars in such a bad environment. Through a full storm was bad and stupid blockbuster (computer graphics worked all over), and it's still the best work of Wolfgang Petersen. I conclude that you would like to look at something else instead. I would give Troy 2 out of 10. It's a very expensive movie B. <br /> <br />
