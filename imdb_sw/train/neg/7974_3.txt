Interesting at first time. The Muslim Observer (Colin Firth) takes a beautiful, wonderful woman (Lisa Zane) for a short time. They seem to be happy, then disappears without warning. He is looking for him, after the end of death, is caused by some of his childhood used to lose soon, which may include criminal activities. And then, it seems the filmmakers don't know what to do with the story. At the beginning, when it is not as celebrated as shown, it is at least seen. Then it becomes more interesting or even more intelligent. And the latter is so crippled, so it's slow, and so without any excitement or intelligence, you will think journalists don't know what to do and so bored trying. What's slow of a good idea!
