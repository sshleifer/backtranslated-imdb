As mentioned earlier, the effects of seeing are amazing. They are breathing. I personally use Blender and similar graphics are not easy AT ALL. But that's all this movie. It is not just a combination of conspiracy, but the general crisis does not understand. For example, in the first place, Proog and Emo are trying to get away from who knows what. The conflict seems to be between man and nature here. Later, when they enter the bottom of the hole, Proog explains that "one step outside and (you're dead)". Here, there is a more precise conflict between a careless person and nature. As the film goes on, it is clear that conflicts exist between man and nature. But suddenly, the conflict exists between the man and the person when Proog, out of anywhere, kills Emo. Proog immediately turns into a caring caregiver looking at a lost child to be "sick person". He gave us. It's not just sad, but we don't care because the conflict between thought and behavior was not done. Not a story about a man, through the struggle, happens power. It is a problem and has not been stressed because there is no good truth about the human spirit or about the world has shown as a wonderful game does. In my opinion, the movie has become very low in all fields. However, the graphics are wonderful, but the movie is more than just eye candy. There is no truth, no war and bad surprise. In conclusion, an unsupported movie without sure. ... but the graphics are good.
