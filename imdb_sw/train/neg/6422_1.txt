"I just saw this film last night and I don't think I will ever think of any of the participants involved, because this film will hold back my thoughts." The above details can be considered as good or bad. I mean every time I see Tom Cruise or Demi Moore in the movie, I think of "Few Good Men" which is good. Now, every time I see Ron Perlman or Kristy Swanson, I'll think of "Tinseltown" which is a very bad thing. I took this to think that it might be a good thing or at least to make me chuckle and for Arye Gross and Swanson and Perlman mentioned earlier, I thought that at least it wouldn't be bad. You can say the movie was done on the budget size of Wheeling, Indiana (Where? Exactly), but maybe spent every dollar to make a good film. WRONG. <br /> <br /> This movie is not funny or entertaining for any word either. It is only there and it is a minute of slowing 84. \ t You care about about NONE's characters, and since the direction are both struggles of Hollywood writers and dreams that are two hardworking writers and dreams who wrote this need to know about them. Well, two REAL authors know all about the screen versions itself, so they see so viewers. They don't even think about the development of the character, except to try to connect the story there to "Island of Gilligan". <br /> <br /> The program is normal. Two men live in a storage, where one of them puts the bed, and there are twenty other people living there, too. All of the story has appeared and is stupid. What? Have you seen the "Great Death Lampoon"? The second story by Joe Mantegna is about a television writer who can't find a good story to make a TV film about, so he creates one. Now change the television writer to the screens of the screens, the Mantegna striker inside the worst half-year actors, and remove the comedy and you have this film. <br /> <br /> Officials are trying. Kristy Swanson is on the film for perhaps 10 minutes and still gives the best performance in the film. It is still hot, but it will help if he could STAR in the film instead of making regular CAMEOS. For everyone else, I don't think they are the perpetrators of the fault because they have the BAD <br /> <br /> Go to watch the National Lampoon movie, but leave it off with this film.
