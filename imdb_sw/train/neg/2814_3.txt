1 looked at 8/26/2001 - 3 out of 10 (Dir-Tobe Hooper): Scary, but sad (which means) shows the family of Marquis De Sade doing similar sad and happy acts that seem to be its predecessor. This Tobe Hooper film does not make the difference to the similarities of Freddy Krueger and the same stars (Freddy himself - Robert Englund) plays two roles (Marquis De Sade and his family). It also seems like it wants to spread Christianity but then loses that at the very end of my chagrin but stopping to feel the opposite to the movie. It can be worse if the excess was taken in sex and abuse, but they try to put this to a lesser extent even though other disgusting events. My last thought is why Hooper would like to make this film. In fact it took a short time to get really distributed, then it should announce in large quantities and in the name of Hooper in the name of hope to make money in his name and his name. Obviously this has not worked.
