The effectiveness of innovation in awfulness. In fact it is very bad. The first ... Nicholas Cage must now have done the final in the Top-Emoting category in his acting class. Wearing new hair bags and an uplifted face often have its backed ears seem to be fighting and touching back does not only make the patient sick but builds the character of a “hero” that you do not intend to possess. I don't know what is for Labia's Neil and female characters. He makes women to be lost and totally evil ... and to return them to have some Cage punch them directly on the face and call them all "b **** es" a few times too. I have enjoyed the first LaBute films and a few games ... but it is amazing what he has. <br /> <br /> I'd like to give this film 2 out of 10 just according to Ellen Burstyn's performance. By the time he finally makes his appearance (brave soldiers through his events and his line of open wig on his forehead) looks like all hope can be lost. He deserves the right of Oscar here and now to speak his lines to the straight face and when he appears wearing white color blue and blue, white, and gold around the Wicker Man you know to be working with Scorcese and Friedkin for really has taken away this role well. <br /> <br /> This movie is a bad head with a cuckoo which looks reliable. The most important things include: Nicholas Cage running with the bee ass and then falling down the hill. Nicholas Cage steal a bike and look like Ms. Gulch from the Wizard of Oz ascending on it. <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage runs around the island striking down the look of the lost girl. Leelee Sobieski PLUMMETING from a once-promised job in the "striker" and Cage. Ellen Burstyn dancing around said during the time. Nicholas Cage screaming "Who was burned?" Who was burned? Who was burned? for any reason. <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage at the costume of the bear (I am not a child) runs through the bushes, overcoming the dress (but leaving the bear legs) and then doing some karate action for some criminals. And you don't live until you see the last minute of the movie and its horrible class that looked like it was hit yesterday in your cousin's basement. Needless to say, if you can do this through this film without laughing loudly then you deserve a medal. There was a point in the movie where I stopped stopping to ask myself whether this was not to send to the "Hysteria" films ... just to be reminded when Cage could shout / shout / talk to her that she really was struggling. I think this is supposed to be a religious film again ... because it is so terrible.
