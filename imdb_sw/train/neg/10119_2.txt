Animation in this again think of Peter & Wolf is better, but for 29 minutes, the film is sleeping inducing. They should call "Peter & Hammer", because everything is going on at the snail speed. I could not even watch the film in one session - I was going to look at it 15 minutes at a time, and it was a pure passion. Save yourself 30 minutes - don't watch this film - and I will thank you. I can only think that the Oscar nomination committee just watched the first few minutes of the elect. Unfortunately, voting for the winner in the best short (short)! I already feel sympathetic to them - and we must predict that there is no way this film is about to win.
