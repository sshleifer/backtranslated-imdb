I came from a free investigation and I am very happy I did not pay you to see this very small film. The Theater was full and the crowd was a mixture of children and adults. It seemed like only the children who were laughing at all the strings of the fart and the fart joke though (a good god they liked to beat these poor mice in a lot! The movie is a good, unknown, unpredictable, and irritating. The characters seem to simply be thrown together to fill the empty space and the relationship between them all seemed to be very forced without charm. Watching, the film is an average of something that has stopped completely. They did the best to follow the soil looking from Wallace and Gromit, but more than that it was a very forgotten picture. Though I was very tired of all the films, I beat several times. Not quite a failure, but I certainly don't want to look at it again. If you are a parent and children (and you do not care that your children see a controversial problem) then don't feel to take them to see, but everyone should not lose their money.
