I am 47 years old and have spent a lot of life as I can remember, a fan of awesome and sci-fi movies. To be silent, black and white, no budget or big budget, there are very few that I can find something to love. That said, I will give them this film for a good year effect and creation but that's all. This is a case of harm on the story. The fact is that we live at a time when there is a little left that was not found in the awesome movie. So for a film of any kind of interesting really must have a good, original story. Good story can overcome bad effects and bad acting but a bad story with good acting and good effect is still a bad movie. This movie does not even act good, just good effects. So unless you can just about gore, go through this.
