The real Irony is this: Joe Besser was a top player player, in another situation far from Stooges. He had a track record of being very funny and clever. Moe and Larry and Shemp had known him or at least for many years and loved his work. Why was the world going on when he joined the soldiers like "three stooge"? Obviously, no. In most of these "late Stooge" short shorts, more often than, boys are pitted against each other or Joe against the other two and this is not correct Stooge etiquette. "One for all, all for one, everyone himself", by quoting Curly from "Restless Knights". One thing about a good comedy team, Laurel & Hardy, Abbott & Costello, The Brothers Marx, no matter how much they all try to take advantage of each other or hanging each other, while the chips are actually down, they hold together and come to aid of each other. In this one one, none of that happens. It's almost like watching a dog to fight if someone tries to cheat others or be mean and bad, and not to the effect of either comedic. One can assume that there is something behind the current events here, art imitates life. Maybe there is really why Besser was not very long with Moe and Larry. Just look at the history of other teams and tell me I am wrong.
