Goremeister fans Herschell Gordon Lewis should look elsewhere if they take this film for its regular blood-covered buckets, since there is little value in the bleeding method in this film. Instead, Lewis decides to try and tell him a fantastic story, depending on the special basgain effect on the budget that could possibly be doubled if they have been given their bags for one day's change. Typically, when affordable and very convenient (especially with McCabe as Mitchell), the general freedom of the plot continues to focus. Imagine what this film would be like with a good budget! In general, it is caused by the taste of champagne on the beer budget.
