Cluster is ridiculous, characters cannot, conversation talks, and amazing last. <br /> <br /> I do not believe, I am a fan of Kevin Kline, but watching him do the accent Pepe Le Pew for 2 hours if the French thinks not as close as amusing as it seems. <br /> For his part, Meg Ryan is once again as perky and adorable as (take your pick): kewpie doll, baby, puppy, kitten, whatever you happen to think is the cutest creature in the world. The bears are not exactly the same as the real man. This game is hit me as an opportunity caught by friends Lawrence Kasdan and Kline for vacation in Paris and southern France when they have to be paid well. So I can't blame them.
