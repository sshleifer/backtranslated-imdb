This is a dumb movie. It can be fun with visitors looking at the winter and the landscape, but it is not. Some visitors hear the announcement of World War when a little country radio station plays on Halloween. They come to the earth to kill men, but instead of killing, they make people their slaves and act. The front cover of the film shows these visitors riding on the surfboards in the space ... not really what they do. These are not guests of the party, they are ignorant of the basket of the basket and the angry sounds of the sound. A guest with an acceptable voice also happens that Jack Nicholson escaped a stranger who wore his glasses forever. Other than foreigners, acting is awesome. Writing is definitely meant for children, because each character is written as a child. <br /> <br /> This is a dumb movie, which only children will enjoy, maybe. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1/2 of ****. 100 months.
