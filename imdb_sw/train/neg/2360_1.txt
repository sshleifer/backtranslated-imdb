This will be the most insignificant view I have put down, but I must still do so to warn you about the effects of movies that "Freddy's death" is. It's not just the worst shape of a series of dreams, but it's up there with the worst fears of all time! It was boring, useless, and almost near death free. Then the worst of the last 3-D and the top-CORNY kills is enough to run this "film" below. However, it does not stop there, just add a bad acting, a terrible script, and some cheesy comeos and you yourself got yourself a heaping pile of guano! Not surprising why Freddy, as he played with Robert Englund, has done two postmortem performances. I also like if I came out like that. This is only strictly movie fans, nor see our shame.
