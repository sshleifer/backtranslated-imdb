Yes I saw a sharp reduction. Unexpected sexual events. Hidden secrets. Next to the parallel film 'Needs' of strict action. This movie is bad if the bad film finds a bad script, bad acting, bad effects, bad places, bad stunts everything wrong. The 'best' players in the film were the players they had hired for extra bonus! Sean Harry, 'fopp actor' as someone else put it, makes a look like talented here. Its amazing ability to drive a bad car, when it is clear that you are experiencing people on bonnet (see reflection in the mirror), the inability to turn left, which is a class. OH and do not forget the sex area. with its impressive use of a toy gun that people could not even torture to hide as a real gun. Other actors on the screen could not provide their lines. It was about half an hour when they were waiting for a line that was not there! 'Special effects' were strong for sure boys who did so took their real names on credit! <br /> <br /> If you want to laugh at a party then rent this movie ... then again there is a lot of good comedies that are as funny and give money to people who aren't worthy.
