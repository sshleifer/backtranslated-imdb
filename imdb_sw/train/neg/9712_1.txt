This film is one of the most misleading exhibitions of history. Surprisingly, this film has nothing to respect hundreds of thousands of Dutch employers, the UK, the Chinese, the Americans and the indigenous people of Japanese killed and tortured to death. The bridge was built "on the bodies of a white man" as described by the Japanese engineer. It is disgusting that unforeseen threats imposed by Japanese prisoners are the source of the film, which the bridge itself, does not close to the real bridge. The exact bridge was made of iron and cement, not wood. What about the victims who still have alive today? They hate the movie and all that should represent. Their friends were hungry, tortured, and killed by cruel worshipers. Those who have not died of dysantry, hunger, or disease are very traumatized by a movie that makes light like their dark times.
