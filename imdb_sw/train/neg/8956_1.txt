Prequel terrible prequel for the first two films, they have no first doubts or second interests. Based on boys who 'run' the cube, basically removes any sense of tension in the cube, because we don't care about the characters inside. Most of the film is just boring, and it becomes just a very horrible and the introduction of the head of the eyes of the glass and the sea of ​​green eyes. After this, however, it comes from a high hilarity. However, the end is suitable, and reunite again in the first way. Script is awesome, performs the most beautiful, and incredible patterns. Very limited monitoring.
