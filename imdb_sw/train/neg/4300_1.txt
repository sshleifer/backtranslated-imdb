Bunnies Beach of Buford offers a B-grade film with a bad name. As a fan of that kind, I was surprised to find an unsuccessful attempt by using young talent artists. I specifically mention the lack of common fraud and sex incidents. Is the next generation of sad young boys looking at this television night you think about?
