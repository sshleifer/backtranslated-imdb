First, I agree with the very little that runs the mouth of Mr. Chomsky. The fact of the issuing of an interesting counterpoint is what makes a person on the university's circus. He comes beautiful, pleasing, proud. We don't care about modern modernization (which includes bi-partisanship) and sets its sights on the left and the same is the same, and for good reason. Unfortunately, the film itself is dud. In fact, I will not even call this document but not just a collection of conversations. Checking "Customs without Pause" is not different from looking at the speaker in the 3am section hit on the CSPAN. No camera movements, no change, no touch to stylistic. No stories, no details. <br /> <br /> By speaking technical, production is very bright. Sounds are awesome and inconsistent; sometimes we can't hear Noam talking, sometimes we can't hear the questions available by those who attended. When Noam speaks a few times we are allowed to see the results of the audience unless we are given a quick shot of his wife who seems to attend each of his speeches and beams with pride whenever we see him. I can't recommend this film and say that perhaps it is better to look at his speeches on the tape or CD to listen to the car. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 stars ... and I'm in a generous atmosphere today.
