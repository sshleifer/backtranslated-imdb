I had to endure the age of the youth, high school and family for almost every show. I don't care about secondary school girls are afraid of their relationships. I have spent my time in Hell dealing with such issues and I don't care about the false rumors that go to the "lite" offerings of fear I have endured. I want false science. That's the only reason I got here. There were a few seconds of false science at the end of the show. We see Proto-Cylon. It was good but for one difficulty. The gold of the red eye would bind on something of interest. We all realize that Cylon's eyes are always reflecting and returning, releasing a world map map. The red-red eye does not provide migration and return. <br /> <br /> I really hope the authors will correct this abuse before the second period.
