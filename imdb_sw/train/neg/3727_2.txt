It is not the worst movies, but at least schlock as_Plan 9 From Space_ usually had a real or two actor.

Looking for free (although locked from poor VHS) here: http://www.archive.org/details/Thief-In-The-Night <br /> <br /> Proper links are added to the 10th line of IMDb below : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispensationalism http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/3199/thief-in-the-night-se-a/
