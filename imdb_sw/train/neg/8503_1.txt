Irritation # 1 is Mira Sorvino to use the Russian brilliant to play the Spanish soldier - WTF? This story is not quite good. Is there a proposed romantic story that is deliberate confusion - is she or not a girl? - they do not serve anything.

There seems to be a message about the '30s of the Spanish Civil War of 30' But because everyone involved in it has died, one does not see direction. Even with the back-up of the story of the story (what part?) who looks good to fight the cow. Hemingway acquired would hit the director in the nose - and my blessing.
