It had all the pictures of this kind of film and no substance. The program was not available and the end of the movie I heard as a watch player. Production was good; however, the script and acting were the quality of the film B. Competition was poor because there were good actors mixed with the actors. The best actors did not have themselves and did not raise others. <br /> <br /> This movie is not suitable for more words, but I will say more to achieve less than ten lines. James Wood and Cuba Gooding, Jr. they play caricatures themselves in other movies. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for entertainment without mind, I can still recommend this movie.
