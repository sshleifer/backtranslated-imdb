This film should be fun. Lea Thompson little, young Joaquin Phoenix ... and Terry O'Quinn. In space. But it was designed, it had no unwanted characters and had no target audience. Some kids are going to a camping space and launched in a place with a friend of their robot (called, right, Jinx). The parts of the space are long, repeat (the accident occurs twice) and causes them to be based on your view. Adults will be worried and burned out, children may be afraid if this process actually leaves a high sense of it. <br /> <br /> There is a romance of budding, but different to transfer - this hasn't taken away. Why it is with the first unknown place, unless perhaps adding additional tension between characters - but it has failed like that was the idea. Little Lea Thompson should be attractive and attractive, right? I mean, "Return to the future" is good. But no, he was angry with the average look. It's not the person you would like to date, have a friend or even consider it as an example. Joaquin Phoenix? She is really fortunate she has ever seen in the movies again this performance. Maybe he can act like Mikey in Cereal's advertising, but doesn't seem to know how to be a normal boy. Not recommended on the screen and I don't think we can identify him at home. In fact I would like to be happy if she has never returned to the world. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone.
