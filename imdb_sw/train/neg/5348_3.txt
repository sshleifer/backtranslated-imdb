The inventor Wayne Szalinsky (Rick Moranis) prepares to make his donation / expansion to the Smithsonian Institute if he and Diane Diane (Eve Gordon) prepare themselves at the end of the weekend away from their son Adam (Bug Hall). Wayne Gordon's brother (Stuart Pankin), Patty's wife (Robin Bartlett), and his children Jenny (Allison Mack) and Mitch (Jake Richardson) are willing to take care of Adam when his parents have gone, but if luck will (and the head lets you expect), people The adults are hit by Wayne's accident. When children run away from the amok, their miniatural people should compete with powerful insects, defects in the string which looks like canyons, and other threats to them. This was bad, as it was directly on the video column is, Honey, We Separated We were laughable. I had to laugh at the film "roach" Stuart Pankin and the attackers were more ridiculous, views for yourself!
