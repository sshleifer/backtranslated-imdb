This movie made me feel like I had lost important scenes from the beginning. There was a mistake to continue with the standing stadiums as they suddenly started. I was shocked because I love Whoopi Goldberg & Danny Glover, with that always trusted and respected Danny Glovers flavor in his choice of responsibilities, "Grand Canyon" for example. I couldn't finish this film, after what seemed to be forever, but maybe it was a little more than an hour; we had to turn off. There was no comedy, there was nothing about the characters to make you feel or sympathize with them, there was no feeling about all of this film and the old parts were not well organized, confused, and not needed. What could be a good idea for the film, even if the game of sports and not comedy (although I think the comedy in this situation would be better, because I love watching the white people disappear out & start making like full idiots, it makes me laugh) it became a waste of my $ 1 credit card.
