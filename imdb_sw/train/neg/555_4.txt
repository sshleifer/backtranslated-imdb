The film is a good and beautiful mix. The program is bad ... but on the other hand acting is very good, and the voice and a few good. Sharon stone is similar at this time ... even half as good as the natural mind you. These killings are not like the first, or embarrassing. It's not a predictable mess everyone says it is. Sex is very good at times when others are obviously fake (fully dressed). Script is the most weakest time, but events and flags and arguments between Dr.Glass and Washburn are important. The plan loses a few times, but the end is bad. The tension is always constant and the great gold 'Oh my god!'. The tracking process is guided by priority, and shots and corners of the camera are amazing and bring a little class to the otherwise film, the rush. Sharon stone is old for this too. Bits where we see her breasts were very happy. All this time, they are also awesome to describe. His film is rather moderate, but it's worth going. Especially because the film deserves a good buzz ... and a series of opening that is open. Not important, but if you liked it first - leave this. Do not destroy the run. You will be happy with this stone removed.
