I waited a long time to see DR TARR'S TORTURE DUNGEON and after looking at it, I was disappointed with it. It's not a Baroque film I expected you to. The trailer (which I have seen on the so-called on DVD) is much better than the entire film, which is possible to forget. There's almost no scenes in it and look and feel it interesting but even come close to other Baroque styled movies out there, from Fellini or Jodorowsky. The characters are quick and nothing is going on very much, although we see rape, crucifixion, sex. The main problem of the TARR TARR TARR was the fact that it was a dialogue - more than anything else. It was almost like looking at the book. I just wanted the film to have a quiet time or feeling or something, rather than we see / listen to the main characters of the act for a long time on good things. <br /> <br /> The missing space.
