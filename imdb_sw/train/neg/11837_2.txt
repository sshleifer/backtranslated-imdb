Can anyone make a good CGI film instead of Pixar? I really mean, animation seemed to disagree with 2006 standards and even with 1995 Toy Story levels. Or perhaps they spent all their budget on Hugh Jackman. And nothing is considered, the narrative story. <br /> <br /> Somehow, Hugh Jackman is a mouse - a mouse that faces a toilet. Yes I know, it seems to be normal. But the sewer tried the ways of London - to the extent. Throw to the promise of entities (????) and bad (??) frog and you get a fun attempt on entertainment. I would like to say something interesting to me. Maybe hookup in the movie? Or perhaps the happiest mice of happiness. But nothing did. It had a talent, but it came out. D-
