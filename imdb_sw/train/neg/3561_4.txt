Stephen King changes (written by the King himself) which the family of the youth, the visitors of the rural Maine, know about the cemetery near their home. The father (Dale Midkiff) then learns about the funeral of Micmac's burial place of the beast which has the power of the resurrection - of course anything that has come back to absolute justice. Under the picture of "fear" begins to freeze, tremble, and avoid, and it goes on that way for a while, and the worst aspect is that the functionality of the useless Midkiff. It gets better towards the end, at the end of real trouble. In fact, the whole movie is really annoying, that's why I can't totally refuse it - at least it has something to do with it. The good support of Fred Gwynne, as a wise old neighbor, and Brad Greenquist, as a well-developed spirit Victor Pascow is not enough to redeem the film really. The King has come as usual as a minister. <br>> <br /> Followed by the customer is also guided by Mary Lambert (is it strange that he did not work on a regular film since?) <br /> <br /> 4/10
