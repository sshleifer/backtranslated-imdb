Well, the big money machine has done again! Disney very much takes advantage of morons like myself who feels we must have every video (good or bad) hit by the Disney moniker. Why should I continue to expect these "sequels" that make Don Bluth a bad day look like Leonardo DaVinci? Cinderella 2 has three story stories (already a poor choice!) Is not one of the most innovative of Disney creativity at least worthy storyar? Of these three, the end alone comes anywhere near the quality of animation and story that I could expect. Music is angry and modern (meaning in 2 years will be ready to be dated) and does not add anything to the story. Why is everything needed to be cleaned? You know, the original cartoon is still known because of its shortage, then why don't you respect the truth with nature and songs that show the same style? Gee, I can't wait for the sequel of Ulala Beauty. Instead of music according to Tchaikovsky theme, we will find music led by Britney Spears !!! So Disney, if you're listening, remember we are not all the children out here. How about cast a bone or two to fans who have been around for a long time to know the difference between crafts and craft?
