Sorry, but this may be scary in 1978 when it happened, but in modern times it doesn't. Only a fascinating part in the whole movie is the opening area where Michael kills his sister, Judith, wearing his Halloween mask. The most amazing time in all the film is when his parents beat the mask away to see their son killed their daughter. The movie goes down from there and will not take up to fifteen minutes, but at that time it's too late, we viewers have lost all interest in the story. There is a very difficult development of character, and people always say about Laurie being a unique heroine, when there is really not her. Sorry to disagree with everyone who was scared of this film, but if you want a great movie to watch the Shining Children or Rosemary. That's two awesome films found. Halloween is certainly not in their ranks. I can't believe Roger Ebert gave four stars, for there is no way this film can deserve such a high level.
