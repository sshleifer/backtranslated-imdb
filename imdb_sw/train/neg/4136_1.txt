I read the review before seeing this film, and I didn't believe it. I love films and I expected this to be moderate. It was not. This film makes Camp Blood 1 and 2 looks like greats. The film has a bad acting, bad sound, a bad storyline of confusion, a beautiful makeup - and very beat me to put it. even dirt was trash! Did they have a budget for this film? I don't think they did. You can tell them whether you will enjoy this film or not the first 5 minutes. If you want a good film of cheesy gory go to look at the 4th explosion or even a bloody camp. Avoid this waste - I watched it on television and I heard it, so don't do anything about it. The best part is probably the last.
