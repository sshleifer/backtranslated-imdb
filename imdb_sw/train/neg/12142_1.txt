Please, with God's love, don't look at it. Now I say, I know what you think, can't be bad? If everyone says it is bad as they say, I must look at it! Don't do that! It will be like watching a serious accident that involves small children with a gasoline tanker! You will have weaknesses for life ... the picture will never leave you! I could just look at this half hour before being ill. Acting is the worst I ever seen, and I saw Barbwire !!! If you are in danger of raising your eyes and hitting this movie ... don't say I haven't warned you! Cover and story is a trap! Zombies? Satire? Shaun's dead was good! This movie should be the same .... right? NO !! Writing = crap guide = garbage acting = there was no acting. Still not sure? Then your soul will be tormented !!!
