I got this movie because I worked in a movie shop so I got free taxes. It came, and the lid made it visible. Chick the fire, bear arms, the same, I will look at. <br /> <br /> Oh man, bad argument. This was a horrible thing, I used half of the film's fast-looking film to get dirt, which was small. I think MAYE three instances of weakness of the section. <br /> <br /> Talk of cheesy, crappy abuse, bad excuse of characters. I feel bad to put this movie down, because I know it was made to a cheap budget, but it was also "Authors" and it became a cult worship and franchise. <br /> <br /> 2/10.
