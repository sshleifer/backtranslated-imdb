For some reason, at the end of the 70s and early 80s of the CBS involvement center in New York continued to play this movie in the evening slot or Saturday night for several years, usually at 2 a.m. or sometimes. It is a suitable movie for organizing at that time because it is very difficult to follow and unusual (see another review for specific story details). However, after discovering it often in those days just before the TV cable (And even after the hit but before giving too much all night app), I keep getting this odd. After seeing it for many years I decided to see if I could get it on a DVD. Found only (from each search done in any way) in a good grainy printing on the "Brentwood Video" budget as part 4-pack of movies (4 movies on two skirts two) called "Alien World" if anyone is interested. It is usually found around $ 10-but even less when you use it. The other 3 movies on this set are easily available in many other public movies, so there is no need to comment on them here. But I haven't seen "Eyes" available anywhere. Although it is difficult to "restore" in any form, this publication goes for 92 minutes, so the IMDb once described during the 90-minute cycle is incorrect. Even for a minute of 92 minutes it is not unusual for a film called English from other languages ​​to also have time to run. It seems to be typical of budget-conscience exercises at times saving money from having no trouble writing some cases when they don't think they are important to the story. Could a long-term version be confused? Who knows-unless you have seen it in the native language ... By the way, my attempts to watch this during the day does not work and I end up just closing it. There is nothing about this mid-night watch that fits only this movie .. maybe it's just from my previous experience, who know ??
