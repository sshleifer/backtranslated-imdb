Ok so here is a basic plot. It is 1933, Peter Sellers is Dr Fu Manchu, a 168-year-old Chinese man who has lived for so long. The movie opens and her birthday when she celebrates a special exir which (even the film does not talk) enhances her life. Well in this lixir event is clumsily dropped by the assistant (Kato if you remember the Pink Panther movies) and he ordered his minions then go to find 6 rare items to do elixir. This creates international hunting where his people live to pick up a museum and enter London, meet Dr Fu's nemisis, a Scottish explorer Yard, Nayland Smith, also played by suppliers who try to stop him from what is supposed to be a wonderful comedic adventure. <br /> <br /> This was largely Sellers last full full feature film which made before dying. The tragedy was that he was in it. Sellers who are a talented player and have had the 'funny' roles in the Panther movies and especially in the movie 'The Party', are nothing but this film. This film was quite tortured to stay and I could not even finish. He has completed DIES and I have continued to keep track of the sellers' performance. After a great 'come' work last year, how do I mean to do this and how has this been done? If one person mentioned 10 first .. 15 minutes is the same but then it's ALL DOWNLOAD ... <br /> <br /> Avoid as a blow. <br /> <br /> Test 1 out of 10.
