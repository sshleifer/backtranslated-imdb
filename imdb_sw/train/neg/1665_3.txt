It was a good movie, I really enjoyed it. But the end is suddenly !! There is absolutely no closing and leaving the last tons. What happens after the festival? What happens to his girlfriend? Does he agree with Grant? Does he come to the second meeting? And what about Angela? Obviously, Holly's performance would allow Angela under a few buttons, but nothing is shown to show how she touches. There is a lot left on the air and not very recommended. I don't know if it tries to leave the position in order or something, but it's a terrible end and I think that it really makes jokes. I was shocked.
