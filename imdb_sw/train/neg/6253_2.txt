It is not a very good movie but according to the description is very accurate in demonstrating torture techniques. The purpose of the film was to show the cruelty of the NK POW camps and which have been done efficiently, with an amazing transparency for a while. Whatever technical error exists (and there are many) for this look you will see a forgotten corner of the forgotten war and other good things - again, good because it is done in North north of DMZ and not in Guantanamo Bay. <Br /> <br /> I don't think any Korean fighters brought suffering during the run of the office, and if you're watching movies like this with Pork Chop Hill in comparison to Vietnam movies. I don't know if people are in '54 being inserted into WWII concepts (boys are very hard) or war or what, but it's interesting to see this from the same system that 16 years later will make movies like "Go Tell Aartart".
