I am sitting through this film and it should just say it has been able to keep my mind. The film would be more focused if I did not look at the CGI bad, by mentioning the future for the industry if you would use CGI to look at this so you can know what to avoid. It seems this should be a model novel for screens but all that I saw was a bad movie that is not appropriate to match any novel. For all, the story was not as bad as the CGI, I was so impressed with acting and I think it was good and the little details of the behavior would be as good as it was to get a little confusing at times but it is not surprising as I just said, but for all honestly I want this miss.
