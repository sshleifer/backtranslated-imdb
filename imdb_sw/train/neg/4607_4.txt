You can't imagine how I anticipated the King of Ants. As a great fan of Gordon, I was waiting for the scope of Europe and expecting the worst. For I loved the final success of Dagon - Gordon - very much. The King of Ants began here in my country and was Gordon himself who came to show it. Unfortunately, I couldn't go and congratulate him for the future. The king of Ants is his very non-contemporary film to this day. In fact, the quality of the quality was not the usual standard of television. The summary of the plot is very common and except for a few poor events, usually the Gordon touch is not recognized. On top of this, the already weak script has holes than a suisse of sugar! It involves a young man - who is employed to commit murder. So he does it. And of course they don't get. And of course he likes for the victim's wife. And of course he assures himself. Only the ways that this descent into madness is worth mentioning and they are the only ones who remind you of the fact that you are still watching Stuart Gordon's film. Acting performances are less than average and McCenna as a heroic lowball, George `Norm Peterson 'Wendt as a bastard chubby and Kari Wuhrer as a good sex sex bomb. Improper things do not always happen and the gentleness of the story persuades them very quickly, while the effects of doing surgery are not even enough to reach amateur-horror fans. I read a few comments about the King of Ants, claiming that it was better than Gordon since finally it is a stimulating and mature film. Oh well, I think every good director runs out of steam and inspiring finally.so bad also won Stuart Gordon.
