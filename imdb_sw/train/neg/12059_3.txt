The 80 'was not very kind to the big stars at one time Charles Bronson. Starting with the "II death" of 1982 and ending with this really interesting film from '89, Bronson journalists seemed to be trying to increase on the weight of continuous. "D.Wa II" came from a little imagination in his model of rape and suicide for Bronson's behavior, (rape and murder of his house was also shown in detail). "10 to Midnight" was a kind of interesting film that made you want to bathe later. Nothing liberates about it. Other films such as "The Evil Men Do" and the remaining films of "Death Death" from this period have been done in the line between the top camp and the top barf and their performances of brutality and revenge. I do not know if manufacturers (usually Pancho Kohner) have voted to show a brilliant, Bronson's oldest citizen destroys enough young punks to become his grandchildren or what, but shadowing skills (and horrible texts) of these common films are damaged by little energy which can produce. <br /> <br /> "Kinjite" - the end of these films - is well done but it takes really a cake in the pain of movies. In this film Bronson: sodomizes the miserable; causes pimp to eat her Rolex; allows a male prisoner to be raped by another prisoner; makes the necessary instructions of concern among other things I have forgotten to thank. It is also shown the rape of a young Japanese girl (fortunately, this was off-screen, though it means). People thought when they made this film? What did Bronson think when he decided to destroy his work with these awesome films? For anyone who is attracted to his best films, see many films he has made in '60 and' 70 as “Mechanic”, “Death of Death”, “From noon to 3”, “Once Western Time”, “Red Sun "," The Great Escape "," The Seven Magnificent "," Rider on Rain ", etc., etc. ...
