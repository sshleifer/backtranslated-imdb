I really have retired from the fear of Asia a while ago after being completely ill to see the shade of the garbage story. However, I have been getting more and more in recent exploitation, and so decided to give them other opportunities. My first reserve call was tested by the director of Takashi Miike who was tested very 'Visitor Q'. I would have already seen the Inspection, and when I didn't like it much, I would make it one of the best modern Asian films. Therefore, I came into this with reasonable expectations; and unfortunately, found only by weight. I think this movie is really clever and has gone over my head, but what seemed like I am just a collection of incidents of violence and evil for small or infinite cooperation between them. Any comparison with the work of Luis Bunuel and David Lynch is fair even though I'm concerned; all Miike has done here is making a film; any mind around it has been accomplished by brave fans, desiring to find some kind of meaning. My headache has been put in 10 minutes (after the father has sex with his daughter for some reason), and has not stopped it until the movie is finished; at least twenty-four hours later, or so will appear. Do not do wrong, not against abuse in movies and actually looking for very popular films; but when this may be violent, it is also useless and I have not enjoyed one of the fun. Takashi Miike can have many fans, but I'm certainly not one of them; and indeed I hope this is the last time I will fit with one of his films.
