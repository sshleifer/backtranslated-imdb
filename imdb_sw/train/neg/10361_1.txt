ABC's direct failure to the TV will not be fair enough for the fantasy novel of fantasy which is a Template of Time. Mrs Madeleine L'Engle brought children and adults alike in a magical, mysterious and original world as no writer before it. This novel, the first in the 'quartet of time', is good to take life, the world, and the time itself. But it is easy for a child or boy to understand. His weak morals are spread throughout the book. The effectiveness of this film can be seen as nothing but the dislike of Ms. L'Engle's art. In fact, what did they think? Side effects are cheaper and uncomfortable, the plot is mushy and unworthy, the discussion is widely available and almost every magical character of the novel has been lost. This was a bad attempt to bring this screen. I believe that one day, an intelligent, qualified director (Guillermo del Toro, David Yates, Alfonso Cuar√≥n) tries to bring this book to the screen and understand why it really is a jewel. This situation can be compared to an attractive, fake and costly art room that does not know the ground and makes it completely impractical to its audience.
