"The Victory of Love" did not win over anything. It's plodding, ponderous, 4 hours of suffering. True is a little less than 2 hours long, it seemed just a long time. It hurt me even to think about the amateur performances of good actors like Ben Kingsley and Fiona Shaw. Supporting players are not very dangerous. Maybe they were trying to be higher, to be clownish, but, if so, I didn't see it. Mira Sorvino does not make sense in one way or another. He (he) is just there. I think it is, playing with the same name, written by Marivaux 270 or more years ago, is much better. It can't be worse. Clare Peploe, the author and director of this film, inspired by the recent production of play. I don't know what he was thinking when he created this bomb. Maybe everything was lost in the translation.
