What is this ? Does low-budget sex try? However it fully describes people in Spain. They can come up with a better idea, I mean they do this kind of movies since 60 years and people like them! This is not a young comedy or a single family (you can't allow your 12-year-old boy to look at bed kissing, he doesn't want to go to Spain). This should be tested "R", because only 35 + people seem to laugh looking: S I'm really disappointed, maybe I don't like gay (which is a very important part of the movie). <br /> <br> Foreign humor is bad in the film (except Kusturica), stick and make dramas! If you want a new comedy to try Talladega Nights
