Q: How can the director of bourgeois handle the issue as migration? Answer: by turning it into an existing fragment. Yes, we are back in the 90s, just after the destruction of the East and the subsequent floods of immigrants in the European Union, and it is the best way to deal with the issue of filming on journalist the middle was a foreigner, who was a politician of high school, who was his separated wife, and so forth. , immigrants are asking for political conservation in the unknown Greek village near borders. I think that Angelopoulos can show a social understanding, while having advanced studies of anxiety. I mean honestly, the area where the top army officer condemns his destiny because he sent his daughter to study in London is enough to make you a puke. <br /> <br /> However, it can't be bad, Angelopoulos is the master of cinema art after all, right? Not right. It's this time when its procedure starts to get also fake, kind like the filtered image in Photoshop. Its typical tricks show: there are outdated windows, lighting lights, a wonderful wedding, walking on the river, and people with yellow water clothes. Mastroianni also breaks new ground for further sleep performance. Avoid the truth. Go to his original films.
