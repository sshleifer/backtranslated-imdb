I was looking at the old cartoon inspector of the warehouse as a child. It was like Getting Smart for kids. Bumbling boob can not solve any case and all the work has been done by the brain to talk dog Brain and his nephew Penny. I had heard a live film of honor and so I looked at the library. I lost this film free of charge and I felt I had to be paid to see this. <br /> <br /> Broderick comes anywhere near the caliber to act Don Adams as a gadget sound. His voice was very bad. The girl who played Penny was not found as Penny's cartoons. She is a brunette where the cartoon version had a blonde and chicks. But he does a good job from what he should work with. Dabney Coleman gives good performance like Quify Cheif. Saldy did not hide any unusual place or had a banning message for the Gadget. <br /> <br /> The gadget phone was correct. It has never spoken in a row and done well. Why did they do it? <br /> <br /> Gadget was very intelligent in this film. In the show she was a complete idiot. Here he had a good mind. It would have worked well if he was moron. <br /> <br /> Also closed completely catchphrase. Borderick says "Wowser". It must and always be "Wowsers". It looks lame and out of 's'. I was angry when they showed the assurance and did not have the right words. The only respect for credit was during credit. Lack of Claw is in front of a support group for survival people living. Sitting at the audience is Mr. T, Richard Keil known as Jaws of Bond movie, Herve Villacheze look the same, Oddjob, Kato and more. This is just one part I laughed. <br /> <br /> Others are the end where Penny looks out here to look at the gadget and tells brain to say somethin. Don Adams tells the dog that "The brain is not right now please leave your name in the voice of woof. Woof." Of course this is not a great laugh, just a good piece of nostalgia hearing Adams in the movie. He should have at least saying a stupid car. <br /> <br /> Children will like this, anyone more than 13 can't. <br /> <br />
