Reminds the mind how this film was selected for seven Oscars and one win. It is not because it is bad or because of the merits of the creation of a true behind-the-creation team should be worthy but because in every society it was chosen for Prizzi's desire. Some may say that the Hollywood founders of Hollywood John Huston had lost this point in his career but I did not buy it. Just last year he signed the best of VOLCANO, a study of the darkened Mexican character, which is among the most beautiful. Prizzi's judgment on the other hand, the film carrying the power of the stars, good intentions and good script, proves to be a major barrier. <br /> <br /> The voice and the general plot of the gangster likes a woman-collision compares the quirky criminals who did not receive Mobile with a storm in the early 90s but the script has also been dropped for its own sake, the inspiration is far from the whole story it seems to be unclear of what really tries to be: a romantic comedy, a criminal crime game, gangster saga etc. Jack Nicholson (who works in Brooklyn effectively with De Niro but apparently didn't accept from Jack) and Kathleen Turner in seemingly visible responsibilities be in a state of payment, sleeping in their way through a certain section. Anjelica Huston on the other hand provides better quality but its performance is damaged by the motivation of its character: it begins the person who has been affected by the punishment of the great father, confirms the support of her former husband, then becomes a defensive object that requires her head plate. <br /> <br /> The color of the film has the quality of washing as it was done in the 70 years and the Huston trend is as inappropriate as everything else. There is a promise behind the story and perhaps in the hands of the preferred director would have been locked up with something good but what was left to look like a film nobody liked to do.
