American film workers decided to make a film they think is Japanese. All actors represent poorly, artists are not Japanese and the set is cheap, untrue and definitely does not represent Kyoto in the 20th and early 30 years. distinguish the movie from the script. Unfortunately, they even changed the line of natural plot and fewer bonds. Rob Marshall uses two of its two known Chinese characters who joined in the desert desert of tiger. Marshall probably saw one Chinese movie and tho represents the Japanese culture. Seeing these two actors again makes movies more stupid. The last part of Quentine Tarantino in Kill Bill # 1 is ten times more Japanese than done this movie.
