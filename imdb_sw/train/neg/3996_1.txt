I don't see what everyone liked about this film. The setting was too long and spoke, and when it was finished, the main character remained as flat and opaque as it was in the first place. After the film finally got Cusack in the hotel's hotel room, I had to ask myself, well, what would happen here for the next hour or so keep me involved. Answer: Not too much, John Cusack only has a long, tired, and broken mind. <br /> <br /> Maybe if the character of Cusack was more detailed. . perhaps if his freedom was renewed over his daily life. . . perhaps if the film would have developed its semi-baking theme on loss and faith or has never done it. . . perhaps if the film had made a choice either either psychological or horrible-horrible fears and completing one of these styles. . . I don't know. All I know is that I have seen this movie and two other flowers of fear and none of us loved it so much. Except for the horrible period of the hotel, a frightening woman with a hammer, a fool-of-fun-crypt-keeper in the air duct, all three that accounts for more than five minutes during the screen, this film was bearing. The way, this story seems to steal ideas from the Light and use it here for a lot of effect. Stephen King now has been reduced to steal ideas from him?
