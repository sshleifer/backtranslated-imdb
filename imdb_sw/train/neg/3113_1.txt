This movie is a mess. I wonder it even has the release of exhibitions. Robin Williams's song would have gone straight to the video. Written well. Not properly directed. It is the worst that it has taken an interesting topic and reduces it to the sensible and sensible which does not thrills with no doubt and no sense of emotional or emotional. what I saw and was laughing. Save your money. Trailer completely destroys - not insisting with no thrills - in fact the movie is a very serious mistake is that it's just boring.
