This film is an attempt to present the theory of Jared's diamonds "Guns, Marines and Steel", revealing how Europeans have led the world. The version I saw of this document came to 2 discs needed 3 hours. I think the information can be released in 20 minutes. There are very significant events: Professor Jared Diamond looking at the flight through binoculars, Professor Jared Diamond can not use the bow and arrow well, Professor Jared Diamond playing a heavy load. Was this document considered to make a hero from "Professor Jared diamonds"? This part of the document was bad, it could be spoof. The worst is when Diamond is shown to break down and cry when visiting the malaria ward at the African hospital. None of them help me to understand his theory of "Guns, Diseases and Steel." BTW, "Guns, Diseases and Steel" is 100 times reported. "Can Europeans use guns, diseases and iron to drive them out of this bad situation? Continue to keep on getting!" When he finally gets a business, his theory is the same as interesting and frightening. Europeans conquered the people of other countries, because they had guns and good weapons against stone and wooden weapons. What? Do I really need a professor to show me this? Part of his theory describing how the Europeans were beneficial that allows victory is interesting, but vaccination is a thin paper. In the end, I think the document tried only to show me that non-Europeans have the potential as Europeans. If I'm not racist, I already know this. If I am a racist, Jared Diamond will not go to me with its shaking of natural materials. I don't think adults are the listeners of this document. Children can enjoy this more than I, though. I have read that the book that this document is better than the document.
