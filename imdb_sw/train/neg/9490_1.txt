This is a complete and complete waste, a good example of what the BAD film does, this can not please anyone, even the film's b. Do not repeat, do not waste your precious life on this piece of rubbish. A bad job, leading a bad, horrible (but I mean horrible), with a complete lack of idea about what entertainment (of any form) is. I bought a DVD for 3 dollars, I swear I could pay someone to get it. Burning will not be enough why this film has made me. I love b movies, murder fingers, ocean wells, but this is not near. Do you know those movies that are so bad? Even. Just the old pathetic.
