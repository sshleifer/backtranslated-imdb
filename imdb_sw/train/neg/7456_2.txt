This can not be the worst comedy at all, but it is close. The producers of this movie stole an hour and a half of my life, and I want to return! Chris Kattan is funny for 10 minutes. His high and frightening voice begins to start, and then you realize that all the film is worse. He falls in the long line of SNL-ers of old who have tried movies. Some have been brilliant, some have failed too much. There is no middle location in this category. Although Chris Farley was brilliant, and then the same, and then it's not very strange, then he is dead ... so I think he scores the whole scope in one job. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie as a blow. <br /> <br /> c
