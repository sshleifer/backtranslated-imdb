I saw this by chance shows the cable on wanted to like if I thought Sandra was very funny from what I remembered. The only face-to-face tips I had during the movie was a joke to stop the wonder of how bad the movie I had suffered. <br /> Someone who said this is one of the funniest movies all the time please see one line, one single event, which is even better to be beaten. He is the best singer than I remember that, but I didn't want to look at the act of rest. <br /> <br> I think this is a movie trying hard to love since they think they should and should not look at it effectively.
