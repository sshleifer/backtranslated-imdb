I went into these hopes would be a "thoughtful stimulus" a few young people have gone through this. I love indy movies and I wanted to dig too. find out what the hot button this theme is I expected to expect real, maybe even seeing the outlook. <br /> <br /> All I can say is wow .... if you're in personal suffering, or mutilation then maybe you will be like this. personally I do not like the idea of ​​being pee'd on or cutting myself so I thought it was garbage. A bad script, a bad act, a bad story, a bad lie, a bad editing .... I can continue. I have no clue why the viewer claimed that he was making political action by giving this movie 10. That causes and does not know. voting for film on IMDb is not setting history! it enables other people to think that a garbage bomb like this is the same as long as it is controversial (this film is not, it tries to VERY HARD but it fails). <br /> <br /> you know the movie is bad at 15 minutes in it to ask that all dead characters are afraid. unfortunately dies, but not in pain ways that would give the viewer a right or a confirmation because he has watched the two hours of adornment they have endured. Do it yourself, don't worry even. I have found this film in the master of brass in the local video store for .50 and feel it up!
