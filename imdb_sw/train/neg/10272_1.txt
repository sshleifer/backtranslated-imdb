When I was in the back of the DVD case, I thought it looked really interesting ... so ... I had my mother throwing me into a bunch of movies in the "4th for 20 dollars" in Blockbuster. When we got home and we explored the film ... twenty minutes in it, we found ourselves turning to each other to "this is coming. Let's put it in something else." I will admit, a few lines from friends on the restaurant make us a little smile. But come ON, at least find good actors! Every time in the movie, if acting is bad and the film is not recommended at the speed of decline and it really looks attractive, I can wipe it and get a few few on how high (or less) make their lines. But I can just take a lot. Right scenes seem like participants had a fragrance of laughter, there was no delivery of their lines ... amateur does not even come close to acting in this film. Anyone who came up here saying that this film was good to have some good medicine when they were watching movies. It is a trivial matter that I have ever had to look at. Do not see or buy this MOVIE !!!!!
