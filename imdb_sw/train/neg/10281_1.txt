Carly Pope plays JJ, Fast Food Assistant whom a proud boy, a strong mother enters with him. JJ, he emphasizes this time of events, then the owner of the restaurant, Alex, to take care of his mother instead of "perhaps" through his dying restaurant. Alex is actively predicting to a daughter when he is burning with a mother. There are many problems with this film, the characters are all 2-dimensional. JJ is an independent character, a tendency to hate, his mother high and not deep. JJ participants in the newspaper are few and suitable. The most basic message of more than 50 women can not do it alone, without male support is bad, bad, BAD. Acting is very safe, the script is not recognized. Only saving documents are New York City's surroundings. I would not recommend this film.
