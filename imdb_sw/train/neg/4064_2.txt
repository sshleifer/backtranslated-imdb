This movie is very boring, says the story of the owner of the gas station and his life. No exciting ever happens. The director has "put it real" and feels like the next camera around her life. I had to watch some films by this director for the class, others didn't like it. This film was also viewed for work ... it is better to have a boringness value and a good bridge! In general, unless needed, do not look at the film. But do not minimize the other film with this director, because it is not bad ... don't minimize other films about Africa, usually good, especially when it is done by the western director.
