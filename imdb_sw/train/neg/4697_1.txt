Well I saw the sneak preview of this stupid movie. First off the film is so and not true, they all do. Can't sing. They are a very perfect way for themselves. It's bad. Yes 8 to 10 children can enjoy but they are very stupid. I mean they say their manager is a child. And the record label is fake. His fool. Don't see it. <br /> <br /> By setting up and leading, it's not too bad. It is a good document but it's a stupid thing. <br /> <br /> Just see this if you don't really like good music. Also, it is very corny. It's not even delicious. I hate being very meaningful ... but this is a piece of junk.
