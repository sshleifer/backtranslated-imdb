Yes there are good displays here. Unfortunately, it happens in a cinema environment that does not seem to have a clue that does. The first 45-60 minutes of music are all done as real performance. Suddenly, about an hour, the characters who, until this time, said each other, suddenly started singing to each other. To combine more things, a little more, without anywhere, it actually makes about 15 minutes of singing, then it seems to stop the idea and continue with other things, like the numbers starting with the jazz club and drummer and two electric guitars suddenly turning A fully orchestrated piece with a large non-visible string. On the variation of each type of music is used, it is a clear member of a real authors to write music in a style that appears to be displayed. During the first two pieces of the motown sound of the 1950s, all the parts of the film are just (bad) Broadway show music. Then there is the pure silliness of the snippets of the group to make the bad Jackson imitation family with Eddie Murphy morphing from Little Richard and James Brown to Lionel Richie. He followed Stevie Wonder I couldn't help laughing loudly. This was one of the films that made me know how little time I have in the world and anger that I have lost two hours of watching this film.
