I lost this film only on the fact that covering me call. Yet once the film started I was sad. It seems that they used a video camera at home to make this film and allow a young child to do so. They also used inappropriate faces and shapes to try and fear people but I found myself laughing, I could put it with me and do the best work. As for the plot that I saw was a very good idea but because of dodgy lines and in some cases acting acting they had. It had no direction. <br /> <br /> I didn't need to stay all because it caused me physical pain to look at but I always finished what I started so I took a deep breath and let it continue. In fact 98minutes of my life were lost. I would save myself from knowing that you were standing 'Haunted Valley' and getting something that is more than entertainment. I am a fan of the awesome low-budget films but this was a great wish that I thought nothing was going to be worse after 'Terrorist' but this made me renew. Allow it to type. (/ Starts) for out of *****
