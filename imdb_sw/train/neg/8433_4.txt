Pere is idiot, but knows about it and makes a result. His life is terrible and he does not know how to change it. When his last friend, Nicco, dies. He feels completely empty and decides to go out to drink. When he comes home, he attacks himself with a girl who advertises. Although he ignores, he loved and began to follow him, obsessively. Well the beginning of the film is slow, and can cause boring to many people. However, as the stage begins, it is better (not much!, Perhaps, the best part is 5 minutes of sex (close to 30 different scenarios on it) which you can see in the middle of the movie: it's not good for damage, but for funny and unexpected which is the area. Probably the best of the film. And the characters do not lead it good, and the result is a boring film that can cause funny to some people (not for me) all the film depends on the sad state (idiot, as the film says), has anything interesting. I like Ventura Pons, but I agree that this is not one of its best films (maybe it's worse!), knows how to do better.
