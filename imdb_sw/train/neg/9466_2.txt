This movie was painful to sit, perhaps because (like most people my age, and younger) I grew up with Dr Seuss and loved his books - funny, clever, mad and striker at the same time. "Cat in Hat" takes all the interest and comes out of the story, and the performance of Mike Myer as Cat has an amazing. Why Betecht Belt accent, unfunny patter, bad joke, costume costume? I had to go back and read the books again to see the real problem: books are SIMPLE. This film is OVERBLOWN and a way, a very long way. It doesn't expect that every children's movie is a Toy Story or The Big Giant, but this new set down. How could Mike Myers earn money?
