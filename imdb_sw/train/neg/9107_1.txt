I was mad anybody made this film. I was more angry when I lost a moment of my life while still looking at this. I could have a job of wax and I have been happier. At least Cherri makes me laugh before I hurt. I was confused for the first time but then I caught and realized what was going on. By this time the film was half way, and yes I am the process but I always want to see things to the end. So I was taking it out and looking at it all. Not only actors who are not as attractive as in the Cruel Inventory, they cannot influence. I have seen my nephew crying more than a lobby than the desired desire shown on the screen on this film. If you like bad movies and acting bad to watch this.
