This film is also bone. It is a low-budget film (I hope!) Which causes some degree, but the lack of respect for the honor and open plot hurts much. Phillips is completely trusted in his role as a burst of a good relative who is looking for himself (though his family is ... well ... well, little white very much ...), but all the other cast are holding on the leaves. Every time you have the power is damaged by many melodrama, and there is a very small * way of plots (which is a clear sign of a deficit of the plot. or who doesn't have anything * to do. 4/10.
