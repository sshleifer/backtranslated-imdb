What F * # # was this just looking at? Steven STOP !! Please! This film is very bad and stupid. In a strange departure from the action and adventure, Mr. Seagal now fights (open) they love-their-be-vampire 'as' super powerful human beings. OK? Oh, and their eyes are far from the human way? Wow! However in this movie however, in order to remove Seagals have a-last-punch-and-no-can-kick-me - $$ ego, he is somehow more powerful than they. However, all human beings are broken in every direction. Come, I can understand the big neighbor's mouth harming or the drug dealer, but these are very powerful people. Oh and get this, Seagal goes through a small way of identity issues, because she and her groups in the film think she is Wolverine! Oh GO GO ... And worse than it all! Yes, there is worse than that. He has a voice about even changing the voice in the middle of judgment when we look at his face. They don't sound like him and I believe it could be one of the other actors in the film. It was pure mad. Although I wanted to open it I watched the film to the end. This is down at all even for direct video clips Steven. Awisha! Awisha! Awisha! Body thumbs down! Ability to praise? Well I think so, I will be right in that matter. At least some special effects were the same, and I love the wardrobe choice for actors and executives. All women were attracting IMO. Still, and I said the STILL, it is not recommended for the plain X-Men, Underworld, (insert your favorite zombie, movie vampire here) to stop! Director, author, producer, ALL should be banned & transfer from the movie business. I think I feel how many people feel about Blood Rayne (and about all photos of Uwe Boll) about this film. That's all my $ 1.00 on this film. See if you say.
