I agree with one of the other commentators on the good news and good actors but they have not been considered, and I would also say the refuge. It has been about 24 years since I read the book if it was at school. But I felt that you need to know the story of Jane Eyre when watching this one as bits are left out and therefore does not fully make sense. For example Jane & Mr Rochester didn't tell him and suddenly suggested marriage !!! Pastors don't have time to listen to the audience how their behavior feels about everything that happens in the story. Pastors are good but they do not have enough time to make this story of justice. Sorry to say but I did not enjoy this version. The 1970 edition by Susanna York & George C Scott will be the movie of Jane Eyre of my preference but you should look at 1983 BBC mini series version with Zelah Clarke & Timothy Dalton in two main roles. I love it so much I look at it regularly.There is a version that is facing which goes for 225 hours or a full 330mins.
