If this is your first time you are experiencing the wonders of movies, if you have never seen a "Migration Photo" before, you will think that this movie is a god of gods. But if you see a movie, TV show, even Barney's Dinosaur, then you are not interested in this film. Heck Barney dinosaur was actually more than dinos in this flick. Now I like movies B. I just watched "Giant Gila Monster" right before I saw this swill, and I loved the movie very well. It works like a film B. It has a good dialogue, hokier acting, cheesier effects and honest to Gosh Monster real like a monster! Carno 3 does not just pack a punch of the movie B. It has some gore, and that the Polchek player comes around to be funny a few times but this movie is facing, almost .... flaccid. It is a small engine that has not been of dinosaur movies. I don't know you should watch the film. Some people can watch gum drying on the way and feel welcome. If you are one of those people, then make this film a shot.
