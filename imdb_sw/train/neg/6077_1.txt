What? Can anyone look at this rubbish if they didn't have young children riding around nude? From a movie perspective it is probably one of the worst films I have ever encountered. Some pervs woke up one day and thought I would make movies with little girls in and call it art, keep them in the countryside and no need for stories or details of how they got there or why they don't seem to live anywhere or have parents because p * rn The film does not need anything like that. I would like to comment on the remaining film but I have not chosen the careers so I will say to avoid, try to avoid and get a good film to watch
