First of all, I saw this film when I was 7 years old in Christian Scholl I attended. Not to say that I was very scared. Not because it was terrible but because of content.Cmon ... I was 7. However, the movie was very bad and acting was cheesy. That's too bad to consider that I was only 7 years old and I remember that. One thing that still offends me is a terrible song. I can't recommend seeing this. I will probably do, because of nostalgic. Besides, I am sure remake is better. The best part of this movie though, should be when everyone "goes"; A clear luggage cars, lawnmowers run themselves ... pretty hilarious.
