My wife is a fan related to this show. That's the case I have bought its one season through a third and fourth season is on the order. I personally think the show is one big farce of cast is the same bad. Alyssa Milano should be connected to other trash movies that made such as Poison Ivy, Agree with the Vampire to call a few, other supportive members do not do the same in their pictures. I have seen more special effects in the old Serial Republic photos I have seen as a child. I can understand why men lead to remain in the show for a short period of time even if I don't know whether they have chosen themselves or not. Please. Please do not return to another season if enough is enough, Bob
