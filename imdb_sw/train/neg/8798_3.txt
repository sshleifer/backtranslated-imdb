I love the movie that has at least a button of the story. This did not happen in this film. It is a series of vignettes without cooperation. <br /> <br /> There are cases of someone collecting pineapple cans. A woman with a wig blond never stops her sun glasses. This woman gives us some people at the beginning of the movie and we don't know why. He disappears completely after 30 minutes. There are endless events with fast food where Mamas & Papas 'California Dreaming' is very big (I was like a song). Discussions are linked to food (pineapple, salad chef and import drinks). I think most of the participants got weight during this film because fast food was being used. <br /> <br /> No interest in this film because there is no story. This means love - not something like that. I wonder why I did not hit quickly. I kept waiting for something important to happen ?? not recommended. Perhaps that is the only comfort in this movie - events have so quickly changed that it deceived you into thinking that there would be a revelation for non-trivial things.
