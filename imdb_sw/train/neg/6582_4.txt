Geez, another movie of Life, but again it's not the worst movie in the world, but far better. I think the main problem is that it is obviously who is responsible for what, and in general it is predictable. Still worse, some of the dirt has come to be mixed, and the viewer is left wondering, "Well, what should I care about?" One thing I liked was that the movie shows you that it can't be as simple as "good people are good and bad is bad", and sometimes it's bad and evil rather than good and evil. Hadley did not do what he did because of justice, he did so because he felt he had the right to work as a family, and to overcome the competition. For Alicia, it proves that the victim is not always a good person. Some of them make "have come", even if "it's" painful, horrible death. The "burning bed" is a good example of this, but the difference is that the bad person in the "burning bed" got what he deserved. But, Alicia did "come"? Some will say that they did, but others did not agree, and the general law is not recommended. <br /> <br /> As for acting, it is a mixed package. Some do a good job, like Mia, but others just met as having no work. They were wooden or unacceptable. Music was very beautiful and some of these events are good and steam, especially if you like the girl / girl action. The movie is not quite shot, but due to its glaring weaknesses, the power is in the background, unfortunately. I have heard the rumors of the good, but from the years, I doubt that 'I will happen. But, I can't be surprised if a good man suddenly appears. If Alicia is like evil, it includes horror as people say, then I don't think she will be thinking, "YAY! I woke up from the coma!" Oh, Hadley was involved? "Oh! That is okay! And you want the charges dropped!" No way Hadley would have been in prison for a long time however, even if it does any time since there was no real killings that happened. <br /> <br /> However, worth checking at least once!
