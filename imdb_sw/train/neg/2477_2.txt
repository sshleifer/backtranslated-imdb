If you want to know the real story of Wendigo, I tell you to take a copy of the original story of Algernon Blackwell. This movie was not only bad but was not related to the book. I liked the book I read as a child (In "Campfire Chillers" by EM Freeman) and I was very happy to see a movie that has come out of it. I was very encouraged when I saw it. Another thing is that there were many PCs (inappropriate Politics) under a movie that had no place in the film. When a written PC book was not available. <br /> <br /> My comment doesn't waste your time or money! If you see it on the video store shelf.
