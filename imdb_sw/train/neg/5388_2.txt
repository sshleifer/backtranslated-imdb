There is a good movie here, but this is not the case. The basic thing is good: to explore ethical issues that would encounter a group of young victims of apocalypse. But the logic is very drastic that it is impossible to participate. <br /> <br /> For example, our four heroes are (understandable) paranoid on catching a strange diagnosis of air that has been destroyed near all people. However, they wear masks of surgery several times, not others. Sometimes they are passionate about wiping it and leaving any area affected by an infected person. At times, they seem to be quite nervous. Worse, after living for a couple of weeks or months in this new world of killing or killing, these people always act as a whole new. They have no trouble collecting materials, or food. They are forever escape oil in the middle of anywhere. They will not take primary precautions when meeting with visitors. And after walking through the decaying corps of the whole community, they are like squeamish as preserved debutantes. You need to always ask yourself how they could be saved for a long time ... and even if they did, why would anyone like to make a film about them. So these dweebs stop hurting on moral values ​​of their actions, it is impossible to examine their soul seriously. Their actions would be the first to make some kind of small feeling. Over all of this, we must fight with the ability to work with Chris Pine. His prideful young man James T Kirk may seem to be wise, when viewed with isolation. But in Pack she plays on the same memory: pride and bone. It is impossible to condemn that this makes all its great variety. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the film * looks * better. It has a much higher, more comprehensive view that suits the southwestern United States issue. But that cannot save real weak text or narrow marks (and awesome). Even if you are a fan of the end of the world, you should save yourself from watching the entertainers.
