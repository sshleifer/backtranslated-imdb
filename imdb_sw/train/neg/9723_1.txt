Jeux d'enfants or how the film was misinterpreted in English I would like to say it is a film made by ignorant and ignorant people. I don't know how I can expect something worth looking from the film and the plot: Two stupid kids make a bet that each of them will do something (certainly very idiotic) to prove (wtf?) That they are "dudes cold". I know that I multiply other elements but that's the whole film. They grow older ... and instead of realizing that they are only a few of the weirdos who are left to do their own things, thinking that they are great people. Can anyone expect this film from Hollywood, but France? It's even worse to watch a film from a country that has created Amelie a few years ago, which, btw, the film tries to look like it's far, far away from. Avoid it. Avoid. Avoid.
