It does not matter to anyone who tells you, there is only truth in the word "possession" in the film circles - such as "enabled you to make this film?" Religion has nothing to do with it, but common sense does not. That is, if your head is clear and you have a good sense of judgment. <br /> <br /> At most levels I tried to fix where this film would be interesting .... or even interested in average users. Star? Stories? The only thing? Children's movie children can love with dinosaur and black lady? On, my goodness! I am sure this was a "idea", it seemed good. But at some point during development ... one should describe where the idea could not translate into a piece of entertainment that he would like to watch or pay ... unless they were too much under the influence of alcohol or drugs and see what others could not see. <br /> <br /> Regardless, this is a complete mess. Message, aggressive - sin and aggression. Who cares about the plot (what is the plot?) Et al. Whoopie got paid, but I would be embarrassed to take it. I am sure that he drove his agent / manager / advertiser on this work argument. Certainly not, he continued to make more films. And the worst films. Sad.
