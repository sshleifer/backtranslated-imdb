I read that "There is a Girl in My Soup" came during the lowest period of Peter Sellers. Watching the movie, I am not surprised. Almost nothing happens in the film. It seems, the very presence of suppliers and Goldie Hawn should help the movie; not recommended. The entire movie looks like they just randomly any movies happened without scripting anything. Maybe I haven't seen any film about middle-aged people and older people trying to be hippies, but this provides movies like a bad name. All, Traders and Hawn have emerged in the movie better than this, so don't waste your time on this. Pretty useless.
