This is a bad B movie that pretends to be a document. Film films on the movie has almost time screens and talk as any other character. That has completely destroyed the "text document" that they would want to create. <br/> <br /> The fact that the film is not a real mockumentary is a minor problem. Movies are not funny. Movies are not sexy. Film does not mean anything to say about porn business. Not particularly salacious. Although there is sex, the level of weakness is limited to the film R. R. This is not the case.
