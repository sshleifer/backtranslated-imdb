Tierney is a real tough boy, but this film has dropped from the normal RKO has the potential to affect its effect on each side. Script is about as plausible as OJ Simpson in Ten Cmmandments dinner. Just counting the times Tierney's strange car companions swallow one injustice because after another for its evasive events and violence. The old sketch on it "occurs only in the movies" is used here in spades. Then there is a boy playing, who seems to have walked from the comedy boozy WC Fields, destroying the horrible situation in the process. The set of one room should not help, and neither the Feist director can not feel for that information. Then add the last car to expel all the ideas and pay, and the result is pretty flat. In fact the film only climbs at the station center where hard fighters discover the hidden forces of innocent gas station workers. It is not wrong that Tieney's work has not been spread. I collect which was due to a large amount like a big tough guy off-screen as high and get into one scrape screw after another. His ice-cold way and the sense of feeling reminds you of Lee Marvin's very best-guy. However this project could work as a radio play, but as a film with a humanitarian theme, it is a desire.
