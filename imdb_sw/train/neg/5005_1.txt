Cheesy, compellingly bad (and not for fun) C Grade movie. Everything says 'amateur', from the crumby script (amazing buildings, small partnerships and predictable endings, turgid lights, sound and hand held camera camera cameras, coy and sex and memory, dialgoue and irrelevant I have seen it on DVD and I have been expecting Edward Wood to come out. All of you have been forgiven - your worst movies are art works, and are more durable than this fabric. appropriate to fight 'Every night in my dreams I hear you' - are you sure that the Titanic staff were not involved in this side?
