I took the TRAN SCAN from the library and brought it home. We considered taking a journey to the east and thought it would give us a sense of what was. The film was a waste of time, if I came out to buy it I would call the TRAN SCAM when I saw it takes $ 49. down and around the corners and the film faster. There were many pictures that could be hit on this and you would think they could have made the best products. If I would like to make this project I would like to make more photos, it's stopped on road signals to enable people to know where and where to look at the landscape. Making a film like this should be 60 to 90min. Oh that's the case it was stereo, the whole film was the sound of sounding from the sound of the car, it could be at least put it music. If you want a good cross of Canada to look at the National Road / Canadian National Film and Buster keaton (one of the last films he made) in this comic Buster Keaton comes into the railway trackspeed in Nova Scotia and travel to British Columbia
