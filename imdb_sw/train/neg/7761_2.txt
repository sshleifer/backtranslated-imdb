After a series of power from an island off the island, tigers of nature sabertooth have free populations and mauling of the island. Man, the sci-fi center has made movies with "nature", but I think this might be worse so far! This registered and directed "Jurassic Park" abolition provides all the common clich√©s (mad scientists who think people killed by monsters are "lost at a high cost", the characters go down on the summer roads alone, the young brain characters who only works in the film is the death of horrible death, etc.), and, of course, no doubt. Special effects are sad? Leaders of the puppet in the head of the head head badly are enough, look like a complicated storm, but CGI? Which makes dinosaurs produced by computers in "Walking with Dinosaurs" looks at life as for comparison is just too bad. There are some gores, but many of them seem to be unaware. Oh, and the death scene of the scientist at the end is really one of the worst things I have seen in years. I couldn't even laugh it was bad! <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time, this is very bad. <br /> <br /> 2/10. Oh, and here's an interesting trivia for you?
