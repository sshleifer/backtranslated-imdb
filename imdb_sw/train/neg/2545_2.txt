There is a laugh in this film, that's for sure. Michael Keaton is talented and he felt (before deciding he was a good actor). However, what worries me about this film, is how it is impossible for all characters. Other than two leads, everyone is jerk. I mean, these lost city city is almost as they can not get. You just look and think, man, these lost should be unemployed. In addition, the US factory worker is shown as a sluggish slob. It made me wonder if this film was made by Japanese citizens. O really, at the end they all meet as one, but I didn't enjoy the trip to get there.
