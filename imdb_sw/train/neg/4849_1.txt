I lost this today .... hear many good comments before. WOW! What is a bunch of absorbing this movie movie! Does anyone know the director's address to get my five dollars back? Finally the man said "Stop-loss" from 'worse Iraq War Movie' Ever 'number one. To be fair, I don't think there is any good film of Iraq war, but this was quite bad. I can't get any technical information, there is a review review from other GWOT vets that define all. If the director tried to consult even E-something very low about technical accuracy however they could make the film actually .... maybe. I think the author should be given "credit" to lose the film. He explicitly built a plot for this film from a clear view without suffering from the obstacles of truth. Does anybody but I wonder what is the point of this film? What? Is there a message? Largely though ..... WTF? I am fascinated by all the best views. This film is difficult to explore as a vet because of all the accuracy but even if one can consider it, the plot takes, the characters are poor (say the least) and acting is the poorest. It's amazing, I think, that this movie should be on the Degradation of the Explosion Act, because it's a big bomb I saw this year.
