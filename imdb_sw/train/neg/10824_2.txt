This version is very soft, I'm afraid. Jane Eyre is one of my favorite books and since childhood, but William Hurt's exhausted slave, a completely lost way to Edward Rochester and poor Charlotte Gainsbrough looks like a bored, toddler whose teeth hurt hurt ! I also cannot believe that they removed Edward's great marriage from the end of the book, one of the most common causes of Scripture. I am grateful that they eventually used a young woman, open to Jane, a character who should be worldly 18, but if you want to see a version that is closer to the features and desires of the novel, please see Volume 70 by George C. Scott and Susannah York. York was very old, tall and nice to play Jane, but no one touched the character of Rochester how Scott did.
