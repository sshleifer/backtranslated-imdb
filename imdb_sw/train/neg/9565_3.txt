I can not say that Wargames: The Dead Code is the worst movie I ever seen, as it had one or two times better, but I can easily say it is a more transparent movie that I have ever seen. No once a plot of conspiracy emerged without me I guess 10 minutes early. There was no trick for anything the movie did, no intelligence at all behind the events. Every intention of the said or sent line was very clear was not possible to "interfere" on the film. I found myself laughing on a very thoughtful plot of the plot, and the experiments of attempts to restore the audience, more often than I found myself enjoying the movie.
