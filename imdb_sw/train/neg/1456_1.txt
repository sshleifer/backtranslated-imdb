Just set, this is a simple film and one direction. Head, Increase of Evil, should tell you that this will not try to be anything deep or to do a lot of Hitler's behavior. Instead, from the first minute of the movie where we see the Hitler child looking at the evil and the worst music playing back, we are given Hitler's comments that provide him as a cartoony administrator, apparently bursting out on Saturday morning festival. The film really wants to make his case that Hitler was bad but does anyone need a movie to convince them that Hitler was bad? Finally, behaving like one of the evil is terrible and confusing (one must ask how inept, phsycotic behavior in the film film has led the nation to follow or called a man of the year). This film had a great opportunity to take a figure that has done other horrible actions in the 20th century, and try to get into his mind. Instead, basically it says, "Hey! Hitler was evil! It just thought you would know ..." again and again. The biggest impression is that the film was still being attacked by presenting a sympathetic attitude to the attitude. Give me a break.
