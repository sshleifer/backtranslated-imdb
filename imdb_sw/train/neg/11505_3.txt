This photo reminds me of more photos from 1957 called Crighton Admirable "while on the boat he was a servant and on the island became the master and on the saved restored to the servant. Madonna did OK in some movies however this does not fire. Madonna can't do it this. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure if this was a copy of the "Admirable Crighton" trick but it certainly looks like it and ifs that case then Hollywood should be missing out of thought and that is sad. to administrators to improve the status of their work and only on that this fails in every corner and detail. <br /> <br /> The layout is free and acting is mediocre.Script must be set shredder before taking on the area.For most here and cans Madoona for all his work I think that in the film as "their own league" was quite good and enjoyable "Who That Girl" showed the quirkiness of Madonna's style is not shown come forward or future. Other Madonna film is not as enjoyable with me, they would like to see Madonna animations series and characters from "Who That Girl" I love music from these two films however "Swept away" still under the pile here and will remain so <br /> <br. /> everyone has the same bomb?
