Few could be sent to <br /> <br /> Spy who supported me is a very large and high-hyped sequel. The International Person of Secret came directly out of blue. It was the only star that few people heard. But it was originally surprising, it had modern humor and great humor, always continued with a good taste, and it had a brilliant cast. The sponsors who supported me were being declared more and shaking on business. I will accept it, the first time I saw this film I thought was very interesting, but it was after watching two or three times you see all the errors. Acting was the same, but Heather Graham can't act. His performance was not very attractive and was not very close as Liz Hurley was in the first. The actors who climbed first, (Scott Evil, Number 2 etc.) are cured back and heard and have no photographs of standing. The film is highly interactive with watos. Exactly, I hated how they totally rejected IMOM images. They killed Vanessa at the beginning and had Basil sitting that knew that she was fembot around. What was the point of what? They were killed in number 2 in the first, and now they return him without any information. This should be a spy-spoof, I don't think any of the characters even hold the gun in the film. It comes only through the way, more and more away from the action. <br /> <br /> New characters are not used very much. All Mini-Me 'laughs on my size' joke gets very fast. Bastard oil is just an excuse for a great humor. In general there are about two or three good jokes. Others are unsafe or stand out from IMOM. If this is the first series of the series then I would like it to be easier. But the series began in the memory of dry magic and then fell below the external level of humor. So I tell you, just watch this film if you haven't seen its predecessor, because The Spy Who Shagged Me is one of the last desires.
