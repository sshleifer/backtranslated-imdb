I loved the series of Batman television and I was looking forward to this. But they tried to do much. <br /> <br /> Why they had the story of Adam West and Burt Ward trying to restore the batmobile was my most. I don't want to knock Burt or Adam on how they look now ... It has been 35 years since they came to Batman and Robin, but to see them wearing suits and 'fighting' fought against immunity. I would just see the old stars to make the definition. The story of the batmobile side was stupid. <br /> <br /> For a flashback movie, I think it was too short and gone too far. It was a quick view of my opinion. I love more background. They showed Penguin and Joker for every minute just telling them the same things I knew. Joker had a mustache under his makeup and penguin had smoke even though he hated it and was a former smoker. That was about those 2. <br /> <br /> I would like to read a book. I'm sure it has more in it which this has shown. As to why there were 2 or less 3 Catwoman or 3 Mister Freezes. Where was Commishioner Gordon, Cheif OHara, Alfred, Mr. Freeze, King Tut, etc.. The list continues. As I said even those who were in this were difficult in it. I was very broken. And really corny.
