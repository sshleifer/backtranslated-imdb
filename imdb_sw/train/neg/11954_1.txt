This movie was awesome. In the whole movie, I was worried and I was not sure any. I had to go to this site and read the review to finally understand what it was. This movie is not worthy to watch at all. Not only is sick and rebellious but STUPID completely! Please do not check unless you are one of those who like to watch bad movies. If these Japanese film questions and their roles and responsibilities, than this is the country I would not like to visit or bother to know. This is a completely movie of patients !!!!!!!! I did not enjoy it because it was useless. My partner and I sat there waiting to see if it was scared because that was listed below. It was a general desire.
