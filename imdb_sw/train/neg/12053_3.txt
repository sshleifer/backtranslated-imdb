as always this is an incorrect image of homeless. TV described many lies on panhandlers in the early 1990s and made everyone appear bad, and demanded we made more than $ 100 per day while $ 20-40 per day was closer to reality. when a man was running in a place where I had a job offering, and gave me a job, I went and took a job if I was physically able. and I still had $ 10-20000 for NL $ 1-2 and $ 2-5 cash games on casinos. I often always win and can win the respect if I just had a bankroll. instead of winning around $ 1,000 per month is playing every time you buy less because you want to lose all. I was homeless because I had no risk of using all my money and going to break, sometimes I had more than $ 1000-2000 in my sock when I slept out. anyone who wants to talk to sabacard2003 on yahoo messenger.i admits that it is different from most homeless people though, because of the fact I have never been drinking or taking drugs. im no longer residential, now I am in house houses for $ 177 a month and get SSI and spend a lot of time winning an hour on the web poker. Mothers and sunflowers worked hard to get me SSI. happy my days of hiding under the action at the conference center of casino during sleep at night, worried about getting caught and security finally. had the staff of this television took me to be on a lot more. it is a disgrace to them that they do not choose the best they choose.
