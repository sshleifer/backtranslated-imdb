*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** If one would go through the film on its own basis, one might think that you are looking for a flick of the animal's fear. The plan is as follows. A group of authors of film films leave the island to create a document on using and sharks or using blood. (I lived in South Africa so it was released as a "Surf of blood.") Of course, this seems to have some interesting idea behind it, if it was considered more, it could improve some movie. However, this is not the same as the part of the film that uses part of the film is small due to the fact that their document is interrupted by the magnificent salt-crocodile. <br /> <br /> Script is awesome. A good example of this is when a person is eaten by crocodile which is a frequent occurrence in this film, no one seems to give. Anyone who made in the film was just charging the victim in an area that was meant to be poignant but only ended up being laughable due to the fact that the dialogue in this film was very natural desbious. Another interesting thing about this film is the fact that they create characters who do not like the film itself. They start a bunch of pirates who can only seem to add 10 minutes to a sympathetic film. <br /> <br /> Acting can say that it is alive. Maybe it would be very interesting if they didn't have that awesome script to work. All in all there is no one who has made a bad impact on me. Each person appeared to be a water-down caricature and in this way, none of these actors made me any kind of impact on me. The mamba itself is said to be bigger, about 31 feet exactly with this magnitude of the magnitude shown by an open crocodile that they have given us in the film. The death of crocodile at the end of the film is false and comes from the fact that it causes the body's body to change. With a great cry of ignorance, the film hero announces that he has a plan that turns into a hill and gets a crocodile to pull himself into a fortune of beneath this hill. > <br /> For all, I would say that this film is one that looks for you to believe how bad it can be. What probably seemed like a good idea at that time got a bad script with a great sense of low budget which all made to create a very bad movie.
