This film starts very fast, but the process eventually begins, it must follow a bit. I could not understand why some events took place, and many events occurred before they were explained, and made them a kind of mix. The only thing that goes with it is a large amount of blood / blood that has, though often special effects are not enough. Blood looks like the Kool's Helper. The skin is seen as a person entering a bunch of sticks. Again, the story has a kind of amateur feel, as the author did not take long to be completed. I feel like it could be a better movie if the effects were made better and more time was taken on the script. I really wanted I didn't look, not because of the gore, but because I feel I have lost 90 minutes of my life. If you like so many movies, this is for you, if not, stay away.
