I went to the film as Preview of Sneak in Austria. So he had no idea what I would see. Stories are common. The movie is very long, I believe it can cut up to 1/2 without causing any problems to the story. Its kind of movie you can see the lucky night you want to get bored more! Ashton Kutcher was very good. Kevin Costner is the same. Movie speaks of the American Coast Guard, how they were taught, their style of life and the problems they face. Since there are no many effects on the film. So if you want to look at it, then you don't need to lose your money and time to go to Cinema. It would be more effective to look at home when available on DVD.
