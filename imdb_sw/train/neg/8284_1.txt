Who wrote this? Another person named John Cohen. I think this was the first screen that he ever worked. One should tell him you need to write a dialogue that looks like something that someone might say. Who / who led this? Scott Marshal? Son of Gerry Marshall. What has fallen off the tree. One might have wanted to let him know that you can, in fact, hitting the area in the cab in New York, and it will appear real, and you won't need to do it with a blue screen without reason. He may also want to inform him that he should stay away from Jessica Simpson, but hopefully has learned the lesson now. <br /> <br /> And Jessica Simpson ... usually can't act. Hell, he makes Jessica Alba look like Audry Hepburn, and yet she is a star in this movie. OH waiting, was released by her father. Well, that's why he got that part. That's the only reason I can think of. <br /> <br /> So should I be surprised it's bad? No. What? Should I be surprised at the bad situation? I think most people would like to see as much as I did. I mean you expect to have a movie cinema Jessica Simpson being bad, but this ... it's not just bad, it's the opposite of the classic film. Think of the great movie of Woody Allen, this film is bad if the film is good. It's Anti-Annie Hall. I am very happy to pay to see it, I stopped looking ten minutes in the cus I couldn't continue. Of course I could walk out of early performances. I am wondering how many 6 people who saw each of the theater stayed and watched anything. The movie begins to get worse, and then it goes into a bad situation that becomes a form of Chinese water suffering. And then, when the first action is finished, you realize that it will continue to get worse, and then you need to leave, or commit suicide. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this film goes down to the worst group that should be used in the position of water boarding in Guantanamo Bay. Although some prefer the water board.
