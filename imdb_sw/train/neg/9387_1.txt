I saw this film when it was released first. The memory of how bad it had been with me for nearly forty years. I did not need to trust my views on the movie when I saw it, so I sought a review of a film published in the main newspaper of the capital on the second day - verified by the sensor, the inspector wrote that the movie was not normal, unacceptable, and unacceptable. A small study suggests that the producer was the star of Leslie Caron's husband, so the preferential wind shows the beginning of this bad film. Part of the film's most capable actors - Caron, Warren Oates, Scherman Crothers, Gloria Grahame, and James Sikking among others - suggests that it has a promise. But the death of this film comes from its awesome screenplay. The "secret" feature is very clear and not too small revealed in the film that the viewer is distressed from location to location. The movie seems to burst between being a secret detective and a spypier thriller, but never sit on one or the other. The feeling of suspicion does not exist. The main characters depend on the play of the dry, senseless type of style that does not promote any understanding. Style is a pedestrian. As a result, an innocent observer loses interest in characters, conspiracy, and eventually the film itself. I wonder a little that there is no version of this pathetic film available to buy. I hope that if TCM gets the print of this film and it feels compelled to make it installed securely until 4:00 am.
