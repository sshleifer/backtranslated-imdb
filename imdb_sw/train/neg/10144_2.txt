As Steven Segal movies go this is under the barrel. Its best was just a diet for young bored. This one point scales, then falls. Anime are all cards. Stories are two lame. I can't destroy it by telling you the end. You already know how all of Steven Segal's films are gone if you see one. Here it goes. He is the chief agent of the dooper government who knows so much to stop free to decide, instead of killing him, permanently his brain until the squat. He is fleeing, of course, caught up with his former head who needs one man in a million experience to return a secret bird that has been given to a terrorist group in Afghanistan for Air Force forces who, surprise, surprise, Segal taught . All the heroes, except the character of Segal and his girlfriend of dusky, die hero and Steve-Baby to save the whole world in one dog's swelling, or fell swoop. Whatever it is. It has been done by some of the fly's Air Force and Navy. And a lot of boom-booms. Get Papa's cartoons instead.
