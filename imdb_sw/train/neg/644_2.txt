We've been asking ourselves "why have they never returned the slasher films that were just the same than to fix those who were already ready, so they could only be better?" with the Prom Night they have given Jamie Lee's Curtis' s average but fun 80 and made it even work. His paintings and a number of small films that try to attract young people (so there is no violence etc.), a knife in this flick of slasher is open. To send those that include Britney Snow (who was very good at Hairspray) try their hard but the material does not give them anything to do but they are scared. In anger it is how the events of death are dealt with (we will hear the attack but do not see). It also seems that the only place the knife that worked on this film was the editing session since the film looked like it was hit (im guessing anything that was scary ended on the floor of the refusal room so that you were not afraid of the children). Number 1 at the box office !!! Slasher movies are a lot of fun but in the Prom Nights case it made me want to download the original.I have seen many OC and Dawsons Creek sessions.
