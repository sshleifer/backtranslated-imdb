Many agree, Genesis is a good modern anime. Music, graphics, and the world are made up of good and really stand on other modern animations. However, if you are looking for more of this, than I suggest looking at where. Beauty leaves its shortness and appearance, and when it comes to conspiracy with the characters, there is nothing special. The action is slow and small and people are flat, frequent, and do not do the truth. Don't mention the pit of the plot here and the pit of the plot there ... So, in summary, oh my goodness, I've never seen anime as good as this; and oh my goodness, it's like ... -poke- people don't do that. It took the initiative of GIANT in front of the drawings and music in the anime, but also took a few feet during odds, and unfortunately, there is no great action to do so ...
