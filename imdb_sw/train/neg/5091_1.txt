My opinion is for the Russian version of the Space Race of Kosmos (Battle for Space) shown at the Russian First Center on April 10-13, 2006. Negative interpretations may damage certain details but I am sure it is the case. The number of actual errors is that it is impossible to list, especially in the first part (development of the first missiles). Even half of U.S. The film has many errors and omissions. Viewers were not told of any V-2 / A-4 launch from U.S. Three different Jupiter C missiles are launched by the same number of 'UE' inboard. Apollo 1 will be delivered to the Moon, etc. In the Russian half, everyone is good. Korolev is afraid of NKVD, Glushko is a striker and traitor, Mishin is brewing etc.. Men like work; no motivation, no life at all. Similar to decoration is bad. Gagarin sings a loud song waiting for launch (I think this was added especially for the Russian version).
