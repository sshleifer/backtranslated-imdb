SEX WISH was released (no more than ten minutes, ahem, 'severe' footage) here in England back in the early days of the video boom, causing a tabloid storm in the teacup when allegedly led a copycat murder case. Surprisingly, these journals sparked this unpleasant flick under the carpet in their rush to get innocent of FROZEN SCREAM and NIGHT's DEMON canned, and the film was just lost as a result. I jumped up to look at the DVD-RW and spent a lot of time with the film and my jaw on the floor. It is not a large amount of politics that is missing, three-X takes the deaths of Michael Winner (made a kind of name to give away as far as the impulse was involved?) And hard sex with real abuse caused by seventy seventy seven . If you don't think you are squeamish, this may force you to think again. For the time of SEX WISH is over, you will need to brush your fingers to clean your eyes and disinfectant to take a long shower to purify. If any film is worthy of "movie alone, only the movie, the movie" of the identity, is this. <br /> <br /> Highlights (or tiny) - a businessman using a vibrator on a victim with masturbates on it, Harry Reems's scene-robbing a mustache, who have no help with young blacks who are forced to screw in front of a swine river (they could winning Oscars for all their credible credentials as the Academy had gone mad) before someone was beaten because of his problems, and a certain positive trend threatening to raise the case on their clear grinding nature. Don't say no warning. If you thought the world was more innocent than thirty years ago, SEX WISH will show you that it is very bad.
