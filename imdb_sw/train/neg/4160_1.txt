This was most likely for the worst movies I saw. I looked at a large group of friends and after that, none of us understood the plot. In addition to the lack of conspiracy, acting was wrong, "special effects" were not very special, and writing was quite frightening. The only film to redeem is that it is so bad that it is quite funny. You can't help but laugh the zombie to run over when executives are spewing talk crappy. I will not recommend this film to anyone who is looking for a good film, but it is something that a group of friends can gather together and laugh well. Now it's a joke between my friends and I. 1 out of 10.
