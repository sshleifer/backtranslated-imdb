This full movie name is "Waqt: Race against Time". That's running no one can win, but you can certainly cut your margin lose by losing any of your "waqt" value on this bakvaas. This film was solid and cheat in a way that made K3G seem to be honest. It had led my loyalty far away. It was ridiculously stupid in its storyline, and deserved to be canceled by it. It's not as bad as Baghban or Black, but this film has nothing to recommend. Fools, without meaning, and the performance of OTT for ridiculously for Amitji. The main "conspiracy" is another good example of fraud propaganda that affects many films "family" BW. If my father, who raised him, and whom I love so much, was stolen as Big B did Akshay, I would shoot him himself. Say nothing to reduce the terminal illness.
