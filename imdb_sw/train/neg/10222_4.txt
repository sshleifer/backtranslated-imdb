Other than the great movies with James Wong Howe's amazing events in the war, this film is a real stinker. This is the second film that I have seen in recent days led by Alexander Korda. The first was "Rembrandt" of Charles Laughton. It was lousy that I shut it off. I am afraid it is not very good. Flora Robson is as bad as Queen Elizabeth. Perhaps, her performance as the Queen of the Virgin was good in 1937 but when compared to that of Helen Mirren, it is not quite good. In the robot style, Robson says his lines. His mission of war for English soldiers is a very lack of spirit. Even Laurence Olivier can lose this piece of boredom. Vivien Leigh's wife is in the role of supporting here and she does not present anything here. Imagine, that Scarlett was 2 years later! It is a shame that history and the Spanish Army have been made fun in this film.
