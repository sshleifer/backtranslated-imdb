From the mind of Harry Alan Towers comes another piece of sludge of the cinema. Because of the basis of the work of H. Rider Haggard, the only effectiveness you agree with anything Haggard wrote is really that it takes place in Africa (with Africa that has dinosaurs - which our brave travelers use to pull their boat!), And has other characters with similar names. <br /> <br /> Our heroes (David McCallum, Patrick McNee and John Colico) have struggled to find treasures, armed only with medallion, and ended up where the treasure is, solely for space. Along the way, they meet the rhythm of the lame organism, the French chef, and McCallum has a relationship with the Phoenician Queen. <br /> <br /> It's ridiculous, it's hoot. That's the only reason I didn't give them 1.
