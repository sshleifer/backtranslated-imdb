A terrible film was made on the $ 9.99 budget. A very clear example is used, a bad act with a bad story about visitors who use beef from the shop as a fuel for their spaceship. The film has blood (not enough to bother) and a character with a biometric takes one of his hands. (Yes you read correctly.) It is a song that was made in the "show of talent" (how about irony?) And a fake punk / new wave that I think was called "I M Wise Seeking" Muscle ". Other than that, this is not the value of your time, even at the "bad" level. See if you like foreign movies, but anyone should be clear. Rating: 1 out of 10
