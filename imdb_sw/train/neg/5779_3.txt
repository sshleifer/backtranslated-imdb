I saw this film a few days ago ... what was hell? I love movies and Brian O'Halloran, it's fun and enjoyable. When I saw the name of this name and the type I thought of, this could be very good ... some of the parody for slashers or other movies Gore ... but then I read the preview and the right ideas can be good however ... but it wasn't. .. <br /> <br /> My opinion: if the movies seem a bit like a document, and a bit of comedy try some Moore movies or an autopsy visitor, they're really about something. this was empty. <br /> <br /> and put a nice head ... no comment ... very bad joke
