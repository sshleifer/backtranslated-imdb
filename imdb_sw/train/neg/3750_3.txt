Finally I had to look at this short Lynch experiment after a long wait .... and unfortunately, it wasn't worth it! Even for a fan of Lynch who has died, I have found that this is beautiful .... <br /> <br /> nothing happens, there's a long, long, long breathing where nothing happens, long, free speech where nothing said and one thing ended with the observer without knowing, or caring, what hell was all, what happened before and what happened later. There was a crowd of Mulholland - a blonde girl and a brunette girl were Diane and Rita -esque, and when the Lost Highway lost to all the important events that had happened but could not be spoken on the open. Unfortunately, all of this is very unpleasant and very interesting, nothing happens, it is very forgetful and I think I will wipe it on my computer and forget I've watched it. I'm sorry David!
