Marie Dressler carries this Drug-Time game about a wise owner of the bank, which recently opened in TCM during the April of their foolish month of April. If you come with the hope of laughing with respect to the Dressler-Polly Moran team, you will be disappointed, since this is a very slow film. It is also very serious, so surprisingly considering it came from MGM. Leonard Smith's sketches from 'set up cameras and tell' schools, from time to time to the effects of cast, who find themselves giving off-screen lines (like pot and publishing newspapers before they exist!) Or have their heads cut off . The film does not even have a well-known director, centered on a clear fly night of production. In general, it is an unpleasant mess, and the dressler often eliminates-and giving it just amazing, dash the end of the bathroom to put it.
