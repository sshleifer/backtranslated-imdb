This type of conspiracy really has great potential, but it was hit here. In fact, I heard a cheese element at the beginning, but I thought it would be better after finishing. Who, I was wrong! So a foolish scientist makes a monster, wants to brag about his old documents before killing them, but of course they run away. After this, it is very bad. I had to count when the shark ball was lost behind some leaves, but I most likely have lost count. Get down at the foot of the foot from the foot to show us how a shark man gets people. I would like to have a spoon-driven every aspect of the awesome film. Oh, and after being around to be killed by a man with a shark near the island of jungle-esqe, there is nothing more enjoyable than the middle man reading Shakespeare ... This is one where you'll find yourself rooted for monster ... if you can carry it to check this bad excuse for Flick.
