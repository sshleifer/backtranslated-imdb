It is about the time we see a film that is unpleasant to this ancient Indian tradition. Sometimes it is clear how many of the 'doctors' love, even lying on how they can't pay their customers. When they were wearing their golden eggs, the 'contribution' box was unnecessary. Note that only a few people get 'treated' when we see very few events. Remember that when you look at the mercury gum is not poisonous and that a few of the Indian banks are 5 rupee, while the average salary in India is 1,700 ru / month.
