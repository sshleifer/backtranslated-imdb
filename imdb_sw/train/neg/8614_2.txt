I must admit that I have never been a fan of Rodney Dangerfield. In fact, from me there is no "respect." I just watched this because my wife wanted to see it, and found exactly what I expected: a stupid story without real humor. It is full of perfect, rough jokes and ignorance conspiracy around the developer (Dangerfield) plans to build a ski center in Utah which did not dominate my thoughts at all. <br /> <br /> Apart from Dangerous Class The film made a weak star, including the love of Andrew Dice Clay and quite on John Byner's hill (I did not know he was still close even when I saw his name in credit for this. ) <br /> This is really a dangerous risk. <br /> <br /> 2/10
