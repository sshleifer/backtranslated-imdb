You can't hold too much against this knowing that it was done for four days, and I had expected to be a campy anyway. (Not all that is true, except Kevin Kalisher and Huntley Ritter, who have not taken so much, all the other half are one half; Riley Smith is very bad.) The story of ignorance is actually paid attention to, what kind of fear; I thought all the purposes and these non-low-budget movies are receiving basic sex fantasies and not giving stories about stories, but they use many words like "technology" and "physical" on the script to get their point in. (Although it is possible that the story is important to explain why there are very few members thrown.) No one cares about this stupid story, and the only things that are interesting in the film are the cult of worship and soft-based homoeroticisms (which is not all of edgy ). I would like to enjoy more if there were some random killings for any reason. The film is a crop, and look for the quality of TV and the level of action. There are a few "scenes" that are the same - boys bowing in bed in their pipes, they feel themselves; or be tied down to make gray faces when wine is poured on them - and some of them are kinda funny. And I liked to dig for L. Ron Hubbard and have a story of the story about religious pastors who told religiously, but it's still not good. 3/10
