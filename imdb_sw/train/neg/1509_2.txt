I have problems testing this movie. Carefully directed, there is a lot of money in it. Gere and Danes are sharp (though the screen surface uses more definitions and wind), editing and movies are better. On the other hand, it is one of these real-time movies where one cannot help but wonder if the director himself likes to create special scenes, and, yes, someone can't help but wonder how many copies encourage the film. <Br /> <br /> With only artistic words, it is 9, but I must ask myself who these people are giving their money to produce the film.
