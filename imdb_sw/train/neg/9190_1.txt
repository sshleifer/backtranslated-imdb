That is by far the film of the WORST I've ever seen. I have seen the most bitter movies in my time but these take the cake, no, wait, means all the bread of the bread. It is so bad that I believe the word to describe how you will feel after this attack is not started. Please make your approval, if you need to look at this and watch thirty minutes of Barney's interesting purple color, then multiply it three times and you will only get a small part of the fear you would be in. In a summation, I think you can really call it a movie of fear, but only if you already have a serious and worst fear in business and the story completely useless. <br /> <br /> Music Rating, -10 It hates
