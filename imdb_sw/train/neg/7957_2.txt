Who. In Twin Cities, we have a center that shows the "Big Bad Movie" Monday to Friday. Today's nugget was a film by Carrie Fisher called "She Back" about an angry woman who ends up being killed when strokes enter her house. Bea (Beatrice) returns to despise her husband. He wants him to take revenge on his killers, therefore "he is back". And he will not allow him to rest until he does. He is angry forever ... and the audience, too! This movie is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Hey, I would like bad movies, though (my fave movie is Xanadu). I was shaking my head in all the film, looking at who thought this would be a good idea for the film. Bea is just very angry. This plan is stupid; Acting is bad; The story ... well, you get my drift. Otherwise, if you want to see a very bad movie - a really bad movie, check out this one out. Not eligible. Heh.
