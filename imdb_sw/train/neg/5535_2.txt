I think a great thing of failure can be to be boring. Evil is better than stretching. This thing has no breath. It has no interesting fact in Cambodia. How many films are made by the 30-year-old in Cambodia. However, the crisis is a bit difficult to think. Even the movement of the forces is a little aggressive. What draws on the interesting line is the story of love. Why are these two men completely missing in the skirt of the skirts I don't know. I thought he should continue to use zombies (as well as they) and forget all about him. The movie just plods together. The perfect microcosm where one of the code characters follows the Cambodian priest through water to reach the secret place where hieroglyphics (or whatever) tells how to turn people into zombies is preserved. I thought they couldn't get there. One takes two steps. He stops. He looks closely. Another person hides behind the columns. He takes two steps. He stops. He looks closely. This man hides behind the forest. This is a short film. Then there are bad conversations and confidential conversations. I really have great patience when it comes to the shape of B. This can't be interrupted. By the way, the most appropriate head will be the Resurrection Store.
