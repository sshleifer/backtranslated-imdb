I got this movie from Blockbuster in one of these racks you can find as 5 movies for 20 bucks. I would like to say that I have the value of my money on this. I expected bad talk, crappy monsters, and shaky cameras. Well, if Meatloaf said, two out of three is not bad. Acting is bad, although it's not as bad as some movies I have seen. Or maybe I have watched many low-budget movies recently lost my focus. There are some bits that are acting very badly, but for the most part it is at least the School of Play. <br /> <br /> CG of Sasquatch in this film is the second most part. The first thing I thought when I saw (and I noticed another consultant agreed with me) was that someone who had been suited would be better. Animation animation for Clunky will be shown well. So you can ask why I would call CG a second part more. That's because the worst part of the film is the sound effects. They are great, angry, and constantly. I've been camping, I know what insects seem like forest at night, and when they can scream, they don't hear like a cacophony in this film. Usually when "history" seems to end the film discussion, it is a bad thing, but from what I have found in this film discussion, I had nothing big. <br /> <br /> The step was normal and boring. The tension was absent, as was any sense of understanding and characters. Speaking about the characters, all were caterpillars and bland. The only way to play it gently was in the middle ... in fact, I can't imagine anything. There was a line or two that made me pronounce the smile of the wan, but that was about him. <br /> <br /> The movies are suitable, one or two steps on what you see most in a film like this. However, it still had the quality of "movie movie" that you get with the movies made in pocket and prayer. <br /> <br /> If you have been like me and get a kick from a very low budget flicks, and you can see this in a bin bin, think about grab. Otherwise, get away at all costs.
