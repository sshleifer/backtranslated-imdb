I was unfortunate to lose 10 quid buying SS new movie on DVD: Attack Force. Now I can always stop my faith to watch this film. Salt salt and some beer of dark evening on the sofa watch the evening of the evening noise em up is perfect for one man like me. I bought this film to think I would like to see the art of cool winter and shoot. It is hell. Segal is old and closed, the plot was hard even with SS levels and wiping all of Segal's acting (as it started with) is very unique. In fact it was obvious that half of his voice was called by someone who seemed nothing like him. Neither SS did it again (the moot action) of the workers were very bad in their work they could not record the sound well. Sounds would spin and return between Mr Whisper Segal and someone who makes a voice on Honda advertising! The wise plan is not a matter because because many films work with the same premise like this, there is nothing new there. A common combination of characters who will die of destruction as eating and dirty organs that are expected to get sanctions. Avoid this film if you avoided walking in front of a speed train or a flight of H5N1 Flu. <br /> <br /> Say trash. <br /> <br /> 1/10 <br /> <br /> This has been a public health warning.
