Misty Ayers had a body of smoking, and that's all this movie was close. Fresh exploitation. I started playing the game with me, and counting the number of times you beat the music of the orchestra music. And in fact the music is not completely related to events. A thorough observation: walking normally into the room and saying "Hello" was closed and expelling music from the epic of roman. I would like to know why this film was sitting on the shelf for 11 years before it was released. I learned from this film: that the lower panties of women's rise was in 1954. I speak Sigourney Weaver in the original photo of Alien movie. For at least 20 minutes the first 30 is Misty entertainment excluding and wearing clothes (except for bra and panties, sadly). It also includes bad dubbing, causing "Look! Godzirra!" effect.
