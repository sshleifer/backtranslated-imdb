I chose this film on the cover alone to think that I was in an adventure up to the level of "Indiana Jones and the Penalty Temple". Unfortunately I was in an ordinary yawn. Not like any yawn I had before. Yawn was so great that I could find anything of quality in this film. Coverings described the special effects of wonder. There was no. The movie was so lightweight that even fraud were clearly shown. It offers an idea that you can solve problems and violence. Good if you want to teach your kids that. I am not. Get out of this. If you are looking for family entertainment then you can find something that encourages them elsewhere.
