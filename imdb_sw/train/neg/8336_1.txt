How to hell found this? Appearing itself as a comedy of the caper, the "exemptions" of basically "exemptions" are two hours of people separating pieces of sentences. Normally Warren Beatty is generally seen to be drunk, and Goldie Hawn usually does as she is in trouble. For Gert Frobe, his most famous role - Goldfinger - was more interesting than his behavior here. Even a boy with a LSD champagne bottle can save this litany. <br /> <br /> Do I compare this film with "Sort 9 from Outdoor"? I can't do such a thing even if someone gives me. "P9FOS" was idiotically made but completed hilarious; this was idiotically developed and makes you as cold as your brain broke from your ears. Warren Beatty and Goldie Hawn have created for this when they met with "Shampoo", but then participated in the awesome "Town & Country". Maybe it should not take into account the stars in the cinema. All in all, I would like to have my skin broken off than any more. Hasila. <br /> <br /> Maybe they should do it with Jackie Chan. Then I would give it to see it.
