Don't understand how these animation films continue to occur, and no matter how good (or bad) they are. I saw this movie with my two children (5,7). They like anything of animation (like many people who tested this film). The Theater was close, and I expected to see the movie and cast it. To be honest I was distracting. It was predictable of course and is quite clear. There were a couple of supporters in the film and that was. Of course they tried repeatedly to get a cheap laugh, but did not work. My son almost always tells me that he wants a DVD after watching the movie's animation, but this is not. My daughter slept half way. Also, children thought the animation of the character seemed to be weird. I have never heard from them since seeing Polar Express, which gave my daughters dreams. I don't believe, it's not the kind that looks negative in everything. But quality is the quality, and as many films that make it out there, it has very little.
