Yuck! And again I say ... YUCK! The original version of this movie was a well-written story of a man who had died and driving through purgatory. The original movie had a lot to say and it didn't come out of its way of telling it. And, it was to chick naked on a motorcycle. This version strikes me as something the producer bought right and then left out of disinterest. It seems that a group of people carefully decided to succeed in the nineties and to change ethnicity and girls only to be good. The movie is not about burnout on suicide in the final stage of the opposition. It is about a person who tries to go to the hospital to see his wife. There was no reason for this film to be made other than offensive ...
