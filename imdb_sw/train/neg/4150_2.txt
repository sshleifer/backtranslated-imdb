Oh really true. I have seen films that I didn't like most, for any reason, but never seen a film that just fails in every text of the film. Even failing to make a film, the Hercules Way in New York can be said to do. It's not the movie I like at least, but it's the worst movie I saw. It is the first thing that hits you. I have never seen more films than pornography. In fact I have a lot of films that have been done better than this. In fact it is bad. <br /> <br /> In fact, it's awesome. The camera function is amateur. Editor is nonsensical. I think they could not buy sound equipment properly, and this means that every car's location (and there are many of them) drive them three hours an hour and every area is set out with one timber zone (and there is a lot of them too) in fact is given on the label, again employs the worst of vibe porn. <br /> <br /> The program is nonsensical, as many have said. I will defend Vampiki walking in the day and the fact that despite being known by Nosferatu, this has never been a natural part of mythos of the vampire. Speaking about mythos of the vampire, the author has seen reading Carmilla, or at least the Vampire lovers. I'm not sure how I feel about this, playing from the impression that this movie means it has at least some of the expectations of the Gothic novel I am very happy about; or are offended by the best references to sledgehammer and for the worst damage to the source material. By and large 'Great' is insulting to Peter Cushing though. <br /> <br /> It gets two stars however, because I can't bring myself a single star for a film that has, or at least it wants to have vampires and zombies in it. Unfortunately I looked at Lifeforce (another film that has vimpires and zombies in it) the same day as this, and despite being a guilty film itself, it comes out of the result. The last, this is not a very bad film, or very bad for any enjoyable way, even drinking. It's just a mess, and the value of no one to look at.
