I hope anyone who has shared those lost with their voices was expelled. Only the top pieces are a few of the characters, 3 out of 5 of my favorites were killed away from the end of the season (and one of them was a cat, to set a view). The whole story focuses on sex, and nothing else. Sex and Vampires, gay sex with gay vampires, sex sex with direct vampires, sex and blood marks of vampire, sex after drinking blood of vampire, sex in front of the mamba, sex of vampire, non-vampire sex , sex because we fear vampires, sex because we deserve vampires, sex just because we were vampire, etc.. There was nothing against sex, it would be just fine if it was a little trick and it was inserted into the story. . You probably have a story story and then deal with sex in it. But they were not worried to do it ... and Anna Paquin is a bitch of the tooth gap. Maybe the motivator or his behavior takes, I don't know what it is. <br /> <br /> Another part of the story that I find so much is why Bill's 150-year-old that seems to have its elements together will be interested in someone like Sookie. He always jumps off to handle him with objects that he cannot control. He comes out for two days and has already decided that he is "not back" and suddenly has a sense of dog-man? Give me a break. She should be a 25-year-old woman, not a 14-year-old girl. People around her are dying around, and she has a more bright smile on her face because she just gave her a V-card for some dude because she can't read his mind? As the main character of the story, I would hope to show it could do a little more to make it understandable and someone to invest your interest, not the person who put the secret hope killed or put in coma. I can't find anything about his behavior that I love and even the fact that he can read the mind is very interesting and not very interesting. <br /> <br /> I can't waste my time and watch the 2nd season coming June.
