Yes, Madsen's behavior - when talking to a woman from the TV station - is the same: LAPD is a demolition, cruel and racist. And this film doesn't do anything about it. Well, here are good fighters, moral fighters, even a black man, who, a Christian, a offender. But this is the story of the story, to accept. True not like that. And most importantly for fans of action: shoot out is boring. It's just shoot and shoot and shoot. No extra. Play Counter Strike, then you will have at least have something to do. The only values ​​of this film are: LAPD is good now. No more cops in it. If you like non-support ads, for police business and military service, check out this film. It's the longest business I saw. (2 Points for camera and editing).
