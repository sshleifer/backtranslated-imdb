This is some interesting for fans of "bad movie" entertainment. It is more important for the students of the pop-up of 1970s: fashions, furniture, perspectives, and "big women lib" of the early 1970s, when it was still fresh and novel for a self-reliant woman, self-existed. br> "Superchick" (Joyce Jillson) had a reward for money as a task of ending (after all, what a flight attendant but serves 30,000 feet - which goes to men too), she slept next to many people, she can to protect yourself and others (and karate) and was not bound for anything. This is the kind of saved woman who feared the juice from women fighting women, those who believe that no woman is perfect without a husband. The "sexy administrator" was a powerful archetype in the late 1960s and 1970s, (geez, even on "Family Partridge," I remember flying to bachelor Ruben Kincaid always connect with pastors) and from in this regard, this secret film is important for pop culture during pre-AIDS prevention, love-free, lib women, moving seven years. That plot is bad even though. And for those cemeteries in the audience, there are a few breasts to watch.
