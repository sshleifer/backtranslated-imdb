The person at the end of this film is very unknown and dated that my whole class of films was laughing as mad. Now more than that film was the same. It had few unpleasant events but had a few shots of good camera and editing. Yes Alderich is a good director who made the Phoenix and All That Happened to Baby Jane among others. The problem is not by leadership, acting or anything technical. The movie is just destroyed in the third act. Why? Killing, loses, turns and all the characters have been around the NUCLEAR APPLICATION? What he heck was a smoker writer when he came up with that? The way that comes out of another place may be Deus Ex Great Machines in history. For all complaints about the Burton Planet of Apes, David Gale or Notorious Life I think this is the last end. What to allow.
