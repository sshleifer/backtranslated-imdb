Anyone who has read my review to Uwe Boll's "alone in the darkness" will recall that I have separated the incompetent work of living on that piece of human waste so that each hair on your hand is taken out. This, make an example of the more and more unwanted waste and try to imagine the pain of getting your teeth released without novacaine. Do that, and you will have a general idea of ​​what Eli Roth's "Cabin Fever" is about. <br /> <br /> I've never believed any film that was able to dreck the worst dreck that Uwe Boll appears out as "the worst movie ever made." But, honestly, I have to "Cabin Fever" is very close. This is still another sad excuse for a motion picture that had no reason to meet with any kind of presentation. For someone who says such a kind of horror like Eli Roth does, he has created one desperate patchwork and downloading the movie I think I've seen throughout my life. How do you change stories like this? Imagine the possibility of this plot would be without a spelling, without a bad letter, and without any unwanted and unwanted comedy. The virus-related virus can eat meat should be better than what Roth has given here. This document has failed on multiple levels with me. And, when I don't doubt the obvious talents the director has, I know that he had a long ball on the idea that could fix the kind of terrible. By saying this was the production of lost opportunities of course will be a great play in words. The amount of generosity of blood and damaging special effects can not even save it, and that's one thing that is normal. There was nothing about "Cabin Feast" which I could recommend to anyone. When three quarters of the crowd come out of the semi-semi-field, you know the movie is increasingly fast. My best advice for those who read this will be tax just before buying. One view was more than enough for me to know that I could never bother again.
