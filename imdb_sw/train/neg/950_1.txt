I got this film on AZN on the cable. It seemed like it would be a good film, Japanese "Card Card". I can't say that I have never loved an Asian film, quite the opposite. Some of the most popular films of all time are Japanese and Korean, and I am a great fan of John Woo's films in Hong Kong. I am not impressed with the hard-hearted film, like Tampopo or Chung King Express (my two lovers), so I thought I would like this. Well, I would like to kneel down and drink my own blood than to watch this film, too bad. I think the director Steven Okazaki should have water for Quaalude, because no one this film had personality. And at any time of the characters tried to act, as opposed to connecting a line or two, their performance reached as forced by a great lie. I really didn't think anyone had ever done before ... the only person who really heard was Brenda Aoki. Even more amazing is the news of CBS morning called "breathing of comedy breath". Not comforting, nor the breath of comedy. And that end was very predictable, an old observer must be foolish to think of such things. <br /> <br /> FIND this film unless you want to see a plot of predictable plot and wooden acting. I really think that "Pastor Bensonhurst" is a much better film than this ... and I came out half way through the film!
