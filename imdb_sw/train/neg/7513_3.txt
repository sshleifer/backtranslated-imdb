What can I say? I think I must write "Spoiler alert" and then "reveal" they used F-word LOT in this movie - as in every two sentences. I did not like this movie completely - many tips on sexual misconduct, stopping and cheating. And that promise was out of the window. I paid this film "3" and two of those points are for Mira Sorvino's apartment on the dance floor.
