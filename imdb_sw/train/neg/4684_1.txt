This film is insulting to all travelers. It was stupid. It seemed to be written by monkeys. Acting was wonderful. If this is the view of the majority of the Navy, then I cry for our protection. This movie was bad. I put it under the "Underwater Trip" as a submarine movie going. Gene Hackman must have a high cost of rent to make this tax. Denzel Washington must be over. Little in the plot makes any sense. And last. For the accused will be paid for his crime? Hollywood would just think of this waste. If you haven't been interested yet, I didn't like you. And if it was not for all pro views, I couldn't have trouble publishing.
