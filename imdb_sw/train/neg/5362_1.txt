A woman with a pig, who "sinks" her hair in the middle of the film (= takes a wig) probably does not see what viewers can see from miles away: <br /> <br /> *** The attention of the spoiler * ** that hubby is having a relationship with her best partner and both trying to quit her. *** The end of the precaution of the spoiler *** <br /> And it's a spoiler which was: the name has already given off, isn't it? Bad work, bad script: waste time Oo: at the end, lives happily every time .... <br /> <br /> If you liked this film, you will love "Women of Cannibal in Avocado Jungle of Death" ....
