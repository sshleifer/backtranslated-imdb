Hey, <br /> <br /> If you're going to do a document about Leonard Cohen try to do about Leonard Cohen! This is just filled with Leonard enough to convince the viewer who will be left wondering why they are listening to other other singers (some of them worried) talking about themselves. Puleeze .... it looks like they focus on their diary entries in on top - who cares about you, what about Leonard? I think what people, like "doing something" deserves maybe someone will make a document about you. I found it especially to blame U2 members as if it would add credibility to this film - NOT. Leonard doesn't need Bono or Edge to talk about his spirituality. What would be good for the film partners to have a certain part of his spirituality through the film. Gee, what a concept! I will give Rufus Wainwright and Jarvis Cocker for his Cohen coverings - all exhibitions were produced and others could not fail. Cohen's fashion, don't say I warned you!
