... at least during its first half. If it had started with three friends in navy and concentrated on the events of a marine action, it would have been the best and powerful film. The second half of the film is worth it, especially with the order of action and the boundaries of the ship's 20th century, but it is like an inappropriate toothache to get there. Also, do not look at this film because Ginger Rogers is present. He has an important role, but it is small. <br /> <br /> The movie begins to show three New York City tourists and also in good competition for nature by Sally (Ginger Rogers), singing candy salesgirl along the avenue. World War I breaks down, the three partners are completely invisible to the struggle, but they come into any navy. One of the three and sub-sectors as a citizen (Bill Boyd like Baltimore) sends a senior officer to two others (Robert Armstrong as Dutch and James Gleason as Skeets). To make things more complicated, Sally has fallen in love with one of three, but they have no opportunity to tell him before three trips to the war. <br /> <br /> The movie is more interesting on the ship, especially because the shots around we have the ship itself, and also because chemistry among three friends is reliable. However, James Gleason at the age of 49 is seen for a long time in the tooth that swabby, especially when the sign in the register office said you should be between 17 and 35 eligible. One real obvious in the film that has made me believe that everything out of the events in the aqueducts and the underlying service is the design of clothing, or, I must say, its lack. In New York events just before WWI we have everyone wearing fashions of 1931 and everyone runs 1931 cars - no effort was taken to bring this film on time. In conclusion, if you are expecting a few events with Ginger Rogers in them and the last 45 minutes involving a suicide mission, you have seen everything here to see. Others are padding.
