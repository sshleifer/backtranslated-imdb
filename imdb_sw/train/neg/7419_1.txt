This movie was bad and angry with the viewer. The stupid script, giving us bad, endless patience. <br /> <br /> In Hollywood tradition, the US government is shown to be bad all the time. Communist-sympathetic tweets in Hollywood, many of whom are as dumb as rocky boxes, love to take the sole nutcase Eugene McCarthy and imitate him as a great movement leader. The fact is that at that time he was considered as a habit of a frog who was using legitimate concerns over Soviet Communists for political gain. Well, and the United States brought on all the evil Nazis. Like Werner VonBraun, who would have a plan of space without whom. He really liked to become America and became a good asset to the country. But, however, the anger is that the foolish, uneducated Hollywood folks who live a fantasy life, still believe that the government should run everything and give us everything we want. And yet, this is the same government that they always show as bad evil in this film.
