Dr. Seuss can be mad right now if he lived. Cat in Hiti confirms how film production can take the ethnic story and turn it into a goopless bunch of goop. We have Mike Myers as a bad cat in Hat, a big mistake! Myers confirms that he cannot act in this film. He does as a girl of showsy who has a thousand tricks to her sleeve. Children in this film are the same, somewhere in the beautiful and interesting lines. Stories are like the original and the problem of the couple and as many films according to other stories, we will never have the original story! Bringing a bad neighbor of Quin was a bad idea. She is a stupid villain who never can find anywhere in life. This movie is like a sketch of the comic from the newspaper if you think about it. Verification of the film looks tacky! Certainly there is a joke of ordinary adults like where cats cuts with its tail and censor goes away before they say a nonsense word, gently. At least Grinch was spunk, and the film was really good! This film is a piece of snot with a red color and a very serious act. Is Mike Myers even in this realistic movie? And another thing, fish. What is the stupid fish! The first time you see him, he is a real fish. Sometimes you see him, he is alive and speaks. But he looks like a piece of ball to play ball! This film is the total collapse of the target. Good joke, bad joke, bad, bad, bad, good joke! I wonder he even had a good joke as a joke trip on a trip, that was good. So please if you have the option, see Grinch instead of this mess.
