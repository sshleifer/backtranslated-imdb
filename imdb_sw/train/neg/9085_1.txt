One of the worst movies I have ever seen. Work was bad, for children and adults. Many of all the characters were not feeling, little or not enough. The lights were rough, and there was a lot of dirt on the day of the film was struck (In the area of ​​the river where they just got their boats destroyed, there are 4 shots; Sheriff and Dad evening on their boat, Jillian and Molly in the evening swimming, children The rest of the day * time should be evening * on the river, river and doctor, Beatrice, and Simonton at night but not evening go to their boat.) The best work on the movie was perhaps from sheriff, Cappy (though, there is an importation of character when the detector of pulse * Whatever it is when people die, it is a beep * shows Cappy is dead, still continues while it can still be heard, and when the nurse looks at its own checks, then shows the blow again, and then finally dies.) I think it won't be perfect, for that is an independent movie, but it can still be better. It is not worth looking, honestly, even for children. It can also look something nice, like King of Lion or Toy Story if you are going to see anything you remember.
