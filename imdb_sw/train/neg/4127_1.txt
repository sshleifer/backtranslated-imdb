Films as bad as this should be removed from all stores around the world. It is therefore full of stirring, quick, thoughtless characters and with a leading attitude and a sense of despair and a whisper sound constantly expressing no thought on every step and feeling, this film has a record of challenging film I've ever seen. As I paid money to own it, I felt it was a responsibility to see it, and how I sold it. My head hurts because of the most beautiful and useless characters, they are building a poor life. A group of children who have skills on anything, both are frigid and worse, have a bad conversation around, playing only if the main character tries to get on with a girl. Boring, so my friend was shaking and hate and I was red and embarrassed that I would lose Â£ 6. The DVD was on eBay the next day, and I didn't make a lot of money. Avoid as a blow.
