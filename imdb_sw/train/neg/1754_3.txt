Why should Mary and Rhoda's history be so powerful? The women were abandoned by the worthless daughters. And why do you say very little to show with characters? The daughters of the daughters were ignorant and unattractive. Why can't they have a daughter like their mother on TV? It means that Maria would leave Minneapolis, and Rhoda would return to NYC, but why Phyllis or Sue Ann Nivens were not visitors of the aliens? It seems only a sad way to remember these wonderful characters. It was good to see Mary and Rhoda together, but it would be better, better. In fact, it has been Mary Tyler Moore Show Reunion, Dick Van Dyke Show Reunion, hopefully Mary will do well in the future if she returns to her old Mary Richards again.
