The American Pie: The Beta House is a kind of song between species. On the one hand, it is comedy without a plot and a few jokes of joke. On the other hand, it is a porn that is tad too soft-based to actually turn any audience. Particularly Beta House is a collage of sex scenes - some embarrassment, others simply attempt to downgrade - with a few thin points beaten with effort in cooperation. The characters do not even have two-dimensional, many developments depend on the skills of Naked Mile, and the objects of the "conspiracy" are far away and you wonder why the writers even felt the need for stories. For all rights, I did not enter this film without expectation. I loved the first movies of the American Pie, and I thought the Band Camp and Naked Mile were the completion tax. I thought Naked Mile was about to be released on the movie, and so when I saw that some of the same characters were returning to Beta House, I was glad to see this unit. I knew that there would be many incidents of abuse and sexual abuse in many forms. And I was well, because in the past, these events were supported by the story and it was well connected to the plot. In Beta House, however, it is almost like the authors have forgotten why formula in other AP movies. They used a lot of energy to work through the fraud they forgot to write stories. <br /> <br /> This movie is desperate and even deserves to rent one dollar. The joke is lazy, the story is not there, and the porno aspect is very bad if you really care about seeing.
