Nintendo !!! YOU #% $ @ ERS !!! How can you do that for me? I can't believe ... this film is much worse than the first. I went to see this at the club with my brother because my mother forced me to write together .... oh God ... and I started where? The plan was planned. Sound takes SUCKED. Animation connected. The end has been raised. If you liked this film, YOU WANT TO TO. And for Futuramafan1987, who said this is the greatest film, you are TRAINING, EDUCATION AND SIMPLE. This is not a movie for anyone but ten-year-old boys and children Players think Pikachu is God. I still have been up to this day to think about the terrible turd of the movie .... and then there was a Adventure of Pikachu ... neither did they get me to start on this terrible mess of films. It is, in fact, one of the best experiences of my entire life. Don't go look at this at any cost. Under / below: Go out, get any copy of this movie that you can, and explore it. Burn all, and then continue to rent the movie GOOD, as Visitors ... or Bowling For Columbine ... or even return later!
