A young American woman visits her Ukrainian roots and tries to a witch doctor who has got her own. It seems exciting but after you start attracting, I'm lost and I spend a lot of time asking for where to go. The movie seems to be spinning in two ways - Can we look at the suffering of an Irish-American woman to combat her alcohol problem or we look directly off the flick fear about the evil witch that returns from behind? The director can not appear to decide. Both do not appear to be gel and finally find anywhere. This can be very good and the story seemed to the end. This was exciting and frightening.
