It felt like I watched this film a thousand times before. It was quite predictable. At all times the story tried to find something that was lost, every time I waited for something interesting to see, I saw nothing but what I expected. As a "bakery factory opened another facility, because it didn't have enough food". In two words: a flat story, which has been a hobby, an evil act, a horrible harm ... Only the Russian brothers of Kibubu, Vlad, was very young when punishing bad people. The muscles of the muscles were so wonderful, that they made me laugh for a while. I wonder why I waste my time blowing spit on the sham-movie ... It will not be worse (because it is impossible): D
