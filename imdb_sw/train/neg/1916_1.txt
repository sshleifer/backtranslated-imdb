This film is quite garbage. Other non-brave professionals comfort themselves by doing all that is best to demand the quality of the aristocrat on the working class. No more than a piece of self-catharsis. It's interesting. If this type of film is installed in the United States, it will make it a great joke. And just because it comes from 'the other side', it emerges as a hub, an extraordinary hub for a certain western brain and / or brain-washing (some George W. perhaps :). It is usually the sequelae of the cold war, the kind of joke however. I would like to say, like this - as shown in this film - that's what the Soviet scholars had thought about all those years, then maybe they deserve all the rumors that they have gone. But no! because like many others, I have read and checked the real moments provided by modern Soviet scholars. For example, the right thing for the dog, "White white Bim Black" - the book of Gavriil Troyepolsky and the movie of Stanislav Rostotsky - is a real masterpiece. Real life, real tragedy, real sorrow, real pride and respect, one of the best of the Soviet era.
