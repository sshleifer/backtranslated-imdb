Remove all discrimination and unhealthy misconceptions about the emerging Mormons, and you will see that they have had an excuse for films. Finally the success of Kurt Hale has changed (thank you goodness) and hope that it will be long before you see any of its features in the movie. The movie cinema was normal (I think they used a camcorder for some basketball scenes). The plan was very unlikely. In fact you didn't understand why anyone did anything. It was as if I had a sand in my eyes, and a 300 kg woman was sitting on my face, it was painful. The only reason I did not give this movie a negative rating is because the standard will not affect me.
