After reading the book, I liked the story. Watching the movie that I had been disappointed that many changes were made. It is understandable that books and movies are different but it was two different stories, the names and stories of the book remained. Read the book and you will have a better understanding of the film. The book gives you the best development of characters. These characters are very interesting and caring. The sites were true according to the details of the book. Other characters are not included. Television has many books and many microwaved stories, this is a perfect example of it. Importing from the author does not guarantee a good movie but it can help sometimes.
