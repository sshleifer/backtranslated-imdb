This modern has a beautiful brunette named Danielle Petty. He has green eyes, and is in the first events and the last location. He is the only thing about this movie that should not be. They may not be later as a film actor, because this type of film is a kind of tragedy that kills work. <br /> <br /> The movie itself has nothing to recommend. It is not a bad film, or a good fake writing, or far from it done well. There is no experience in the production. It's like a bad film of students. The horrible stories of the story did not make you sick, it is the fact that it is not done well that makes you sick. I would like to give you this film of ZERO star if I could.
