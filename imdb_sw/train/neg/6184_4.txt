A non-minded video about a beautiful but unsuspecting couple who decide to live their dreams and take people to dive tours. These close partners make an improper choice of customers and frustration with other people who want to restore the things we see fall on the sea floor during the opening opening chain. A direct look at a video video can be better if it is not very interested to look good. The exhibition can be used by the plot is not bad, or it will have the director and producers not going to a conspiracy in ensuring that we see lots of people in swimming suits (or why I think the reason for the "not" was a few short-sighted lights). The film does not produce any tension nor hike on the movie's rate of TV forget. If you suffer from seeing this you will not remove your eyes out of the eye candy but we really need to stop the producers making films that are the reasons for having paid holidays.
