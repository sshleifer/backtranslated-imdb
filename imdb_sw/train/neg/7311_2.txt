Like I heard a little about this film, so it was on the television stations, I wanted to look at it, with a terrible feeling. I think I can do "huh"? for everyone who looked at it. I decided to go on with my life, but at the party with my closest friends, we saw that some of us had already seen we could laugh our way that way, we all declare "this is a sad thing I've ever seen ". It was not terrible; Disease Roth (who I think is a small hack); The characters change in all the films, the "Cube". Even if your "mice" in the form of a fortress - who will turn on who, etc., was the average fear. <br /> <br /> A few points: 1.) What was that child? I'm not even talking about him being a weird and hurt people. I am talking about all the "slow motion of karate", what was it? 2.) Well I know the character of Rider loved Jordan Ladd, but as a young woman, I was surprised that he went ahead and hated him in his sleep. Uh, that's illegal. <br /> <br /> 3. Roth was in the movie only Roth can be in the movie. Talk about sure without writing! 4.) What was the deputy? 5.) So was he just once pulled by a dog? And there was little blood? Just a scrap of his jeans? Otherwise we were hitting our horses off, and I would like to laugh during the horror movies (Dead Dead 2, Evil), but I don't know if we should be laughing here ...
