Ram Gopal Verma has proved to be a good and capable director. He made mercy / reworking of the Godfather and Sarkar, and very successful. Ditto for Lolita which made as Nishaabd. <br /> <br /> Sholay has been a movie that constantly says it has raised more. Unfortunately, he has been able to make a despair and ultimately provoking. Acting started from honorable to very good, with Amitabh Bachchan as a strong shock like Babban hosting. These songs were bad and forgot. Mehbooba Mehbooba song came as a second-class music video. The worst part was to stimulate, and talk - forgotten. <br /> <br /> Watching movies in the playground, I found myself waiting for an entry, and then at the end. Other viewers were wise to wait, and seemed to stop at all of the film. Finally, one of the worst movies made by Ram Gopal Verma.
