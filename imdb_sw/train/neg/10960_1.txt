Ouch! They are no more than this terrible change of the beloved novel of C. S. Lewis. Although these changes are true for novels, acting is very bad and a set of special effects are on the same level as the school game. I have read that the budget of this miniseries was the largest of which the BBC has received at the time, but they would certainly be able to beat together over $ 2 which looks like this was done. The worst effects of all are Mr. Beaver. I know the effects of computers were not at the required level or even costly at the time, but the person of the clothing store in the look suit was bad. Better to have just cut the character from the film than to do it for the role! Avoid this at all costs.
