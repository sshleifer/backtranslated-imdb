The movie seems disjointed and in general, badly written. Screenplay goes along as 10 different people wrote, and none of them contacted. Apparently they want to take a page from the Miracle on a 34 original original (but original) film, but it has been done in a very bad way that movies fall. This film is just for young people, and even they will see the fact that anyone writing does not know anything about baseball. Like: <br /> <br /> ?? When angels have died in the last place, the owner does not seem to care, and is not worried about the fact that his manager has entered into a fight with his pitcher? IN MOUND? or that he chose to play for the team for the live TV player. However, when the team is one game to win the Department, it gets a chapter on the story (caused by the age of 6) that the manager gets help from a child who claims to see a real angel. What seems to be worse? Failure of violence without the control manager whose team has lost 15 series? Or a winner coach around with playoffs which are acting a little eccentric and are helping kids to promote? The owner's reaction does not know. And she has moved to change her mind with Maggie and 'direct out of the speech' speech during the news conference. <br /> <br /> ?? Angels are required to play for the Department in the final weekend of the weekend against White Sox, however at the end of the game the advertiser says that the Angels 'won pennant.' Pennant has not been activated until a person won the LEAGUE championship, not the head of the regular seasonal division. Whitt Bass, a goofball pitcher is a starting pitcher and is a successful game that breaks the Angels losing a line? then is the starting pitcher? Saturday. <br /> <br /> Mel Clark (Tony Danza) said in the nine inning of the pit throwing 156, in the bottom of the ballgame. Usually in low-scoring games, the calculation of the pitch is smaller than this, usually around 80-90 buttons. <br /> <br /> ?? "AL" angel says at the end "Championship should win alone", although he and his angels have been fixing and fixing games in the second half of the season. I would like to continue, for there are other MANY examples where the story is not written. <br /> <br /> For small children (less than 10), this film can be fun. It's very bad ?? done this right can be normal. It has been done badly like this and it is an excuse to forget which will live forever as UHF / cable Saturday morning washout.
