Confession having fantasies on Brad Pitt is entering a pretty tough for sex to do. But what can I tell you? Maybe it's an extra extra thing that everyone talks about and makes star stars. It passes the cross. It connects you to an unknown and secular location. Brando was successful, Montgomery Clift, Gary Cooper, James Dean of course and in recent times, Tom Cruise, Jude Law, Johnny Depp, Ewan McGregor and Billy Crudup. Women liked Garbo, Dietrich, Katharine and Audrey Hepburn, Grace Kelly, Marilyn Monroe, Julie Christie, Charlotte Rampling, Meryl Streep, Vanessa Redgrave, Julia Roberts and recently Natalie Portman. But Brad Pitt has, automatically, reopened that concept. He is the only reason to go out, get a car, get parking, buy tickets, popcorn and get into the theater to see "Troy" If you liked epics in "Jupiter's Darling" style you can enjoy this. But if you don't, go straight, we want to put Brad Pitt in business.
