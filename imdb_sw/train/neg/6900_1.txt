I sat just in the sports field as a hell, I wanted to leave half through the movie. The program is simple 4 Samoan boys have broken the marriage. So they should bring the date to enter the wedding. Yawn. Something that moved it far was so-called joke ... They were very unfunny, clich√©d and thrown into your face, so that you could get the most common film. Acting was less than average and I felt that this film continued only with anything but an unfunny joke and predictable plot. <br /> For all, one of the worst movies I have seen in 2006, unfunny, bad acting, just bad. Thank you my friend my friend shouted. Avoid it.
