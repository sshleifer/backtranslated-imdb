Failure. The movie was not very good. It is astonishing that 5-year-old children cannot even drown. I mean, of course, some parts were interesting, but most of them are not. Lindsey Lohan is a good actor (and bad singer,) and should work on the best movies. The movie should be looked like a Disney Channel's original movie, that's free. The only thing that happened about this movie was music. There is no sound like rock record to brighten your day. These songs are very good. Especially Alyson and Amanda Walking On Sunshine and Caleigh Peter, Boy Boy song, Fun Fun Fun. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10. If I gave ten, 9 of that would be music and 1 would be a film. It's not worth your money, but the sound of the voice is.
