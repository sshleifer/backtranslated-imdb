This is one of the worst films made. Trite. Expected. Flat. The only thing that tested one point was the best photos of Barcelona. I think they will use this film in Guantanamo or another secret CIA / NSA prison to torture the suspects. Too often bad films have features of redemption, this has nothing. If I was in it or I worked, I would change my name. Really turd. It is difficult to write more than this, but I feel the world's viewers need a head over this. On the other hand it will make a great gift to people who can't stand up. You can send them to politicians who do not like, by law, former wives, hate teachers, former employees, Dick Cheney, W., and others.
