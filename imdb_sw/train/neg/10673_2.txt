This movie was like the worst indie and the talent of A-list. The plan was desolate, all the way to the end. It reminds me of something that was given out of the home video market in the 1980s. I think the worst thing is the underwater area held off the compound. The underwater light was not going out, and whenever someone we had to take care of was around to escape, this air of the tank would have been seen. I would like to avoid this, unless nothing else on the shelf. Good day.
