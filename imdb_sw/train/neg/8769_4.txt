This was a movie that I hoped I could recommend to my American friends. But after 4 attempts to watch the film to finish, I knew I could not even look at a big thing to install. You almost believe the real war did not last long. Others will try to question my patriotism by criticizing the movie like this. But flat out, you can't go from looking to Restore Private Ryan in the LOC. Forget about the budget variations of the film or the audience - those who do not prevent the director from making an intelligent film. The length of the film is not bad and the fact that it is repeated - they continue to attack one hill but it gives different names. I thought the LOC was a horrible scene - this hill seemed like my fields. Characteristics of character development (keys to soilders, looking back to their last time, before being deployed) should be in all movies and not just closed in one long memory. To date, I have never looked at the last. But there was a better film (not much) called Border.
