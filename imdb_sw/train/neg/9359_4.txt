This film is possible to be Pro-Muslimization. Why do I write that? The main character has a Muslim father and a Christian mother. He lives his first 20 years in the Christian village. At the end of the film he appears to be a Muslim because of his head covering, for he has taken his clothes, and his total clothing. She has a six-year-old child, who wears a head-wear straight and therefore maybe a Muslim, although mother is a Christian. The main character chooses, apparently, to be a Muslim and his child becomes a Muslim. No one of the other male characters, who are Christians, seems to reproduce a child. There are more Muslims in the world of this movie its end, so it seems.
