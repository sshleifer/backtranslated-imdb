In summary of this film: Without a real plot, this movie has 80 minutes of characters who said drinking or making bad jokes. The music is very bad, humor is not funny and all female female characters or total consumers. It seems to me, that the movie is written by a 14-year-old boy, who thinks that the drink is cool, women are arranged to please men and all who oppose such views are geeks. Also, the movie is not associated with the original movies of America Pie, except a few names by Mr. Levenstein who are a small character in this. The only good thing about this film is the very best girls. Do not look at this film and do not show it with 5.4 rating, because it appears to be standing and not worth anything more than 2.
