I bought this film because this was Shah rukh khans Debut. And I also liked to see how he would. nath was good at its place. Amrish and Mohnish also did their part too. Stories are bad. It tells us about Ravi the famous pop singer. One of them is Kaajal.Ravi and Kaajal love and marry. Ravi is killed by his cousin. They are going to Bombay. He comes to Raja.She loves him and he gets married.Ravi return.The story is predictable. Music attracts and other beautiful songs.The movies seem non-existent in t he is the first half but it seems unimportant. check out this only for executives and music Rating-4/10
