It is not often that we in the UK have a film made on city life in the view of the Afro Caribbean society, the last example that I can remember is Babylon the Great back in 1980. So I had great expectations when I heard about Bullet Boy , the film found as the British edition of La Haine! Well La Haine is not! I agree that the use of the dialogue and environment gives this film a legitimacy that has been lost in other UK's delayed films, but my concern is that this film is predictable. The film deals with the growing problem of black color on black violence that is all so common in London, but I am worried that the filmmakers are now using a form of forming against the same characters that are the same and destroy. Saul Dibb had a great opportunity to make a film that would be fun and encouraging to all of us, but sadly lost and created a film that just reinforces the idea that a young boy in London just future is violence and catastrophe.
