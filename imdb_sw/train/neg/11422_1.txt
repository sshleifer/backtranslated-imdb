I saw this in the playground when it happened, and just yesterday I saw it again on the cable. This I was able to identify with the feeling of how to resist this film. A large group of characters are self-narcisstic toys. Then, it reinforces any unfair discrimination on the 20-year relationship, even if you hold a celebration of people "they find themselves". Good young people are finished, young jerky boys do well, brave boys are doing better. All girls are pushovers of the boy. Only one character ("Wendy") seems to do anything that is most appropriate for the community, and provides for its long-term boyfriend in a night-long nightly struggle, in an effective area that we should consider is romantic. What this is actually the concept of Hollywood's youth of America: allowed, closed, uncomfortable, worried.
