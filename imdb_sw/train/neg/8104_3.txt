It is a cheap shot I know, but this movie is a good example of how the compilation of 'deep' signals (political trouble, love / desire) can be merged accurately with much acceptance (see also the beauty of America). kaufman movies and free sex shows from the interaction of pain talks (in one area I have calculated three 'European' permits that are affected by administrators) and state exhibitions can run amok, but still involve them in reflection on the unity of the scenario offered. . and in its long hours three hours it takes almost entirely to look at the franz, a four-piece piece in the triangle of love that is in the heart of the plot, and in this way provides a medium-sized way of expressing the sense of feelings and relationships. The power that finds in love matters. it also fails to enter the time of the star screen, used in the novel to show some political points of the screens made in the novel. as well as the sound of the high sound, these obstacles make three hours of film without undue attention to the sound but light inside the content.
