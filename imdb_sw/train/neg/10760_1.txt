This "movie" is the end of everything wrong about modern films. slow motion, unintentional jump / jump / jump, unwanted characters, unnecessary talkâ€¦ basically it is necessary. (is it a word? well, founded by me, Robot.) <br /> <br /> What happened naturally? (ie, car garage, skin medication) The only tool that shows a mix of future and real work is a turn-around card to a coffee shop. What happened to show respect for women? (ie the behavior of smith has nothing but contempt for the doctor for the best part of the film, and still "wants him." WHAT TO GIVE IN WHERE I WILL tell you, good and not compliment or common ground you know? Smith did nothing but sat next to feel sympathetic, complaining to other people, and when they said something that motivated the mind was far away. this is the worst way to get the story from the b-c-d-etc point ... was the same once, but not several times in a row. (speaking several times in a row, what is "I am happy and I have not heard of it? Twice in one place?" <br /> <br /> What happened to a small part in the movie has a certain meaning and not just a tool to promote rescue scenes Shia LaBeouf (child) is in the cinema for the total of TWO SCENES, we know that A-she despises women, and B-she knows Smith ....... so the COURSE we should take care of him and if he comes to harm, <br / > <br /> What happened to the hero? Let's remember that there are people, women and children everywhere beaten by robots and by subscribing to save only a man with my view that I know him. when a doctor can reach the same distance in terms of seconds on feet. <br /> <br /> is not available to me, I'm for a concert. But I am also for the loss of reality and meaning. > I say I did not laugh at them so hard on the film in the mref time u. so thanks Alex. <br /> <br /> I pray for the swing of a social pendulum behind a simple, simple and simple story everything in the film ...... but the simplest approach. <br /> <br /> Big Budget Movies: "you should die"
