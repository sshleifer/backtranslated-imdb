How Irish critics say about this film is more than me. It has been dealt with by the Irish band of ordinary actors listed out for every Irish movie. Wrong script, and quirks forced character (brown sauce). Show all the bad things about Dublin. The character of 'ah, is a dump but certainly not very similar'. Much of the advertising for the American audience (boss's supermarket and his forced catchphrase). And the nail in the coffin was characteristic of Colm Meaney. A good actor was compelled to play this part that could have been written at five years of age. Good items. The best thing about this film is Farrell, and it's bad when you say it. In fact, at least he did not put his awesome emphasis on the US. International viewers will warn: stay at home and watch the Prevention and Prevention. You will have a good time. Transfer is a walk-out
