I am not writing a review but I can't understand why this is so widely calculated and I wanted to give warning to fear lovers because I could only assume that all those who measured the highest rate were given by the average TV styles. <br /> I just watched the first two events but the two were so cliché, it wasn't even more funny. These old stories that you have seen / read several times already - the evil things that live, the evil things from other dimensions ... and not just these stories are not creative, they are also evil versions of these clichés. I would like to prefer a.m. "chucky" and "silent hill" on these two events at any time. and do not ask about the consequences of seeing ... those in the first place are the same but the second ... bad. it seems like a film student project did not go wrong. blood ... or gore ... erm ... nothing is worth mentioning. It may be interesting for a ten-year-old child who has probably not seen / read many of the shocking stories yet (although I would prefer to "over belief" - now that's what I call the TV show). but for the adult fan of this fear is free. I just gave 3 points because there are really some good movies (especially in the second part) and some good acting.
