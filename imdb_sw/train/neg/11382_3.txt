Anyone knows that Tommy has only 3 face face. The angry eyes look at all the enemy. 2. Closed hands, mouth agape and fearful eyes. 3. Tommy Turnbull is interesting. I say that I hate this show, I don't look but it's like the Lyoko Code, we've looked at one, it must say that this show is a racist borderline, uninteresting and useless. <br /> <br /> Every part ends with a winning robotboy, except for one exception when robotboy essentially allow this geeky freakezoid to fly off the jetpack. <br /> <br> Jokes are very good too, I think it's a lot of people saying the word "suck" or farting, I think the showers of the show are also shocking. <br /> <br /> What! hides bowling ball under his hatred, and another uses a chain, for the god, what kind of school is going. Not to mention her big brother, who is a barrier of mind and has no other qualifications. All I see I crash megas XLR and Promotion. If you could say three of the hats, jamie and Kiva, with Robotboy be the same as Megas where he hits everyone regardless of the odds and he is free spirited despite being a robot. <br /> <br /> There's just no appeal on this show, I'm surprised that it still runs.
