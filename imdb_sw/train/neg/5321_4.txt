One of the unwanted music comedy that tries to marry the rock rock 'n' roll and the feeling of mid-urban sitcom. The result is a mish-mash magazine that is not worth any of the listeners who went to music, but at least to keep their parents lost. <br /> <br /> Quick view in re-posting of video release should give some idea of ​​content. Tom Ewell is an alcoholic agent, with a very limited ability to approach him in the morning, I am at home! The conflict says as "Very interesting in the" Itch 7 of the Year ". It looks almost like excuse. What other film could be self-reliant on the fact that the leading player was good at something else? It reads as "Surprised by the" Itch 7 of the Year "... but he is garbage in this". <br /> <br /> Mansfield, a beautiful girl with about 50 inches, is unfortunate Monroe with all the ability to act and the comic time of rotten haddock. Its timber delivery with the OTT of Ewell twice takes to make the cooperation of the comedi from hell. For his part, the sale gives us: "[Jayne Mansfield] whose most obvious talents are the reason for laughing on many films!" As you can see, the movie sold on the idea that leads to tuberculosis is not very modern. Many of this "humor" are men who fall on their own, their glasses erupting on Mansfield's website, etc.. Only the Freudian dream of reviving the bottle of milk causes doubt on the "U" certificate. The music side, the adenine most of the players are selected. Should you see Eddie Fontaine giving: "I love your eyes, I love your lips, they are better than potato tablets" in a song called "Cool It, Baby"? Just a few of Richard's decline from MOR, although he has to sing some of his dad's songs in a four-minute sequence. And how do all works sing without a single microphone? The satires attempt in the industry is wide and child as their pregnancy. <br /> <br /> In fact, the picture was very high, with special effects (including spirit-like Julie London) and the deluxe color (That now looks flat and fake.In fact, with its reds which looks and tones-looking meat meat, resembles a colored movie). Trends, however, are not good, and the quality of sound is also poor. <br /> <br /> Maybe it comes to them to be old. While men are still smoking, children who punish the children are talking about adults and only black servants had to cook and play. (All that happens here). Some Others Love Fire, African King, Ben Hur and many, many more stand as models of the film from the time that can still be found today, so the "good time" argument does not stand true. In her heart the girl can not help is a stupid project with an incompetent sensitization. 4/10. <br /> <br />
