Stephen J. Cannell apparently decided a few years ago that he could expand its scope and be afraid. As a result, "Dead On Ground", is a large piece of junk. Now, I would see her name in conjunction with this special film I would like to put it but no, I didn't have my glasses and so I was lost, damn, I need to bring those with me when video shopping. The first question would be, who was the audience of this purpose? It is almost like a "horrible" movie of children, but again there are children without many children and some of the words and evil that have been hit here and there. The main characters are so good that you want to see someone, anyone, follow them with some kind of field equipment. It seems that the boy opens the bed and breakfast that has taken the past, the witch of the child who has collected the teeth of children lived there. Probably something of the real estate agent did not mention mention. Of course now in the modern day there are little spirit girls around to warn the little girl to live who now lives there that something bad will happen. It takes, and there are also two Bubbas that were stuck in the property when the new owner took it so they could take revenge. This all has a feel of junk made for a cable that is for children in Halloween except, of course, things that are not suitable for young children, so not just this is normal, confused, too. Big boo and hiss for Anchor Bay to keep this out too, based on their regular track record and good releases are below low. UK receives Phantasm Box Set, we find "Fairy Too". It is impossible to be the same. 1 out of 10, litter completely.
