That was, so far, the worst movies I have seen all my life, and I have seen some of the worst movies. I saw this movie in my local video store, and the cover looked like it could be a good movie of fear. I did not know that the cover would be a good part of the movie. Where to start? The description of the film was scattered and disrupted. At one time, there is only one minute of a person who is not talking, just a car travels on the ranch for the usual sunny day. Nothing happened, they just chased him away. The whole movie is boring, and the terrible, unreliable conversation and basically no plot to talk. If you rent this movie, watch with other friends and can make a good comedy. Otherwise, when you see this film, use it.
