In the latest biography of Alec Guinness I couldn't find much on Paris and Love. I am sure Guinness made the film to get free travel to Paris from outside. Film has no other reason to exist. <br /> <br /> Paris is undoubtedly going well with the amazing opening of Guinness and his son driving down the Elysee Champs and Arc De Triomphe back. Unfortunately it goes down from there. It is not just chemistry at all between Guinness and a little girl who has a short fling with Paris. According to the latest biography of Guinness and Piers Paul Read, Guinness was not pleased with the girl, and found her a non-profit character. Why Odile Vernois thought of his co-star, no record available. They have many chemicals like two cats neutered. <br /> <br /> Guinness has a good time in a film that was directly from one of his Ealing drama while climbing a tree trying to get badminton's shuttlecock. But I did not wait for him through the film. At least Alec got a trip to Paris outside the deal.
