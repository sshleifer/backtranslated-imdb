I was lucky to look at this garbage on Sky Cinema Max in the cold winter night. It's not a big fan of awesome movies, because most of them are just rubbish. This is even worse: it is one of the most invisible pieces throughout my life. Movie terrible? Yes, there are bad things in this: acting, script with special effects - Gosh, I have rejected this interesting attempt to make a flick for 90 minutes. for manufacturers. <br /> <br /> Vote: 2 out of 10 - didn't have one vote because it made me laugh all the time ;-)
