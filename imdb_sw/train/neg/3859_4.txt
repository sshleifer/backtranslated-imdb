Jason Lee is doing a great job of bringing happiness to a sense of purpose, but the movie fails to connect. <br /> <br /> Maybe because the character of Julia Stiles seems to be as bad as connecting to sexy soon becoming a son-in-law. It is probably because she and the characters of Selma Blair should have been beaten differently. (Selma Blair looks more than Julia would be). Either way this film is one of the Hollywood distortions of the real world of the world (that being getting caught by your pants out in the bachelor party is not bending your cousin), which when having a promise fails to deliver. There are some laughs to be sure and cast (even if the miscast) do the best for small devices that don't reduce. So instead of getting the comfort of the successful farming (ie the House of Animals or Pie's America) we are left with the middle part of the humor and part of ignorance (ala Meatballs 2 or something).
