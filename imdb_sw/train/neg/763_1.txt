I love Columbo and I have seen all the pieces well but surely this is very bad. An unnecessary, useless, insignificant, indiscriminate group that loses all of the viewers and the talented workmen of Peter Falk. 'The plot', as it is, appears only to be made as the film goes along with even a little bit of ingredients for the formula that made a show as a priority to begin with. One part of the charges I received most (or could be angry) was the behavior of Peter Falk brought to visitors at the wedding as 'Lt' Columbo. If producers insist on putting the first name of Columbo's mystery, why couldn't they stop this line as it seems to be worried? As I said, this is the holes and all true Columbo fans will do well to avoid as a blow.
