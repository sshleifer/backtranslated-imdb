This DVD appears to be directed to someone who will set and play an endless loop. It has been developed as a series of Grand Canyon music videos placed on various Tangerine Dream music. Unfortunately, the TD music is limited, and the transfer of DVD is rather attractive and decreasing. Very expensive DVD for what it is.
