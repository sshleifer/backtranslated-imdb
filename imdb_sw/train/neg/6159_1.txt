Why everyone who has seen this movie feels that it is their responsibility to tell us if they do not have fencers? This action is not suitable for any motion being done against this full dog. I think the movies are falling into two categories; well-made movies of humanity and race, and 'Sword'. This video really did not determine what it wanted to be, a touch game to try to be better for you in life, impeachment charges or flick of military art. Finally it did not make any of those convincing or quite enough to make me give one of the care of any of it. <br /> <br /> For a record I am also a fence teacher (and now I am off as bad as others). But placing a bad fence on the film does not make it wrong directly. I mean looking at Star Wars (Episodes 4-6, good movies, bad fence). I liked those movies. But when you put bad games in a bad movie for some reason people think that only the purists who think it is a bad attempt. <br /> <br /> Do not go away with any views on the sub-issue of the fence. This is just a bad movie. Finally, this film has nothing to do with a fence partner or a buff of film or just anyone who has a blow with three brain cells. When I see the film and I have to think, 'Man, I want I would be looking at the Powerful Docks. 'I know it is time to move the argument with the sports manager to get my money and see if there is anyone in the lobby which somehow give me two hours of my life back.
