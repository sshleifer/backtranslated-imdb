This is a small amount of budget, made for TV, a kind of film planned to extend beyond the previous success. I am a fan of b movies, and this can be good if you have not identified the name "Cube" so, because as it was, the director and the original conspiracy were better, and this movie just about my ruined taste for the entire series. The characters are angry with the clich√©d, there are problems and persistent, and several more enough productions. This story is not worth the opportunity to develop because of unnecessary discussions and facing it. They more or less use similar scores and more on the film, and for the first time it was very good, this just returns as desperate. <br /> <br /> If this was a stand-alone b-movie, I'd like to give it about four. The "1" rating I gave was a good explanation of how it was completely harmed in both harm and mind as compared to the first.
