... which is not a ringing ring. In general, "DinoCroc" was the best movie. Of course, in the movie Matt Borlenghi played a full package which used the entire movie crying on his younger brother killed by DinoCroc. But the special effects in "DinoCroc" were excellent, the plot lines were excellent, and acting was better. Here are the problems with the "Surf of blood" - 1) The killer crocodile looks like a child with a removed jaw. 2) The plot is ignorance. Matt Borlenghi & Co loses a ship on an abandoned island, where they face a rabid group of Filipino locals who try to engage with women in the group. Which was the perfect waste of 15 minutes of film. And 3) there is not enough time to croc. There are several features of the "Surf of Blood Redemption" - the artists are very attractive with Matt Borlenghi given by croc towards the end of the movie. But if you are in your bed and just have enough time to watch one of Matt Borlenghi's movie / crocodile, skip this and fire up "DinoCroc" instead.
