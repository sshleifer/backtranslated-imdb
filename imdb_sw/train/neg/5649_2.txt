I don't think this is too bad on the show under the correct conditions. I endured the first season. Unfortunately, this is a show about lawyers who are not actually lawyers. God allowed anyone to go to law school according to these exhibitions, which I heard was a case when I looked at a particular interview. It just makes me a little gag. <br /> <br /> That aside, Spader and Shatner, who are supposed to be the stars of show, are much more offensive. Although this may be a compliment in certain situations, certainly not here. They constantly bother women on the show are funny at first. But since that is exactly what they do all the time, I have found that this is as deep as the show will go. Trying to insert the short, wonderful, and even tears in the middle of this real show show not to cover the loss of preference for I've been trying to enjoy the show. Alan Shore and the bright "public service broadcast" where it offers his comments is not recommended. Denny Crane is only annoying. I was embarrassed for him and for the authors of the concert for a crane wearing a colonial dress. I have two stars because there was a time when I thought the show to deal with modern issues was done carefully. I think the authors of the show knew that gender-based violence was shown by Denny and Alan when you were even tolerating even those who were more welcome from the beginning. The fact is, I don't care if the treatment of sexual violence in the show has been done well, but I just felt that the author had criticized me for impersonating sex every day in the hope that my libido would prevent me from coming back for more. I'm not a boy anymore, and I think this show promises if his goal did not reach the lowest denominator to get ratings. In fact, I write this after I realized it was not better than this. It is embarrassing because it is one of the things that I like to love.
