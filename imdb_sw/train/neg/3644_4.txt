This film is very poor. Acting is bad and complete. Additionally, by filing the film as a docudrama should not make it possible to be reliable, you can not from them easily Mr Dir. Do not let my opinion be lost yet, if I would like to consider watching this film, because it describes psychology or non-psychology behind the criminals. However, the peak of the film is quite garbage! No other way to put it! It's clean and fails to capture any atmosphere of the sky! Something that does not have any sense of despair, fear, fear or fear that someone will have experience in such a terrible situation. No. Your replacement is leaving you with a jaw to stop "Is that?!" lose in your language, and in no way are you broken by these boys' actions. Instead you just feel a shame for another film that started with a possibility, but it completed a flat fall on his face in a very important point.
