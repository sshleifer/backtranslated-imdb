*** Possible Spoilers *** <br /> When I saw this today I was hoping how it would be like, not up, but not down. This was not as I expected even though, it seems to me if the creators of the film could not create their own ideas of what kind of film to do. <br /> <br /> At the start of the film is somewhat strange and kinda exciting, but soon it will change to some stupid scenes - very clear scenes ... When I was looking more I almost slept several times. <br /> <br /> Last is the most ridiculous of all though, almost splatter / comedy ... I don't say you don't have beautiful scenes just that the film never becomes "whole". <br /> <br /> 4/10 Movie-Man
