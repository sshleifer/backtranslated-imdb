Wow. I have seen the worst movies in my time, but this takes a real cake. It is the worst movie that I have seen in the last decade - no excuse. As a veteran of the US Army Forces in Afghanistan, I have found it impossible to finish watching this fraudulent film, not because it brought memory - away from - but because there was no "test" test to be found anywhere in the film. Not even a little bit beaten. It seemed as if it was written by a 8-year-old child who got all his ideas of war (and military behavior) directly on comic books. The film was made in Honduras, which would have been a clue, but even that could not fully explain the values ​​of this good piece of rubbish. poor technical errors, but it will take almost forever. From the old patches of the unit that have not been seen or worn since WWII, and characteristic characteristics of the character, such as "ColCollins" (worn by character "Collins Collages"), which actually written using a picture of the interference mirror, "N" of the Russian alphabet (not the US alphabet) the list goes on. Secrets, materials, plot, and especially the character of the characters themselves - each area was full of ignorance, inaccuracy and clichés without understanding. It is not the story itself or the characters are unreliable or reliable. They were all infants, at an extreme time. That was a film that was meant to reject the boys carefully before publishing, and I am a little doubt even they will find this amazing film. In short, this film does not always get the redemption features at all. It's a dirt of time. I would like to advise anyone to read this to pass this garbage; it's not worth losing one time of your time to.
