that's wonderful! Fidani (who was also spiritual) was one of the cheapest director of the world. This movie stole the original name of "Buck you sucker" of Leone! but tell us the beautiful story of the Pinkerton agent against the killer "Testa di Ferro" (Gordon Mitchell, player of potential). Both are poor and mad in this pelicula that took place on the theme of Lazio lovers. Stories are bad and things at the same time. Fidel was not able to ingenuos at the same time. In the same story occurred some kind of spiritual wrong things (like a discussion in the house of a sheriff and the appearance of a democracy of Butch Cassidy!?!?? Yes, really Butch Cassidy, who is shown as idiot). Terribles night americaine, incredible behavior, legitimate conspiracy, ineffective and many appearance and one of the most awarded player in Italian television stories, Renzo Arbore. Ah, of course: Klaus Kinski. Yes it is great and terrible, but I'm sure it was in it for just money to play with iron horses) 2 out of 10 but ... Don't do that!
