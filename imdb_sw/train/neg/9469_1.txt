Audrey, I know you enjoy the memory of your husband Ted but PLEASE do his right to inheritance and listen to his wishes. Dr Seuss refused the license of his characters during his life for a very good reason. We ask you to stop inserting into his stories, photos, fantasas and characters. They get the moral decline and authority that contain the Hollywood and Broadway. Tomorrow's children will be included in these historical and mysterious interpretations that will ever despise the warmth of love and guilt of his books. It is really your property to do and what you want. I just want to hear the advice of others for a short time. Except of Dr Seuss. Thank you.
