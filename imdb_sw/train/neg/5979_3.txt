Pokemon 3 is a little more than three or four of the series of television series, connected together without regular ads. The story is common to Pokemon (war, fighting, and resolution where all are happy at the end), and nothing natural or unusual in animation. Some holes in the plot are filled (on closed loans!) Without explanation, and everything is very sweet. <br /> <br /> Why do I see on the big screen? The only reason is to be part of your child's world. My two sons enjoy Pokemon, and by showing interest in what they like, we're close. Seeing the film in the playground is still different from watching it on the tube, and my children are enjoying the full film experience. I gave the movie 4, mainly from my children's perspective. <br /> <br />
