I can't believe I've been using it for one and a half hours to watch the weak film. If only one film is missing, this is the one. Robert is a young man whose father died recently so he begins to be executed by other anti-social youth and drug abuse. All of these make more violence and more ultimately the same understanding explodes ... \ t If the director considers what I saw in the last two minutes as a great joy, I must say it is not close. <br /> <br /> Use of movies is not available. Often I had no views of the face from the participants and I did not feel the body language was enough to make the impact. Perhaps the workers were so tired that they made the camera there to put everything into the environment. Everyone is happy except the audience. <br /> <br /> The program is very weak. There are many unrelated events that can be related to but actually are random that you can never pull all together, perhaps unless you write. At the one and a half hours you can get less than 5 minutes of real acting and sometimes there are just people walking, talking and moving. So I can't comment on doing here. <br /> <br /> Good music in the last few minutes though. Maybe this is the only good thing. I have never given a film 1 but this film really deserves (at least you are laughing when you watch awesome movies). This is a film about when an unsuccessful attempt to show young people encounters a very sensitive audience. Hope to fall into the group.
