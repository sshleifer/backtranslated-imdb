True, the worst movie of slasher. The psychologist avoids from the reserve. Three years later he kills a professor of theology, the end of the scene. One Saturday later (hey, that's the title card said) a new professor of social theology is in school. He is making friends with another social community professor who works there, and starts dating another professor. All the students are tired, like us. There is a number of card headings indicating the most recent time. Exhibitions are very short, and are cut by different characters elsewhere, by making a little progress of any kind. Many events involve characters walking and talking, or sitting and talking, and serving a little purpose. Despite the time period, many characters dressed in the same dress. Sometimes an uncertain condition of time means when we see the body for a second time, we ask ourselves: how long has the body been gone? Also, at least one of the dead does not seem to be mistaken for others. The killer can kill one person by curing him in the chest, another by blowing his urine, and another by breaking his forehead. Is his knife or something? The video box cover has a cheerleader: no one on the film. The back store has a picture of a person in a graduate hat and a coat that destroys a group of women in the dorm room. The red photo of the picture in the picture is in the film, but no one wearing these clothes, and no such place. The murderer is effective for each other.
