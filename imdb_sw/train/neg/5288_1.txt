My God, is this "Run, Lola, Run" to counteract Influence? It was terrible. Still that the "photo writer" (and I use the word very freely) to cut and talk a conversation from one character to another, quite often out of context and rush stories together: but Anne Elliott runs from place to place in search of Wentworth near the end of the piece was an abomination! Austen must be around his grave. No respectable woman could do such a bad thing. And the actress who played Mary? Fear. Needless to say, if all of Austen's refusals are bad, they will remove a new generation of guards. If you want to see an inappropriate version of this (otherwise) a fantastic novel, get 1995 Roger Michell directed the stars star Amanda Root (whose words alone can speak much) and Ciaran Hinds. It's very good.
