This was a huge cast of stars like Tyrone Power, Henry Fonda, Randolph Scott, Nancy Kelly, Henry Hull and Brian Donlevey with lower and known names for short roles. It also had Technicolor, one of the few movies made in 1939. Now the bad news ....... sadly, I can't say very good to that story. It showed James's boys in the best light .... and Hollywood has done so since then. Why these criminals are always shown to be "good people" are more than me. This film convinces and makes their enemies - the people of the railroad - being human. The end was so widespread that it was a desire. Well, that's the movie world: evil is good; good is bad <br /> <br /> Hey Hollywood: here is a flash story - Boys James were criminals! True - look!
