The sessions that I like Japanese movies did not cut ... The movie that should be on the rebels and the life of the royal blood line became a very slow film and the course of doubt. The photography is the same, although I have seen the best scenes to fight the sword in other Japanese movies, quick cameras and how they followed the characters did not persuade them at all. The sound is too weak even to look at its presence. But the worst is the way of a conspiracy. I have to admit that, at some point, I was aware of a difficult time who was and what was going on. .. Normally the platonic love between the main character and the other was not quite desirable and it seemed to be the influence of Hollywood. All of them, if you are looking for the action of this Japanese movie is not. It is very slow, with fewer incidents of fighting with the sword and feeling very ... in a bad way ...
