All children aged 14-16 want to see this film (although you are only allowed 18 hours). They feel it is a terrible film and they feel cool when they look at it. I feel very sad children can't see a good movie, and it's a bad movie. This was one of the worst movies I saw for months. Every area you see in this film is a copy from another film. And the end? It is a clear end ... why? Because it is impossible to come up with respect to that stupid story. This film is done to make you afraid, and if you are a few and you know about music, you know when you will be afraid. When the movie ended and I turned to my friend and told him (a bit loudly) that this was a total waste of money, another stupid child appeared to me. Nowadays I can make Oscar and home video of my gold horse, if you just use the right markets.
