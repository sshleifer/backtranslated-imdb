Without stupidity, there is no budget "picture of war" made to show clearly the characteristics of Eve Meyer - not a bad idea itself - but that should be embarrassing to everyone connected to it. The Laughable Scriptures, the exhibitions that will not be able to photograph the Christmas school, the "no-step" point of view, the disturbed direction by the general director of the document document Louis Clyde Stoumen - who is quite obvious as he does the comedy, the contract The philosophy of the futility of war or T&A of speaking (at the rate of 1960s, however) travelogue of the magnificent body of Hawa Meyer - and the general air of shoddiness and ignorance. The value of seeing to see Eve Meyer has hit her things, but that's pretty much.
