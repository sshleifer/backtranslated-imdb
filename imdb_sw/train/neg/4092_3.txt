I love Fulci movies, I am really doing and not surprisingly surprising either but I realize that they seem to be hopeless and divided to many people. <br /> <br /> Victory is a place where Fulci is trying his hand in the fantasy of the epic genre and does not really match. The structure, like many of Fulci films, you saw. Other items occur, other things occurring and occasionally one area may be tangentially related to another. The truth is like Conan without a set, no script, no real executives (yes, Arnold Scharzenfartz are not just a series), no budget, a dog's watch-looking soldier and a group of gore. This was difficult to find and I could live without the inch of a vaseline on the camera so that it would be a bad hair video video watch.
