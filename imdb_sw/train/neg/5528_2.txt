With this movie just running 61 minutes and nothing good on television, I decided to pop the Revolt of zombies on the DVD to pass the time. Even when I knew the time was coming, I was very disappointed. It started with an abnormal quality of the opening logo (what - no music that includes?) And then the opening of the opening open. Gosh, I thought about the movie about zombies - even from the 1930s - would have some people looking for (White Zombie, and Bela Lugosi, certainly did) but had nothing. Sufuri. It was even harder (except for a short time with the burned eyes mentioned on the film to show a mixture of man). As a good King of Zombies, this movie can be an interesting curiosity to have yourself, but no more.
