Fox's "True Story of Jesse James" (1957) is a very powerful remake of the 1939 most famous Tyrone Power / Henry Fonda classic "Jesse James". I do not know where the error lies but healed in this version of the two intermediate characters, the uniformity of Nicholas Ray and the screenplay of ham-fisted must surely have something to do with it. In the thirty-thirty years Tyrone Power was the top of the Fox but in his fifty years his star started with the head of the studio Darryl Zanuck began to persuade guest Robert Wagner to take his place. This was a big mistake in the part of Zanuck as Wagner appeared to be under good replacement. With the possible variations of "Broken Lance" (1954) and "Out of Heaven and Hell" (1956) it is hard to imagine Wagner to introduce himself to anything! Also, Jeffrey Hunter was nothing more than a Fox player before being given the opportunity to play Frank James for Jesse's Wagner in the "True Story of Jesse James". He was borrowed from the studio last year this distinction of the actor was his best performance and revelation in John Ford's "The Searchers" class. But his play here, with Wagner as the second half of James Brothers, is not something to ignore. The player does not bring any color or color to their roles. They have absolutely no mark, they do not have charisma and appeal to be exposed to the Power and Fonda in nature. The film has also been destroyed by many publications and everywhere on Wagner's screen, like Robin Hood in the west of the United States, comes as an unlikely twit for love that you can't feel any feeling for everything. Support support was not worth mentioning but it is embarrassing to see a good actor like Agnes Moorhead being cautious as James. The most beautiful of this western far-off is the amazing Cinemascope / Color of the movie with Joe McDonald's great and best color music and the lowest lowest and well-known Leigh Harline!
