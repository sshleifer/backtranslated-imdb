I am in Iraq now doing a job that gives a lot of time to watch movies. We also have many pirated films, this gem came with 11 other movies, and this is a very simple one I have seen for a long time. I have seen a few other comments that say this movie doesn't take very seriously, but in fact, I think that's a lid for the fact that it's awesome. Not a language in cheek, the authors thought they were improving on the Blade of the film. This movie is one head on the Vampire Assassin, which if you haven't seen, I recommend. At least that movie is so bad that you will laugh more hard than you thought possible. That's the same in the cusp of no praise what so ever. from bad acting, photography (ie opening of credit), for special effects of Adobe. they could not even get buttons for guns, which relate to where the film was made, but if you use the effects, make them right. as for cast, it looks like they just went to tae class class and picked up first not to chick chick that walk out. Once again, like Ron Hall in the Vampire Assassin, do not let the non-living, can. Also, the comments on this have to "return to the old vampire movies" ... no, not. This is exactly the new vampire film. Buffy Slayer Vampire, Blade, Underworld, are all about a certain anti-vampires. This is a new type of vampire, and bad blood, artificial hitting, and cheesy over act. indeed anyone who wrote a good review about this is somehow connected to a film, or a friend of cast. But I care what, I paid 33 cents for that. However, to close this, a person in their first school semester school decided to make a film, I give them credit because it is better than I could do. Of course I also know I can't make movies so I don't try. I know how to watch movies though. I worked at 12 o'clock, 6 days a week, I saw several thousand a year I was out here and this was so bad that half way through me I was hoping to be attacked by lime.
