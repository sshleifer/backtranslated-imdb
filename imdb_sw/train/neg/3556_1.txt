You know you're in trouble when John Cassavetes runs at half the speed instead of running perfectly in the movie, and "Incubus" is a bad, worst case than a good actor who goes through a pay-off. True, examining the subject of hammy and the art of 'Baroque' of John Hough, a man cannot blame him. The movie has something to do with a series of rape murder goes into a small town, and a lot of common hokum mixed. In some way, the trend will be able to absorb tension and interest out of every area, and Cassavetes looks clearly PO 'ed sometimes. Incubus itself, which does not show up to the last location, is a well-created creation, but not worth waiting. </ 1/1 / / 1/10
