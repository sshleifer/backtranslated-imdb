It was good to see my favorite stars 30 years ago including John Ritter, Ben Gazarra and Audrey Hepburn. They seemed quite strange. But that's it. They were not given characters or good lines to work with. I did not understand or care for the characters they do. Some of the little female roles were beautiful, Patty Henson and Colleen Camp were quite capable and confident in their small side parts. They showed some talent and are sad they did not make stars in more films and better. Unfortunately, I did not think that Dorothy Stratten had the opportunity to work in her special role of film. The movie seems to have some fans, and I had an open mind when I started watching it. I am a great fan of Peter Bogdanovich and I enjoyed his last movie, "Meow Cat" and all those early from "Goals" and "Nickleodeon". Therefore, he was surprised that I was able to keep an eye on this. It is amazing that this film is about a detective agency where spies and customers are involved in romantic relationships. Five years later, former Bogdanovich lover, Cybil Shepherd had a series of television called "Moonlighting" to steal the idea of ​​a story from Bogdanovich. Of course, there is a big difference in that the series relied on tons of magic talk, while this tries to do with a slapstick and a few lines of screwball. Under / below: Not "Paper Moon" and just the color version of "What's Up, Doc".
