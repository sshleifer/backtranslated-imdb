"The National Nation goes to the cinema" (1981) is, just set, the worst movie ever made, lamer far than even the "9 inept program from Space Out." The Lampoon film is told in three groups, each claiming to be a spoof of the most common type of film, but each one walking our feet with a bad chest. There is no rhyme or because of these vignettes to implement, and no comprehensive lines of story. The other viewer on this site is written that the only good points about the film are nude events. True, Misses Ganzel and Dusenberry makes the body light, and also good too. But directors do not think that even T&A needs good news around. Nothing here. Probably the third largest part is the last one, featuring Robby Benson and Richard Widmark. Here, we see Benson as a young, energetic young man connected with the old tribal age played by Widmark. And for a short time, those of us who are still looking at this film exercise are interested in the idea that we are about to see the story of liberation about how a young boy, idealistic brings a cleansing change in an old timer approach to police work. But no such luck. As we have said, this film does not have liberation values. It is a disease until the end of the extinguisher - which, on the contrary, has been set longer than it should continue on the screen. It seems that the creators of the film knew they had had something wrong, and they wanted to make it less.
