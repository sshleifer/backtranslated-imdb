I can't see the appeal of this series (which should be sci-fi). It is only true "let's see what detergents are done this week" and oh, Cylons are linked to the stroke. Cylon "babe" continues to capture someone else's hippo is very good, it is very obvious that T&A was added to the show. Every time I fly I am happy if WTF should continue. And do not even try to deal with "story stories". It is a soap opera with a cast of CGI. This is not a science fiction away from the original Foundation. This series is not everything that works â€” be. If you like the right direction, evil, dodgy, jumpy, an unprecedented job of the top-camera camera, this show can be for you. Since nerds seem to be raving on this show, it is a clear indication that the voices of the nerds of the nerds have been changed from the Picard's TNG.
