Now, I don't want to deny that when I buy this off eBay, I had great expectations. This was an unusual job of publishing from the master of the comedy that I am really enjoying. However, I was disappointed. Pray for those who loved, but I've just compleat Al to be very difficult to watch. I have a few excitement, indeed, but most of the funny came from music videos (which I got on DVD) and others were basically filling. You can say that this was not a great achievement of the video of Al (that honor goes to UHF). In fact, I doubt if this will make you jump on the DVD, so if you're a fan of ultra-hardcore and have anything, buy a tape on eBay. Not just pay too much.
