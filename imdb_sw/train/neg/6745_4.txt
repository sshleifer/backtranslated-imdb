This is a small movie budget "Scream" style. "Maddy" is a new employee in an unknown office, which meets and starts a relationship with his colleague "Chris". During the hot fire party, Chris and his friends persuade Maddy to be a "killing club" where everyone has killed a man for captivity. When Maddy lost and killed someone in fact, hijinks installed. <br /> <br /> The film looks good, and there is a demand for this type and budget level (fraud, gore, maybe a few delegates from a smaller star than a cast), but, after rolling credits, you ask yourself why you spent 80 minutes of your life watching it.
