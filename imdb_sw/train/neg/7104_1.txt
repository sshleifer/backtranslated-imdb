The producers of this film offer to pay funeral expenses for anyone who dies in terror while watching this film. They had to give a strong psychological to anyone who enjoyed this stinker. The young couple enter the house, where a woman who looks like a woman from a couple lived. Very frightening, and very predictable. Finally I ended up regardless of anyone in this film. Avoid this at all costs.
