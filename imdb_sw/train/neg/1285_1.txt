Born, elevated, and educated in Scotland, I was very surprised by this photograph of the man who was no longer or under the farmer. The worst, the thread of the whole movie was sex for one or another form, for meaning or in words. To see it, one thinks that Scotland's 18th century had a lot of homosexuals and homosexuals. Lange was a sandwich as a "little" mother at the age of 49 but Liam Neeson was worse! Taking "bath" in the Scottish loch is not as usual as they did - but, it gave them another opportunity to show how we have sex. Save your money and look at Pinnochio.
