I can't believe this show still compares 9 out of 10. I was a great fan first season. I walked - all the secrets, doubts, unforeseen events. You never know what will happen next. For the 2nd season, I was still looking honestly, but I was a little worried that some basic things were still not explained. And instead of giving you more answers, it seemed like more questions. I LOVE suspense, but you give people bone every now and then keep them looking. Now, I can't even remember what was finally exhausted, but somewhere in the 2nd season, I had enough. It's not a great fan of the selection - and you can't miss a part of staying on what's going on. Therefore, it was not worth more to me. <br /> <br /> It is a shame that they could not be more prudent and more concerned with loyal fans. I agree with some banners that seemingly only ABC has been disappointed and has decided to see how long they can extend this show out. Do not know that at the end, they will lose more fans than they can get.
