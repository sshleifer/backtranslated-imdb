Average (and surprisingly tame) Fulci giallo which means that it is still very bad for normal levels, but it is delivered and reinforced with some good touch as well as good times when you come out on issues and displays. Guarantee known for genre is in full gear: banal talk, wooden action, plot points. And the finale goes too long, when the denouement proves to be blind or I will say: the wrong thing. Fulci's wonderful handling of the giallo principles is amusing, though. Yellow signals wherever you look. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 killers hurt
