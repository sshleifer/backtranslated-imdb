This is perhaps a display of Santa Claus ever dedicated to any center, whether it is a book, a picture, or a movie. Santa looks like a perv looking down children with a misleading story of bringing Merlin to help him win one of Satan's satanic, Pitch, does not do better things. It is delicious to say a bit, with adverse effects, even with the standards of 1959. If the child was watching this film, he could have dreamed of night and never wanted Santa to visit. They could have life for life. Think of the child in the “Christmas Story” when they start shouting after putting on the Santa column. This is how it happens if the child sees this film.
