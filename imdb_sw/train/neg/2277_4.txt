'Vampire Bat' is obviously an interest, being one of the first shocking films of the early 1930s, but being taken to isolate everything is too little for the true reputation. <br /> <br /> The film is set in the European village sometimes in the 19th century, where a series of murder is associated with vampirism and uncomfortable locals. There is a similar feeling to James' Whale 'Frankenstein' and this is included with the introduction of Dr Niemann's Lionel Atwill character, completing his improper ideas for scientific development. <br /> <br /> The vampire theme is arbitrarily and only used as a red sauce to be desperate to fall on the hitting village of Herman (Dwight Frye), thus giving an excuse to a bright-rock group to continue walk - if they need one. This is one of the first scary trio films that Lional Atwill and Fay Wray have been confused (also 'Doctor X' and 'Wax Museum') and as their other film partners are facing non-counseling comic aid and a tendency to disappear from fear of inserting exciting things. Taken in context though, 'Vampire Bat' is still weak and derived. All that we have left is to emulate the quality of Frankenstein, and only the vampire components of the hoodwink fan of Dracula fans. But in the name of the film it would have been even harder to be considered as fearful and it is important to consider that director Frank Strayer was making 'Blondie' films a few years later.
