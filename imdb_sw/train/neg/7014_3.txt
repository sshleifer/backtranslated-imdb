What desired! This film can be a decent thing, but the writing, especially, is a dancing, and the main characters are rather less and less interesting. Mike Meyers was good, and the historic entertainment of the 70-year decision was well organized, but in general, this movie was a waste of time. Instead, the film to watch, which deals with the same theme and at the same time of the base, is a great BOOGIE NIGHTS.
