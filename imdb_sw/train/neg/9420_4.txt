Following up to the best 1973 "Cleopatra Jones" has a statuesque black actress Tamara Dobson returning her signature as a chic, super-tough narcotics agent, here overturning heroin rings in Hong Kong. Blowing the color of the film to implement the wounds-and-kung-fu B-movie is fun at the beginning but finally the flag. The finale of the shot is similar to the collection line, and Dobson himself seems to have a little more than before (he still has a sexy, and he sets a special series on his basic discussion, but these circumstances can be too much for him - he is jaded). Stella Stevens is engaged in this time; he is good, but he can't resemble Shelley Winters in the predecessor. ** from ****
