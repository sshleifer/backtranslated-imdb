After the first 25 minutes of the promise that lets you feel in the heat, it is believed that this will be a good romantic comedy. Then the movie takes the opportunity to become worse. A warm feeling can be still, but if others say: the plot becomes unreliable and fake that is too difficult to watch. <br /> <br /> The movie gets faster, and it gets the feeling that you are moving faster in that way, or that the producers decided to make it in less than 1h40m and they had to cut out many scenes out of it! Realism is not a focus on itself, but as a viewer, I am sure that this comedy is not for the purpose of false, it just happens. On the other hand, this film has good internal features, and despite the bad script, I think that the performers' performances are very good. If I could only take the first 25 minutes, I'd like to give them eight. As it is now, it gets four. ... And that's good! <br /> <br /> If you are a pastor for romantic comedies you will probably have any good time. If not, I would suggest you look at something else.
