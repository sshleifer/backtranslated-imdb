Did the producer / director Stanley Kramer see Adam Kennedy's novel and Kennedy's awesome screens? Was there a few pieces left for the purpose? And what about Gene Hackman, Richard Widmark, Edward Albert, Eli Wallach and Mickey Rooney? What did they see in this muddy story? And why Candice Bergen, who gave good performance, accepting this responsibility of gratitude? The Domino Principle wants to be in the same direction as Parallax View or Manchurian Candidate and missed a very large score. The biggest shock of Stanley Kramer.
