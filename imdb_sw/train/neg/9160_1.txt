This movie was very bad. A friend leased from Netflix and made me look. There are many gaffes and goofs that it is impossible even to get to get to know the characters and plot. What about this for example ... <br /> <br /> "Vermont aircraft" surrounded by palms > The seat of the priest's office ... full with the desk card folding <br /> <br /> There is a good story hidden behind a very bad movie. But even if you look at technical errors, you will get a hard job and throw it. I was very interested in the creation of a gay flamboyantly actor to play a sincere brother of sincere religion. His opening part, sitting in his vacant apartment, playing his cat bed, was a hilarious master. Thank you for the author / director / producer / editor / star / guardian / dentist / dancer (and anything else to do with this argument) to actually find a movie like this distributed. If you do not have the best thing to do, it can be a fun group or even a game of drinking but don't have to lease it for a powerful story about strife and gay marriage.
