This movie was a real desire to me. I have been a fan of Gram Parsons for a long time, and when I got to know they were making a film about it I had been given so much, I got a movie on VHS when it came out, and I was burned with what I saw, This film was not about her life, it was after her death. I thought it would be a natural film about Gram Life and Music, but they had to make a film about his death. I am tired of hearing about his deaths in books and movies, I wanted a film about his life, not his great death. I was very unsuccessful. I would like people to watch his life, more then his death. The only thing about this film was his voice. This film is a disappointment for any Fan of Gram Parsons.
