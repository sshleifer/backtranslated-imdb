And a few more "no" about it. Voodoo Academy is, of course, a small film of pride at all times. What exactly is trying to do? Tell the story? Not clear; as mentioned, most of them are just a few of the legalists themselves. What? So, can it be an attempt to homoeroticism of quarrels? Well, maybe, if it's never really never gone beyond innocent and non-resistant forms of men. (Which, with no joy, no more than eight thousand times.) Well, it's a kind of terrible movie; Is it trying to scare us? Except unless the director will have the means to do it in a completely lost and void "work". <br /> <br /> Never in my life have I enjoyed the movie down. This is a boring and unnecessary thing I have seen. It is like Voodoo College takes a variety of horror movies, zombie, and homosexuals, puts them on a grinder, and then runs through a coffee filter - just instead of a kind of coffee filter that casts coffee beans, it's a kind that takes everything useful , or in any interesting way. The result is 74 minutes of every little movie as exciting as a glass of warm water - just without the ability to bring them back after a 10-day gin binge that will reach inevitably if you look at these detestable humanitarian efforts.
