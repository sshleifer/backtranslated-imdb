What? Has this "Be There" ever loved? People say it is evidence that a respectable, faithful person can succeed in spite of lack of intelligence. They are the same. The movie is evidence that luck is everything: hope your friend gives all your money to Apple and not Atari; hope your boat's shrimp is alone outside the sea when the storm dies; hopes that it will die in shock when you are intentionally shot and not back; hope you can't get AIDS from your wife. This modernization is also collaborating with politics - all who rebel against the social organization lose their feet, use drugs, beat their friends, or die young. In addition, product placement in this film (Nike and Dr. Pepper) is not shy. A romantic romantic film that is very empty.
