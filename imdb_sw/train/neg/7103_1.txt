That is the best way I can describe this film that puts on a new couple who enter the home where they are beaten by the first husband's wife who died under a strange situation. That looks good and beautiful, but what happens is at the time of a clean weight. In fact, one of the best things about this flick is that there is a warning at the beginning of a film that promises anyone who dies in a free coffin. Honestly, nobody took them on the offer unless someone out there is afraid of plastic skulls, bees, vinedressers, and doors closed. And the music is even worse, it includes the music of seemingly playing music by the sixth farmer. And you will see a horrible secret which is very obvious that you need to ask yourself what the people of this film thought. A person dies as he fights with his head and the police are never called to investigate. Yes this end is slow (which is very bad to consider the movie is just over an hour), a little boring story, which is easy to think with the average person. It seems no characters in this flick were the average person.
