This is very bad, so it's very bad. Acting is a great joke in history. Don't worry to see, I made it after 20 minutes and it was like a terrible end at the end as at the beginning ... I don't know the real flavor of the people, I am a fan of the movie of fear and I 'Not a surprise but I SIGNED! Maybe it was a quarter of the best stars at the beginning of the park but that's it. So I advise you not to lose 15 minutes to watch. I mean acting is best done for monkeys. And a great brother with the responsibility of parents is very bad. Do they not mention the characters in C's movies? No I must say it is not the first time I think the terrible movie is bad but it's one of the best in my eleven movies and it will be obstacles and pictures of vampire, cabin and lake, The Hoast!
