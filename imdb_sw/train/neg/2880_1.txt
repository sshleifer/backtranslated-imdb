I've never seen a film in a very short time. Only salvation is the quickest work on the DVD unit. It was like watching a film caused by the CBC film. There was definitely no money for lighting, photography, sets, place, authors, editors, characters ... Oh, there was no story even! I need to write ten lines of feedback ... Bad, bad, horrible, sad, sad, sad, bilious, nausea, causes, check, disgusting, likes, becoming, becomes, becomes, hua, becomes, causes-down-down, and I don't know if I can continue to complete ten lines of how bad this crap-o-matic production was!
