The Ballad of Django is an aggressive picture of the movie! This western whale is just a collection of events from other films (and much better) that are linked to "Django" describing how he brought it into a different confusion. The Power of Hunt (John Cameron) brings something to Django's role. Skip this one unless you just have every Django movie made and even that could be a good reason enough to see this!
