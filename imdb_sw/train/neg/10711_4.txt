Minion is almost ... well, minion. The servant of Satan and whose goal is to find the key that will open the door where his master is bound. He is a type of demon who has humanity and when the body dies it will have another. Anyone who happens to have property will go to the rage of berserker. Dolph Lundgren plays Lukas, a member of the secret mechanism of Templars, who is obliged to put the key away from minion. The movie begins a thousand years ago, in the Middle East where several knight temples run from minion. Then flash up to 1999, where an important wind somewhere underground in New York. The archeologist sand is given the opportunity to learn / dig where the key was found. Needless to say, the minion is after the key, and the movie becomes a long-term expulsion between minion and Lukas and archeologist. <br /> <br /> movie, it's just, a budget budget down budget B. Movie has no energy, and just trods aside. You will follow the track but you will never feel involved in a story that deliberately takes thoughts from past movies (especially Terminator movies). The qualities of fighting the minion are difficult, because you can't find the meaning of how good or bad is this demon warrior. It is a "skill" that becomes a one-person army when fighting a templars force but comes when it comes directly. And it should be around for a long time. All this shows that any sense of logic is just thrown down to run easily. The whole concept of the mysterious system of Templars, the hell of the hell, and the key is not well understood. We are just accepting that they just exist. The movie seems to have been made with the feeling there is not much of the story but just enough to make a few bucks. Dolph Lundgren certainly looks like he would like to be somewhere else. <br /> <br /> Decision: 2 of 5 stars.
