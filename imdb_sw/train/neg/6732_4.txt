I discovered this film on the IFC, and I thought it would be interesting. For "small stories" of love stories, some stories are given on this film. The fact that none of these women's names are making it a suspect that the partners are talking about their actual sex life, including Kathy Baker and Alicia Witt. I should admit, I want to start to see other romantic views of the first encounter of sex, as in "Strike! (1998)," when the friends of Odette Sinclair began to ask about her first time, and Tweety asked "Is it good? Others can think of new rules and restrictions that can improve this movie. I think it will make things worse. It doesn't need to be hard to get my ideas, but somehow I expected more.
