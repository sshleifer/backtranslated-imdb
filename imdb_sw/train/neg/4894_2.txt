Voting, ever shots, free shots, meaningful events are what you will find in this film. In other words, it seemed to me poor. Bits of music are directed to amateur (no interaction in wanting to play, deleted badly after identical, bad and obviously frequent actors, etc.). It is a long and stimulating film. Finally, it makes a small step and a little. <br /> <br /> There are good ideas though. Some comic elements are really effective, especially the opening area. However, the film becomes worse and worse because it cannot be completely connected and impossible to understand the end. The trailer I saw was very powerful, which is not true for the film. That is to say the difference between the trailer and the actual film is something close to the break.
