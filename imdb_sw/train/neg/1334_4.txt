So finally I saw the film "My Left Left" last night after years of being told by my mother how amazing ... Performance between Day-Lewis is really amazing and surprising, but anyone with even a little exposure to her other work should not expect anything. <br /> <br /> The worst anger in my eyes is that in observing and confirming the size of this person; The movie chose to show him as complete and complete. On the one hand I can see that this is a logical ratio; mankind is always able to be legitimate, and disability should not hide it. I just want the impressionable audience would not be so forgiving for the bad behavior and assume that the situation automatically makes it forgiven. They don't. Working is normal, and so, people with disabilities are working - but they do not do so because they are exhausted; they do it because they are wise. The lack of physical capacity did not allow the right to lose hisity to the public, simply because the person you love is changing you. There are some things that are difficult to do if you have been disabled or have the ability to be held. Providing personal permission to run football directly on your head for the sole purpose of it is one of them. (Actually, I did immediately save the punishment from the school star striker and my face, but I'm already at that time. It was not acceptable.) Working in the brawl bar is another. Rejoicing for the fact that your father enhances friendship with you after confirming that you have the ability to fly through a romantic way through the physical hoops it takes the eyeschism to move far away. All these things are foolish, and suffering through them as a way to show your courage does not make them more foolish. <br /> <br /> So yes; just because you have overcome the obstacles to achieving good things did not make you less than a jerk ... Being a good person takes priority; setting a good example for the disabled should appear at the bottom of the list.
