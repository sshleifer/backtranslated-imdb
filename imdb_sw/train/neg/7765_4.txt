Unfortunately, almost all visitors are very interesting about this film. Is it because it comes from 1975 and has Chamberlain and Curtis in it and therefore forgive for the most often the worst and miserable stories of the story? Maybe it's because some people get a feeling about this film because they have read the book? (I haven't read a book, but I don't think it's a problem, the filmmakers never think that the audience has read the book). Or is it because I am very concerned about the fact that English actors are trying to live like French counterparts?
