I liked Chiba on the Street Fighter, and I thought he, regardless of the ignorance of this film, will come to see him blowing some ass, right? Not right. This is a peculiar mess, dreary of useless talking, scriptwriting and half of programs. There are few cases of any kind of action, even a few military screens, and a few who have been beaten and edged so badly that you can't even do what the world is going on. Dub is also angry, and perhaps the idiocy which is this movie is well displayed by the fact that it is alleged to have the Italian Mafia ... CONDUCTED BY ANOTHER FAMILY! Avoid as a blow - you would see the best of the military by looking at your class for your early karate window for five minutes.
