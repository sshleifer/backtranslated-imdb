This was the third effort of the director of Stroheim's - it is very serious and no exposure to a unique camera and editorial editing could show a few years later with his work, GREED and MARCH MARKET. In fact we have a trio of grifters, hiding as a Russian and Russian Russian two who have rented a villa in Monte Carlo. His goal is to use fake money on gambling tables and win luck. Part of the plan is to Count (von Stroheim) to embark on a US ambassador who visits his wife "fool," asking him and expecting to get money to play on his weaknesses. She makes the mistake of taking the life of a maid, who promised to marry. When he sees them together, he sets fire in the room, (von Stroheim and his prey is on the balcony of the room). Here von Stroheim first puts its persona as "someone you like to hate." He is so bad and his behavior of the character will eventually bring him to the worst and deserving end. The movie is bad in the movie and its editing and should not see unless you are interested in the director. There is a little-time she tries to first meet the wife of the Ambassador, reads the book - we see the head - FOOLISH WIVES and Erich von Stroheim. This was previously thought to be a 210-minute film, cut up to 140 minutes and the label was finally released for 70 minutes. Restored to the Kino Video replaces an ongoing video (somehow damaged in multiple scenes) from an earlier version to give us minutes 107.
