The film is based on a true novel of 1950. Colin McInnes's journalist wrote three columns of "London novel": "Originally", "City of Spades" and "Mr Love and Justice". I've read all three. The first is the best. Finally, perhaps the attempt that does not happen. But McInnes's work is very sad; and so forth. This music is the ultimate dream of a journalist - seeing the fruits of one's mind has been turned into a great forgiveness, held, carried out by one-dimensional soporific of the film that says it catches the spirit of the 1950s of London, and does nothing. Thank you good Colin McInnes was not alive to preach.
