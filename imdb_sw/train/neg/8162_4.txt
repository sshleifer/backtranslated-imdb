Your view into Prom Night II will determine what happiness you remove from the film. If you're expecting a jewel of fear, look elsewhere. If you like camping videos that are fun to watch, you will love them. Lisa Schrage has a lifetime to play on top of Mary Lou and Wendy Loyd way Schrage angry fully when her "possessed". Not a classic cinema but a fun way to kill several hours with the end of evil. <br /> <br />
