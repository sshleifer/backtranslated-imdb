1 out of 10. <br /> <br /> This is a type of film that you are about to believe you have lost two hours of your life when you see the role of credit. I honestly think I can make the best movie of Vampire .... and I don't know anything. The only thing that is not absorbing (harder than the Vampire) is Jason Scott Lee .... its character is at least a little cold, it has a certain mystery, and a little buttock.
