This movie can be a study of interesting behavior and may be aware of its subject but the real problem with this movie is that it has nothing in it. It does not give any insight - or solution to the problem. It is only a demonstration of the old male punishment and the problems that build up his normal daily life with his family. Why do you want to watch this? That's all meaningless and useless. It doesn't help that the main character is some wrinkly 50+ old man. You will have a hard time to inform yourself â€” and to sympathize for him. He looks just like an old old player, who is a regular hunting woman and sex. He has all kinds of sex three times a day with a different woman and not just for prostitutes. It also doesn't have a bad way to see, although all feel they have been forced. But however it is much better than more direct production to video. Who knows, if the filmmakers were given the best equipment to work with, the film would be worthy of good faith. <br /> <br /> The story gets occasionally sometimes. There are no meaningless verses that are often more interesting than they seem to be. I'm talking about the example of all Ordell's line. Things are getting worse when the movie starts towards the end. Also the whole way is told, the refusal between the events that happened and the main character sessions and his psychiatrist feel easy and simple. But far from bad movies, this is not just among them. Not better or worse than any direct direct flick, with the same concept. It still seems strange and incredible that they could hit Nastassja Kinski and Ed Begley Jr. as well as low-mean productivity like this. I think they were desperate to work with money. <br /> <br /> 4/10
