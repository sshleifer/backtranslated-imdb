From an impressive title for flat displays, Curdled is a very unusual film. The movie has found other fans through the fact that Quentin Tarantino's name is linked to it, and secretly and out of the position of nod to Rodriguez / Tarantino flick 'From Dusk to Dawn'. These things do not make the big movie, however, and this is more obvious all the way through 'Curdled'. The film faces a lack of thought, and tries to conceal this by killing which means to be stylish and inconvenient events. The Mexican music track with the interaction of the film is clear that it means to be cool, but it hurts very quickly; especially as aside from the fact that the leading character is Mexican, not recommended by the sound of the movie. Film films are usually offbeat and follow gorehound who, because of his endurance and murder of gris, takes work with the cleaning company's murder scenes. It looks boring and it is. William Baldwin is the name 'just' on the list, and even won't make sense. She has not been given anything to do in the film and away from talking to her victims and standing around trying to check that shock, has lost much. Angela Jones, or let's say; The taxi driver from Pulp Fiction, assumes the responsibility of being killed as a massacre of a young woman, and it is always clear that it is her involvement with Pulp Fiction that has won this role, not her acting ability. He can be good in his small position at the Tarantino masterpiece, but they do not have a talent to lead the film himself. He looks out of space and out of space for many films, and if he was not at its latino speed; she can not convince the audience that she is weirdo to any level. The letter is a hundred percent-evidence of waste-forgetting. Films like this often boast themselves for innovation or black comedic antics; but this fails at all levels. If you are a fan of Tarantino, a fan of William Baldwin, a frightening fan or just a buff of the film; this is one of missing.
