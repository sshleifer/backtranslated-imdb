When you see a young person, you will spend your time trying to get a lot of conspiracy. And that's not a good sign because this film should be a comedy! You should be laughing! But you? Probably not. The biggest problem with the little man is his concepts â€” it is very ridiculous to accept (even if the cartoonish comedy), so when loud sounds, work and on the joke on the inside kick, they do everything that appears ten times more than it is already. <br /> <br /> "But it's comedy" some of you may be shouting. That is true but that is not an excuse for that dumb conspiracy. I mean coming, think of it if you have seen a child with a MANUFACTURING CHILD, do you? Can't you be younger? And if calvin wanted to hide a lot of diamonds, why didn't he put it on a close shelf rather than a handbag for ordinary women? And how can a doctor know that calvin is an adult? I mean a great ... what? <br /> <br /> "It's not about a plot, it's about laughter" you can be screaming. Well you see this, there is hardly any laugh at a little person and that just make a dumb conspiracy donkey stand out more. If you want to look at Tanzanians fighting the faith to strengthen the plot, stick to white chicks because at least they have a few good laughs. What you do to make it clear to a young person.
