A bad, unpredictable and unpredictable story of a person affected by a chemical substance (Weller) who continues across the country to find his old wife and children; At the same time, he kills everyone in his way only with one touch with his hands. In her risky song, the doctor (Hurt) and the little journalist (Natasha) try to stop the person. Movie has an early season but although it may be better. The end result is the only movie without insisting or shorter. Even cast well is completely desired. I offer this 4 (four).
