Ba ba ba boring ...... this is close to the battlefield in science fiction. genie francis (laundry hospital hospital) has a small role as an author and that itself must tell you that this film must be bad .... there are kings kingsley (professional award winner) in this stinker and a few other actors respect. You need to ask yourself who made them to make this bad film. Music goes up and down as a great story. Even if you are targeting the plot it is impossible to follow. Effects are mediocre also and it looks really a date. All characters speak in monotone voice and do not have the origin of their conversation. I would like to proceed and continue how this is a bad movie. At least the World War is very terrible but this is just b o r n n. Avoid unless you want to sleep to sleep.
