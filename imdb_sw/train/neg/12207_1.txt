I remember I loved this movie when it came out. I was 12 years old, I had Commodore 64 and I loved Rambo on it. So I was very happy when I came to buy this cheap film. I put it on my VCR and start: This film is very bad! Sylvester Stallone says as 3 words on the entire movie (except for the bad speech of the last impression), and has the same words on his face all the way. And the most stupid thing in the middle, it's very strange prediction. I just ended up quickly distributing something around and going to exchange movie for something else.
