As a long-term superman fan from the Community, through the series of 1950s, the first two films of Chris Reeves and Lois & Clark, and finally Smallville, I was * I'm hoping to be cunning and "Superman Returns". <br> <br /> Instead we got a l Author of Lex to do * another attempt * in real estate conversion, another superman-hit-time-wear kryptonite, and indoor variations: could not stop falling into the sea while facing and 6 "of kryptonite, but when Lois has gone away 3" of it, * and leaving others in it *, can lift the continent in space?

He made all kinds of survival, heroic things without anything but guts and skills - no power, no damage ... is a natural man. <br /> <br /> They continue to make Superman so small. Why can't we have Superman to fight Brainiac or fight to save the world from General Zod instead of the small plans of Lex. Oh, I forgot ... they do it in Smallville. ... / I think I will catch him with Smallville ... <br /> <br /> Maybe you should, too ...
