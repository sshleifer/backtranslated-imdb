This movie's movie - let's be right now. There are a few of the dirty filters in this pile but no one can redeem the plot. Colin Farrel looks like Brad Pitt in "Monkezi 12" and makes it like that. I usually hate Colin because he is a fairy in general but is right in this film. There were two lines of conspiracy in this movie = = one about a child who strikes stones with carts and moving about a woman with a mustache. Let's say - this movie has no idea what it wanted to say or where it wanted to go. Those story story lines are faced at a certain level but never should be included in the script. The whole thing is weak and useless and then there is a constant situation. But in general - do not bother unless you love so much Islam so that you can look at freedom and have been saved by everyone who looks like a Lucky-or Happy American who has taken some real movies to succeed.
