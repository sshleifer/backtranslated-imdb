I often come to this site before going to the movie, if I would like to see what other people think about the film. I read a lot of reviews that said 'excited not a terrible movie'. This helped me give this film a try. In fact I must take the matter with these words of "amazing / fearful," as it was not! I went around and asked my money back, and if you many of the spectators enjoyed this litter .... well you must be pleased with ease! At the end of the film, people behind me said loudly "it was a waste of time" and I turned to them and I said "I couldn't do it well". I kept waiting for something to happen ... but it didn't. There was a really awesome ability (or exciting if you would like) but nothing happened. Williams made that part well but I felt that it was a short mix with a poor script which dithered around and went anywhere. Save your money people, this is Turkey which will collaborate with a DVD shop near you in the future!
