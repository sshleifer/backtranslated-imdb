Drivers of the race cars say that 100 mph looks fast until it is turned 150, and 150 mph is fast until it is sent to 250. <br /> <br /> OK. The Andalusi dog looks so beautiful that you have seen Eraserhead, and Eraserhead seems to be so strange until you have seen Born. The birth seems to be so strange that you have seen the work of C. Frederic Hobbs. Fans of the competition, there is nothing in the world of films like C. Frederic Hobbs. The Alabama spirit comes close to any of its films with a concrete plot, and involves only hippies, rock concerts, voodoo, ghosts, vampires, robots, witches, non-bribes, international, and Gas Secrets. With Woodmobile Fabulous, for transporting Sunset District in San Francisco, in fact. <br /> <br /> What really amazing is that someone gave LOT of money to make Ghost Alabama. There are sets, lights, hundreds, clothing, lots and lots of effects. Somehow makes the Spirit of Alabama SO WRONG. You look at a bright basketball like the Night of Horror or Baby Plutonium, and at least some part of the weakness is an excuse on the basis that they were obviously making a film from the head over to their discovery cards. But the Alabama Spirit was made with a real budget, and that's bad. I mean, I have a script about the tribe of aliens living in Thunder Bay, Ontario, to build a mysterious temple in the woods outside of Twizzlers, and nobody blows down my door making a notebook - how did this person get the FOUR films of flakiest films?
