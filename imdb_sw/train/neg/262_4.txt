Jamie Foxx is my favorite player. However, I feel that he sold out to give his first budget place. Foxx follows in the footsteps of Chris Tucker, Martin Lawrence and Dave Chapple, both who have seen their talents have been destroyed by the uninformed manufacturers who think the black men doing good crime are a fantastic concept (See: Money Talk, Blue Streak). In fact I laughed a few times and I have given all these helpers to keep taking hilarious responsibilities, but I'd like to see these people of the branch out of the Marlon Wayans show in Requiem for Dream. Or Tommy Davidson and Damon Wayans of Life's moving forward in the satire of Spike Lee's Bamboozled.
