People like me will break this movie off. Not true. Plot is sooooooo predictable. You can expect everything that happens efficiently. Of course, it gets rich and becomes rich, and robs the wicked. We've seen a million times before. The authors of this film should think that most of the films that go to the public are stupid. They should be right because a lot of people really liked this film. I mean solving scores in a matter of seconds. Store a hidden treasure hidden under Manhattan road? You would like to think of all the work that has gone under New York under that room room would have been found before. and all that was built during the civil war? PLEASE And the story of love between Ben and Abigail ?? how good, and I think romance in Clive Cussler novel was weak. They just fall in love like that, in 2 seconds I will be more worried about saving my own ass then getting some. Hell and a girl with a foolish piece. 1/10 litter
