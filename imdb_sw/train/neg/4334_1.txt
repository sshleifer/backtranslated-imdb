This film was capable and I had agreed to try but there are many problems during emergencies which are obvious - it's hard to swallow as a idiot like that. <br /> <br /> Rising Power is installed in seventy years. Carlito's route is in the middle of the seventy years. For this film to be true, it would have to put in five years, if not thirty years. The Growth of Power has no Gail (Pennelope Ann Miller), no sign of Kleinfeld, no sign of Rolando which Carlito deserved to run with "his" day "hey". No primary characters in the original film on this film. We should believe that Carlito met these people for a few years. The Growth has ended with Carlito walking on the beach talking about retirement in a paradise that he wanted to do in the original film. Also, before it creates Rocco characters and Earl - what is supposed to happen with them because they are not clear in Carlito's route? It is also hard to understand how Carlito could have a relationship with Italy he has in the original film to watch the uplifting events. What? Where is Taglialucci in this film? There are probably seven years between the two films and they use five of them in prison. It's like trying to put a square square in a round hole. It is obvious that nobody was attracted to telling a good story and that they were willing to make certain bucks by making a gangster average film and giving us a character called Carlito Brigante on the story. The movie had a good time but I think they would be better off leaving this movie to stand itself instead of trying to make it before Carlito's way. If you feel deciding to see this film, the only advice I can give is to think of the movie as a pre-qu linear. Think like the western spaghetti and the man of Clint Eastwood without the name, in other words two movies that have the same character but not necessarily merged.
