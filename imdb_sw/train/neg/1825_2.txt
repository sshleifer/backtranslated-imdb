I don't know what. I just couldn't laugh. I had an open mind. I didn't need to be tight- @ s about it. But I largely could not laugh at this film. It was not an interesting thing for me. Some parts seemed like Ben Stiller and Jack Black tried very much. Just because they put two very funny people doesn't mean that this will be the best comedy. Some movies should not be made. This is one of them. Because it makes a lot of old jokes and acting it was just stupid. I know, I know it's comedy. Type of least. But I just had no feeling. Sorry, but I can't give anything less than two. And that's all I give. <br /> <br /> 2/10
