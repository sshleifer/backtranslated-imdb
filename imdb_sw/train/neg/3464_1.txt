It seems that several people who watched this film just watched it because it took place near where they live. Is that for a ringing ring? If this film was done near the place where I lived I could not mention it in my opinion. It's bad! Several reviews say that this film is a movie of spoof or a language of cheek horror movie, not. It's sad to see this film stepped as a comedy like it makes it not just a bad attempt in the film of fear but as comedy as well. I laughed, although the film was very bad. <br /> <br /> This movie has two beautiful things going, mask with a choice of choice, unfortunately it would have been the most interesting hour and half of the mask with the weapons set on the table then look at this waste. The social definition behind the film is also laughable, young and stupid. Don't be worried about this film, you have lost time to read this reading again. Arrggghhh! It encourages that movies like this are even made. I expected to give all employees the praise of Alan Smithee, the name used when someone, usually the director, does not want to be counted by the film because it is bad. There is nothing liberating in this film, I spent $ 1.19 on rent and I felt broken. Avoid. 1 out of 10
