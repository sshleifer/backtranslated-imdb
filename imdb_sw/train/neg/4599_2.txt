Advisor "Do not judge the book for cover", was created as a warning to those who cannot look under the face. <br /> <br /> I looked at the art, "King of Ants" I once thought HORROR! The pictures of arcane proudly displayed on the cover & back spoke of dark vision, summary promise of murder, betrayal, & penalties. Instead of what he discovered under that face, he was less interesting of what you could get under your rock your average <br /> <br /> "King of the pest pot" article Chris L. McKenna as Sean Crawley, the average guy already doing. name yourself in this world, even if it means murder. Unless Sean Crawley is a careless person, I never felt pity or compassion for this behavior. In fact he downright unlikable, but not as much as Daniel Baldwin (Ray Mathews) who turns into uninspired performance as he did every bad and quite a laughable conversation he is forced to read. Throw in Kari Wuhrer as mourn the widow who seems to have unconditional faith (esp. In residence), and little no ordinary knowledge, and George Wendt as Duke, which is essentially much Normal from Cheers but MAANA! <br /> <br> Now there are a few interesting "madness" sequences in this film (the source of photo cover) but this film never delves the most in the world. It likes to hit you for a non-emotional character, bad conversation, and an impossible event after an impossible event. Oo Fear!
