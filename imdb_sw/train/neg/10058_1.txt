I was fascinated by how this movie was so bad. Did the viewer have to learn something, or reflect on anything here? What had pumpkins? Should I be surprised by the motel shots? Is it a matter that there are rubbish bags on the roof of the hotel? Why the author accuses people who are arguing (it is very obvious that he has edited the parts of his interview to succeed in distress). The best part of the film was an interview with a professor of films who tells us how this film will be bad even before it ends. You are really surprised. I believe that the Creator tries to be a professional or trying to impress the mind community.
