I do not wish to believe some people really like this. Yet they still call themselves fans of Batman. Even going away to say that it is better than BTAS. Which is not. It should be humble to use Batman's name for this piece. It's not Batman. The entire column of the show is '' if you can't defeat someone getting a big weapon to help you '' Batman is not all about weapons. He uses his batarang buckets to hold and Batmobile, that's it. He has not come up with a new technology of skills every time he hits someone. I don't know where hell has the idea of ​​Batbot. or nothing. They have destroyed all the criminals. Mr. Freeze has gone from a compassionate scientist to a small crash in a cryofreezing object. Catwoman is now a 40-year-old woman with dumb clothing. Penguin is now a ninja with a top 50 ft. The Ventriloquist is now called Scarface that makes Dummy a basic piece for character. They even got the idea of ​​dumb to make him a giant! wtf? and two changes of odds are Joker and Riddler. have changed the Riddler to the shadow of the Gothic / retro boy. and Joker for acrobat and fear. He looks like Bob Marley wannabe. they have absolutely to completely destroy the batman even more than B & R did! I would like to meet with the creators or the authors and animators of this show so that I can share the head with the iron metal button.
