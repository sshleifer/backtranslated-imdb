Fifteen years ago, Power Rangers was one of the exhibitions which drove out nations, especially young people. When I was a 3-year-old child who lived in the Philippines, I would like to watch this show every Friday on ABS-CBN (Channel 2 above). When the movie came out in 1995, all was shocked and frightened when I looked at my father and brothers 2. My brothers even took me a "Balikbayan" box full of Power Rangers (including a simple Megazord model and small items Rangers). I even played video games, and I loved only one ("MMPR: Fight Edition"), which was sad. However, it was an expanding show on my behalf in a series of robot (especially the anime series like "Gundam") Now I'm 18 years old, I'd think that this show is very good to me now. To verify this, I walked under the memory line by purchasing a DVD set by "MMPR: Movie" and "Turbo: Movie Rangers Movie" and checked both. I was like, "Ugh. It's very bad. Just another junk in the upper room for me." For you all of my generation, this is not a show that you would like to watch regularly. I don't know to leave it for the rest of your life, but it's not always a bad thing now, is it? Instead of "Power Rangers", I would like to suggest something like "Mobile Fighter G Gundam" (IN RECOMMENDED), "Ninja Senshi Tobikage" (aka Ninzo Robots), or even the ORIGINAL Sentai shows that it is the basis of "Power Rangers."
