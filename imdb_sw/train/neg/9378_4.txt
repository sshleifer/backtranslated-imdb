This is another North Eastern Florida production, which took place mainly by close to Fernandina Beach and Plantley Plantation. I was wondering what the company could take on Fernandina Beach for as long as it was necessary to achieve street events. Movies are good, and they are very bad. Tami Erin is good, but it affects. Eileen Brennan overacts more. Good for small children, or for those who love to a large extent. A 4 from Miller-Movies formula.
