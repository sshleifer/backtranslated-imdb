What was this movie? What was the plot? I don't know. Shaq cannot do, people don't know how to lead, and I am Kazaam! Genie who climbs? Come. Maybe Eminem or Linkin Park will be on a film like this. I remember I watched this just to kill time. Not very interesting. I just remember thinking, "Who put Shaq in this film?" The whole story seemed to be stupid too. It had no meaning. I think the non-made of this movie is that you can find anything on ghetto and anything can happen. I can't comment more because this movie is awesome and nothing deserves to comment on. I "want" this film will leave.
