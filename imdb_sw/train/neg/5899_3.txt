For all the people who have emerged have been doing on Miike and his work. I've sat through this Flick night. I thought, if it was a good half like Ringu, if I thought from this comment, it could be worth my time. It is not lucky. <br /> <br /> I am searching for the general director (or author), but I don't think Miike is the same. I have no Articles of Art, but I know a lot: the horror movie should be faster. It is also appropriate to give the viewer more features than this film does. Sticking to this film was a whisper of my head. Some of the events close to the end were very hard, I went to the refrigerator and sat there with Kou Shibasaki when he looked at the camera for the first time, the end and mouth agape. The famous director once made a claim, and I am paraphrasing, the movie can be made by turning the camera on a beautiful woman and letting the roll. Kou is not a good enough player to do the job. He is amazed at the little girl for more scenes than I remember to remember. And he is not the only one who makes a contribution to the head of the head; The other members of the cast feel the need to imitate this non-performance. Script gives you a small chance to do much more on a lot of time. <br /> <br /> I love Asian movies. Hong Kong's argument comes from the past 30 years, the Korean fear as "Phone" and "But", the work of Ang Lee, some of the fun but fun movies of Philip and sex fights, and others. Chakushin Ari would have done without it.
