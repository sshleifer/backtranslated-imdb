First of all I just want to say that I love this show !!! But this part ... this part makes the shame of the whole show. I don't know they tried to reach this period but they created an effective program of WORST in the entire series. <No / line of the story, everything is chaotic and joke ..... is decorate. The way they tried to answer some of the questions in the game. .... For example "how furlings are shown as" to create a stupid "original on ..." ...... it's just a shame. It is understandable that authors run out of thought and that is very bad.
