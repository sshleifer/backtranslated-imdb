::: SPOILER ALERT ::: <br /> <br /> Soooo, Arnie is a very good man, but after the event with some fighting in helicopter and disobeying orders, he is sent to prison (or rather some kind of work camp . He runs, but after a while he has found it again. This time has been completed in a basic show where he should run for a time from a group of people with problems with different themes, and eventually die. But we all know Arnie, and we all know that he is tough than the tough guys. I really wanted to love this film, be a fan of Arnie and all. However, "The Man of Race" has a lot of errors that are very critical from me. E. Construction of Arnie's battles in a helicopter, where trembling viewers are shown a brief summary of the event, completed with 5-10 different camera angles. This means that a military helicopter that Arnie climbed had about 10 cameras equipped with staff members, one of which _inside_ the eye of one of the members of Arnie's staff hits. There are also other errors, and conspiracy, which in theory seems to be very interesting and creative, works for a while, then it is a form of building a stupid house and a reality that ceases. <br /> <br /> Acting cannot actually say that it is better than sub par, and Arnie in the leading position, make the average Arnie performance. Some of the cast gets without being good or bad. <br /> <br /> Special effects are the same, without being awesome. <br /> <br /> RATING: 3/10
