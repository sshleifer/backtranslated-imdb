There is something wrong about watching the movie as 'Kill for Numbers' because somewhere in the Hollywood form is a good movie trying to happen. However, when completing credit, no saving. Anything has been hit by the "cop" side of the story, where Sandra Bullock detective and Ben Chaplin are experiencing sexual incidents that become more and more eliminating the movie. Although Bullock is powerful in its role, it is not enough to save the missing script and pacing maneuvers. Ben Chaplin's gifts have been destroyed in the role of forgetfulness (well done earlier in the year under 'Under Girl') with Chris Penn, who has an amazing role to feel like talent. Otherwise, the plot is not a factor even in this film completely. Two teenagers played with Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt are the only reason for this film. Their talent and chemistry performs a good job and plays well. It is very bad they were not in the best film around the world. Barbet Schroeder is a way of walking also safe here for a seasoned film manufacturer. Below Below: it is a tax value if you are a fan of a variety, but everyone will have a verified life without ever seeing, but maybe on a TV network and a convenient business break.
