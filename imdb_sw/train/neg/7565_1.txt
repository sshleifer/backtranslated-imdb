This movie is a huge waste of nine dollars that I have spent so long. If you knew how many times I went to the movies you would like to say, it's hard to imagine, but never-down, it's true! After seeing the trailer of this movie, I knew that I should see it! If you are a fan of fear, mystery, and suspension, why not you? Trailer is not less exciting and exciting; Unfortunately, movies are not one of these. <br /> <br /> From the movies, on the script, for acting, this film is perfect. If you are reading this, you plan to go to the film you expect some exciting, secret, action, fear, or anything else except losing an hour and forty-five minutes I'm afraid of being scared. </> <br /> "Why is it bad," you might be wondering. Let me tell you. The movie was not strange or suspenseful. Nothing about the movie made me a little bit "on the edge," scared, or curious. The document was very good. There were many times in the film where the conversation was just ridiculous I started writing it as a comic exemption only know a few seconds later that it wasn't. Acting was very scary. I like Nicholas Cage but this was lost. Without exception, every performance in this film was below average. The cinema movie was bad and not one time of doubt or mystique. Finally, the story is quite clear. You can see the end of this film comes miles away. <br /> <br /> I'm not usually a very sharp suspect. In fact, when I'm going to see the comedy I want to laugh and when I'm going to see a secret / suspicious / fear, I just want to be surprised. This film was awesome, not working, not well written, and desperate. Make yourself a permit and go see something else.
