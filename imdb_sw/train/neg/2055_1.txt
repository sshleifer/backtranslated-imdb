Surely there is no reason to waste your time with this "film". The original said it all and still continues. Read the book or do research on the story, and you will see that this remake is hard. Eric Roberts as Perry Smith? His sister would do a better job! After that Holcomb & Edgerton, KS where the story is done, sets and places seemed NOTHING like Kansas. The original is riveting, from the film's writing area to the use of real participants, armed with victims victims. Not mentioned by Scott Wilson and Robert Blake. Soundtrack and Quincy Jones with movies for Conrad Hall ... Content available on DVD in the current mirror. Let this turkey die a quick death.
