The summary provided by my cable TV guide has made it more interesting than it really is. "Dog Rocker" is far away from the worst films I've ever seen, the name that was done earlier with "Legends Urban: Final Cut". From its opening location I could say that it would be very bad, but I was so tired that I couldn't care. This film has a refusal of action, especially for a boy who is being tortured in his dreams, wonder if he is not trustworthy of the plot, and some of the rhythmic music I have heard, and I live when he is loved by Britney Spears and Nsync dominates air waves. The main problem with the "Rock Rocker" is that it's not funny. One would be a very light and stimulating film and so it is not as horrible as this would try to destroy a few things and a few buttons shaping here and there, but no. We have found an independent friend of Guy trying to be happy, but he has come as angry instead. (spoiler) And please, tell me, who in this world of madness is insane and love enough to visit a creepy prison in the middle of the night? There is no-one! If you are doing a terrible movie, at least it will make it reliable. This is nothing but.
