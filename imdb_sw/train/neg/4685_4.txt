Up to the last few minutes of the film, I would give them a movie of 7 or 8 stars. However, the end is terrible and "Hollywoodized" that completely weakens the first 80% of the movie. The plan involves around the submarine and the possibility of having received fire-related nails. Captain, Gene Hackman, is for the launch, when his first officer, Denzel Washington, deserves to confirm the launch orders first. The problem is, launching WHAT captain and first officer should use their launch keys simultaneously. Hackman has launched and Washington stands firm until finally this brings a defensive weapon into small. Finally, an error has been discovered and missiles have not been launched. Cool. However, here comes a place that is not really good. After returning to the ground and going ahead of the review board, Washington and Hackman (who would spend half a movie trying to kill) shake hands and all are friends of a friend! Huh?! Also send the end of making the movie worthy of my time.
