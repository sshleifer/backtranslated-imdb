I watched this film because Amber Benson making it with Nick Stahl in general is very cold - I thought that any movie that shared with two actors I love and respect can not be all bad. And in that sense, I was right - based on the string that was given, both of them did well. It is not good to leave a movie from sucking, you understand, but very well that I was able to make it through 75 minutes of the film (and that's the main sign of the bad film: time, for 40 minutes through Ready to ask for it over) <br /> It's hard to know where to start with problems in "Taboo". Negotiations, as described, are terrible; wood and odd. The work of January Jones is very serious, and since he is a habit we spend most of the time following the house, this is an unforgivable mistake. This program can be very powerful because it is not done at the same time when you are a clich√©d so you can predict exactly (in fact, not one of the main 'twists' in this film could be surprising to anyone but small). Several interesting publications beat aside, the director tries very much with great success, the awkward tracking tracks and the function of the scam camera that convinces you from a small element of the story there. <br /> <br /> The three stars of this film are awarded to the fact that it has Amber Benson, and the end is closed because one reason joke made me a little snigger. I will not recommend this film to anyone, forever, under any circumstances. Avoid at all costs.
