I saw many of my "My Daughter" today at the IAAC film concert in New York and I had to leave the playground because of the nausea feeling filled in me. I've seen sound movies, and I've seen satires of sound movies. This film could not decide which one wanted to be, so it became a shock to him. It seems to have been fully published from movies such as Bride and Mixes and sound sounds, and what work of cunning, lazy at that time. What? How can a voice be moved away from its decision to adhere to a well-used scripture? What? No one can bring a million screens of real, interesting stories that really exist and come into the country of a billion people? The highest car driver, cattle on the road, free photographs of exotic locations, the non-motorized means of Mumbai roads, are all there. Every possible clich√© about India has been installed faithfully. So it is predictable. ugh !!! The work show is weak on board unless Neha Dubey, who is talented and good. Someone wondered why he could choose a project like this.
