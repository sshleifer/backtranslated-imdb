Typically, any movie with Sylvester Stallone goes to drink ass. Rambo: The first part of the First Blood was not different from this. The only movies that Sylvester Stallone were in were good with Rocky and Blood First. This film is not real, and itself. It has steps, but it's not a very good step. I did not enjoy watching it, and I could never look again. No wonder he won the Razzie Award for the worst pictures. I would like to give this 3/10, the only reason that was 3 is because it had some good action, but it's not good.
