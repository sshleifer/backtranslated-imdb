I am an actor, producer, director and what I say is true. This project was the worst film in the history of film making. From the producer to the director and the edit of this film called film is a joke and I mean a BIG joke. Why blockbuster was released that trick? I take my worst job and this film is insulting to my profession. Did the director try to make a bad film? I don't think so. I saw a bad zombie movie, but this takes Coffie cake and everything on the damn table. THE MOVIE! I hate to say evil about other filmmakers because I am one, but please think about taking a different profession. I respect the fact that you have completed the film, but I need to ask you "DO YOU NEED FROM", I mean love for your girls, awesome Zombi, what would you be thinking about. For the whole nation, if I could vote Zero I would like to. FILM OF WORSHIP IN MOVIE DOING HISTORY!
