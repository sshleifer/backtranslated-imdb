In comparison with my colleagues, I always try to find something liberating in any movie I have seen. This, the quality of dubbing and lighting is bad, acting is the wood and the opening sequence is very wrong with the young chicks with a girl with blood forming. Something should be lost in the definition of the word "Bloodsucker" from Italy in the head; almost as the manufacturers were going to the film Gothic Vampire story then changed their minds but they could not finish their great opening sequence, so they put it into any film. This movie has been made in 1975 recently released on a DVD and comes with its own exhibition trailer which somehow is harder than it appeared on the film! Now anyone who can buy this film probably has already read its parallel yet and knows what to expect - the softporn of Italy from the mid-1970s. I bought it because I was attracted to Christa Nelli (often known as "Krista Nell"). I find it very exciting in many Eurosleaze movies from the 60s and 70s. He had hoped Imdb will show people the characters if someone hears their names in the film but without a cast list, it is very difficult to connect to the actor concerned. I think Krista Nell played "Cora" but under the style of magnificent hair, clothes and make-up is difficult to identify him. There are two pictures of the size and the participants of the pieces and no one appears. Maybe there was something lost in the dubbing process. The music was of the sky and of course if you like soft-sized photos there. The outdoor areas used were good and I would like to know where they beat the castle on the island. It should be set to "Ireland" (North or Republic?) 1902, so the cost of every piece of sports game. For some of the events I found without surprising funny especially on mobile phones! However enjoy romp.I I enjoyed 4/10.
