Forget Plan 9, this is the last fiasco, practice game, directed, written, used, etc. This film is based on the best of Isabel Allende's novel. I love Meryl Streep and Antonio Banderas (in non-Spanish films), and other actors, including Winona, my famous actor and Jeremy Irons are struggling to get the very bad script. There are many mistakes (like, for example, from the time of snow in Xmas in Chile?) And very cruel, with tons of evil being called "the authenticity of magic", this looks like the worst movie at all. It's quite looking !!!
