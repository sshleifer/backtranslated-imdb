Val Kilmer, stable performance. Dylan McDermott, stable performance. Josh Lucas, stable performance. The three actors involved in providing the best performances. Who is the problem, who cares about the plot? John Holmes. He causes good gifts, addicted drug, and a guy who, despite being infected with AIDS, has continued to make adult films, not only to do a pleasing character. The story revolves around the events leading up to and after the massacre that took place at the end of 80 years in Los Angelos which Holmes was linked, arrested and charged with murder, and who was finally released. As in the OJ, the cause of guilt, regardless of the results, has gone up very high in the "Made" area. No one is compassionate in this film, if everyone is independent criminals. There is nothing interesting here.
