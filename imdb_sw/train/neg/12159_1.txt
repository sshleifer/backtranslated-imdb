I can't believe I look at this but I think I just wanted to know if this film will get funnier without pretending and funnier towards the end. and it did. at the end it was a very bad practice found by a defense lawyer - so out of real life that even a false story was also very strange. no one on this planet can live in front of the court as he did. and perhaps the worst prosecutor in the world. why was he in court yet? he did nothing to do anything to prove that he was guilty. A simple search of his home could result in ring results. but no going. he liked to say "objections" 2 or 3 times during the whole attempt - that was. The blonde day was given a fact-medicine to prove he was innocent but not Brett. The attorney almost had a brett altar in his home that would prove his ill sickness. but again no going. during the court area I felt a silent desire to take a needle from his hand and make it several times against his head. even the real weirdos do not see that fake lie "I am wrong" as he did. and this film tells us what? do not put a woman with life insurance: as soon as she falls under her husband's head she will be thrown into prison, guilty or not. evil, wicked people.
