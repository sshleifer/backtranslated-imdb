How many centuries until the Japanese / Asian films will disappear the shtick of a tall woman? In fact, they have overcome the "Ringu" million times, and often worked well - which comes only to show that nature is not the amount of demand in a kind of fear (or that I'm not uncritical and easy to please?). However, this time I almost found myself a little relaxing, much to stimulate. It's not a bad film, but it's at least half-hour more than it should be, with its 110-minute incredible height. Compared to many Japanese movie trailers, OMC does not exist. Plus, the end is confused: it is not worth it completely. As with the voice of the ring: Miike could come up with songs that fit more than a little thing to forget. Although it had played a number of times I can't remember yet - that's how terrible it was. Referring to Miike, for him this is a business thing, so if someone thinks they can have a distortion of "Bijita Q" or "Inspection", they lose their time.
