This is a film where all actors are best, especially Brigitte Bako and Erik Palladino, in a film where each of the three couples meet in a situation that feels that they are forced to be good or keep stories for motion. In other words, it feels like they are the events of the film made, not like real life. Even if women working for peep speakers are from one of their customers, it is not quite visible in all the way written in this film. Also, when one of the characters encounters a woman more advanced in the film, she feels fake, how they look every second after the protest. Again, all actors are good, and during this film is good, but generally someone else who could use the record before the production got rolling.
