* SOILER * It's fake! The whole thing is fake! There are no ghosts or zombies, Alan is the Lord and his cousin or brother or half brother or something like that to the fortress and his own title. So he invests this useless meaningless alphabet SCOOBY-DOO driving Alan suicide. Most of the movies are he who collects redheads and attacks them. He will not kill them even. He stops sleeping and the girl disappears and he thinks he hid them somewhere. If she looked at Evelyn's soul, she would tell her she was wearing a protective coat! My God is wasting time. Don't bother to watch, lease and buy and try yet, sell it. Quickly! Make yourself a permit and keep away from NIGHT EVELYN IN IN THE WORLD. I offer this stinker CRAP-O-LANTERN.
