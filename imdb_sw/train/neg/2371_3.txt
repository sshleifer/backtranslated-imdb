It's not the big striker Freddy Krueger, but that doesn't mean I don't like Robert Englund and his other dream on Elm Street movies. I think Robert is a very good actor. No one is better than Freddy Krueger than he does. This movie is facing. Acting is awesome, the plot is very weak, and Freddy Krueger is the only part of the cast that is even worth looking at. .) But this is not one of those movies. At first it was good, the second in my opinion was the best, the third was the same but I haven, t seen others.What you do, don, t do the same mistake I did by looking at this piece .
