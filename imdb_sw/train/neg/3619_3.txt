Basically there is a family where a little boy (Jake) thinks there is a zombie in his room and his parents are fighting all the time. <br /> <br /> This movie is slower than a soap opera ... and suddenly, Jake decides to be Rambo and kill a zombie. Well, first time when you do a movie you must decide if it's a thriller or drama! As a movie celebration available. Parents come out and fight like in real life. And then we have Jake and his closet that destroys all the film! I expected to see the same movie of BOOGEYMAN, and instead I saw a spectacular and unpopular advertising. Only 3 out of 10 for parental discussions and natural orders. As for the shots and Jake: just ignored.
