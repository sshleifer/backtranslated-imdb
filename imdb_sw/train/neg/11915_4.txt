This open attempt for a non-recreated TV series shows a young Canadian executive Shiri Appleby as an amnesiac with some mysterious powers that should be used during a man-turned demon-driven world. CGI is par for work on TV, and Appleby is the same as amnesiac but hard swallow as superheroine. The face of the well-known television Richard Burgi includes a journey as an adviser to Appleby, but can not do anything to lift this higher on the medium level. We see many ways of photographing shadows from the beginning, a bad sign. Also, events where Burgi teaches Appleby for war is really laughable. They are the worst copies of such events in several other movies, especially REMO WILLIAMS.
