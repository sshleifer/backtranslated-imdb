This movie shows Ruth as a drink, a hard drink, gambling, lots of enough games and baseball hit in. The early life was very surprising and this was because of all the purposes left in this film. Also, Lou Gehrig was not clearly covered and this was a good, bad or improper relationship, would have been covered better than it was. His life was worse than all of them. He was a US hero, an icon that a lot of baseball greats made their lives after. I feel that I am entitled to the memory of a great baseball player that this film is completely ignored. The shock of the creators of this film based on its errors and not its greatness.
