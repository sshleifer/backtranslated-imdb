I have had evidence that confirmed my suspicions. A group of children, 14 to 22 to set the DVD of "Titanic" on a fantastic state of mega screen home entertainment type deal. Only two had seen it before. But all had seen the time of Kate, Leo and Celine Dion many times that many felt that they had seen the whole movie. Shortly after the epic started, they started to get worried, some of them stopped asking others - "call us when the ice looks" More than an hour and a half on the cinema, two girls who had seen the movie before, were still there. They started shouting: ice, ice. The shock was followed, all returned to see the sinking of Titanic. They stayed mouthed open, giving Ohs and out. So, as I thought when the movie first bursted into the area. What is this? One and a half hours waiting for something to bleed but what about all the rest. Dr. Zivagho, for example, had the same time, but consider how much is happening in the film during that time period. In "Titanic" Today teaches Kate how to spit. Look at the faces and hands, namely, creme de la creme in the first dining room of the ship. See historical details, if you can find them. The story of the story is very thin so they can set up a gun and shoot at a ship that is about to sink. The actual sink here is the standard of the film. All efforts focus on special effects and weekends. The film continued to be the most stimulating film of all time, what do I know?
