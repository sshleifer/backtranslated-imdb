I run the team to stop the addiction and I just spent the last 2 months to hear the scared stories from comedians who tried to play for, "Comic End Standing." If they do not have a GOOD agent, then they do not get an inspection of more than 80 percent of voters who turn out to be denied before they can show anyone having talent! If you do this by checking, I was told that it was "installed before" if they have a second chance. So the television audience is not the best in the United States. If the community does this on the show, then most of them do not receive IMD credits. I know this because I made credit for the entire 6th season, "Last Comic Standing" and I have not paid for working Manufacturers. In fact it's a shame. Last month, I asked, "Last Comic Stand 7" on Facebook why Manufacturers don't get IMD credits and I'm blocked from the Facebook page! I am not a player and not personalized in this. I just want people to know the truth. I don't like to see anyone getting wrong and that's why I've helped comedians. Fighters are getting wrong on HBO, BET, TvOne and other cable networks but NBC is a third-party BIG network so that those with payments should see themselves by allowing this exploitation to happen. <br /> <br /> Please check this video player who was attacked: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMb4-hyet_Y
