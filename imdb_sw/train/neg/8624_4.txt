Acting was not good, the story was full of simple turns and transparent characters. It is about the outcome of the struggle between the right fighters of Flemish voters and one of the Moroccans living in the Antwerp city of Belgium. What is the political analysis? What? Is the Belgian West Side Story or modern Romao and Juliet? The film cannot answer two questions (assuming those were the director's questions, too). However, some events can work as Ken Loach's film, set by Antwerp. After all, this city has been the first step of the right wing wing of the Flemish Block party and is experiencing many problems and tensions between people and different cultures. It is very difficult to make a film about this situation, and this failed, unfortunately. However, it tells stories about the reality and hardness in modern Belgium. A few foreign audiences should watch and enjoy and realize not a real film that is important but dividing lines that hate Belgium, 10 million countries, in 2000 years / Don /
