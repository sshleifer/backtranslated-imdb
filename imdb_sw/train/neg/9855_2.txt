Let's start by saying I'm a great fan of fantasy. However, this film is not for me. Most of the emerging discussions try to support the claim of this film which the potential dragons might exist. The film talks about relationships in different stories from different countries, but it does not explore them more, which can give them a film honesty. Film uses (good!) CGI tell us the story of story stories about the life of the little dragon. This is included with flash-popular TV-show-CSI-popular displays to make it look like a scientific object, which is certainly not. Most often the arguments / symptoms are deleted. In some cases, the symptoms used to show dragons as possible, or have sprouted, or the fire is just invalid. To see this makes me just get sand on my fingers. Even the fantasy film requires a certain degree of truth in it, but this one just does not. Below: it's a fantasy-CSI document, inappropriate to view.
