This movie is a Ramones festival of 90 minutes and short periods of ignorance and great weight. What kind of secondary school is however? If you are a great fan of Ramones, don't have to repeat your time as I did. This is quite unknown from beginning to end. This movie should be called Ramone Fever. Everyone looks like them in this film. No plot found in this flick. In addition to the young people go, you are looking down the barrel with this.
