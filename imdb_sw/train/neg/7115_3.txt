Okay, so the introduction, and its hokey delivery of free hats for anyone who dies in panic during the film, is very lame. And so the first "skull" is taken and the state of emphasis is amazing. The real mark of the movie is the amount of respect, there is at least a bit of real food ideas in the character of the characters, and the plot of the plot is honorable if it goes horrible. Acting is moderate, not very bad. Overall, this film does not fall completely through the 1/10 film. Not enough to get a low rating or even less down. If I just read the screens, I would say this is likely to be a good movie. It's just that the direction and production breaks the film damage. So it's a bad movie, but there's the worst things out there.
