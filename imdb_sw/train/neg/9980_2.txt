Don't waste 90 minutes of your time on "Fast Food, Fast Women." It is an annoyingly episodic script and three-story lines linked together are bad because of predictable writing, acting awesome, and even bad music. I have seen the main character of anorexic stopping every time he was a screen. She needs fast food. Use the 90 minutes you give to this turkey doing something more exciting ... if you cut your fingers. You would like to have more valuable entertainment. The only thing to redeem on this film is Louise Lasser, but it deserves more than this fatigue script. It doesn't have the capacity as an old man doing court in the film. <br /> <br /> VIEWER BEWARE!
