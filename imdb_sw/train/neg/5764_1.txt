Modern Movie 3 is a stinkfest hard to put it in words. It makes movies like Malibu's Wanted looks like Oscar equipment, it just says. The horrible scary movie was very good, one of the best 90s spoof movies, emerging from a great team that had fallen before us a world that would not be dangerous to Central Middle while drinking your juice in Hood. But what happened in hell? After the tragedy of Modern 2, I thought the changes made by the staff can help matters, but they were worse. <br/> In the past 20 minutes I would like to double it. Not one laughter, joke was restored and nature was obviously no reason. The fact that at this time in writing, many people on this site voted 10/10 made me feel sick. While there are great flicks like the School of Outdoor Rock, which actually has a joke which is a * slow * funny, anyone will lose their money on tripe as this requires their head to explore. <br /> <br /> no star / ****
