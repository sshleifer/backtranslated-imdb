Let's say, romantic comedies are considered to be lighter compared to big movies (just look at the Academy Award selection each year). But still, those who are good are the art form. See "When Harry Met Sally", "Asingizi In Seattle", and scholars like "Holiday Holiday" and "It took One Night". I would like to feel good to see two people who are expected to find happiness. This game is trying to create something that resembles a romantic comedy. But no one believes the love among the main characters, and there is nothing surprising to make such a huge deficit. Modine is an old way to become a leading man - especially romantic leadership. I am sure if the Executive Producer, had a way - but not a good sense - devoted yourself. And Gershon ... I see the possibility of certain comedic talent, but it didn't have a script with odds development. And their idea is English? They said it. Some have told it, but I want to repeat: this story is unacceptable, not well; artists are widely sent; and the characters, well, we can't give an impression on them. This type of art is not. Go hire "Moonstruck" again.
