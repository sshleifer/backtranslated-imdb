I was not a 2005 fan of the hit "Hostel", and many of those who hit the ass are just bad or bad - however "Live Feed" has managed to put me somewhat about 30 first minutes. It started with many aspects of sex and good surroundings, followed by good deaths related to the China Crimes Group organized by the foot of the foot, which had a skin ... What did you do out of the movie was a 'hard hero' with a gun and The violence will save the day ... I will call this modern phone, the best, since the foundation mainly involving young people to be slaughtered in the seedy porn theater, twice as hiding the mafia, is pleasing to me. If only torture was a long time to be effective, then my rating would be very different. Unfortunately, a lot of brutality is used together in one place, leaving the entire movie to complete as a state of revenge. Therefore, basically, it is only a budget under the "Hostel" spilled with the use of free sex liberation, almost constant during the first half of the film ... In general, I would like to say not to worry about this.
