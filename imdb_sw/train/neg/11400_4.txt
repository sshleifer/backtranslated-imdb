The planning is confused by the jumbo-jumbo who wants to be difficult to be so bad that even Bruce Campbell's records several times. The problem is, not just in one league as a bad movie. This movie is not close to the original. The plan has been used before, and Kevin Tenney on the Day of the denomination, and that was more fun. This flick takes a lot of time and hard displays before getting kids in a spooky house and starting demon events. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <3 /> <br /> Brad Dourif is, as usual, was not given much to do here, but while screening sets in another high-top performance that would make Christopher Walken jealous. For children acting, it is possible but not well. The function of the shaky camera is more contemptible than clever or sky. There is a good time when the first boy gets and throws him around other deadly organs while sending his victims, but he was not afraid of the second. The level of the gore is in the middle to the bottom, but the director tries to do it by showing it to non-regular partners. All in all, just the same if you have 87 minutes to lose.
