I have been able to find Marilyn Miller's films because they are not displayed on the TCM in the UK. , but not for Miller.The play seems to be too tough and too soft, to play a bit to it and if the actor makes Ruby Keeler look like Hepburn. So much worse in this film as the public was tired of music, almost all music numbers were deleted . So we are left with the comedy of that period without a real appeal. He was paid $ 500,000 for this! So I have only two conclusions. Perhaps he was abused by the movie or had no talent at all. I think the fact is closer than the former.
