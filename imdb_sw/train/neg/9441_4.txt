Was this film banned in England? why? tom savini, george romero, dario argento, lucio fulci and others had done worse before and have continued so since ... <br /> <br /> This movie has all the basic elements of a good 70s or early 80 horror film. The beautiful girls (who cannot act to save their lives, by the way), a severe electrical storm and rainy rain, scythe, a male brother walking near the family property, and in fact it is good to lose the end. but banned? for weight. when the English parliament banned the film, the callers laughed their donkeys on the back and ignored the same as it was / was it possible for two minutes of the total screen time that emerged in violence and the year (which was very low) . there were weaknesses but no sex though sex was made, clearly. but nothing deserves to be banned. I would like to see what can be done if the film designers have a good budget to work with. as it stands, the film is entertaining, but the lack of image and sound quality removes the final result. <br /> <br /> banned ... what joke ...
