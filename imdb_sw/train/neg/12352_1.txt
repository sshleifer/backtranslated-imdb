How to get this 6-star movie is over me. Script is so banal, and in fact it's insulting to those whose life is based on it. The movie comes directly from the world of advertising, and talented Ridley Scott should be shy. Demi Moore, however, does not surprise you to participate in this film, if someone looks at its track list. All for all, the film "style" style that even Don Simpson shy.
