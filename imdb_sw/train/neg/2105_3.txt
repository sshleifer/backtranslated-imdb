Bela Lugosi as an ignorant insane scientist who uses orchids for woo grandmothers to steal female life for an old wife. Midget in this film is hilarious! Much of the freaks, with a lot of padding and no plot makes watching this dream dream. I liked all the pieces fell together at the end of the usual Hollywood style. The story doesn't get interesting, and it feels powerless when you look. Normally I would like a logo produces a flicks like this below, but the midget added enough moisture and fun to get more than a few points.
