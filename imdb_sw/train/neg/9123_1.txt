I don't have much to say about this film. It is possible to be a wonderful-of-powerful visit to Peter Sellers, but it is one of the worst pain in the history of the film. That was the last movie of Sellers makes it more painful. <br /> <br /> The worst screenplay, trends and horrible displays of all wood come to dreadfully together to make this one of the most unlikely movies to make. <Br /> <br /> I would like very much that I could get even a snicker or chuckle buried somewhere in this bunch of putrid blubber, but it's a disaster, no humorless. The truth hurts. Peter, why can't you stop for GET?
