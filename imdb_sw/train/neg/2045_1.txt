This film must be the worst movie I saw. My sister and her boyfriend went to rent Zodiac (2007) and they found this by accident. thought it was a joke before the real movie. this was horrible I was waiting for fear and has never been done. This movie had no real truth about the true Zodiac killer. The film traders did not even insist on anything about killing ... they just wanted the name ... so they decided to write a script about anything really in its name. I am sorry I did not realize that it was not early in the film. I'm trying to love something out of every movie, I don't like movies ... forever ... except this. If you could give them no stars, I would be. 1 out of 10.
