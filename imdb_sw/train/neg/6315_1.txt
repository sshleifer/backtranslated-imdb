This black film, the sexy is a must-see. Only on many views can someone understand the unique truth of this film. Personally I enjoy the author with his mind, no subject left untouched, story style. Introduction reminds you immediately, and puts you on the edge of your seat in all the films. He gives great insight into the world of training and allows the audience to 'unite' with the inner fear of this film show. The script itself holds the movie together with amazing. Not only for children, but adults will understand more about the training and modern knowledge that they have gender experience. Before its time and spread in the movie, it definitely defines the term 'hub'.
