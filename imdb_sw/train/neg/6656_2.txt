This gets two because I loved it as a child, but it became so great that I started to hate itâ€¦ I can't give this meaningful review because it would restore one thing after another, I probably wouldn't say anything that everyone didn't say ready. The only thing about this show is that it is very good, and a child boiled that deviated child with the stupidity around it and over it. I have a cousin who loves to show this and she is a very angry and sad person I met. This version should be dragged from the air. It's always the same thing regularly ... They need to put the best displays on Nick. I get very tired of such things.
