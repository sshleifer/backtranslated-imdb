The family migrating to their daughter's football league decides to take the 'best way' and end up in the middle of anywhere. The father is a bright photographer, and when he hears on the old abandoned rejection of the city, he decides to take another investigation to take a picture. <br /> <br /> Of course, the side show is filled with inbred freaks, which lets them kidnap women immediately and leave the little child and father defending themselves. The only cool thing about this film is how the family really fights back against domestic captors. Other than that, there is nothing appropriate about the film.
