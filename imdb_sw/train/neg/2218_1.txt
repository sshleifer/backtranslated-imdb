I agree that my opinion is from 2006, about 30 years after making this film and during her pregnancy, it may be a terrible / exciting movie. From the night of Halloween in 1968, 6-year-old Michael is committing the brutal murder of his 18-year-old sister. Michael has been involved with a mental institution 15 years later and runs back to home to kill him again. From this point it is clear that the film will follow the basic and destructive path that is predictable. The beginning of each area is easy to predict in a way that will end when music for every area in which Michael (the killer) is very similar in the movie, thus showing the viewer to events that can follow. It is / are / is not a great amount of blood / gore compared to modern films though it is not the same as it is shown in this day and age. A fun member can be found. From half an hour to the film, not one area that is not expected. Acting for an awesome / exciting film is the most common era and therefore there is no punch for the modern day of enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> Good for the film is its shots of ongoing cameras and dark lights that make awesome atmosphere. The second positive will be the behavior of Michael's doctor, who gives symptoms for the possibility of a story that can cause. It is clear, however, that the stars, in Jamie-Lee Curtis, are at the stage of the pregnancy of their work and so they cannot give the true victim the real. It is difficult for me to test this film as it was in its day, but due to other fearful films of 80s and at least, 90 years, it dies in a short time with the film awesome / awesome. <br /> <br /> I recommend you continue to get classic from 80 years.
