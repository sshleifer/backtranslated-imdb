This film had a promise! What a great idea, a pale colored team of color struggling to identify and personal glory, only to lose its speed due to bad dialoge, bad editing and half-written stories. The characters in the beginning were interesting, just losing steam half way through that one dimensional sputtering out liner fatigue-liners <br /> <br /> Maybe if you spent more time on the story and the dialoge would have been a great movie, instead of The efforts to close after learning.
