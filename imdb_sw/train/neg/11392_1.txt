For years I've remembered reading about this show "Trouble With Tracy" in the TV Guide. CFTO-TV Toronto every morning Saturday at 6 am! I lived about two hours south in Toronto and we could not get CFTO, but you know how it is - we want everything that we cannot have. Well, I knew what he wanted and what I wanted to see what "tracy trouble" this was about. Was a beautiful girl in the role of star? What? Are there weaknesses? What? Are there any doubts? Was it a comedy? It would be nice if there was a promotional show. At least I could have been known as lost. But, NO! The secret deployed him, until CVCO cooperated with the CTV created a radio provider in Wiarton, Ontario and began to announce "Trouble With Tracy" at the same time as CFTO .... Saturday morning at 6am !! One Saturday morning I woke up and returned to the TV at 5:59 and finally noticed what the "tracy problem" was. Yes, "a tracy problem" was a Canadian content and stuck in innocent 6 is a place where no one could see how bad it was. but the most would say that he "died" was first seen on this show. When I saw it for the first time on Saturday morning and fell back in my bed, my part also died, too.
