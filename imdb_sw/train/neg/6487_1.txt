So thank SO many of the Disney for combining fun memories that I had to have with my first favorite movie. I was about 5 years old when the original film came out, and it was one of the first movies I remember seeing. So, now that I am 16 years old, with enough feeling, I have decided to rent this movie. So, I was able to offend all my original movie and this excuse for the film. This movie takes everything that made the original love and wiped it, to the bottom of the last description. <br /> <br /> In this film, Ariel and Eric celebrate the birth of their daughter, Melody, and go to show everyone in the sea ... BROADWAY STYLE! After the music number ended, within minutes, the marine magician Morgana shows and threatens to kill Melody if Triton does not give the trident. So, he offers without even fighting. Eric stands there gaping, although Ariel explains how to use the sword and save Melody. Morgana has fled, so Ariel and Eric decide that Melody should not go near the sea until Morgana comes. It is worth ... uh, no information to happen. Eric is a total wuss. He never can do anything. Ariel sort of something. Melody can delete the top items. More, animation is a step down to Disney. Computer graphics have wind and nature. Then one position of character development is passed. Songs are lying. See, don't waste your time. I am sure even young children will be bored out of their skull and this, for nothing is even more exciting. They don't want to sing songs. If you manage to grab a copy of this, throw it out of the sea and hope that no one has ever found it. Forever.
