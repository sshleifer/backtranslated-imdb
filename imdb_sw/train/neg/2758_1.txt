I offer this film for 1 because there is no negative number in the IMD rating system. This movie was bad. It was done very well, the story was not well written, the action was impossible. I insist that the Salvation Army is waging war as badly as it did in the film. I can't even write a trader of the plot because the movie just isn't enough for the plot destroyers. Write comments on the plot without being meaningful. If I had to compare this film, I would like to compare it to the Fire Leader, even though I didn't have a Fire Leader either, the movie was even better than this. Some people in the theater left before the movie had been done. The only reason I was not because I didn't just think to do it. I was hoping for a CGI feast and fighting for knowledge, but it didn't happen. Military arts lasted 30 seconds and that was from practice exercises that took place during a reverse, extremely disappointing situation. CGI has not done well either. One part comes to mind. In one of the previous fighting battles, the soldiers run away ...... without anything. One forgot to rub the young animation in a small part of the film so the road had no bad people. I also think the voices of the bad man was called by the high voice of Imotep from Mummy movies. It had the object to reject the model going on. (Someone should pay the debt, here?) Since I mentioned the fighting area, I will say yeah that can be considered to be a spoiler, but only for monitors I think. Don't go see it, don't buy a DVD when it comes out or. You have been warned.
