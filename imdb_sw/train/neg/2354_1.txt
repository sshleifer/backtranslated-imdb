I don't want to even photograph this film - it's a movie that should not win any prize. Acting was terrible as well as silly events. This is a type of film that many people think they serve NRI viewers but actually have lost out of the country for its stability and a great feeling of "trying" in all movies. I think it is strange that many of the speakers who speak English have a hard time doing it by appealing to the camera. I am sure many readers know what I'm talking about - all English words of the sign made on film, in Hindi and in regional movies for cool points. There are a few Indian movies that English looks quite real - Because Cyrus was one of the most recent. Although not a great film, it was a good film and language was not found "wear". I feel embarrassed that P3 was awarded the NFA in 2005. The only interesting parts of the trash were Konkana and a spectacular natural color. Other than that, don't waste your time with this film.
