Who can want a popular film Bert I. Gordon "Mad Food"? No, of course, but the director Damien Lee thought it was a good idea, however, and put together a rough column that stands as one of many more movies in a terrible history. "Gnaw" is a sequel by name alone, as the environment has moved to the late 80th place (university) and also the cheap and favorable effects are fully reflected in 80 years. This script depends on the clich√©s, written written for damage and plot conditions which do not listen significantly from other shocking groups (and more successful). Neil Hamilton is a good shoe scientist who makes experiments with a common mouse to make a fellow scientist. As a result of the extravagant animal rights activists, big and rough mice run away and destroy everyone in the campus. To follow the ancient tradition of which the Spielberg "Jaws" started, there is a terrifying Pastor who refuses to accept the problem though the corpse of the corpse is everywhere. During a delightful coup to hysterically, the mouse invades the opening ceremony of the new game of college game! "Gnaw: The Food of Gods 2" is very bad and therefore it's so fun to watch! The actors make and say stupid things (like dropping into the sewer without the weapon when they know it has a mouse), the act is angry and there is an amazing sequence involving a sexually active hero under the influence of serum growth! I wonder what the Freud theory would be on that! There is a reasonable amount of gore and sleaze with ?? should be said? The music is fantastic atmosphere. If you can't get enough for this junk, there are many organisms created by mutated mice, like the shadow of Italy's "Mouse: The Night of Terror", a typical worship of 70 "Willard" and "Ben", a year 2003 "Willard" gave the star Crispin Glover and the most recent star stars and directors of the once famous Tibor Ticaks ("mouse") and John Lafia ("Rats").
