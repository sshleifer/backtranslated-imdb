This film comes as the ultimate desire in Tsai Ming-Liang for me. It promotes laziness from each frame. So I can't fully analyze. But some observations: <br /> <br /> 1. If the premise is drought, why do we see the city's theme and green trees? I wonder if that was meant to mean something in the context of the film (which thirst confirms the desire for friendship, and alternative alternative, sex). Or it is simply a matter of decision-making films, not to give the impression about being consistent. We do not know what happened to a porn actress, why he has no consciousness or, perhaps, has died. It seems a question of any importance as long as the message of absolute abandonment is achieved (= bombastically) release, but in the past, its inert body reflects that it is an underground violence, an excuse as free and use as an activity used. Nothing is shown in this film that Antonioni had not mentioned over 40 years ago? and without humiliating its executives without unnecessary. The number of music (revised from 'The Hole') felt like the idea of ​​a high school anti-painting, conducted by the same secondary skills. If so, it did.
