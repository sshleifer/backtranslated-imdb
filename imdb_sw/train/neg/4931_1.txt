At this time we find a manufacturer of a psychological toy called "Joe Petto" (find?) Who makes life, evil evil that will kill people. She follows a family that has unfortunate to live only in one house where she and her baby's robot "Pino" (again, get?) Used to live. (and with hope [perhaps] last) in this half-series, this and the original one looks like primary sex movies, but without sex and dirt. It's kind of a combination of low tax "Halloween III", "Pastor Teacher", "Dolls" and bad home movies. Usually in 2000 they began to make the sixth chapter in a row, but it was left and never completed. We can only hope that it stays that way ... <br /> <br /> 1/2 star ****
