Pictures of Mann The Rocky Mountains of Alberta in a beautiful style, and Jimmy Stewart and Walter Brennan provide an enjoyable exhibition as they always appear. But come to Hollywood - Mountie telling people of Dawson City, Yukon to build a marshal (yes marshal!) And enforce the rules themselves, then fighters fighters on the road for controlling the city? Nothing is similar to what happened to Canada's border until the gold rush of Klondike. Mr. Mann and the company seem to have missed Dawson City for Deadwood, Northern Canada for North America. Canadian audiences be ready for the kind of madness of Reefer's fun to enjoy this amazing plot, or, shake your head with dirt.
