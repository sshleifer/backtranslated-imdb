The lowest possible score is one star? that's a shame. in fact, I will go to IMDb for the option of "star zero". give this film even one star offers WAY much. What? I was the only one who saw the microphone dropped on the head of the hopper on the station? and acting, or should I say his absence? apparently not talent when the director of the throw came to the city. My sister's sister's primary school sister gives more and more depth of feeling. and the fake smell was like nails on the chalk board. The only thing that could make this movie worse would ... oh, wait, no, no, it's already as bad as it can get.
