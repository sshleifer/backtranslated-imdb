I lost this film because it seemed very interesting but for my Horror this movie was the worst movie I ever seen! I read the comments from Gumby-8 and needed to be part of the cast or staff. Except Gumby-8 is a 4-year-old child or another member of religious religion no one in their good minds thinks that this film has any potential. I couldn't believe Gumby-8 views. Quote: "From the" Dune "revealed the opening of the animation fast speed ... this film continues to move the eyes and it works very well that repeating it is not unexpected." Animation is the only feature of an interesting movie and the fact that the film continues to keep an eye on, well because you are looking for any type of charge. I mean giving me a Halloween break shot by a budget of $ 100,000.00 and a mask they have built and in that way became a cult. In addition to "repeating view is not unexpected" I think it made a typo. Another quote from Gumby-8 Fan only: "Acting is also a powerful feature of the film." <Br /> <br /> With all respect to the executives, their performance is not more than the applicable talent of Robert Napton. <br /> <br /> Tagline Interesting: "Watch out the clock between the evening and the dark" <br /> <br /> That is because there is no evening or darkness in this film. The rating is "R rated for abuse / gore" The only one you saw was the color of the red color on the dead body. As far as I knew it could be part of the leaves. In the summary, I found the fear comes from 50, 60 and 70 years. I've seen what I thought was the worst and few that was very good. The director of this film is trying to make any attempt, lying, or took a hit of acid. Anything that I think executives deserve to cry out trying to try a good job salon. I would like to give this film a color .5 for the movie 'B'.
