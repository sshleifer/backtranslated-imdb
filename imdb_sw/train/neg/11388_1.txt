This story is about a romantic triangle between the nth. African male pastor, female French pastor (Stephanie) and a Russian minister who does not speak French and never seem to have shaving. <br /> <br /> If the film is lighter, dreary and depressed, it is shot on foggy, overcast winter or inside the inside, where everyone bursts into a blue light. And yes, I know, it's because the white balance was out. Everyone is colored and decreases and looks haggard, shabby and dirty. The bodies are bony and shot around and it seems to be bad and inappropriate. Plants, hair fat. Yuk. The bad news in movies where people spend too much time or sex or sex. <br /> <br /> And the story? Yes, Stephanie's mother is dying. All three actors return to Stephanie's village where, in the shadow of the mountainous hills and inland interior, we see little Stephanie as a young man named Pierre. Mother dies. Well ... and that's about it, in fact. Definition of behavior is taken to a minimum, such as the story of the story. I think the storyline is not a line (it would mean a lot of non-sequiteurs) but, in fact, after paying my seven euro I don't feel like I should create a movie myself: that's what the director takes my money. Expecting me to join the process of telling stories and getting my dirty hands, to say, is asking a very much way. This film is a painful trash made of the top, all over, and the passion of epater les bourgeois (ie, straights of straights). I can see how it was a shoo-in for the Berlin film festival, and I can see why it didn't.
