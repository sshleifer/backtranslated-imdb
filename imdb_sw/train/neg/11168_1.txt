- The Mexican priest becomes a wrestler to save orphans or something - <br /> <br /> I went to see this film because it was about WWF wars and so I thought it could be funny. It was not. It is advisable to check. Forcing. Every opportunity to shout is to be destroyed without mercy. I agree I don't like Black Jack anyway. After this I have been criticizing my brain thinking of one good role he has made. The only thing I can come to is where he was. it was like an important foil for the character of John Cusack in the 'Great Honesty'. Jack Black is one of these abnormal boys who can't walk (such as a little fat in Abbot & Costello or Jerry Lewis) who should be told that having a strange voice is not the same as being funny. It is not even a string. It's just angry. It's not even stopping, it's just stupid. I heard good things about Napoleon Dynamite too, but if this is something to go and I will never have the speed to get it on DVD.
