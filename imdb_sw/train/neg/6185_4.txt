My first revision of 2010 is "Inside Blue 2: Crocodile". The story is about two people who played with Chris Carmack and Laura Vandervoort who would like to explore the hidden treasures under the inner rock. One day after exploring the couple faced by David Anders and Marsha Thomason. They tell young people that they want to hire them to explore the rock and find a rare artifact on Columbus' hidden treasure that is reported under the rock. <br /> <br /> The next four day dive to the bottom of the rock and coarse after the whole day of diving do not have anything. A few days ago and two hired men discovered that they were part of a major deadly plot that they could not escape otherwise they would be killed. They were employed to get two big bonds. One has a nuclear reactor and the other has a base. <br /> <br /> The movie also has stories back on someone else (brother of leading behavior) trying to try patching things with his partner, I see this part of the story was a waste of time, this also includes a steam area among the couples to me is complete and not required to be displayed. <br /> <br /> However, this is far from this movie has beautiful underwater pictures and colors combines well and why it gets 4 stars. No original characters or return characters, has a dumb program, stupid and peak characters.
