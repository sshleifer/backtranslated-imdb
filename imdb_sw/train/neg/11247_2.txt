This movie was a way over-hyped. Many viewers, who thought this was "amazing" should have been on the old school movies, leading to the entire movie installed back. At first I thought the movie was just showing something from the past, so I was expecting that faded dreamy like lights on passing characters, but it's just going. Basically this was a movie trying to combine the past and the past, and 2 is not very well connected to this film, even with special effects. You can actually see the blue screen executives were working with. There are many movies out there that actually make this film, so there is no reason for critics to make this film saying "it's the biggest movie to be done". It's just decorate the stick. It also did not help that the story line was sooo crappy. I don't understand why Hollywood acknowledged that this film was produced, and I also do not understand how actors / filmmakers like to be in this film. It's almost like everyone reads the script and forgot to read a good copy ... "All will be done on the computer". This was a film that would have been on the film, because nothing about this film was a revolutionary. I am very proud of myself to pay money to see this. Whatever you do, do not waste your time and money on this film today or tomorrow.
