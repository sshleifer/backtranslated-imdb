For science to fear the movie to work properly it must be either original or very good vote. This movie is not. Certainly there is a pseudo-original twist in that one kills people because of toxins and not because of the disease, but that is a very small twist. There is a plot of the government's plot, the protagonist of the crusader who has personal experience ... And one of the real drawings of this film is that the person with dirt has no pathos. Although the character is written that a person should be shown mercy, he is not. Without sad movie is useless. Other characters are cutter of cookies they are ignorant. Subplots are caused by anger. And the sad thing is the movie is very flat and even enjoy it as a shock material. Make a short film 45 minutes and may be worth watching.
