None of the characters appear, special effects are hilarious (but not funny). The story is a dragon (very bad). No logic for what is happening. I felt that the creators of the film tried some kind of "tomato attack" kind of thing. Particularly in the area where all important people were talking about national security in some kind of closet ...
