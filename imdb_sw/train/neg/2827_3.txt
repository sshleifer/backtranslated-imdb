The story was originally interesting: slavery in (late) 20th century from West Africa to the Middle East Arab. The problem is that it deliberately destroys two famous enemies of Richard Fleisher: Arabs and Germans. In order to convince us that the most prominent Arab men can have the freedom to move around and be easily infected by the West in West Africa, as the Europeans want slaves in "Root". Both businesses are / are operated by locals and include (d) more modern networks. While Arab countries are the same in today's business and slave slavery, Israel is one of the worst violators of Amnesty International. Why only show Arabs and then choose Germany as a buyer of Europe only? It is obvious to the love and hatred of those people and the Jewish director. The task is on average, especially by Peter Ustinov (Suleiman) and Kabir Bedi (Malik). Michael Caine (Dr. Linderby) is as good as always.
