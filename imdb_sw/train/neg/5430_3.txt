Priyadarshan - everyone heard his name, his first thought would be 'comedy'. That's what this man is known for, or rather, he was known for. After giving the comedies of blockbuster restrictions like Hungama, Hera Pheri and Hunchul, his train slowed down with movies like Chupke Chupke and a few others whose names I can't remember at the moment. Now for films such as Dhol, the first word that would have our feelings after hearing his name would have been 'persecuted'. Dhol is a mixture of joke, unwanted, unwanted, the amount of game, poor doubts and preferences. The only good thing about Dhol was one or two of the events that were to play, though not of magic, and secondly, except for Kunal Khemu and a hysterical grandmother, acting it was good. Speaking of the acting, I felt that Rajpal Yadav and Sharman Joshi were on top (if you compare them to others in the movie), then came to Tusshar Kapoor, then Tanushree and the last two idiots mentioned above. Kunal's khem was that he had a great voice in his joke and even in his work. Mrs., first time resembled the spirit, with her not quite happy but not bad. The plan was the same, it appeared before one. Four boys behind the girls and they need money, but with a slight decrease. There is a 'bad' person who is stupid and ignorant. And lastly, good success on evil and everything is good. The idea of ​​having Dhol in full voice of money is not magic. The worst thing about the film is its length. After an hour or so, you are faced with want to leave the theater. But being a critic, it is my responsibility to endure all the hours and half of the movie. This movie continues to continue and the type of joke is repeated again and the situation is only forever a different place. If your mother-in-law has gone to your home and started to ridicule you for everything, then take her to this film and have fun. 3 out of 10.
