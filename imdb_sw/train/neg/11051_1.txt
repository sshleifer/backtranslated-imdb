The scary D-list of Canadian actors who feel very much about their reality on the camera that their performances are very interesting and completely forgotten. <br /> <br /> This movie has been written badly, misused, and misused. Included, incomprehensible and strange - but not in a good way. McDowell does a good job with what he was given, but it's alone in this film to do it - he has a really bad story with the script to work with. It's not even enough camping to be funny. I've never seen Van Pelleske act in a credible way, and even lower characters like Eisen (with his nose, white) confirms that we are much in Toronto instead of Africa. Does the director not see that the 'creature' looks like a jazz dancing in a guest suit? Fights between blue and lightning of Pelleske's 'magic'! Is there even a director on placing or in the filing room of this disaster (not a good type)? <br /> <br /> Learn from the mistakes of others ... don't even waste your time with this, you'll regret if I did it. I have nothing more to say about this celluloid waste.
