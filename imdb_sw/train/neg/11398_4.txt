I saw this movie especially seeing Brooke Burke (like Jill), who met briefly in LA in a business show example, in her first film film. I was hoping to see him more, but I think he had done a very good job. Since he is a good host and powerful television, and an example, it was not surprising. I was left wondering why he was killed, and what happened as a result. Maybe I missed it. I was not sure about this type of film, and although I loved the participants I heard as it was for college audience. I tried to keep my mind focused on fear not my favorite music, but I felt like I had had weeds. It seemed to go down somewhere, to stop thinking in some places about what the bad professor had, and, like many films had the wrong end. After writing several documents, I know many of these are difficult and can think of personal opinion, how many movies you have seen & learned, and those you share at the same time. In short, I saw it interesting, but not a satisfactory plot and ending. If Jill (Brooke Burke) could return through the harbor at the end and choose the ass everyone would be a satisfactory end and would get a high level.
