The story told of the expected divorce - or is it? - with the eyes of a 6-year-old child. Corny talks, paperwork characters, stock status, red zombie celebration and, most of all, have no advantage, either emotionally or faster. Doesn't anyone teach you to write creativity again? The true sign of the weak journalist - when you can't create any kind of denouement satisfactory - just close the story. I have to ask, "What made you think this was a great story to tell you first?" Good, but lost, beginning with baby actor Anthony De Marco - all others were lost, better, forget. And they wonder why no one is watching indie movies! This is ninety minutes of my life I will never come back.
