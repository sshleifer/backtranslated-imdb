It came to watch this film waiting for the 'nothing' thing is coming, still very desperate. The opening part pledged small steps and the tinge of the comedy. It lets you talk for the first half of the coz until you expect it to be now in the entry point. Yes, nothing of that sort happens. The movie comes with the end ending only up to the point that you get angry. It didn't make any sense. That movie was not in all spheres, it had no real story and it seemed to be clear, even if "Rambo" was in it, I don't think she could be helped quite. No logic only for the movie. The perfect way to waste your time and money. By far the most offensive movie I have ever seen and I'm sure there will be others who will have the same opinion after they have endured. Certainly not for people who have a little sense of film left in them.
