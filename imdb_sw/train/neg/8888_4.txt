I was tested on a standard of 2, but the movie had a minimum of 4. This movie has just 4 from me, but it has 7.3 from over 600 people. <br /> <br /> This film is boring, because it has never stopped such rooms in that broken house. And it has only 5 people in this film. It is almost two hours long that is not quite suitable. Many discussions are slow and meaningful. Tons of film is also blue color which removes the look. Film can only be reduced to a few sentences. This film reminds me "three times" directed by Hou Hsiao hsien, that's similar to interesting, also interesting. It also has a high level! I had to stop checking it after the first story ended. This video has no preference or excitement.
