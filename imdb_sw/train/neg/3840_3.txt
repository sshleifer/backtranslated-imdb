I would like to hear about this film earlier from a friend and recently got it on DVD. There was a lot of excitement and excitement if we would all hear that this was a terrible, scary film. How did I get discouraged? VERY !!!! In addition to one event (we all know it's a little) nothing happened! I expected to see this black woman a few times and make him more scenes of jumpy, like appearing on a window or walking in the hall or something. <br /> <br /> Nearly all comments here say it is a horrible thing, that is, this film is. I just didn't see it. Perhaps there is a difference between people who get scared in the United States to go to England. Big / small / big after all of the hyped inspections:
