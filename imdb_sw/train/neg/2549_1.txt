my friend bought a film for 5? (not 1 cent of value), because they wrote it as an American pie. but we will soon know that there is a long way from the American pie to the crap. not even more comedy as a really bad document. not just the story is bad, the picture and the sound also follows. they put in alcohol, chicks, young and young young. and the result is a tragedy. if you see this film does not break, instead of using your money for something else, and better. if you are bothering yourself, then invite your friend / s, unless you really love and want to quit.
