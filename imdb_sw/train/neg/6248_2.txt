The most amazing thing happens when you talk about global warming: science comes out of the window and “faith” and “agreement” becomes the topic of discussion / talk <br /> It is because of the fact that I give a score of failure Al Gore version. <br /> <br /> Instead of promoting the intellectual discussion, he continued the debate on the "faith" level and "agreement". Of course, when you try to sell the world in the use of trillions of dollars to “stop warming” you may be in trouble telling the true science: we do not know how much of the current heat generated by humans. Maybe no one, maybe some of it, or maybe has taken over the next Ice Age and we got very fortunate not to boil the world. But the truth remains that we can't sun. We are asked to "believe" in the "agreement". Never remember that any scientist who is missing from "consensus" is ostracized. Never think that a scientific investigation is about lost in agreement. Einstein did not "believe" in agreement, nor Copernicus nor Galileo. So why are the worst concerns they put on those researchers who will develop the farm by asking difficult questions? If global warming is insignificant, few people are trying to have a theory not threatening. <br /> <br /> What's going on here? That is the film I had hoped for Al Gore. Istead, he chose to push his support with the "true believers" of the "agreement". <br /> <br /> Sorry, indeed.
