By far the worst movie of all time. Even Yaphet Kotto could not save this turkey. I have heard that the film was originally known as "Treasury" but it was changed to "Treasury" Shark "to take advantage of the excitement created by" Jaws ". I think the papa was in the same area of ​​this film; The fact that they happened to be included in this "fun" was supposed to sell tickets. It didn't work. At any time something "good" happens in the film, the crew of the ship passes to a certain type of beer that was established only when the movie was released. Gee, do you think that beer can be a sponsor? Could they put it more clearly? Just when anyone should break the beer is like they are doing this thing. That's the reason for the celebration.
