With Adam Sandler. This is definitely one of the most idiotic films made. It is about the ship's sailor Shecky (Sandler) who wants to be a player on the ship. First, there is no single line of funny or clever in the whole movie honestly. It is very clear is pathetic. There is surprising not so much dirt or sexual humor, but f-word is many. The budget is very low, and also damages the film. It happens on the ship's ship, but it seems that they had only money to rent a small boat and had money in excess of 10 ships, one of which is Billy Bob Thornton. Credit opening is animated reeeeeaally at affordable prices, and it's just pathetic. I hate this film and everyone else who sees this will also hate it. <br /> <br /> 86 mins. rated R in language.
