Movie had a good idea, but the only implementation did not live by it. <br /> <br /> What is this concept? Well, the wisdom of the story, is "dirty Harry" meets with "M". The killer of the child has started to threaten the city. The lead explorers (Dennis Hopper and Frederic Forest) have never been dealt with by an ordinary killer before. The mayor and the Police Police, in desperation, secretly hire a local group to speed up things ... go to places and do things that the police will not fail to stop this mess as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> Be fair, this film really has good things to offer. <br /> <br /> In addition to the concept, I have liked to look for the hiding of the killer. Norman Bates has his apartment. This boy has a sewer. In some shots, light draws water and creates reflection on the walls; often give these incredible cases of kind, like a dream. <br /> <br /> Acting was good too. Dennis Hopper is one of those participants who get the best and age. Going through it, however, more-or-less goes down. The film is followed by the fastest route. The actual diagnostic process from both teams feels very quickly opposed to strong and interesting feelings. This can be locked in two ways: either make the film again or cut some of the many programs. Perhaps this would enable the workers to give more time to the real mystery. For example of how bad this is, one of the most important indicators that help zero in just the right defender is this: one time in his life, the accused went to a pet shop ... That's true. I'm really bad here. It is as they came from an A (first note) to describe Z (the defendant) and jumping over all the "middle" steps. <br /> <br /> Then there are characters. I was the only one I loved was two bags to meet you about half the way through the movie. Given that they are small characters, I would call them a bad sign. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is an angle of people. This is the one that gets me more because this is why I went to $ 3 to buy a DVD at first. I mean, hook! There has been a massacre of deaths in the past 10-15 years. Angu's group was a gimmick that would have helped lift up the rest ..., but it didn't. I thought the gangsters' tactics would be brutal, but it's fun and exciting at the same time; The kind of movie of the vigilante or something ... maybe they could even give us other things of the heist film as well. We're talking about criminals, after all. Instead, we are given some of the most active members of the cell. Investigators question the witnesses. What? What do people do? They ask questions and kill them. Not as much as these witnesses are really bad. In fact I have seen the criminals more suitable than their killers. <br /> <br /> Unless the best points I have explained are enough to get your interest, I'd like to give him this miss. Maybe some day, they will re-use one idea of ​​the story and do the same. I hope so. I hate seeing such a good idea is lost.
