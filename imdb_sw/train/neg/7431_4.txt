USING IN MATRON was released in 1972 and it explains that the series has reached the end of nature and the best things like CLEO, UP KYBER and SCREAMING to be in the mid-60's to the end. and a thin plot (a spivs group trying to enter the hospital to steal the supply of contraceptive drugs that they are preparing to sell to third countries of the world) are surrounded by basically gags though not modern. I think there is a problem - Gags are not all that combines with a modern nature that begins to show its age. What? We need another movie that uses someone dressed as a woman to run a plot? Perhaps the worst strife I can do is that I have seen USING IN MATRON this afternoon, under the last twelve hours and I have trouble in trying to remember a wonderful line. That's a big problem for comedy
