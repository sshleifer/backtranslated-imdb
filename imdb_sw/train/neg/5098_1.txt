This should be one of the top performances made of the anime. And yes, I was shown the "End of Evangelion" and that still loved me even more. Don't have to mention many fans of this show! I don't know the psychological and philosophical untertones, but Evangelion puts it into the mud like anything else! Not many of the characters seemed to be very interesting. These only seemingly amazing were Asuka, Misato and Pen-Pen. Other than that, especially everyone else was a group of lost whita. They need to go to a psychiatric center, not to try big robbers against so-called "Angels". Even sand and guest war did not help even. It goes something like this: <br /> <br /> "Well, there are these robots, and they are so cold because they hit (!) When they hurt, but it's not mecha, but the fallen angels, and sometimes they go mad and do not which fighters emerging want, and should be controlled better ... blah blah blah! "<br /> <br /> I am sorry, but I can not only recommend Evangelion to anyone, anime otakus or not. For those who love this series, fine you have the right to comment, I respect them. But for people who are "out of your mind" it is interesting to think that everyone will love this series, you are more than a fool. <br /> <br /> I would like "Macross", "Mospeada", "Run -Dim" and "Robot Taekwon V" yourself.
