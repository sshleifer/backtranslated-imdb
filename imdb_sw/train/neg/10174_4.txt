I saw this back in '94 when it was finally released. It seems because the image of Orion was closed, I think, the film has not been opened a few years earlier. I have trouble remembering the details in part because I haven't seen them for a long time, but I remember as a very light movie. I continued to negotiate as I left. Shop did not interest or involve. It was the 3rd level of imitation US Graffiti. There is no showcase to do so deserve to watch. One of the greatest desires since the local newspaper inspector gave a high score.
