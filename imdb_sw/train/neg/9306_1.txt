This film is a bad excuse for a picture of the motion I saw. To start, I would like to say the front cover of this film is in all distorted ways, if you think you are approaching an awesome horrible and clown film of monster, you are soooo correct. In fact the killers are faced with even not equal to the front cover, it's just a picture they have to get on Google and they seem to be cool. Referring to what they found and thought it was cool, there is a scene in this film where some of the group are looking for friends in the old bushes, then suddenly the screen gets into the area where the mother of the teenagers are raising the glisten of the sun ... I mean WTF substantial ??? What? How does this apply to the surrounding dark forests? I bought this film from someone on the market you expect would be entertaining, if it was not afraid then at least it would be funny? WRONG! The next day I give my colleague to the side of the blows called S.I.C.K <br /> <br /> Below is: Don't see this FILIA!
