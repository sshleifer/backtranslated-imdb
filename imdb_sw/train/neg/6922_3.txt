One paper and newspaper campaigns (as they often did) a bigger and heavier piece than shown on driving screens. Claude Brook is actually America's Claudio Brook, who worked in the film for years. This is very hard to find again; I would like to see it again to compare the other international fears of the day, but don't remember the way of feeling especially when. Possibility is a plugin version that made it on the U.S. movies and videos. But oh, one paper ... it's still a gem of my awesome future collection.
