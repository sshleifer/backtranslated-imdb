I can't believe that this film was made recently in 1984. It will do a horrible job, not to mention one of the stupid squares forever. Who could ask Sheriff oil for Texas Joe Don Baker escort to Italy was arrested illegally in Mexico to return to Italy? Not to mention that the head of the film tells you nothing about it - in fact, it's like the usual name of the movie wannabe action / cop as I can imagine. <br /> <br /> I'm happy to see only on MST3K and Mike and bots like shield. They say about the effectiveness of female leadership Elaine from Seinfeld ("No one likes it") and does not know to stop the weight of Baker. This film should not be worse than "Mitchell," but the character of Baker appears in front of him here: when his head comes at the beginning of the film, Tom says, "I would not have read and write so I didn't read."
