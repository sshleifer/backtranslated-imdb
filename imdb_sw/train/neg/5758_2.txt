You can say that the actors will make a film, but this proves that the information is not appropriate. Most of the characters in this film have nothing to hold. They play part of the referral paper on the unexpected and unpopular routes. The story is very simple. It can be inserted in a few words, but I will stop if any reader wants to see this film. I had to develop a section where Jack showed us how to eat bad food. I would like to say that 70% of this film around cooking, eating, or preparing to eat. Frankly, I prefer to spend my time watching Jack chewing out loud and open mouth. Of course, I could do without references to shoes and jokes that pepper the first half of the film too. <br /> <br /> Out of my own mental illness, the film did not have anything worth while. There were countless scenes and camera shots that felt like they were finding it. When something happens, the effect of the characters is vague and dry. Don't look at it.
