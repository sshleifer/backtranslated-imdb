In my opinion of humility, this version of BDWY's great music consists of only two things - Tyne Daly and the fact that there is now a text version and original script. (OK Vanessa Williams is good to watch.) But I am all that there is. Many of the cast seem to be walking through the show - Chynna Phillips doesn't know who Kim really is and is not surprising people walking on Harry McAfee when it is playing with George Wendt who looks like he would like to return to the bar bed in Boston. Jason Alexander can be approved, but the same wig should go and I saw the best play in Bugsy Malone. As I said, it is advisable to have a script version of the action now, but I hope young people out there, who have never seen music, do not judge them all for this.
