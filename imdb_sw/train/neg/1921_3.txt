Because of the wonder the film world is run by fashion. One makes a film about the shark of killing then suddenly the world of the film of the movie has large squids, octopus and flowers of each sea. A person is beaten by a partner of hell and every character of the film is faced with a striker from hell or a collision from hell or a child of hell. Then a big Hollywood company produces a huge FX-filled blockbuster budget about tornados and other film manufacturers jump on the bandwagon, the fact that they have no budget to remove it is not to stop them. NIGHT's TWISTERS is a case for sure. What has been said about this made by a television film is the fact that it tries to hide the budget deficit by cutting the rest of advertising. Every time a hurricane appears a camara comes to a horrible expression of actors as they shout as "Oh my gawd 'leads this way" and "Run for your life" then the screen continues to save black producers need to upgrade the special effects budget. Unfortunately NIGHT's TWISTERS budget should be regulated with the best administrators. The beat is not bad but not unpressive and they do not have the ability to carry a film which is a character driven. Where did Josh Hartnett and Elijah Wood when you need them? And the last word about this is the TWISTER hockey ..... Yes NOTT was released a few months before TWISTER but TWISTER had been standing for several months as a blockbuster for the summer of 1996 and NOTT has a sense of rush which leads me to believe that it was made and released for connecting to the neighboring TWISTER
