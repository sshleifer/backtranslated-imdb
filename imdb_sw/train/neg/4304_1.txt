This is an anti-Serb propaganda film made for TV. <br /> <br /> "Muslims are good, Christian Orthodox Serbs are BAD." This is a message. Use “entertainment” to get a propaganda message is not new. <br /> <br /> This movie puts it in thick. <Many viewers and inspectors reduce. I know more. <br /> <br /> Serbs, under General Draza Milhalovitch and its Chetnik, have been saved more than 500 hit down by US flights from the Germans during World War II. Churchill decided to betray Milhalovitch and put British support behind the Communist Titus. Roosevelt took a suit and as a result, after the war ended Yugoslavia was released to the Communist Titus. <br /> And the United States's Milhalovitch partner has been beaten by the media since then. <br /> The movie is part of the anti-Serb campaign of propaganda developed by George Soros and the International Crisis Group (ICG) which reached the peak of the "War" of Kosovo where the government was bombed by NATO because of false claims and ICG's "cemetery ranges" in Kosovo filled with "victims" of bad Serbs. The fact that there were not many graves and Albanians (Muslims) had no business in Kosovo of Serbia is the fact that most of the media will not write. I chose this film to watch because a single sentence on a video cover was considered interesting. Think of my hatred when I realized that I have been deceived in the leasing of another government propaganda machine. Instead of propaganda this person should make a film about the lack of the Clinton Governance to come clean and Congress and the people of America about its participation in arms delivery from Iran to Islamic government in Sarajevo. I can't hold my breath waiting for the film.
