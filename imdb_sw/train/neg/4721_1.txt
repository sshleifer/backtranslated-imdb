Before you see this film, please see the review available on the internet about the fictional films, especially its introduction on the accepted fact that 7-8,000 Islamic men were expelled from Srebrenica and beaten by Serbia scholars. The author is also of various pro-Serbian agencies of the United States. Please check this film correctly, and read the review before. Many experts say that the rapists take his arguments too far, even if he raises questions that focus on common wisdom about war. Review in NYTimes and Stephen Holden says it would be "appropriate to write this pro-Serbian document," but one should interview all of the presentations of the truth, many of which are taken from reliable sources, and the rebellion of the truth to encourage the Serbian forces. I am not advised to see this document, but I warn you to explore with a very important eye (if you should do all the time however).
