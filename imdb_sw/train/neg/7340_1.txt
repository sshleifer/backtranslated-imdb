Surprise! This is the worst movie of SRK and one of the worst films I saw! I didn't like the novel, but this film destroyed it! Very bad music, even the worst actors (without SRK of course, even though they can't manage the movie), and not so much. The director makes all appear very confused, God knows why ... Maybe it is because he tries to make it all appear very surgical, and still reliable. Indeed, he can not manage. Even if you have a few hours of opening, don't watch this film, please! (Saying this for your well-being!) Continue searching, you will find something else to watch!
