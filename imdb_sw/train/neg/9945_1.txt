After watching nearly half of this film I saw something ... I found myself always changing the TV channels to see what else was going on - not exactly the good character of the film. This game is listed as being in many types of music, and I must say that it has failed too much in each of them. 80% through the film I changed to look at the old replacement instead. Under the bottom - the whole movie felt like those who did not know what to do and ended up in concoction without a recognized flavor.
