I really liked this film to the end. Indeed, it was cheesy and not very easy but still had my thoughts on daylight. To the end, that's it. For its final performance in the prestigious basket preservation where he struggled to get the lessons for other class taught students, what is the main character? Wow they have to appreciate and implement this time of respect for music? No. He persecutes and monitors the great Habanera of Carmen and returns to the song of Brittany Spears-wannabe pop completely. My ears hit! And, in a great time of fear, his teachers gave him ovation! Any teacher who had no fantasy derived from Spears could have failed there. Save your time, forget your ears - skip this film!
