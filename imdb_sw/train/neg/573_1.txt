The last inspector was very generous. I am resting like the first movie, but I can't say I am very happy with this. Beginning is bearing, but slows down. I see Jon Bon Jovi as a "duck hunter of bad vampire" and a vampire is not sexy nor scary. Many exhibitions are useless. I mean any ordinary person could be suspect something going on when a strange woman came out of a place of cheating, then alone a skilled hunter. Why do you have the ability to communicate with Jovi? There is nothing to mention in this film, you would not consider it if it was entertainment, but that was too big to ask. This should be one of the worst movie vampire I saw.
