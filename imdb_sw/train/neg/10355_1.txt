I liked this book since my Grade 5 teacher studied in class many years ago. And I've read each of my 3 and 5 classes on my 18-year-old teaching. It seems that the film has been made in the past, but I could never find it. Yes, my students and I were very excited when we heard that Disney had brought the best book of Madeline L'Engle to the screen. <br /> <br /> When I was watching movies, I was more optimistic. As the film continued, I was more concerned. They had hit it wrong! I have never been so allowed to favorite book adapter to the film. I understand that the film cannot be connected to the book, but they don't need to change things for it! Many, if not all, to leave from the book was not quite important! I took my first comment and just listened to my students discussing the movie. In fact, it's not just me. Almost everyone felt the same way - he deceived a great story that Madeline L'Engle was created with skill! Why / why, they were surprised, Is Auntie's grandmother like Chewbacca from a star wars film? Why did Calvin's hair be red? Why Mrs. Which did not have a "witch-like dress" which was very clever for her name? Basically, we all wondered - why almost every single detail must be changed? I have been dreaming of this book that can do. I still try the movie. This was a Temporary Temporary for a short time of mind. I'll write to Peter Jackson and try to persuade him to work!
