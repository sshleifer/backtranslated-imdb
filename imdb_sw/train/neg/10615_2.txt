Surprise how less than 2 hours can seem like life during staying through such flat, uninspiring drivel. If the story is private if this is thought to be Sally Potter, do you? Do not expect a little desire to show its performance? His acting was completely taken away and I do not feel chemistry between Sally and Pablo and cucumber events, which should be hot due to the nature of the dance, it was rather tough and painful to watch. Obviously, revealing such stories on the film may be awesome, and such as Sally Potter would be wise to allow the best actor to take a job instead of allowing his passion to fall victim to his own sheep.
