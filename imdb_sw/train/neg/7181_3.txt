now don't get bad, I enjoy Christmas movies. I love her good life and I am very happy with Christmas carol and george c. scott and alistair sim. but this film is bad. I think I love the song of life the Christmas spirit now singing is very painful. albert finney sings well for annie. I don't know what is causing him to this film but it looks like someone is trying to sing through the mouth of the dead gerbils. The only thing preserved this film for us was closed the voice and watched the dance numbers accompanied by the south cd of Christmas cd.
