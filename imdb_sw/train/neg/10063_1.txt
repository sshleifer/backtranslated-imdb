Now I have never seen a bad film in all my years but what it has songs in the movie what the psychological meaning has. WOW Pokémon said shows and adds I can get a shock from this. Animie is clear that the developers are not his great marketing plan just to watch the songs and they get a good rating I think this movie would be good if they set the message should see all Pokémon episodes for understanding what's going on and not the film. It's just an animation should be on the video. <br /> <br /> Ps: I'll give you 1 because you've got 5 bucks I can't give half because there is no half.
