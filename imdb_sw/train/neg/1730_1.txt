First I would like to explain that I just know the show from my little sister always look at it. I see it the most desperate program on TV. There is nothing surprising about any 'joke' and cans laughter can not be disturbed. The exhibition will work better if it is done in front of the live audience. In this way laughter will only show how 'you are trying to show'. However I lend to the acting talent of youth cast. It helps me even to think that they will look back on the future show and see how bad their first TV was show. Links to display well with all the shocking sounds and the style of CBBC presenters. Why today's young people need to cry out louder than I do. It's just that.
