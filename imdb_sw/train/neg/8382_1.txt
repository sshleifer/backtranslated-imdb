There was a cartoon of Bugs Bunny titled "Baby Buggy Bunny" which was similar to this plot. Finster standing child stole a bank and money in a car gone away and fell into a rabbit hole. She dressed like a child to enter the Bugg hole to get money. Situated in the "Man Sparks" where he looks in the mirror of the bathroom and his mouth mouth is straight from the cartoon. This was a cartoon of 5 minutes hilarious; not the whole movie. If you are interested in this, buy a DVD of Bugs Bunny. It was the first time the first time (1954). Plus you will find many pictures of Bugs Bugs Bunny for boot!
