Film is a bit of stimulating. It's more silent film, and a multitude of stories offered through a series of top ringtones. When making a silent film like this is not a bad idea, this is one of the films where the lack of discussion and early repeat events makes it easier. You do not understand the reason for decreasing well into the picture, and at the time it is too late. The first 40 minutes of the film is a slow piece of soft Mexican porn, and a non-imaginative picture of there. Later in the film's first 40-minute film begins to be meaningful, but it is too late, because at that time the audience is lost. There is a good chance of photography at the National University of Mexico. I have often wondered why more films are not shot there. The campus is built on the edge of the lava farms that gives them a chance to feel more than others. My biggest problem with the film is that the director / writer has made the film in such a way that he wanted to see it no matter how the viewer does not know the story he sees. You can't ignore the audience when you tell the story.
