This was the worst film. The "Cole" character played by Michael Moriarty was the most serious factor that had been dropped, the actors felt that mentioning the south-south fragile south could make this behavior worse, not. After 20 minutes I wanted a speech therapist to appear, this would have increased trust. <br /> <br /> - 1) does not work - 2) senseless characters - 3) yellow line thin / / <br /> Yuck! <br /> <br />
