I wonder that anyone involved in the production of this series would accept the truth. The script is not really worth it must be written by someone who failed to test the entry of the Canadian Comedy Journalists (and that says something!). Get your binoculars if you want, but nothing similar to the joke before. Ronnie Corbett must have hit the flat to dislike this waste. Some of the cast are not lost in any form of operation or comedic capacity that I was surprised for the first period - to correct, verify. All I can say to those who are interested in this is that it must be very easy to be accepted. And it is clear that production costs must have been kwa 100 per part. And if someone thinks I am talking like a stranger who does not know the English language, I must add that I am English.
