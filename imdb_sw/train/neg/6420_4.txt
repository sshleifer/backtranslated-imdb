Right I will admit, it started very interesting and beautiful, but then dropped down, I do not believe Sara Michelle Gellar could finish reading the script after 5 minutes on the film, the only reason it stood in the general movie, I wanted to see the disappearance of dye, and to my surprise, well I can not even tell you if there is one, because the end leaves you confused, and then the chance of credit, what was I like Hell? this did not deserve to run the theater, I would, but I did not mean that it was terrible, just the only thing I gave 4 is because it had a small jumpy ... that's it! you can watch, im not telling you not, hey can even like it or even love it! but if you hate it, don't say no!
