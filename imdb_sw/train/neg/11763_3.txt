Yes. I will accept it. I believed every kind of work around the work, about trials and suffering of 6 people, living in Mexico City about their sex life. And so, I was expecting to finally see the Mexican movie (at age) which was popular and interesting look. Unfortunately the film was awesome. This story gives us two marriages, both of which have marital problems. When the third party comes into the life of each woman, their problems reach a critical point. Or quite strange. The plan turns out to be a sex war. The position taken by each group (yes, they are a real group, girls and girls and boys and boys) is stupid and young (I think humor should be present). And it's all worse. Exhibitions range from good (Miss Zavaleta) for mediocre (Mr Bichir), and Serrano to work on an acceptable opera on his prima. However, a flat state that makes a conspiracy, one character, is poor (if it is not stupid) a view of sex represents in relation to maturity etc., make the movie fail. Unfortunately. SPYL has found a good reception (surprising) on ​​the office-box. Believe the hype to your own risk.
