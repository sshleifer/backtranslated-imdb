That, for the millennium, Nick has been the Jolly Elf for Scrooge's Fred has never ever been! Open Nick to learn how to make toys, then on Fred to learn how to run a number; Nick giving the sick dolly child, Fred is still dolly, with the family farm! After other other intervals, the evening to the present day Fred emerges his spleen in Anonymous Siblings as fellow miserable victims. There, I have written more stories than this idiocy! This Santa, who is "ho, ho, ho, ho, ho" away from the great hall, is a neurotic decorated by the Queen of Harpies, a direct operation outside of Mega-Mall Hell, and answers to the Board (huh?) Which gave them just Easter Bunny egg its black. Oh, and his right hand is a gray blonde in a dress-tight-tight and go-go boots. Ho ... to ... to ... Ho! But what led it on the edge was Slam called # 1 on the Naughty List. Is not a list of traders saved by Hitler and Stalins? Children who are a true example of evil? Nope, for Old-Pastor Fingers, a good boy who blows out because he doesn't need unwanted is a Demon Seed! <br /> <br /> Nambrods behind Fred Claus should be boiled in their own pudding! Bah!
