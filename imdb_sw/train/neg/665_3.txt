In Bridgeport, a high school teacher, Richard Fenton (Johnathon Schaech), was attended by a young student Donna Keppel (Brittany Snow); he testifies to killing his family to stay with him, but Richard has been arrested and taken to prison for life. Three years later, the injured Donna feels well but still has undergoing psychological treatment and taking medication. On the eve of his night, he goes with his girlfriend Bobby (Scott Porter) and two of the friends of the Pacific Grad Hotel for a party. But psychopath Richard has fled from prison and is placed in a single apartment in Donna, hitting his friends and hotel staff that crosses his way. Don't forget to forget "Prom Night" is a collection of clichés and lack of naturalness. Foolish stories are inferior and ignorant, and a bad act of Johnathon Schaech in the role of insane killer. Predictable screenplay is amazing since it is possible to see what will happen in the next scenes. My vote is three. Title (Brazil): "Morte Convida Para Dançar" ("The Death Invites to Dance")
