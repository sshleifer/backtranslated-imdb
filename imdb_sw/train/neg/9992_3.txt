Ah Ah, Sci Fi Channel provides Yeti other movie disgusting. I was particularly taken by the events immediately after the accident where, if the survivors tried to find a match, at least half of the fire burned? without a visible reason? in different parts of destruction. Fire appeared to be the top theme in each. They looked for a corpse for a match and a match, and finally finding a box was built every day for, apparently, 12, but no one had ever collected firewood. Then the vegan (hah) was burned, what did it faster? I mean these people were frozen? well maybe not. In spite of low temperatures everything was eaten, spilled. Maybe I am the only one, but even in the most unpredictable story (none of the survivors has ever heard of yeast, or the person who is angry with the snow to the end), if you take care of little things the big deal is more acceptable. Olo, the predecessor (1972) had what and the remainder of the movie? And the refugee, with enough heat to hold his hand, went on fire and did not want a fire. Gimme break. In fact, at least we have Carly Pope, another beautiful Canadian. And, very gently, Ed Marinaro as a coach. Well, also add, the rabbit they ate (despite looking like a chicken) is not a stick, but a lagomorph. Now if the guest (or mouse) would have a mouse, but it still looks like a chicken. And the authors lacked a real opportunity to remember someone "Likes as ..."
