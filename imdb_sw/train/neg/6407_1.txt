I watched this film for 45 minutes and counted the mullet 9. That's mullet every 5 minutes. Hard though, this film is a living proof that the formula works. If it doesn't break, it doesn't want to fix it. Village-yet-dangerous, formerly a tough soldier of a gold-hearted soldier and a killer and 'issues'. Magic clean.
