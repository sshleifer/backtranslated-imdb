Another of my delves in the bingain bar, this movie gave me exactly what I expected - the burden of a full trashy fullness with women shouting <br /> <br /> It all started well - I liked the little intro and "news" on young couples are found to blast nuclear, and he was tied up until the first man had finished fire ... <br /> <br /> From the same time the film fell to the ground, and sometimes it was almost embarrassing to look. When the heroine turned out to be the same situation as the main character (the ability to make it farts himself without the help of the match) it seemed almost like someone lost the idea at the end time ("that'll be good!" You can almost hear they say ...) With a close psychic link between the main character and the nuclear power plant, well ... <br /> <br /> The movie reached as cheap - if you pay more than Â£ 1.50 so it's done.
