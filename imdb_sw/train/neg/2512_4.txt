Tim Robbins is oddly benign here, made like a garage machine in the 1950s New Jersey who loves to love with a perky blonde who turns out to be Albert Einstein's fiance! Although she is screwed when scores, Robbins removes out of the inside of her strict persona and continues back (it's easy to forget she is even in the picture!). Lumpy's romantic romantic and gimmick, that Walter Matthau plays Einstein (who does what he can and the sexual behavior of the pregnancy). Otherwise, it is sugar and sun, led instead of sleep with Fred Schepisi, who shows the heart but no wit or mind. Meg Ryan is a man who can be affected by the chemistry between him and Robbins is interesting, like that of a loving sister and a big brother. ** from ****
