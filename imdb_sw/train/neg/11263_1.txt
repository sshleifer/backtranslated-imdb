In shame, for the reason that a good actor like Joseph Fiennes would let him be healed in this nausea. Movie was not just bad, but less horrible than non-redeemable. The plot, (there was one?) It seemed unwanted pop. The Russians played or were abused or games and all others had to be thrown away without their pathetic performances. I left on 3/4 of the way and wiped it. A "1" for the worst just because there is nothing less. Don't waste your time on this, you can't miss anything.
