I would like to start by saying I can just enjoy about any bad Italian movie or traumatic jungle flick from the 1970s. Great. This was very bad. There are so many things that Martino is trying to insert and none of them works (except for something that goes wild) very well. There are Western people who do not know, of course, who have established a break in the jungle somewhere. I don't even remember where it happens ... it's a sad thing ... In fact, people are coming to the center to see this indigenous tribe and 'its celebrations but finally bother' Alligator God 'of the river which then goes on to destruction, and The assassination said they gave a holiday with some of the people of the tribe too. Sounds good, yes? Yes, do not get your hope. There is little violence to the end, special effects are as bad as the class of preschool children and the story of love is thrown in taste. <br /> <br /> There is a few cases where it seems to put the camera under water in the pool and throw a toy alligator, like a dart, into the water and which is supposed to be an attacking gator. I have not given birth. In a special remarkable effect of efficiency, Matchbox van faces a plastered gator, which suddenly is five times the size of the van. (A few minutes ago, he was just a big enough to eat man, but now he is the least loads of cargo ...) It is pathetic. Just another flick I can imagine where the harm was being taken out of the story was Bruno Mattei's jewel, "Mice," what is with the plastic mouse on the conveyor belt and all who will not be afraid. <Br /> <br /> Normally I would like to say anything Sergio Martino had a solid-looking but this is a must-pass. Tanga's time and certainly not worth buying at a $ 15 + price of sticker from No Shame. This is a SHAME. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10, children.
