What boob in MGM thought it was a good idea to put a Clark Gable specialist in the role of the Army Army Officer? Surprisingly, another good star of the future, Cary Grant, also played the Salvation Army for only two years later after being greatly enhanced by WRONG. I think it is very easy to see the folly of these roles, but I am still wondering WHO thought that the Kings of Salvation is "HOT" and who can look at those men who play and see them as a true representation of the places they played. A long time ago, I was working with a sister of the Salvation Army (American volunteers) and I have never seen any boys working there (and with me, unfortunately). Maybe I have to work with the Salvation Army instead! Therefore, for a very curious, this is a good film to look for, but for everyone else, it is a poor text, inappropriate conversation and despair to make a slow film.
