I entered this film I think it would be a good game of football (in the same line as the Titans Note); however, I came to hear if I had gone to Ted Haggard's preaching on the Rapture. The only thing missing is the request to give a tenth part at the end of the movie. In fact, one could get more from the television sermon than this bad excuse for entertainment. At least the television sermons, there are quotes from Scripture instead of quoting from ordinary people to help help. The plan could not be determined by the fact that anyone with long-term alert could put the whole plot in the first minute of the movie.
