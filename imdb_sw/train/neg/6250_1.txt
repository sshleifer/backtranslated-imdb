I did like this show, once in a while. That is, until I realize all the errors in it. It's so untrue. I know it's a lie, but even a little unknown. That's why. ** Destroying people in front ... ** What! Do we really have to believe that a child like Yugi will come from Pharaoh of ancient Egypt? C'mon! He is a great nerd on the surface of the Earth. And what relates to Pharaoh (a.k.a. Atem and / or Yami) hair? Finally I looked, the horse was adorned (except for the little hair of the head) and wearing the hats. And, we should be sure that a rich, well-known young man, called Seto Kaiba, can run a successful legal business while still having time to go to small school as 'Domino High'? Puh-leeze! At first, he will have legal to become an adult to run a company. And that would make him not very young, because he would be the only adult in his class. And second, why would he go to school as 'Domino High', when his business was successful enough to attend a telescope? In addition, the plots with his younger brother are soap and cripples. Every time you turn, the child is taken by goons to baddie. * yawn * No new, no new. Joey is a poor child, living with a good father. It says Joey accepts all the money to attend his school, because his father is alcohol, but he never never sees Joey doing anything similar to work. He even mention work. And her sister Serenity is a perfect motion. Why would he choose a snob like Duke (who wore his brother in dog clothes and humiliate him on television) about a good person like Tristan? What? He really can't be meaningful? The various characters during the period are getting demonic power, getting their soul stolen by demonic powers, and falling prey to mental illness. (Oh, that's safe for kids, NOT.) Tea is a kind of girl-second door, which is the sole aim of being the girl of Yugi / Yami. And while having good points, he doesn't have enough time to shine as the main character. <br /> <br /> Animation is just bad. All characters seem ill and anorexic. The view is awesome (especially when they are doing close-hand) and the color looks good, but it's not stellar. But the worst of the subject for the series was the fact that Yami says that his Millennium Puzzle can send hearts back to their bodies. If this was so, how did he not save the Grandpa of Yugi at first place, when Pegasus stole himself, and saved himself from getting it? <br /> <br /> It is all true, it's a business for itself. The collective collective group is "Yu-Gi-Oh: The planned series" by LittleKuriboh. Please. Do something more. Like, see the Abridged version. </ 1/1 / / 1/10
