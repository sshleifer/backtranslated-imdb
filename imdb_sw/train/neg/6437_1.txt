Traders. First, nothing happened in this film, except a woman without blood. Second, it was not terrible. Third, it was the greatest sound of any movie ever. I would like to explain it. Sound was developed by Beavis or Butthead ?? I don't know what it is, then let's just go with Beavis. The movie gradually finds more stability and more people mumble and mutter, forcing you to turn the volume (I watched this at home). Then Beavis screams many loud and exciting sounds, and encourages them to slow down again. This happens many times until, with compassion, the movie is approaching. I can see Beavis laughing dirty behind the two glass when watching the experiment group reach the village every time. If you have children and you prefer to watch movies after sleep, this is a big mistake. But then it's a big mistake however. Here's the idea? if you are making a horrible movie, at least add a freeous paste, a 19-year-old girl who screams out of her lungs before she can extinguish her sweat, a shade on someone's killed live outside the camera range, the cat was thrown on the camera to stimulate the audience , some contempt of weirdo and cheating laughter, or a monster who looks like the hand of the step covered on the aluminum foil (of the TV lost in space). These people did not even try to fear me. Just liked to hurt my ears.
