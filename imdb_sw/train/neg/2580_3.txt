well officially. have just killed the American Pie. The first 3 were common, but this and the other have been bad. I mean the story is about the relationship of two college friends who are fighting for their homes, meaning to discuss the weak plot, the first three dealt with the rise, change and marriage, which are all the characteristics of the development of human society. The new stifler is a great joke, I know it's hard to try to compare it with Steven Stifler but so there is no cigarette. I give this film 3 because there are 2-3 funny bits in the film. The best character in this movie is Jim's father I don't know why he keeps doing these bad films.
