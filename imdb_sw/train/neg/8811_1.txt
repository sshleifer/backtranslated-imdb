SPOILERS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> I watched half of this movie and I like it. First reason: decay. Of course everything happens, women sit and talk about how bad their life is and how they have no hope, they break the weeds, read the magazines, take care of their sick friend, and cut the body regularly. BORING !!!! The second factor: There are many things that are left unnoticed. Many events have been committed to zombie hunters who rob people who are not interested, stopping them from the chair and asking them. Who are these men? Do they know anything about illegal activities for meat patients? Why did he kill one and let another go? There is also this dude who first time I think also had the meat to eat disease but puts his fist through the wall and superhuman force to indicate he is not quite what we previously thought-never explained! What is sadness? Conclusion: I have seen women excited, unhappy stories, anger of duologue, and an absurd act. Also the art of insurers distorts since it lets you believe that this film will be cool when it is clear. I lost this film according to other comments made by others on this site, and although I respect the fact that some people could enjoy this flick, I will now start making sure I have read more of two reviews within the movie to avoid the other movie I see to see.
