This movie was monitored. Acting was awarded, the script was cooked, and the total film was hit. There were two threads in a film that was not developed and the viewer had to work a little to find out what was happening. We say that it needs to be opened, but you suddenly find things happening and have said if you have a little clue about what they are. Examples: <br /> <br /> <br /> The negative view of the heroine about the hero. The audience is not shown how he knows anything about the husband and how he is bound to the death of his fianc√©. The viewer has too little to die of the guy too. Also, suddenly there is a place where a group of boys is loading a gun and hitting the machine and that's all you see before you cut again to other events. There is no definition-always about guns and people with them. We gave 3 because we don't feel like we wanted our return time. It was fun with a dirty bad mouth when looking at it, so at least he gave us a little entertainment. ; -) \ t
