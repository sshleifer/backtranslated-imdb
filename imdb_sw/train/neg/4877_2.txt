Frank Capra's design must have been used when designing this film. Although it has a momentous time, and many wonderful artists, printed by Capra correctly not only the script but many images from its first version of this story, Without Broadway (1934), is very clear. It is understandable that he will use the diagram from the horse race, which is exciting. But it uses the scenes of dialogue with small actors, then brings those executives and it seems we do not recognize, for example, that Ward Bond is 14 years old! Unless you want to see one of the final exhibitions of Oliver Hardy, skip this and see Broadway District instead.
