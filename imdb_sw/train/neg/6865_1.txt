This film was very bad and sad. I couldn't resist watching it though. The program is normal, to make a bad statement (help cast as a neighbor of the nutty and friend of lawyers were the best actors). A pleasant kind of time if you have time to lose and if you see the conclusion of a wonderful plot. Headline header who plays "Kathy" was just amazing because I couldn't decide if its waste, flat affected was the result of bad surgery or just a bad act (I decided it all). This allows the script to comment, which was very good. Pat's words, idiotic decisions, and ignorance ignorance for each part of the character in the film. Maybe this is what it was so riveting; I don't know. I just looked to see how bad it could be. (Of course the conversation is not even called "cliche" "- but it is quite close.) All over, the worst, cheap film. without a true knowledge or cooperation, more like props that randomly dropped in action in a bad play. I wanted to see the end.
