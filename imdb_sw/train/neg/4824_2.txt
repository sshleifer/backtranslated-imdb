I wanted to love this film, but many elements were damaged by me. The use of fisheye lenses at all times and choppy edits did not give me a sense of being in the world of meth head, but it made me think I was looking at MTV for a while. The movie never seemed to go anywhere and acting was actually the best example of acting on. I like movies that give us a glimpse into the world of seed, but this film could not decide whether it was a horrible movie or even the worst definition of addiction.
