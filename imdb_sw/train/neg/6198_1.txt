This film of fear and rejection was intended to start with. The characters are emerging men who appear regularly appear walking around and exhausted in the marine city. Robert is a stranger but he has his music that can be his soul. Instead of Clay makes Robert become a fool who starts the journey of marijuana and pleasing to interfere with the bad crowd. Clay seems to believe the "madness of reefer" and Robert finishes the film as an advent of homicidal. One is wondering how much of this real life experience is a small director. No one can save Robert. Clay leaves us with a message that British youth do not know. The most unsuspecting link is made to Iraq's rebels; during the rape of unwanted rape we come from explosions and pictures of war. The film shows a group of male group that moves across borders. Young Bombers in London mentions parallel with Clay's description of modern male hatred. Clay means that men cannot help themselves from violent acts of violence. It is amazing that the UK film industry allows money to be deployed in films propagating propaganda, while in London we still attack from recent attacks. This is the first Clay film, I would like to rejoice if it's the last.
