In fact, I can't worry about spending my time writing about this important notion of filming - life is just short. What I will say is that only in the dark can succeed in just three things: 1. It will make you laugh, but for all the wrong reasons. 2. It may give us some inappropriate plots but leave them all. It is totally disrespectful for a normal PC game that is believed to be a total failure in all aspects of film making. Doctor Boll, if you really are (I think of a bone here), what is the world you do in the chairman's chair?
