Well put together to enter into a kind of serial killer that unfortunately gets mired down at its own discretion to be really satisfying. Willem Dafoe is as good as the NYC investigator is trying to track what is seen as a copycat with the methods of murder related to the art of Renaissance that took place in a series of killings he had resolved earlier. Scott Speedman is a little boyfriend of David and they have a good chemistry (at least for a while). Other characters come easily to connect two events together. Clea Duval is a friend of the original victim and Peter Stormare is some kind of art broker / consultant for Dafoe ... that's very difficult to take, though Stormare is, of course, never light. The end of the film is particularly desperate. Look quickly for Deborah Harry as the youngest of David who loves the neighbor.
