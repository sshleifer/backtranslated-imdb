Someone man! It's a piece of making a crummy film! But this is an excuse for guilt from my childhood even though I hate it. They showed this film on my basic cable system at all times. Where I grew up in San Jose, California (certainly the Cupertino border) we had something called the G Channel on the cable system. And they basically showed the same movie consistently over and over again. Nevada Wanda was one of those movies. I fell to disappointment and love with young Brooke Shields and loved her dopey adventures in the Grand Canyon in the 1940s. beautiful song Carole King played on the last credit. Perhaps you should be stoned to enjoy this truth. And hey, everyone knows no gold in the Grand Canyon!
