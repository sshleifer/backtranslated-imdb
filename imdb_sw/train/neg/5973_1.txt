This film is another good example of what Jerry Bruckheimer, since 1997, seems to be better - whistling for a year before release and without coming up with the best film. I'm not a film critic, but this movie was like predicted as they come. Every joke attempt, every attempt at touch, and a sad attempt in the story of love, was exactly what I was predicting in my mind. Make yourself a permit and save your money on this.
