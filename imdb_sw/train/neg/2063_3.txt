Hearing about how this fascinating film is, I finally pay on <br /> <br /> video shop and for 75 minutes maybe I was laughing 3 times. This movie is / is <br />, a collection of skits that you enjoy The television is <br /> <br /> extraordinary mess. The joke falls flat, causes humor and scandals / tiles from the 1970s that are no longer important, and <br /> <br /> jokes continue for too long (almost as new SNL skits <br) > <br /> a few years ago. Well, Chevy Chase is in this but maybe all of it <br /> about 1 or 2 minutes. I loved the fact that this was too much <br /> <br /> despair and had nudity galore but it could not be funny? Are you accredited to the tax of Kentucky Fried movies which is a remote private film made in
