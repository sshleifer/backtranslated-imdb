Typically, on the IMD, going to lots of votes instead of the "average average" is the most important of the entertainment value of the movie. In this case, many offers "one". They are right! To begin my review, I will begin to admit that I am not completely missing why this movie is called "Alien Alien". It involves space and even "alien" (I think), but no rhyme or reason (completely) for anything for a long time, at least, there is no real basis for a plot or resolution that I can do anywhere. <Br /> <br /> There are few cases that are sad (related to all line, time, and how to talk), that is more than a fantastic feeling that finds when watching movies similar. I have no idea about the place next to the beginning where Bugs Bunny's electronics appears to occur on something. <br /> <br /> "The plot" refers only to the location of the space known as G-Spot, sorry, making that G-Sector ... with a virtual viral program infected with some kind of alien virus (?). I think it's a stranger since the image of an odd Ariel looks like a negative picture. <br /> <br /> For many of the films, we see people being shot by space weapons, falling out of lofts, and seem endless, almost shots without the meaning of "Ariel?", "Can't find Ariel" (meaningless for many reasons other incompatible relationships with Ariel, however - nothing) on ​​computer tracking. Skyler commander (Billy Dee), sits and sees every fantasy of VR's criminal plans expects to get this alien virus and become one with it ... ??? Or maybe I lost something ... Billy Dee Williams took a few courses on "how to act with despair" before hiding this picture. We know this because she spends a lot of time moving her fingers under her face and looking at the cry. <br /> <br /> Part of the surveillance and nose of one ship going back to the other was half-hilarious at least, giving more laughter than previous events where we see several shipping shots as it just spin on the circle, looks like a quiz Lego has left. It seems everyone is dying in this film, why are you worried? Even the VR women are killed, as if they have to mean anything (especially because everyone else dies in any way) ... anger .. <br /> <br /> Because of the money I store in the grocery store, I will not come about want my money back that I paid for this DVD. The dollar I saved in the vanilla cover of the paid cover for the time of the inspector. It will only add that the story itself, at least as a novel, and for more additional information, may be very interesting with the correct author. </ 1/1 / / 1/10
