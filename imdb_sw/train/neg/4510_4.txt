I would like Memoirs of Geisha so I read the book twice; is one of the best books I've learned last year. I expected movies and I was afraid that reading this book would destroy the pleasure of watching the movie. I had no prospects for the movie being bad. Some of the best parts of this book were not released from the film and the characters were weak and Hatsumomo (Li Gong) have become worse. If I haven't read this book, this movie would be a little confusing and incomprehensible. The film design shows that "Nitta Sayuri shows how he walked his fishing ..." How did anyone see when or when Saying was in Nitta Sayuri? Forget the film and read the book.
