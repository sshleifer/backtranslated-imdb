I saw this movie twice through the Pentecostal church my family attended Nanaimo BC in the 1970s. The world would not believe. It was not just a movie, but it was also a philosophical that enters many "Christians" on "animal mark" and rapture. This movie, the church, and a good indifferent growth, causes a severe paranoia towards the future. For many years, I lived under the influence of church fraud and fear of being forgotten by Christ. I am now 40 years old. I once described this movie psychologist with the system of faith of the church and family. I was hit by a deception. I really started to believe this, it was my brother who reminded me, that this traditional philosophy really happened. I no longer fear the future, I have agreed with the fears that emerged within its members and the church. I have taken this experience to fulfill the purpose, I'm close to my license as a specialist psychologist.
