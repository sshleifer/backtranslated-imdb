We had an STARZ weekend and I have changed the center to see what was. It was this movie Howling II: Acting was bad but eye eye was good. Sybil Danning and Marsha Brown as well as the eye candy mentioned. I laughed a lot from the few events I saw. My friends are wondering why I never want to go to horror movies, If they see this film they will know why. I would be thrown out to laugh hard. Several publications of trivia: Reb Brown who played Ben White played by Captain American in the text of TV film Marsha Brown was Mick Jaggers inspiring for the song "Sugar Brown" Mick has a good taste for women for sure.
