don't recommend hiring this movie. It has nothing to do with avoiding the death line, despite the English head. I can't imagine one good thing to say about the movie. Poor acting, bad editing, poor conversion ... laughable "conspiracy", and sound / music was very irritating, it is this amazing movie does not come up with a warning label. The only possible way of staying through this film and enjoying it is the historical quality of copper. Don't get this bad movie again.
