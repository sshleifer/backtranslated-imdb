I got this film on FX last night, and as I stood watching it, it happened to me that it could possibly be the worst movies. A bad job, a movie of bad movies, a bad sound, a very strict fight, stupid characters. All of this made it the worst movie of laughably I ever seen. It was so bad, I was happy with any lack of anything that I was able to watch ... and they did good!
