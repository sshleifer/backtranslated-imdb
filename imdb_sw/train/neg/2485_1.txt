There is only the use of films such as Bulletproof: it reminds you of the worst possible. We are often watching movies that we describe as "very bad" or "not very good", but it looks like this film and you can see that although all these movies are not "good" they do not have a very bad way like Bulletproof. It was a birthday gift from someone who spent less than two seconds using 'binary DVD bar in our local superstore in order to fulfill obligations (ie nipe presents). It is likely that it has found serendipitous but it was not: this is quite a clich√©d, so it is written badly, so misinterpreted, so the worst work that I am surprised everyone involved has never been arrested and sent down for 10 years. God, it's bad. I was very disrespectful for 30 seconds, but I am going because sometimes - sometimes bad films can be fun. This is not one of them. It's just bad. I stopped looking after 45 minutes, and tomorrow I will throw it in the bin.
