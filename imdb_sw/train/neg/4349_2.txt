This movie is awesome. Carlitos (1993) is a good film. Goodgfellas is not just one of the best offensive films. This movie should be considered next to the part of the STING or maybe the speed area. Remember those gems! The only reason for this film was made in order to separate from worship after nature. This movie had nothing to De Palma, Pacino and Penn worked hard. There was no good reputation and that's the fault of everyone involved and doing it. I hope that the success of every RAZZIE is possible and maybe even upgrading new groups to allow you to become a record owner. After watching this S @ * T FEST, I sat and watched the original carlitos way to get a bad taste from my mouth. After looking at this I would Pachanga come and heal me out of my trouble.
