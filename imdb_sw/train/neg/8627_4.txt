Although this is a general cheesy jungle-adventure movie, it doesn't have some important things - Environment is quite beautiful, and pacing the adventure is good. You can't be bored to watch it. <br /> <br /> Keith is like a quiet wind as possible to play the eponymous shot, unabashedly drunk forest guide shanghai'd in the rich escort boy Van Hoffman and his wife gorgeous Shower on hunting trips in the country of cannibal. He never takes things seriously. Bathing there is decorative and Keith uses too much - it is not very good to act. She is not only a female to show off her body and the uniform elements of the film make it over half of T / image. <br /> <br /> Nothing in this film will draw special attention to, or away from it. Made into shlock, succeeds without much debate. Good app 2 AM cable.
