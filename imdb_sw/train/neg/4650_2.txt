With the electorate of the happy and delightful British actors of the 1950s, I was optimistic and hoped to be more happy with this film. Unfortunately I found myself wrong - I couldn't really believe how bad it was. I have to look at thousands of old films and am willing to give them a product of their time, but this was very difficult. <br /> <br /> If others have identified, the biggest problem is that it doesn't 'seem to know what it wants to be: a gentle romantic comedy, comedy slapstick or music. I was being beaten when Jeannie Carson suddenly broke a song about 15 minutes! It is not reliable for any level, either the story of the story itself or the fact that Daisy has never been seen to be at any risk. Other things that are embarrassing to trust include the creation of a suave Donald Sinden as a songwriter (a songwriter for God!), The truth that Diana Dors for the woman and does not seem to have little interest in her (I mean, Diana Omba! !) And an amazing location in the office of the publisher of the song. Anything is silly in the worst way possible. If I needed to take a favorite place at the beginning with an amazing actor Wilfred Lawson - after everything came down to a great way.
