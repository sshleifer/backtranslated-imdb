It is a pity that you can't beat a zero star on IMD, because I couldn't hesitate! In fact I would like to go away and say that this film was in the wrong star. <br /> <br /> I, like many others, bought this film to think that because it has Michael Madsen in it, it can be good ... No chance! This movie was awesome! Think of the length of the film 'Bold and Good', well, the Primal Instinct did not come even closer to that beautiful, and I had previously thought there was nothing worse than the length of the film 'The Bold and Beautiful'. Michael Madsen, how can you do that for us? The worst part, I had no speed at the moment, I was hoping that at the end they would explain that it was any kind of sick joke, who thought it would be funny to make us look at the worst movie. Redirect - Zero Stars, Screenplay - Zero Stars, Stars - Stars Zero, Movies - Zero Stars, Effects Digital - Zero Stars, Designs, Stars, Stars, Stars - Half of Stars, Graphic Design - Half Star, DVD Menu - Half Star. <br /> <br /> However I think it's very important to see a bad film just to find out what the worst films are, because I am so glad that I have seen this film, just to have a bad film to put down my list.
