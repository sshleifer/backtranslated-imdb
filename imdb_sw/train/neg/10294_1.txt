Nothing happens. <br /> <br /> Then unsuspecting characters continue. <br /> <br /> Then the end will not come because there is no beginning or middle. <br /> <br /> There are good shots that are made not good because they are not even allowed, because this film does not exist. No "is" in this film because no plot or characters or themes or ideas or symbols or discussions or dialogue or action. There is nothing! <br /> <br /> There is a good point: it has a good voice sound. But the voice editing is the same as the appropriate movie is that the look is not recommended even when you are, so if you are very interested, I would recommend to go and buy voice sounds or something. You will find everything you can from this film without fatigue, headaches, and patience. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
