I bought this DVD for $ 1 at Walmart. After seeing it, I would like to return to the shop and try to get my money! The only reason I gave the movie 2 and not 1 is that the story contains several stories of the novel story, although it does not increase the rate of interest. This film has all the features that are provided for the low-down cinema market, the act of amateur and the free sex spot (for early 60 film). In fact, I wonder if the only reason the film was made is to make a quick goat AND because someone knew some of the attackers who could use it as an extra. The film is about a wacko doctor who wants to transplant the girl's head cut off from the body of an unsuspecting assistant. Most of the potential donors are skanky monitors or examples - the only aim in the film is to make it as they remove most of their clothes. However, they continue to make a movie that deserves to look at the naughty bits and films are not so bad enough to deserve watching and bad movie buffs.
