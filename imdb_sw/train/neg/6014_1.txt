Left Back is a fantastic waste of $ 17 million. Acting is weak and unsuitable, the story still has weak. Observers are asked to believe in the most insignificant and often sufficient line and do not get anything for their good faith. It's not just a film that is not suitable to work and written it is very difficult in all technical areas to make a film. Production production has nothing to support the credibility of the action. These effects are normal and flat. Lighting and general promotion are very bad; even compared with movies and ten parts of the budget. However, none of these will handle that millions of families undoubtedly accept the film with beauty and religious doctrine; and who can blame them. However it is unfortunate that they will be forced to accept the third film of the third film.
