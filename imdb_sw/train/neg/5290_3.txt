I am not the same one moving film. I am trying to see good points and unintentional evil, but in this case, there is almost no good points. In my opinion, if you do something wrong, why are you bothering? The part of the film takes pictures of Anne's face while breathing deeply, and the violin music is back. another place is full of poor and wooden works. Rupert Penry Jones does not know. Jennifer Higham has a younger sister of Anne and modern ways. Anne is shown to be slow and self-destructive, which is well at first, but she resembles the same through the film, and does not see any reason for captain Wentworth fall in love with him. In general, the production has no meaning for the period, and many mistakes are overlooked, like running out of the concert, kissing on the street, walking around the road without a high hat (why this area in the film all the time? written.). By summary, a terrible film, very disappointing.
