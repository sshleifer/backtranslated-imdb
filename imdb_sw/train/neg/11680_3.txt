This movie was most likely - thrown by force, a powerful idea and a clear budget beautiful. I'm not sure where all went wrong, but each of those things was lost. The story does not go anywhere, the characters were hollow to say the least and the results were stimulating, useless, losing film. I liked it. Looking at other votes, I am a few here and I must have some kind of freak. However, I thought that this film was awesome. I was very optimistic, but I was very disappointed. Some desire was the character of Jody Foster. A very cocky “fixer” kind makes a good idea. Jody was brave and sexy, but the character did nothing and went anywhere. Denzel Washington played the same character he always plays - fun but nothing new.
