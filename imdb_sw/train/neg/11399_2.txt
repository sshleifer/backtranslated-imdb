I can't believe that I lost 80 minutes of my life watching this horrible film I kept hoping that it would be better at the end but the boy I was wrong. The plan was bad, acting was very bad and special effects were bad. Even two beautiful girls could not revive my interest in this boring and bloody confusion. However, I cannot lie, some of the lines in this film were not remembered as when the Asian teenager says '' I lost my daughter to a child of the generation so f **** '' waste your time with this accident unless you are ready or want to have a good laugh. perhaps that way you can watch it to hit this movie with other men
