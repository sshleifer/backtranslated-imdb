Last Score (average range of standard-acting movies, performances, creativity, achievements, humor, fun, ect): <br /> <br /> 4.3 (out of 10) Was "Atlantis: Lost Dollar" coming out a few years ago it would look like bold, new trends in Disney animation. However, it comes only after a year after the creative and very close "King of the King" and points to the return of Disney from "Disney System" to repeat. I am a great fan of the length of the Disney film features. See them all they like or dislike. "Atlantis" is thrown to "20,000 links below sea" and similar events of live-sci-fi of 50s and 60s. The problem is that this difficult version has one original idea. It feels like a remake of something, even more than remney real remakes (Tarzan, The Hunchback of Notre Dame). The characters are slightly more than the conventional toddlers who are producing these types of films (an odd ship, gung generally, poor women sassy). Most of that Milo That (Fox) and Rourke (Garner) support is flat-out obnoxious. Movie is also experiencing fast speed. Instead of opening it on the epic story, Disney engages a lot of time of short-term moving on opportunities to develop ... suspence, characters, anything really. They give us this new and wonderful world and we will not only get our barings. At the moment it makes the controversy a simple story. Animation is dark and dreary and cheap. This seems like morning morning cartoons. Let's hope they never forgot that traditional 2D animation can still be amazing. "Giant Iron" among others has shown that. The way: Exhibition, speed, and lack of naturalness. It is a good place for the death of Disney Villain for a long time. It's a creative display of the film.
