Four best friends of lauvinist pigs (with emphasis on pigs) meet each week at NYC's food to write their sexual will in this misanthropic and visceral comedy. Peet is a common denomination who sets three bachelors in a group that causes a crisis and "inevitable" strikes. Although the film's capability has the potential and there is a wonderful time to have, generally the flick does not work especially at the end where girls are seen to be better than boys who run against the story crux. One of the one-fake one man and several manufacturers, "Striking" is likely to be interested only in the type of men who think "The Man Show" is Emmy's equipment.
