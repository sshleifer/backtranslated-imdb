I say Oedpius Rex because it is a tragedy that this film was made !!! This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen! I'm not in any way Uwe Boll hates as many unhappy people on IMD! Uwe Boll's films like postal and tunnel rats are very bad and are therefore entertaining. But honestly, this film was just awesome. I hated so much that I could give a zero star if I could. Stories are just decorate! It takes five years of film to create the plot and then it has a middle which is just a grizzly scary episode that is not recommended to be killed! Finally ended with "the success of the villan ended" which is quite acceptable but surely it would be more delicious than this! I'm not against Uwe Boll (as I said earlier) and not against violence movies! I f ** king likes films of violence! I loved Saw movies, Hostel movies, Tokyo Gore Police, New York Ripper, 28 movies, Dog Soldiers, My Blood Valentine, Last House on the left, Spectator, Wolf Creek, every movie of Tarantino, every Sam Peckinpah, even the Cannibal f ** king Holocaust! But this! OMFG !!! This was cruel, sad and misleading! And look at the movies I am listed! If I loved the Cannibal Holocaust and not so then it must be bad! Be, don't go back again to darkness! You are funny when you are a bright light, such as Ed Wood. This was just a bad experience! I felt awesome every time you see this! Don't see it! AVOID IN ALL!
