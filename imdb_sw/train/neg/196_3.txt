This film is bad in many borders. Like many before it, it shows more of mythology of Alamo than history. Production is poor, generally providing a sense of well-being for many actors who could have other work on Hollywood stadiums. This was the most serious mistake - I know the age and general involvement of the real Alamo characters and the geriatric involvement of television operators chosen to show them never allow any reliable impression. <br /> <br /> As a natural Texan, I had a story. Later I learned more about history. I can accept the best production from any perspective (although I prefer historical accuracy), but this has not given you the opportunity to enjoy. Even John Wayne's or Fess Parker versions had more life than this stolid aggression, while it was very accurate. <br /> <br /> It is very disappointing - to avoid.
