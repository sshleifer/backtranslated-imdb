Under the barrel, unthinkable, and an irreplaceable example of THE ROAD WARRIOR. This film follows a real plot like a Filipino film STRYKER and is even worse! Wrong work, dialogue, effects, meditation, walking, practical procedure ... The list goes on. Italy made a lot of fighting on the road of the Warrior early 80 years, some good, bad. This is worse, there is no competition. Not only was the feeling of the film so lighter and sad, the experience of staying this way is bearing and half. There was 1 (one) good tracking sequence towards the beginning of the film, and a good shot of a man with a grenade pushing hand. But everything else on this very solid film! For the real pleasure of post-nuke, follow a copy of ENDGAME, after entering NEW YORK, or ESCAPE from BRONX instead. They are more enjoyable than this garbage.
