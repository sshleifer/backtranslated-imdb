I found that this film has taken a lot of insult. Perhaps it got some of them, but it wasn't bad. Well, I'll be honest: I don't want to see this film again. It was a bad film. But I don't know this film, tried to tell the story. As a celebration, this film can work very well. I think the film monitors lost the road to take when they made this (they should add more bits if they like to be comedy). To reset it, it can be a good film. But as satire, it did not work in its current form - many events did not take place in the context of the plot: for example, the location of theft makes little sense in the story. However, it was not the worst independent film made - it's in the top 10 worst? That's possible.
