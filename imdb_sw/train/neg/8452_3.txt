This is the first time I have commented on the film because I felt that if a good person reads it, they can get up and do something about it. Over the past few months, ABC Family began to announce a new movie style. I have seen the last three and enjoyed it. They had been involved with the trick. My wife likes these movies. I expected to see "See Jane Date". The trailers looked and seemed to be huge. Unfortunately, this is one film where the book should be a few years before the efforts shown by writers and musicians involved with this project. In 2003, the source (rough), the score was interesting as an elevator ride in the department store. It was intrusive and did not add any emotional content to the film at all. It worked against him. I work in film and television business. I am happy to have fun. This is one example where I kept thinking it could be worse. The script had lines from another decade and I know that these women can act but you can't know from this film. To add to the general experience, the end left me shaking my head. Advisors to Disney, ABC, ABC family and producers: Under any circumstances please employ a musician or music administrator to make any future film. They have lost touch and they need to understand what the word "modern", "now" and "now" means when describing the romantic comedy. There is a world that you are going through. All in great desire from people on Von Zerneck-Sertner and ABC Family.
