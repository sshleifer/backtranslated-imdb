I came to NEW PORT SOUTH anticipating the movie of the generation on the killings of Columbine's school as the ELEPHANT of Van Van Sant and certainly a lesson in the TV guide indicating that a rebel community against the system gave me that feeling but this is a very interesting movie where it happens a little to think of yourself warning <br/> The story is about Maddox, a Chicago secondary school student who decides to go back to what she sees as a government authority. The main problem is that such behavior is written by the actors who play with Blake Shields can't win any deficit of the script. You have a hearing disorder that Maddox should have a bad charisma of Hitler, Saddam or Bin Laden but he has never been anything more than a young man with an impressive and impossible to believe that he can present students. Subtext of you to overcome one of the regulatory authorities only to change it with another fraudulent rule is very obvious that means NEW PORT SOUTH is a very unpleasant game that is worth nothing to your way to see
