They often voted for China's largest film ever with Chinese critics, as well as Chinese film lovers, and in fact, I have not. I saw it is one of the generic melodramas thought, directed to blandly and acting, with a perfect shrew for the protagonist. Wei Wei (do not laugh) is that shrew, a young woman who has been injured with her tubercular husband (Yu Shi) for the past several years. It was after WWII, and they lived with the husband of a young husband (Hongmei Zhang) in a house without a lot of money (someone was employed when they were married). Together comes a former friend of the husband (Wei Li), who was also a friend of the wife when they were young. She thinks to run away from her husband and this man, while a very good husband remains, thinking she can share her little sister with her friend. That's set-up, and doesn't get anywhere you could expect. I have seen remake, directed by Blue Kite Zhuangzhuang Tian director. It works half an hour again, and in fact it's kind of dull, too, but at least it was good. This is commonly taken.
