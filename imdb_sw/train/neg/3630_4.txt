It should be thought that those who loved this film (“more opera,” did not read somewhere?) Don't worry about opera, don't worry Wagner, or don't worry about anything except their desire to be promoted. Although it is a representation of the song of the swan of Wagner, or as a movie, this strikes me as an unfortunate catastrophe, and a leading guide to the similarities to the identification of tricksy, lugubrious texts of literature. It is worried that people who think about opera (or, for that, to play, especially for Shakespeare) are "close" should be allowed anywhere near the playground or film studio; Syberberg, very fashionably, but without the slightest rights from the writings of Wagner, decided that Parsifal is a "top" sexual partnership, so that the character of the title, in the latter stages, transmutes that kind of beatnik babe, though someone who keeps singing The top pastor - a few like any of the actors in the film are singers, and we get two doses of Armin Jordan, a trainer, who looks like a face (but not hearing as a sound) of Amfortas, and also looks monstrously by deleting twice as a Batonzilla type or Supervisor Ate Monsalvat while playing Good Friday music - which, by the way, the natural beauty of the transcendant is represented by the spread of shop shops and flaccid baskets that remain in the wrong turf, is the benefit that reduces me. At the playground we sometimes have to overcome this lack of imagination, but I can't think why Syberberg could not enter, for Parsifal and Gurnemanz, the mountain pastures as lushi as given to Julie Andrews in the Sound of Music. The loud and trumpet sounds especially have a aura glare that adds another kind of fatigue for impatience and a lack of power and genetic paralysis. Another person in another revision described the Bayreuth record of 1951, and Knappertsbusch, although its tempi is often very slow, had what the Jordan did not have at all, the feeling of blow, feeling for the spread of music and after half a century, The voice of orchestral in that set, in modern media, is still better than this film.
