This is an amateur movie on video, not a "voting game" such as a drawing of a DVD that says a fake. I have found the best things from the lowest film students. Most of the stories comes with all the taxi trips around Jakarta. This film could be made using a single video camera, but there are few places where two cameras were used and the content was hit together later. Editing is very bad. The last edit was probably made by two cameras, bouncing content back and forth, rather than the appropriate editor. Maybe they did editing in the taxi too? English publications were written by an unsuitable person in English, e.g., "When you go now?" Saying the quality of production is the same as the Blair witch is generous. If you are not afraid yet, this film was humanitarian and creative, with many cool and funky pictures from Jakarta around.
