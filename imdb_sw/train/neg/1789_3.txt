Although I have enjoyed Bing Crosby in other movies, I see this movie being sandy. Maybe because I come from different times with different countries, but I've got a record of the continuous Crosby and the good American Old for the first time, over time and finally sad. Do not make a mistake - I am not fighting the US anything - but it seemed that English was not fair and / or needed this hero, oh so an American visitor with ignorance to show them the way. It's a story of "fish out of water", but unlike many movies of this kind, this time is "fish" who has a hand. To be fair to myself and the movie, I have watched it a few times published over a few years and get the same feeling every time. I looked at another movie of Crosby last night - Waltz's Emperor - and so, also provided similar answers to me. And for my surprise even my wife - who is worth it is the US - got your "face" "The American Crosby view is very angry. Many exhibits for Teddy Roosevelt, as he put it.) The beauty and music are also beautiful, such as the big dress - although I agree with the inspector who passed that the William Bendix wig appears to be bad (Moe's Stooges three pictures). <br /> <br /> All in all for me this will be the most beautiful pictures without Bing Crosby but because she is almost every shot is hard to stay through this movie.
