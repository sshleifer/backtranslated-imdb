who ever ever ever consider watching this excuse sorry for the film. how it is beaten, looking, acts etc. just useless. it is very bad to check. The loads of clips are repeated more than patience. there is no one 'ordinary' in the entire film and the existence of 'the outside world' is good, does not exist. and why is this young man not able to fail suddenly? This film is more ridiculous. sufur.
