It happened to an attack on Prescient 13 in 2005, happened to the Lost Children in 2008 and now happened to another classic from Wargames to 80. Why, oh why, oh why Hollywood never learned? alone ...! Can't restore ...! They tend ..! We all hate ....! Those who have not seen the previous version 1983 by Matthew Broderick & Ally Sheedy, walk lease / buy now ... !! Materials can look at the date, special effects are not a new millennium but it still claps this rubbish hands ... \ t came as a kind of "floppy" type, and now we are able to avoid this film as a nuclear war! <br>> <br /> Never before the "good chess game" appeared the best choice ....
