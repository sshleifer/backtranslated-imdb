... and I actually gave ZERO my rate of 1-10. I have been attending movies since 1952 and I have seen more than 1000 in the theater (I am not the standard movies I see on TV only). This is the only movie I saw ZERO. My wife and I took our four children (then 15, 11, 8 and 6) and even the children thought it was bad. In fact, he was my daughter (now 26) who warned me on this site (he was surprised that the movie was getting a total of 4+). The dinosaurs animation seemed to be amateurish at the time (and it is even worse to return), acting (especially for Sean Young) is angry and the line of the story is simply gentle. <br /> <br />
