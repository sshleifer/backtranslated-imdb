I've been waiting for this film for a long time. Especially because Juhi Chawla is in this, she is a good actress. <br /> <br /> This movie has six stories. It's a new concept from Hollywood. So it's not a new item. 1. The kite (priyanka chopra) is a player. He wants to get popular and makes a boyfriend leave the journalists interested in it. But Rahul (Salman Khan) looks and claims to be his partner. Priyanka Chopra is still not a good actor. When he screams, I'm angry. Salman khan can not play the role of comic. But in his great place he is wonderful. Vinay (Anil Kapoor) is married to Seema (Juhi Chawla). He gets a midlife crisis and is attracted to a very young woman, and forgets what she has in life; his wife and children. Anil kapoor en Juhi are characters of nature / characters. They are beautiful. But this story is thin to them. Shiven (Akshaye Khanna) will go to marry Gia (Ayesha Takia), but gets cold feet and bounces. Ashutosh (John Abraham) is married to Tehzeeb (Vidya Balan). He gets an accident and loses memory loss. Now she does not know that she loves her husband again. Raju (Govinda) is a cab driver. She meets Stephani (Shannon Esrechowitz) who is a white woman who loves a male Indian but she is almost married to an Indian woman. Raju brings Staphani to that person, but he loves him. I didn't like Govinda movies. He is very sad, not funny. But in this film I loved him very much, as he has been years ago. <br /> <br /> 6. Yes yes! There Sohail Khan! She plays Ram Dayal who is married to Phoolwati (Isha Koppikar). He wants to get a big step with him, but every time his family comes in. <br /> Sohail Khan is not a good actor, but it's funny! I love his movies. <br /> <br /> Now there is a problem. All these stories are not interesting. Making one story from six notable stories is not suitable for the whole interesting movie! Here and there the stories touch each other, but not important to the characters. <br /> <br /> My end; Priyanka can not act! Loose woman in the bollywood industry. Sohail Khan should make more movies, this role in him was very small. Salman Khan can not do the comic tasks, but real concrete movies. It is written about his life as an actor. This film comes, and it is losing to good actors and actors like Anil Kapoor, Juhi Chawla, Akshaya Khanna and John Abraham. It is like you are able to make a film with Amitabh Bachchan, and you just let him sing songs.
