OK. I think the TV show is a kind of cute and always has some kind of subject. So, when my children decided to see this film, I decided to print. I wish I could stay home and watch TV show instead. The fact that humor is stupid and unfamiliar is a little problem than this movie. The program is close to nonexistence, the characters seem to exist in the void, and, above all, Gadget does not carry any subject. It seems that Disney took all the things that do the Auditor General's work on the TV and dismiss them all. In order to be fair, my little child (8 years old) liked the movie but an old man (10 years old) came to think it was arrogant (he was too old for young humor but very young for any adult humor). br /> <br /> Normally, I love Disney movies but this is one kilometer. It is the same for a very young age (say 7 to 9) but you must miss it for everyone.
