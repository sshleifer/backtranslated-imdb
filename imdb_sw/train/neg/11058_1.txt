Failure and disappearance of a true criminal film that has hit the character of actress Jeremy Renner, who is ignorant through Jeffrey Dahmer, who was easily one of the many killers of the last century. Released directly in the video earlier in 2003, "Dahmer" is a very interesting, interesting, very interesting and bloody conversation of a bloodless drama of real crime that is not really necessary to enter into a proud and murderous psyche the killer of the murder as it had the best ability to do! What makes, however, an attempt to do for unknown reasons causes some kind of sympathy for a viewer to a person by showing him that it is ultimately a homosexual, a very tough man and a very strong man who did not just look 'in love in places. all the evil against the cold, counting and misleading sicko and madman that was! In general, 2003 "Dahmer" is one of which the real crime of every place can also fly because I am not kidding when I say that it is one of the worst serial-killer killers ever done! It is even a magician than other improper and contaminated rubbish like "Gacy", "Bundy", "Ed Gein" and "The Night Stalker"! (Turkey-Zero Stars)
