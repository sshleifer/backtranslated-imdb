"Care Care" and Dorna von Rouveroy are one of the worst horror movies found. Elderly old George Kennedy completely disappears as Professor Bruckner. The famous surgeon has a car accident. She lives 7 years of coma and then wakes up and goes to blood damage. "Intensive Care" is clearly affected by American player's films. including "Halloween" and "Friday" of the 13th series. These murders are a polygamy and a conversation is very foolish. Even if you are in good condition you can give this piece of garbage. You laugh until you hurt this one-you can believe me!
