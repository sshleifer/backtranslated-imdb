To hear that reputation on this play, I decided to look at it when I fell on the cable. I don't see how this “can” women and their “experiments” based on the existing topic. I think if you are interested in stories about women's privacy and how they affect their lives, then this is for you. Otherwise, it is rather lighter and frightening. If anything, I got a little. I asked a girlfriend who also looked at this and thought it was too bad. So, not just a person "not getting".
