This film was yawn from the names of credit, it is boring to the decline and acting it is wood and stilted! This was certainly the director Richard Jobson leading the first, but who was the most beautiful green color script as a similar development like this? It seems like another money under the government's cancellation project (Scottish Screen is an amazing reputation, surprise). I almost slept three times and my opinion unfortunately should be more restricted than this. Please please please Mr. Jobson what you did before leading this sedative film, go back!
