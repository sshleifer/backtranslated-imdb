Good plot, the possibility of a malfunction of the car, with the fumbling characters. For the first time I thought that this film was made during the seventy years, since the quality of the picture, as well as stories and drama seemed to be taken from the former Kojac. When I searched and found that it was actually done as -97 I was surprised. This is one of the worst and smaller movies I have seen. If you read this, be advised, if you see you are losing time you could do something more exciting, like looking at dry colors.
