When I was in school I made a film about a couple walking around trees and talking, and I realized half by way of editing that this was not just a beautiful but fun strategy for a Canadian film: a sodden wedding voice open, such as a problem in definition community. But any of my failures of my own film feel better after seeing this ... this thing .... For one thing, my was running for 20 minutes, not 85, and it had much more content: every worthless business here is beaten for four minutes, five, six. Male leadership is very strange, beaten with a face face, loudly beaten and given to the release of the drama game of the definition of philosophy from U to T pub, and is given lots of opportunities to make us let us sing. In fact if it was not such a hole then the third act would do little, if two emerging girls show that they offer different and improper 'values'; but it does not make it easier to look at caged hits "please" almost to the local newspaper. I take what I said about AUTUMN PORN, which at least had the courage of his pastor offender: this movie theater and will remain the most severe Canadian movie of all time. At least, I really hope so.
