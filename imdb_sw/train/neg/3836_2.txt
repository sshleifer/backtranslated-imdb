If one of the few consultants has not seen the first film, I found this to be a very disappointing movie. Yes, it has an odd type of humor if you can carry it (too). However, it easily fails in key areas. There is a thin and nonsensical line involving Gordon's kind of friend who can or cannot be included in the program to send electricity to Third World countries - perhaps on free computers ... or maybe not. It is unclear, long-term and unavailable. Any lack of tribalism is very interesting and what is present is quite modern and completely legal. The film feels half finished. The suspension of unbelief is very difficult when witnessing a very attractive female teacher (Mary Doyle Kennedy) can attract Gordon Sinclair's character, especially when it reduces her progress. Laughable. Later in the film when he reaches his romantic expectations then it gives us all away from certain values ​​according to the little evidence of worthless value. Most movies do not let me hear, but I felt my time was stolen.
