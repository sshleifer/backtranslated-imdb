Lee attended 100 years of fear for Ted Newsom and was talking about waswolves of the film. He said something that his only effect with lycanthropy was The Howling II, then he locked himself, "Few said on that it was better." Surely it was right if this film could be the worst in all its screen displays. The first lament with Joe Dante was a very good-looking movie with its amazing effects and a sense of fashion and subject. It was a film taken seriously. Like other original films, filmmakers for some of the strange reasons thought that even more columns were needed instead of what worked for the first time (See CHUD then CHUD II to show this example). This film is miles and miles away from the first each. There is nothing frightening about it. It seems to be cheaper and is a black pitch in many ways of major events. Lee is the only actor in mentioning a valuable film (similar, I will prevent Ferdy Mayne too). Lee looks ashamed as he says inane dialog and he has crazy things (see that he ended with Stirba). Lee looks very tired and knows what is missing this is what is tad more than more than two guides who come from America to Romania. The story has no value to explore here, and you can beat the beta there is a very small story to mention when you should have Stephen Parsons and his Babel band to play a large amount of films at the beginning and the end and the bad noise. Sybil Danning is here and, yes, he disintegrates once and then we find the area that has been shown repeatedly and again - one inspector said 17 times (I counted ten - but it could be very tired from my mind for that point). I gave the film three stars, but in fact they deserve zero - three I gave was 1 for Lee and two for Mrs Danning's contributions. Yuck!
