A fascinating concept and a story that has not worked at all. When you see the film, you will probably be unhappy with the end as I did. I did not know who was going to put it on the film, Taye Diggs seemed angry as a detective, other characters seem to be direct and unpleasant. If the victim of Alicia (Mia Kirschner) was more than a beautiful girl, we can be glad to see the deal coming down and the offender is brought to justice. The problem was that she was like a girl like other girls, turning from a beautiful girl to create an interesting session. I can't understand the moral message of this film, and if the story of spying and thriller doesn't work.
