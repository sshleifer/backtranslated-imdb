This movie got very silly when things started to happen. I was not worried about any characters; Susan Walters was very angry, and the leading actor (forgeting his name) also had my nerves. He could not remember how it ended and so on but the whole idea of ​​visitors with human bodies and all seemed only ignorant in this film, things did not bear. My father told me it's stupid movie ... I had to listen to him.
