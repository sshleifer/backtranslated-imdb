It's unfortunate that you can't go under one star. Before looking at the Wicker Man, I had taken into consideration 3 guests that the only film that would be similar to the negative stars. For all rights, Wicker Man does not enjoy the previous film, but the fact remains that my curiosity is reduced by seeing it. There is also a cheap trick also often used in Hollywood when manufacturers are very interested in recruiting a good or very fast authors to bring it to a satisfactory conclusion: clapping at the end of the shocker and hope that the public will do it with something artistic or meaningless. It is a gambit which rarely succeeds and in this case can only be disgusting to a good actor and laugh at producers. Even more so because the "effectiveness" (or yet they put it) the conclusion was not found logically from the plot (which I usually cannot explain above without introducing the attackers), and instead refuses what the character was closed to that point. <br /> <br /> It is a film that can deny logically for psychopaths, pedophiles, and maybe die-hard Nicholas Cage fans, but for a few of the ordinary audience. If you want something on these lines, I recommend Mr. Night Night Shyamalan Village instead. Not having some kind of memory note, I think I need to look at something better to keep him from my thoughts, say, the Tomate Attack or the Pee-wee Group Big Adventure?
