If another Hitler will come out, it will be thanks to the false part of this film, which spreads the strange idea that it was at the end of the day that was clearly seen from the beginning. In addition to following the man and choosing him in the highest office in the country, intelligent people would cross the cross to stop him, and he would die in the ditch, without name and unknown. he reads accounts of close friends of Hitler - for example, his journalist Traudl Junge - will fail by the fact that people saw him as a wise, intelligent and generous person. He was also a brilliant member, and the fact that his talks seem to be very high and emerging by modern ears deny the times that were made, while breathing was common in political talks. Ditto's anti-Semitism revolutionary, which was not the central board of the first Nazi - who were particularly anti-communist - nor ordinary or unusual at times. The film makes it look like Hitler's own desire since the beginning was the Holocaust. If you want to identify the second person who will cause the deaths of millions of millions, you can ignore the lively ravers that are shown here. Look for the most beautiful, grateful person whose remarks encourage the whole nation, and the visible and beneficial political work of the country. I'm afraid of his personality will be like Barack Obama than Fred Phelps. <br /> <br /> I expected much here, and I had nothing but caricature. Fools who did this committed a crime against the truth. This is the same historical record of 'The Reefer'.
