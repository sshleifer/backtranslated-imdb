I was recently on the web to watch a website showing public domain movies. In their long list of films it was this film and I thought I should have a reminder to that head of rejection and premise. But, no, that's true. And since the film was only 27 minutes, I decided to try. If it has become a cinema movie, I would like to stop watching. Instead, it happened to be the most amazing film I saw. Danish workers tried, with a $ 49 budget, to make a Star Trek film about male gay workers traveling on the galaxy to get rid of female bullying by killing all women - as they did on Earth! And in each case, they met with cheers and thanks from the people of the current sex world. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is not. And some of the worries and teenagers' names I have ever heard, I don't even think I can write to IMDb without having my comments removed! However, in spite of the absolute disappointment of all this, it was a very strange and worthwhile peek. But, as I said already, because of unfamiliar names and common things (though there is no dirt), it's just a film for adults. The way, this film has left me 1001 questions like WHO will do this, WHAT DO YOU DO with WHO is the required audience? It may not be the worst thing I have seen, but maybe it's very strange and possible offensive!
