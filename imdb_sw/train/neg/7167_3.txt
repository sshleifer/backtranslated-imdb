He saw the trailer for this on another video, and decided to hire when it came out. Boy, I was desperate! The story is very boring, acting (away from Christopher Walken) is bad, and I wasn't worried about the characters, away from wanting to see Nora's husband losing. Christopher Walken's role is thrown away, do you?
