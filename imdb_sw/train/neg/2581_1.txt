First to get my personal feelings apart and let me start by saying that I hate so-called comedi where each character is written and plays as a fool that you injure as a result of all the crossing. <Br /> <br /> Now I will tell you this I saw the first American Pie movies and when they were not amazing movies that I would be seeing have been the same (and artists have been compared to "America" ​​three Pie Presents "film), I still feel compelled to ask what hell they were thinking when they made this film ?: /> <br /> I also have a few other questions too. <br /> <br /> Who thought that this was the use of acceptance of studios and production resources ?? /> <br /> who accepted the final script (and what was the person who smoked when they passed it?)? /> <br /> And why did anyone think it should be opened on a movie where the average cost of The entry is between 10 and 15 dollars depending on where you are living when you should go directly to the Blockbuster or Wal Mart? s goal. There are many errors with this film that I can't write a comprehensive review for The reason will exceed The above words allowed on this platform will only touch you on the great things caused by it. The program is commonly unsupported by the ignorant and all the characters are about to attract as a look at a dry color for eight minutes but the big thing that I can see wrong with this film is acting. <br /> <br /> While most of the cast do not have talent without namers who may have forgotten in a few years, <br /> <br /> just one and the biggest name in this film is Eugene Levy who uses almost all the time on the screen and this knows how to scream on his face which says to the viewer "I know this is not funny and I break the talent but I got to pay for who is concerned" does not even try to make any of his funny jokes (better than this garbage). As I said above above all of the cast is awesome though some of them have been in some of the major TV shows, Tyrone Savage (from classic Canada Wind Wind At My Back) has a character that cannot be connected to the wrong irritating (there are things that he could teach tropical diseases) that almost want to die a slow and painful death on screens, Christopher McDonald (NCIS, Law and Command) depends solely on the screens and loses what he has to be in this film . <br /> <br /> Maybe the next film in this series will only be the core of the porn pin and the line of the story so that they can move around MPAA and get R rating that this movie goes out for non-infinite clay and unconscious content and provides content The sex without a point that would have gained a rating of X (the testing board should be fed or used drugs when they passed this film to its rating). It is interesting that twenty-five years ago when Wes Craven presented the Nightmare On Elm Street to MPAA for a review review they forced him to cut twenty-five seconds of the video (I believe it was part of the death-stricken area of ​​silicone in it). to avoid getting the rating of X and did not have any other choice but to make or the film was not released, <br /> <br /> but this type of improper garbage could not get R rating today because all has been done in the name of comedy, like this movie it was a drama or fear and this kind of content would have a great deal about what it was and would have been afraid of X. <br /> <br /> The last thing that distorted me is writing, this movie is written to play as a rainbow dream of a twelve-year-old child with enough sexual orientation of her newborn and non-crass sex, almost every hygienic situation that should be moved a corpse in this film calls a joint plot is telegraphed that any intelligent viewer can see me coming miles away from those who are called characters of ethical displays, worrying frequent sexual references and non-regular events The sex-off behavioral nature feels like this film has been written with a full year of the first year of school tax writing script. <br /> <br /> The long and shortest time is its time to kill this series before getting the most passer crass and offensive, this pie is full of road apples.
