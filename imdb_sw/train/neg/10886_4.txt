I just looked for condoms for the second time. I was enjoying it earlier and I thought it would make a good Friday night film, some of the year, some style, humor and so on. I was surprised to see that I could no longer understand. It seemed as if someone had gone to refer to the criminals of the baseball like the Demons Night to the modern audience but lost things that made the original. For record I am not even a big fan of the Demons Night, but there were some things I stole. Convent has cheese but it is not very good. In addition to the great girl (good performance from Joanna Canton), the girl of goth and sweet comeo from Adrienne Barbeau pretty much all the characters were very different, with an increasingly low level of moronic, hate jockhood. So the film has been reduced by a lack of an improper fraud that means that, because of bad conversation, it is difficult to look at the characters and difficult to grasp the good points of the film. The perpetrators of evil are original in design and find beautiful scenes, although they are not afraid they certainly kinda cool, and the film also covers the right amount of good year. To the end, while Adrienne Barbeau is in the place the film becomes very entertaining because all the uncomfortable people have died and have their frenzy bad. Stylized patterns also occasionally provide good results, although sometimes the camera goes very fast. All in all, this was a film that for me a very good score can not create the things I hated. Those who love more of this type of film can enjoy much more, but for me it was not a good time.
