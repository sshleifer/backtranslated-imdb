I usually would give this film 6. It covers a very important topic and makes it very good - with Katie Wright which is a success and itself. I don't know if he was actually instructed to play a character like this or usually light, but he did an amazing job to make it possible for me to keep Lexi. There is no direction to anyone than to be confused, helpless and does not know she is, and how she is very good. I can understand how a little girl defends herself for losing her friend and who has an eating disorder without control can be worried, panic and pain. However, the entire Wright performance depends on the right and sewing without breathing, others play. I could not help but feel this problem of a girl that was caused not by a demon that is Bulimia, but because she had no spine. I'm very doubtful that that's why the movie aims to do.
