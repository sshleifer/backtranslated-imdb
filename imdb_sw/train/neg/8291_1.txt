The dentist finds that his wife was unfaithful. Therefore, there are no new lines of stories here. However, the authors were able to create a stupid, disgusting film. If you like to enjoy children vomiting, or to see a dentist thinking that he draws his wife's teeth out of a kind of blood panic, to see (or rent) the film. If not, continue to something else (MY FAIR LADY, anyone?)
