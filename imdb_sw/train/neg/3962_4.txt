I looked forward to seeing Nana after seeing Renoir's first work, the Whirlpool Fate. I had read that Nana generally had taken her film in silence so I was very optimistic. Sadly this looks like a great step back. Catherine Hessling is the main problem with this film. His acting is up, even with a silent film. His acting is like what a person could expect in a film from young people of the first year, not 20 years. It was also very difficult to believe that anyone would fall to this fatale of women. There was nothing interesting about it. The film was also a long time off, the camera function was not interesting (away from the horse's shot) and the editing was inappropriate. This story reminded the Pabst Pandora Box. It is interesting to compare these two because there are only 3 years between these films. The Pandora box is only marked on each level where Nana fails. This video is for only Renoir actors or great silent silent movies.
