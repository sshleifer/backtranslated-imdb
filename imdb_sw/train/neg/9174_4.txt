I often love zombie movies, but this was very bad. The best part: Girl swimming without being beaten with pigs, Sonya Salomaa, and Boobs of Ona Grauer beating on skimpy up when she ran away. The worst part: reduced video, the amount of Matrix speed (draws the action), not enough blood and cuts, acting badly, and no stories. Just another person in the playground was intelligent and right after the swimming area. The total destruction of $ 6 and time. I offer 2 out of 10.
