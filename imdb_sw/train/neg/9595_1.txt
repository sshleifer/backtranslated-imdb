In a recent movement to bring Asian films on America, this is the last movie that should be given here. Being a great fan of asian movies from all sorts, I was browsing the net and I saw soong to reopen the US market so I decided to check it out ahead of time and rent this in a local video store. I don't believe ... The action of the action is very desperate, Tiger and Iron Monkey voted this film completely into the water. Jet Li sleeps to sleep. If you are looking for military entertainment, your time would be better with Flick Jackie Chan! Moreover ... you think you are looking at military art and about the girl who venued the stage for her parents death but SURPRISE !!! The best hour of this middle movie is filled with dialogue, away from the action, lack of engaging in the tangent plot, pretty much NO to do on the premise we are open. It has more to do with the relationship between him and the boy, and the boy with his group of conspiracy that the producer / director did not spend time in devoting, and still volunteered part of the film that raises this issue. It would be much better if they refused the whole hour and develop the story itself through other films and focus on the aspect of martial arts. <br /> <br /> Speaking of which, in fact I do not believe the choreographer of Monkey Iron, made a series of steps in Princess Blade. I was completely abused in the regular use of slow motion and the rapid camera changes showed a quick physical kill. I didn't just buy it. Please ... I warn you to remove your time / money with this movie. The premise is intrigueing, and the trailer can even try you but I am positive that this movie is not suited to the public (perhaps Japan but not in the states) and it will be the worst film brought in the country from the Asian film industry.
