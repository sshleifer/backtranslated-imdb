Van Damme. What else can I say? Bill Goldberg. HERE TUNA. NOW we know this film will be very awesome. I saw the first five minutes of this film on TBS, knowing it would be bad. But even I thought it would be this bad. This program is very bad, Van Damme gets old (finally), but unlike Arnold, his movies too. <br /> <br /> Forgot this film. Don't see it. Forever. I can't even earn to see this film. <br /> <br /> 1/5 stars - in her heart is a wonderful beauty, moving in action. <br /> <br /> Well, maybe not, but sellers will be sure if we think it, isn't it?
