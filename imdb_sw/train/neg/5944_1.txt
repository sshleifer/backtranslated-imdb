Not in my Ghana, this step-by-step fight is one that I just met from a friend put it when we had a few beer. I am interested in the open, with a fan of Eamonn Walker, so I was ready to enjoy it. Blood and bone is the story of Isiah Bone, an old man who becomes a fighter road for unknown reasons which eventually continue as the film continues. Blah blah blah. <br /> <br /> It is a terrible movie. I understand that such films are not very dependent on conspiracy, but they should work in a false, incomprehensible story of a fool? It may not be necessary, but for golly gum does not annoy me. There is no good plot and cleaner action than the fleabag cycle of the story. Inserted by a shaded and degraded shade, it is similar to Turkish film with thin skin full of decaying material. I probably in this point to mention what, of course, the action of filming: fighting. Even itself, the war is rather poor. The bone can take the most powerful street fighters in one punch (a big yaf or two is an interesting attempt to fix this); The fighters who do not seem to conclude that the direct attack is a fool. Even this is a repeat and stupid, cracked weapons and faces have been hit by a sufficient understanding that we see on a regular basis. Running with a mill, movie-by-number movie that is absolutely appropriate for a DVD, is not something new and everything we have seen on a regular basis. And not exactly well.
