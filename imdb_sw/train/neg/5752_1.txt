I don't usually comment, but there are things that should be said. Where to start ... <br /> <br /> Acting, part of Jeremy London was awesome! I didn't think she would be so bad. The program can be good, if properly directed, with good performance from the leading actor. Unfortunately, this is one of the movies you read and you think it has a great potential to have fun, but get a passion from the beginning. Well, at least I got a good laugh. I can't waste my time if I was you.
