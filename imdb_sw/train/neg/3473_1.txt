This is the most likely movie of Christmas ever worse. The program is almost non-existent, acting (Affleck especially) is the poorest. Ben Affleck fans will be able to defend this film but deep down should agree. As far as I was able to collect the plot of Ben Affleck, a million businessman, he is told to go down to a place to remind him of his childhood and burn the list of things he wanted to forget since his childhood. By doing this he ends up paying a family living now at home to be his family for Christmas ... and that's it. The film continues and eventually he meets the daughter of the family .... blah blah blah.
