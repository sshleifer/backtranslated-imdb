Most of the Season 1 events are bad. There is no comparison to the Twilight or Outdoor Zone area, for such plans had lines of good story. Many amazing stories are very good. It is not surprising at least ... to rent or buy a series of Twilight area ... I've heard the 2nd Season of this series is better. which further reduce this participation. One cool thing is to see executives and administrators when they were younger in 1985 ... Most of the story lines are predictable even though the series would be much better to mislead and turn that you left ...
