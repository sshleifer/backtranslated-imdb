Alas, Hamlet poor. I knew him, dear reader, and let me tell you, CHAPTER VERSION This! I don't know who among all the people put money for this flotsam, but I hope they are proud of themselves. They took a normal play and turned it into the most attractive melodrama. This version is quite real, that even the presence of the great Thespian as Maximilian Schell in position position can save. The only effectiveness of the release of the movie is that you have made a meal for "MST3K"; Mike, Servo and Crow were very happy with this. But any way, I'm sure Shakespeare, having lived when they did this, didn't want his name to be associated with it. This "Hamlet" is not bad however good; it's just bad. Certainly terrible.
