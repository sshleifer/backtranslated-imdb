WARNING: I advise anyone who has not seen the film yet has not yet read these comments. Although I haven't seen them all, Hamiltons really gave one part of the entertainment, which didn't happen to me! I thought that usually with a bad acting, a plan of a stupid plan, leaving the end of the movie, which was very low, this film was hit! Okay, so they remove these are people who eat other people. So right, are these people involved, or are they, or what are they? I mean, maybe they are "things" that came here to see what people are leaving, or are those who have eaten people for a long time now, or maybe this movie was HHOORRIIBBLLEE !! WHAT IS NO! So if you think Hamiltons are good, I ask, why, why, why, why it was so amazing, because for me it was just a flat out awesome! One big BOOOOOOO for The Hamiltons !!! Go See Followers, Vino & Nail, or Borderland for a piece of entertainment !!!!!
