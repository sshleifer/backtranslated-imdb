Tom Wolfe's player, stressed carefully the novel of life among the snobbery of New York gets to look here but not well. The film is not only available from the miscasting of everyone Tom Hanks as Yuppie's indifference, Meluni Griffith's Kewpie as the south belle of the south and Bruce Willis (?!) As a New York city partner. Miscasting worse in the chair of the director. Robert Altman may have revived life in these same characters and made them interesting, but Brian De Palma, in his modern view, has never had an eye on human experience levels. The visual film looks good but it looks blah towards its lesson of destruction for the state of the situation. In fact, if the satire is not appropriate viewer anger, what does it mean?
