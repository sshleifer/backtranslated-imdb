This may be the worst material of Broadway music ever. Even the music has been destroyed. Attenborough does not know anything about the theater - almost every shot and when the ring lies. I will say, however, that it is very bad enough to be funny. <br /> <br /> Hair display is very interesting. I can't for my life understand what it means (conceptually) to open the film and out of the hall where "Chorus Line" plays. Do we think that these people are struggling with the "Chorus Line," which has stories about people who are trying? Oh, the show falls on its own. I saw the original production, and I listened to the album many times. Why, oh, why, they did it?
