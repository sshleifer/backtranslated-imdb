This is a very important piece of decoration I have lost one hour of my life. All I can say is to thank God for only one hour. More than half of this 'movie' is an image from the original "Crime Crime". At the very least, I was able to see important things from the common exploitation of exploitation, because for the real reason for defending the reason why my video shop just has "Insane II Crime" (as it was, "Crazy Fat Ethel II "). But some of this film are some of the worst images of home and video making film and back where you can see. Why is my video store this and not original? Why do such things really live in video stores? Why are people hiring and not to stimulate the copy immediately when they see their fear? Why - AAUUGGHH - Why, God, why? Unless you would like to enjoy the fruits that you eat eat all the sweets of candy in a slow-down area, or the fruit from the stair from the stair stair in a slower place, or the tendency to get away (don't ask) often The back, or the monologues of the cell's brain kill about giving tea to the man's wife and then complaining that all the discussions have made the tea of ​​a man go cold, lose eating soup to jump, or just want to just see Crazy Fat Ethel play with Blood in the garden: Do not look at this movie. Repeat: Don't see this movie. Do not rent this movie. If possible, do not walk on the shelf in a video store that has a copy of this film on it. You can still be saved, but it's too late for me now. . .
