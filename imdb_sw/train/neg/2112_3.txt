Bela Lugosi has a doctor who will do anything to make his wife look young and beautiful. To reach this end, drugs become a wedding at their wedding ceremony to make it look like they have died so that they can steal their bodies. I don't know what he is doing with the bodies. I do not remember that it is fully explained. And all I know is that it takes something from them and injures to his wife. (I just think that it is spinal fluid. The spine's water was all the rage of mad scientists in 40 years.) You can think a lot of break from here. <br /> <br /> There are couples (well, actually more than a couple, but I'll just write about two) the problems that I have with this film. One way is Bela. Indeed, he does a decent job in his own way to combine (BTW, all others have just lost). But, to hide him behind the ears or to have him into the bedroom of the female writer to do something is quiet. Also, why should you beat and / or kill anyone who has? What? Is to make him look at evil? Yes, the kidnapper does not need to be done more evil. The second problem I have is the idea of ​​a doctor's poet. Why do they marry? Isn't any woman under the age of 20? Watching Bela goes through these ways to find its victims, I was remembered by the Idiotic Fisherman in I Still Know what you did Summer Summer. In each case, it appears to be the easiest way to achieve your goal rather than implementing a seemingly impossible plan depending on many ways on your external control environment. (BTW, the alternative name of this movie is the Survey of Non-Thinkers and I think. I think that some part describes the need for 'master'.)
