Anyone who films this film good looks must have something to do with its creation. This movie is a painful suckfest. Acting is complicated, the sound of the sound of the usual sound is tasting, the direction is bland and very strange, the teacher is not all interesting (and making a clear progress of the student more awkward). Creative ideas behind this litter should be spread and spread to prevent further exhibition surveillance. I am certain that some of the starving children in Africa could use the money spent on this project. Hell, the money would also have seen the purpose of light intended to stimulate desire; at least one would have been enjoying outdoor entertainment. The only reason that does not give you the last disease, I will give you this two film.
