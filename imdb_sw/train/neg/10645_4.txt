I have never seen the Tarzan film before I saw it on the internet I thought I would give a shot. Unfortunately I think I had lost. Tarzan was over 40 years old and much less. Not how I would think Tarzan would have been. And, unless I lose time when I have made a cup of tea, Tarzan never gave up a traditional fight. He also had no Tarzan around the trees - from the vine to the vine. Oh well, very much to expect. However, Jane was there - Cheeta monkey was there. There was one man with guitar there. There were criminals and good boys and romance ... all innocent and predictable. There is nothing wrong, you understand, but it's not the same as something good. <br /> <br /> Maybe not the best movie to set up Tarzan: 4/10
