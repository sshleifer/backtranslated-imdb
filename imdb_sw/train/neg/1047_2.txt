Someone will have to tell me why each film shows people who are poor and get pseudo-gritty look somehow looks like “real” with other people. I didn't see anything real about the characters (although actors did well for their bad part) or the situation. Instead, I saw the forced efforts, independently become "edgy", "gritty" and "low and dirty". <br /> <br /> Sadly, it takes a lot more than a hand-hold camera without a rhyme or a reason to fail to open the film to achieve any above features in any important way. <br /> <br /> It is a sad comment on the state of the free film distribution which only films are seen in today's movie movies are all copies of carbon, and bad movies, camera direction is missing and much to swear to be "Art". "About Schmidt" to find such raves. I have seen them a few and very moderate, but compared to the current killing for free clones as "Add winner Vargas" they are quite clear and inspired. A few years ago to see the "independent" film meant the possibility of treating some nature and energy and many services, and perhaps a few technical causes caused by low budgets, these days, means that the chances will find another by number , let's -shake-camera-around-for-two-hour attempt to set for the lack of self-supplier. And of course all that serves the characters and situations that are not quite available and are emerging. <br /> <br /> Is it surprising that the area of ​​вitegemea в the independent market consists of intense companies and a few living? It's not when you see a movie like Raising Victor Vargas that does nothing but copying bad films before them.
