Other things need to be explained. Photo of Mark Ferris is not Mark Ferris who had a star in this movie. I know that because he was my father. Please remove that image. Also, Mark Ferris was the author, at least one of them. I've been trying to get a copy or a way to see this film again. It has been years and if someone can direct me in the direction of getting a copy, that would be good. The movie is not all bad, and try to compare it with today's Star Wars and other high tech sci fi is free. If you look at it, just enjoy with courage and humor. Put on the snobs of the film and enjoy other creative and creative films.
