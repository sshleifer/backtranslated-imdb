I will spend a lot of time on this review as the authors did on the script. This is easily a series of tasks that made EVER. WWWWW.WWWWW.WW.WW.WW.WWWW. It's not just the work of Mark Blankfield's GOD-AWFUL, so it was all elses !! Physical comedy was forced, flat and predictable. The script appeared written by the monkeys by using the name Ziggy Steinberg and Rocco Urbisci. How the producers could get rid of the effects of the movies are more than me. They could even make an old actress Ray Walston look like a buffon under the talent. Director Michael Schultz should be ashamed of himself. I want 96 minutes of my life I used this unveiled memory of a brilliant comedy to try and judge everyone involved in this movie.
