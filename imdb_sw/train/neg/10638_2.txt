Proof that not everything that touches Tarantino is turned into gold. This is very clear plastic, all the way. It is easy to see that without this Quentin's participation would probably be sitting on a shelf for years, it thinks it would have been given the first place. It is about a woman with a sense of death who gets a cleaning job after a crime, Angela Jones is confident in this role, William Baldwin is better than Killer Head who keeps Jones in employment! All in poor poor.
