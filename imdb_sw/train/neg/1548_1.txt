Lorne Michaels once again proves that she does not have any commercial movies. You think that after the decline of "Superstar", "Night at Roxbury", and "Coneheads", he would start to get the idea that maybe he doesn't know what he's doing when it comes to movies (and many say that he doesn't know when it comes to television, too). Trying to make feature films out of skits that were wearing welcome to the third time that took place on SNL don't know. <br /> <br /> I personally like Tim Meadows, and I think that will be good at the right movie. It is embarrassing to see a talented boy lost in a film that includes unfunny after an unwanted situation, and wipes it all with a bad song and dance scene. Any laughter here will be because the film is bad, not because it is wonderful. Well, at least we can thank you that there are many other SNL people who are never able to make a film about them. It's so bad that this made a big screen.
