This is a very fiction and very small film about slavery in West Indies and Puddy stars from "Seinfeld" show! Patrick Warburton made his first film in this planned film and he is very good here. Oliver Reed received a high bills but he is difficult in the film at all. Warburton has a white slave and it is wonderful to see all the young men and the older men of the rich asking him because they all want to have sex with him. Eartha Kitt has a bordello owner and they are a lot of fraud in the film. If it is not alcoholic drinks on the bordello then his young wives turn around with him. Then of course until the last slave slaves and there is a division of blood. There is no real political message like the "Burn" film but any other device designed to move the story together. Amazingly they did good and Warburton and all others returned! I hope to earn a great meal because this first film is very bad. Innovation continues to be seen by the lack of Warburton for any reason it makes it sometimes. Very bad movies but I had to admit that I want to see good.
