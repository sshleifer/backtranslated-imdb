I honestly can't believe what goes through the entertainment now. Death (and disgusting death), abuse, sex, child-threatening children, abuse, alcohol abuse and children, drug abuse, unemployed parents, babysitter from hell, suspicious jokes about Africans, police The fat people, and the children blowing out of the house between the night - yup, certainly looks like a children's movie to me - NOT !!! Adding to the dark and horrible things - a dead woman who has to turn into the house and take care of her loving husband in prison over 20 years, and also frightening the whole neighborhood - how sweet for children. PARENTS - is this exactly what you want your children to look for - this is what you want to teach about life? <br /> <br /> This movie also scares young children, and I'm afraid that young people today could be alive some of this film - why it explodes on their faces? As for adult respondents - you can not find that scary or exciting - just boring, generated and predictable. And the perpetrators are just wrong - the uncomfortable parents, the ignorant police, the ignorant and angry friends, the infants and the ignorant, and the boys drinking beer / womanizing. What is the biggest material for children - this sounds like the sounds of children to anyone? Even the computer animation and good sound work is not enough to redeem this flick flick. Save your money, forget your time, and keep your children's attention - giving Ice Age, Monsters Inc., Incredibles, Shrek, Bug Life - ALL of them are better than this awesome movie. Spielberg and Zemeckis - embarrassing you both by making the epidemic and then paying as a child / family movie!
