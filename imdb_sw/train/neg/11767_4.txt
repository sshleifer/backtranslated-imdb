I had great hope for this since I love Tim Roth. I did not enjoy this film. I liked Ang Lee Hulk a few years back so I thought this would have more than a bang. First I was very disappointed with the performance of John Hurt here. He looks like his opportunities are re-created for this. His performance did not convince them. He was not as good as one could expect. Tim Roth is cool as always here. Something of Gama did not have a real stick of the original story that I don't think. I think the best part of the film was the end. It had some cool action. The only problem with nature was that it was too long. This is not a long time but sometimes it was misleading. I remember a time ago when the Walmart made this cheap film for sale and I always wondered why. Now I know. I was hoping to get a blow, but I wasn't.
