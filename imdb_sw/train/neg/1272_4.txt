Does anyone know whenever they are on the car when the camera takes a new angle changes the road. As in one area is one way of residential and road routes, the following are on the highway and split roads, the next two-country road with two yellow ways. I can understand the bottom budget but that was just an inappropriate film work. I also read some reviews and did not accept that it was a bad movie. I think if you're a fan of Paul Reiser and his comedy then you can enjoy this movie. If, however, you get a job / not funny then I would recommend staying away from this.
