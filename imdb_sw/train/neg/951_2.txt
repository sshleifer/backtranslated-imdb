*** It can be destructive. *** \ t and anti-psychological drugs (this is a classic psych com combo that allows patients to enter drooling zombies) all during publishing, then this movie would have more interest. Or, if the film production was another form of trial where all participants were sleeping before and during publishing, then TOKYO TIME can be explained easily. <br /> <br /> Like, this film is full of lifeless, powerless actors. In the area where the new husband was sitting on the ladder talking to his sister, it seemed that he had trouble keeping his eyes open. In almost every area speaks his lines sitting with each part of his body without motion. From beginning to end, his expression to the face is best described as "almost sleep." <br /> <br /> Fret not about administrators talking about each other's lines because these administrators can hardly finish droning out any dialogs of dialog. Everyone speaks with a breathing voice, monotone. No laugh. No voice. No power. No one has enough power to smile. Results: perfect and total tolerance. <br /> <br /> And it is not recommended things that direction is simple and amateurish. Avoid this non-existent movie at all costs. Best looking GREENCARD which has the same plot and has charm and energy. Or, for the odd Japanese stories of romance, see long-term VACATION that has a large amount of everything to TOKYO TIME not.
