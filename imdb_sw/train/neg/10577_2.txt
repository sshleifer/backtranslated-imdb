Some of the filmmakers who are participating in this series have made some good movies but they are sure if the hack does not show much knowledge and this series. Especially write. Well, the first season was better but these new developments are just making. I am a great fan of fear and in my opinion a large number of these incidents are general waste. There is nothing new or true. It is a few of them building creativity. It is a typical model made for the destruction of Hollywood, uninteresting, infants, pregnant women and sometimes, loses. Much like the story from Crypt one thing only this series has been giving it a great weakness! Other then that this series strikes hard. I get a feeling sometimes that they hired a team of eight authors to write the sessions. Maybe they did.
