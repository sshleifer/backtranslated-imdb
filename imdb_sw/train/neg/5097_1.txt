Contrary to many other biographies, I hate this series. <br /> <br /> Begins to look attractive, with wonderful visitors and big robots, and I have put my hope until the last time. At the end of it, I still did not understand what an alien attack was about (perhaps I missed something, who knows?), And to realize that I am sitting at 26 intervals that include self, self-pity and compassion. In fact it strikes a fight between the alien / robot and these dark events, broken-on-off-off where one or more depression can only say or shout "I hate me / you / it" 10-12 times a series. <Br /> <br /> I can't see Shinji or Asuka (two characters) to show growth or change. (I can't see any of the other characters learning or growing either, for that.) I wanted to give them and tell them to get a life of blood during the first events, and the feelings don't change at the end. Shinji actually has a kind of helplessness that makes people angry rather than aid, and Asuka is very sad — all I wanted to beat the TV screen every time he came. Oh, and more than anyone else, these two hate everything, and say they often veeeeeeeery. <br /> <br /> I am otherwise a great fan of animé and manga, and I never liked it very much. I read that the series of the writer / writer wrote this when he was depressed, and I can believe it; it made me sad to look at it. Is this the purpose of this series? I sincerely pray. Is it designed to make the viewer confused and angry? And if you suffer from depression, why not just write a book or biography about it, instead of mixing with visitors and mecha's? This alien war plan, as I could tell him, causes anywhere. Finally, since I am so impressed by how many people claim to love this patchwork of the last stadium, I can 'help but wonder how many of them find it well, and how many say they are doing it because they are told it.
