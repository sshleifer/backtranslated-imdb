This movie is not very good. It is boring, and not too much blood for a terrible film. Simply layout includes not much happening. And I think the female vampire was stupid. He had many chances to kill the vampire hunters since it shows that the lights like reflexes. But, whenever he had one of them bound, he takes his time and something happens everywhere they did not bury him. Not surprisingly this went straight into the cable. <br /> <br /> VERDICT FOR A PLACE: Not anywhere near good as the first Vampire movie. You are SUCKER if you waste your time on this.
