This film was bad. Bad work, lead the bad, write bad. But it was not bad in a beautiful way. It was so bad in the way. I watched "Surface for Air" because I thought it might be laughter. It was not. Don't make the mistake I did. There are many more fun ways to spend an hour and a half such as looking at dry colors or reading a dictionary. Great.
