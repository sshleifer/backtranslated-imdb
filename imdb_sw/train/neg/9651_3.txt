The movie is a crap total. We have two good actors who have been muscular and the head of actress Salman Khan just to attract a female audience. Story is a trick. The characters have not been properly hit. The story does not exist. No chat editing. Ajay Devgan as Rock Rock. That is the dream itself. Film brings up to the point of destruction. The whole pastor about Arjun brings Manna to London, then apologizes to his lover and allows him not to play in Wembley (Vimbley in the dubbing process). Salman Khan on high acting or making it very painful to see. I remember seeing some good films from this Producer Shah Producer but this is not one of them. It seems all good directors fall prey to Box Office mania .. that Mumbai Media Morons have created. This is another movie to decorate in the "You want" line and an idiot actress like Salman Khan who have no place in the beautiful Indian Cinema. He is good for the Indian Cinema as Titanic was in the Cruise Business of Winter. For a positive note â€” I am interested in the character of Asin playing Bharatnatyam when he changes to play in Western style when the teacher doesn't look at it.
