It's not a great fan of awesome films, and I have seen only a few (and no "Halloween" or "thirteenth Friday") - but I can understand the horror of the horror not because of the year. And I'm sure this is not good. Is it a great thing about a little plastic skull that surrounds everywhere? In all its exhibitions there are faraway set up shots, therefore there is no real surprise in any film. (It is not that the skull in itself is terrible, but ...) It is a matter of three-year-old Claus Von Bulow (John Hudson), who marries Donna-like-like (Peggey) Webber, giving one of the worst exhibitions ever, who starts to see the skull and hear the strange blow of the bee group at her husband's house. Did I mention that her husband lost his first wife in an incredible event? OOOOH !!!! Wonderful who did it! This is an old plot on a rich young man trying to kill and / or run their old wife. If you want to see a new version of these things, try "Restore Bahati". With BTW, Jeremy Irons is one hundred more talented than John Hudson. <br /> <br /> MSTing was the same but nothing special; It was connected to a short "Gumby", however, it makes it look good. <br /> <br /> Two stars of "Laughter of Laughter"; The eight stars for the MST3K version. And now, to define Mr. Von Bulow himself: "This film is very bad?" "You have no idea!"
