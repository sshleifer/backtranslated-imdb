This should be one of the 5 worst movies made. The plan seemed as amazing as that of 57 passengers. But for the last movie somehow did the best work. The plan has been done in a more serious way. Just a few bad moments in the movie, a flight attendant standing at the opened door of 747 flying and trying to close the door without being inserted by 250 kilometers per hour? Then after a flight from a few miles out of the start of 8,000 feet, it is impossible even for 747 fighters with thousands of hours of experience. When on the road (quite accurately) he is described to pull on flaps, HUH !! Come lids there there to make sure you lift the lowest speed, while on the road you use to move on the engine and give the highest authority! I can go and continue on small and serious mistakes in the movie, but then my answer would be the size of the English dictionary. This is a lost movie, do my word for it!
