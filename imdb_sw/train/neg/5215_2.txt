It's the same age, "If I can't earn money for my project, I will isolate" the monster movie. There is nothing new here. It's a lot like Jeff Goldblum "Fly" film. The person can set the example of purity, but ultimately reduces the results of his experiment. Acting is very bad. There are people who are ignorant every way, putting their lives at risk for no apparent reason. The boy continues to return to the laboratory which is forbidden. Then there is a relationship with the young woman and her son. True, he is good, but he looks like a lot of trouble. It's just a very big waste of time. Even his tyrannosaurus suit looks like it came out of the rack on the Star Trek contract.
