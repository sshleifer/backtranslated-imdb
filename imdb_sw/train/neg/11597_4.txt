I will have Alice's law, after living in the preliminary phase of the Nightmare series, gets a bad dream of Freddy Krueger starting again. At this time, a manslayer is attracted to the sleep of the unborn child. His intention is to be "born again" in the real world. The only person who can stop Freddy is his dead mother, but Alice can give up her spirit when saving her own son? The film started very well when we saw Alice wanting to be Amanda Kruger who was stuck in the room and raped by 100 Manics and then ran away from the hospital but she was no longer a pregnant woman but then Amanda gave birth to Freddy again Alice and Dan are just two people back from the fourth movie and then have found new friends' soon before Freddy started killing again, I made it as the first dead is the same, not like other deaths or dreams. Freddy himself did not seem to be scary in this film completely, hard it was boring really didn't worry or not quite available. <br /> <br /> Working in the movie was the same for the 5th movie in the series but in general I think this movie was real. (Still not the worst movie of the series, Freddy Dead is worse) <br /> <br /> 4/10
