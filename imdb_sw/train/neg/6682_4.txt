This comedy is not very helpful. It is a romance which includes very much on the exceptional results. It's a caper film so driven - yes, even back - it does not snap. <br /> <br /> Sent is enough. Moreover it is hard to say. However, the good thing is that players don't know. In MGM, this would have star Robert Montgomery. The businesswoman's wife who had no time for anything except work could be any number of characters. We can be grateful that this known film is the most unknown people today. And production standards are not bad. However it is not good feeling. It is a knockoff of generic. And who wants?
