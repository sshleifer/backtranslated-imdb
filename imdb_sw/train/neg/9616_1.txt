First, I was just worried about looking at the DVD box and reading it saying it was about a group of young people who gathered on the lake where they would find something or something. Any movie that has a cluster like this has failed too much, even if the slasher movie, except the first Friday on 13. \ t It was not. Usually, I think every movie has something that you can take from it. This does nothing. Make your consent, and know what made it to do for 80 minutes. If, put a ring, or eat dirt.
