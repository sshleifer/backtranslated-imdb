"Land of Many" is not a film. It is the leading stone of the German Director of Wim Wenders. Many felt that "Millions of Dollar Hotel" and now "Much Land" makes it quite clear; not just the lost Wenders, he has actually turned to be the director of BAD, creating very bad and advanced stories and events. One can say that "when you lose" comes to every director, but Wenders' case is severe. It's like he forgot completely everything he knew about movies and started again - just getting good results. <br /> <br /> In a few words, this film is not suitable for your time.
