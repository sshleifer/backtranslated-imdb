It has been around 30 years, and I hate everyone involved in this film. It's still the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Before you see this, I've never been interested in Rivers, one way or another. After watching this film, I have a feeling of excitement when I see him on television. I have been hugged for this - against my good judgment - for peer pressure. However, from the outside of the theater, the friends swore an oath to never destroy my choice of film. About thirty years later, we continue to bear mental scars from this film. On my bed bed, one of my regret is when I lost the expectation that this film could get better. Never done. <br /> <br /> If you have been given an option, you would like to keep your eyes out of this though the film. I shared the IMD view only hope that maybe I can warn others against seeing this film. If I can save only one person by looking at this, then my existence here will be right.
