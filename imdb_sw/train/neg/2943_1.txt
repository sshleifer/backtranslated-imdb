In Theodore Rex poor who Whoopi Goldberg has been established as a tough soldier of the police who gets a job with a terrible dinosaur in the case. The movie tries to be funny, and tries to make stories about abductions and more but it has never worked. The movie is far from funny, and the story is ridiculous. I chose 1/10
