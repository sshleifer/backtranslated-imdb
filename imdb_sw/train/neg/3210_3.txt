There's really no way to beat around the bush by saying this, Lady Death: Photo Motion just plain sucks. In addition to the fact that the main character is a well-developed blonde around Hell in a bikini of leather and frequent cases of abuse of the model, the movie seems to be done with the cartoon ideas of 1980 according to the figures of action. The bad man himself even speaks like a wannabe Skeletor, he has a guilt of guilt, and he lives in a house that seems to have been done after the field of villain from the old cartoon on Saturday morning Blackstar. Not expecting another humor except sometimes a bad conversation. Sometimes it feels like the kind of anime fits best for hentai, but no sex, no practice of rape (Thank you good!) And a little sexual appeal, this despite the appearance of a characteristic character. There is not only an adult's edge of this material, unless you count the semi-heroine and naked and blood deaths. In fact, what we have here is a feature of She-Ra aspect, Princess of Power, but for skirusi and more than a year.
