I must be one in the United States who did not have this film. I think this is not my style or something, I just see it very interesting, this was * without entertainment, just leave one of the greatest achievements in the history of movies. It is about a person who has not come from anything, and continues to be a master of medicine. The easiest way to describe the whole film, and that's my feelings about the whole movie. Contrary to what many people think, just because the movie is about mafias / drug trafficking / crime groups do not become a great film, do not forget the beautiful stories.
