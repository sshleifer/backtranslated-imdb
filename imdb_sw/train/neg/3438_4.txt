The swimming pool sells as 'Fog' meets with 'Water Locations'. In many ways this is correct. There are terrible and weird people who are attracting you. However, the ability to act is much lower. It shows a clear sign that this is just a group of friends who are making a terrible film. Which in all loans are doing with their potential capabilities. When you accept a low budget it makes it very difficult for special effects, and ghosts are very visible as men with rubber masks. Most features of the film are wonderful and wonderful. But it faces the use of many twists and turns into a short space of time that leaves you just tired and confused. In terms of promoting eye film makes it very good. Ignoring the failure for every 5 seconds closer to the end, you really want to know what's going on. And they are ready to wait 1 to 35 minutes at the peak. This is not the Way of the Spirit but it will definitely make the evening before the T.V.
