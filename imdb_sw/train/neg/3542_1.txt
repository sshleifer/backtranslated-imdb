After reading the comments on the site I was forced to write for the first time. It seems that this film is like Marmite and has divided viewers. I tell you that when I accept the movie is not worth having fun (see MULHOLLAND DRIVE) they should still share it with the characters. Now when I have been bound by the affairs of the murderers of Lynch's opus, I must say to give a turd about Mr Green or other paperwork pages that live on this world of the world. Also, when many people seem to try and say you weren't happy because you didn't get it - I didn't like you because I was bored. I wanted the film to be completed and listened to those words without helping them. Call to be clever if you like - I think it's repeating again. However, my main reason for writing is to ask all the other consultants - there were no final features on the publication of the film I saw. Music only on black. Did I look at the dud publication or is this evidence of engaging in GR? Or, does everyone involved in the film look to cut and have their name removed?
