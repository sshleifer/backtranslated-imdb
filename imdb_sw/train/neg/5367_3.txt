I have seen every part of this being removed. I thought the first season was a good effort based on the prospects of following those achievements that are the Anatomy of Gray. So I kept watching. I am afraid of the second season has not found a charm, chemistry and very important game of the predecessor of Gray Anatomy. Relationships seem to have emerged and acting so. Write down with the mind and comedic tips shown on GA. There shows that the formulaic but does not degenerate to formulaic and contrived, unfortunately PP is not so. I liked the presence of Kate Walsh in GA. I'm afraid of Kate Walsh's life in LA is not just interesting.
