It's the early 80s. There is a group of young adults. And there is a maniac around. Yes, this is slasherville. <br /> <br /> This movie is called Pranks. Why is it called Pranks? I have no idea of ​​despair. Unless your idea of ​​a big prank is to repeat a regular dinner and hitting baseball - equally, not a big prank; it is indeed a garbage dump if it is actually told. But there is going. The film itself involves a group of young people who need to clean out dormitories. They know that psychopath has free. To combat these developments, they were divided and walking in darkness. It is approaching with tears for many of them. <br /> <br /> Pranks is a badly hit movie. The DVD version I saw was one of Vipco. It seems to cut off a little bit of violence. This makes DVD even more meaningless because, let's say it, the sound of the slasher of violence is a waste of time. For film and film publishers only well.
