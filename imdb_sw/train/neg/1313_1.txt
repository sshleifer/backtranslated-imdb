Don't bother trying to try to watch this awesome mini series. It is about six o'clock, the triangular love of three people who have no chemistry at all. No heat in this story, no real passion, no real romance. It is dry, stimulating, drawn, and not working as they arrive. And it does not even reach the expected level of technical crafts. Take six hours of your life and use it for something else.
