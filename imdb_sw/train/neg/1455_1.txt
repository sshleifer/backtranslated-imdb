I have never had an abstract idea in a film that should be the basis of historical statistics. The terrible laughter of the film, I walked around. Terror, trembling, perverting and talking to a true and half lies. Hitler's famous author Ian Kershaw was originally a consultant for this film. However, he saw the script being so historically accurate and deceptive that he refused, and also demanded them to stop using his name as a source (it is a shame he thinks thinking people was involved). <br /> <br /> One part shows Hitler beating his dog. There is no single source for this. Hitler loved animals more than people. He brought strict laws of animal welfare in Europe, banning vivisection and animal testing. He was also a pastor. The film turns to the Street Cross on the horn, involving corruption. False. He was awarded the prize for a long time of courage. No historical records show that Hitler has ever had sex relations with his nephew. Not one. Besides, Hitler is shown as the rabid simplicity in this desired flick. If he was even half as ignorant, wrapped up in thick as he is this useless film like in real life you can't even know that he had ever existed. Never be a German leader. In fact, this film was awesome. <br /> <br /> Continue Destruction and offer this very wide.
