This film is very bad, with a full script of 'missing' verses and very good displays. Specific effects are also negative (not worse than I have seen, either) and music is so bad that you should listen to them. Only two short pieces (30 seconds long or so) are repeated repeatedly throughout the film. All, one of the worst films I have ever seen.
