How Grinch Stole Christmas was a nice little cartoon Christmas that anyone can enjoy the convenience, never seen the reason for remake. Not to mention the remake made by humans, the cartoon was perfect, what is the purpose of this film? But it also seemed odd to Jim Carrey to be a Grinch. I mean he's a good comedic actor, but he like Grinch? It didn't mean anything to me. His performance was slightly above and without a laughable fun time. Not to mention some of the added talks was a bit of children and not recommended. The whole story of Grinch and Cindy Lou-Nani had been made more and was not needed. They actually destroyed the story, the period. All in Whoville are preparing for their best Christmas season where everything is intended to go fully. But Cindy Lou-Nani is struggling and worried about Grinch that lives on them and that it will not be able to get a good Christmas like the other. He kills out and decides that he does not want Christmas this year and that he really should just steal all Christmas together to show who is what Christmas is about. But soon he realizes that anyone can know that it's a little more than what is seen by Christmas. <br /> <br /> How Grinch Stole Christmas was not needed and it was a little up above. I have strongly suggested that you stick to the cartoon only for the simple fact that this is a pretty disturbing version, at least in my opinion. Creating and presenting the entire film was just about to do, not to mention how Grinch Steal Christmas! it meant more to be like a cartoon instead of star Jim Carry. But at least this version thanks to the Boris Karloff edition that was played every Christmas. </ 1/1 / / 1/10
