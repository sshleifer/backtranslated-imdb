The fact that a large budget of this is possible to go to the list of weight responsibilities should not be taken into account if it was made by kindness and thought and sympathy for the original satirical purpose. Instead we get a bad track and tracking drums involving praying and photographing images, and the final division has been completed by the backsliding to reveal the action that has been done at the music-hall stage, enough for the production of Lionel 'Oliver' Blair more than Brecht . The talent of acting is the opposite of misuse: Migenes and Walters are good but they do not need a lot of effort: Migenes has at least a great voice and some feel the material. Julia looks perfect as Mack, but she struggles with the character, beaten by a fake feeling of fake. Harris's Peachum is an amazing opposite to Polly is angry. Change of lyrics, script and music are often not emerged: it was a rough argument on the film's Broadway version of Marc Blitzstein, but at least his words could be seen, unlike many of the entries in the sign of honesty. And an attempt to win a low budget by photographing on the claustrophobic corners on the frozen sets is placed on the blues and garish oranges as if on the bottom floor of the business Vittorio Storaro is completely unsuccessful - just a cheap, unimportant film. not made without thinking. It's a shame.
