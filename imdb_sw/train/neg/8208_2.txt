"Hey everyone! I have the idea, we have found this bronze thingie from the sky, why don't we look at it and open it?" "Well, I know that it will be a thing that the scientist can do, and it can be filled with bacteria or parasites in the world and it may be possible to eradicate society, but hey, I want to know it in it." "And no one will tell NASA, they can take away from us." "Wow this thingie offers off the vibes!" "Yes, it is very powerful in contact so you don't find it but it's okay to open it". "Hi there is good, see my nips". (Later that day); "Don't open" !!!!! Indeed, we should run to the laboratory and tell them not to open it because we don't have a phone or radio or intercoms though we have a gazillion dollar worth other devices here. "I've never seen such an organic technology!" "Yes, Lemme take this stick and steal." "I come out here, I don't care if I kill another 6 billion people in the world, nobody's nukkin!" "Look at the friendly visitors from the" shaft "! They want us to come with them". END
