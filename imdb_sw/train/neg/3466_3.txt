The flick of the slasher, made in the early 80s, has a curse on it which has anyone who tries to finish turning dead. Years later, a group of film students tried to complete the film - and also to revive the deadly film. It's a great idea of ​​the film, but sadly 'Cut' is just another lost opportunity. Unfortunately Australia has not found the best record of the world when it comes to fear. 'Razorback' (1984) was out and out as it was 'Holwing III' (1987), which was a half-American film yet. As for our delightful match, 'The Melt Body' (1993) is the best left forgotten. The problem with the 'Cut' is that manufacturers are trying to create a 'Scream' sare care (1996) but they are not aware of the kind or what works. And although this seems strange I say this on a slasher film but what 'Cut' really missing is any “heart”. Certainly follows the basic “rules” have been set up by the 'Player', but they don't want to play with the form, instead they go to the original copy of the card. The killer, Scarman, is probably one of the most uncomfortable and uncomfortable in the history of horror movies. Its low-end basin, the longest limbs could make a porno look like Shakespeare. They have never been seen as fully involved with them and seem like they are just waiting to shoot so that they can collect their pay points. And the feel of the film is like deliberately trying to be angry; look more like a 'Neighborhood' or 'High Heartak High'. By the way, these experiments in the form of MTV, the hyper-cinema during the sequence of "study" looks just idle, dated and out of place. If Australia will have the opportunity to re-create fear (What we expect yet) maybe we should take a leaf from the 'Mad Max' book (1979). Instead of trying to copy U.S. we should try our own experiment.
