For those who lived in those weeks to hide pictures in the city and near the Valley - let's not forget the bad days of road closure and "film making". As a reminder for those living here - residents include Boulder Creek, Bonny Doon, Davenport, Big Basin. etc. The bank was a fire of BC; run events with Moon Drive off Hwy 236, Empire Empire Rd, and Hwy 1. <br /> <br /> Production: Jeffrey Jones was much easier, Matt Broderick was up to us all - even back. In addition to the film goes - the joke of the script and even a great laugh on acting and plot - but cares at this level. The best time for capsule for those who enjoy our coastal environment and valley. <br /> <br /> Additional information; Joe's Bar (Jed's Tavern in the film), the original name of the film was Welcome to Buzzsaw - the parking lot of Old Erba was the city square, the back shots was off to Grove Street in Boulder Creek; turn off the thinking cap and see a few actors in their early days.
