No, but no one, who can chew the environment like the Divine God, Ruth Elizabeth Davis, and "Elizabeth and Essex" are a good example of what. Although he is constantly playing, see when he gets Raliegh writing words for his song of women trying to finish playing: at the time, he makes us understand how Elizabeth could rule and rule! Sometimes, she has done with the sappiness script. When Elizabeth should be dangerous, it comes as weak and wise. This has an added effect of undermining his authority: when he closes his hands and threatens to allocate justice, it is difficult to take him seriously. Flynn exudes the charm, making us see how Essex could pull through the heart of Elizabeth's heart, but he doesn't really know how to send the controversy and evil of that man. It also does not help that Essex is very bad written. Why is he hothead who wants to destroy his Queen - even if he swears her loyalty to him - except that he is more than blue-blood, so, more "worthy" of the administration? And why is Raliegh betraying Elizabeth with letters and Essex letters? He is in danger of the fall of grace, and we know where Essex (and his head) is headed. Why does he involve his head by hastening to avoid? What does Curtiz do with all $$$ given? He even bothers to try to hide the fact that his war race is hit on the sound stage. He should finish with Elizabeth for the first time only the tower; everything else follows (especially the last area between Essex and Essex) is not necessary. Dress is amazing. And it is me, or Bette looks like Susan Sarandon?
