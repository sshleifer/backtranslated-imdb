There are some bad movies out there. Many of them are very happy. "Insane Crime 1" was one of those flicks. It wasn't so bad that it was fun and it was worth looking at again. "Insane Crimes 2" has to be one of the worst films made and come from me, which say a lot because I am not the type of person saying anything is worse. But I don't believe, this was just too bad and it runs only one hour at 1 very much. The movie has an unusual story, but who cares about the story all the time you want to see it is a great woman around her being killing people because she doesn't care about feeding. Certainly, you don't see it in this film, except for all the flashback system that comes out first. A new story can be very surprising and Ethel is taken to half a house and killed everyone there, but nothing happens until the last 20 minutes of the movie and that time is already asleep. The camera works in this film is just angry. This recalls something I beat with my friends when I was 15 years old. Sound quality is something else if you can't understand the word many of the characters say. To give an example of how bad it is, go to New York road and try to understand what it says about loud speakers, so this film is shown. It is not something that talks about the meaning because the actors are on dry as a piece of wood. Now I know that saying this is a very bad movie there is very hard but the words can 'Teleze how this movie is bad. If you don't believe me, see for yourself. 1/10
