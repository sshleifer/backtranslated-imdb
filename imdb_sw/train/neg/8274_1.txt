Ahh this film was so great! A good cast of quality B executives, thighs of Jessica Simpson and ... that is on that! <br /> <br /> I believe some guy in some of the unnamed marketing departments with an idea. Basically, let's make a sort of Legal Blond film, but do it in New York. That's a great bright city of space, power and money and where everyone is personality, power / money hungry person. Let's add to this Jessica Simpson, a small town of bimbo, that the brothers of Owen Wilson and for no other reason Andy Dick (because of her she should ignore this film). <br /> <br /> The basis of the basic story: <br /> <br /> Boy leaves a girl for NY, girl follows, boy cheats, girl sits in NY and cousin, gets a job under the trick, mucks up, is courted by another boy (Brother Wilson) and together to save the day and kiss. <br /> <br /> A few words come to mind when displaying on this film, ie dire, awesome, hard, intolerable and discriminatory <br /> <br /> not just watch this film, you will be happy. One auditor has described Guantanamo and I certainly agree with him. This film causes shock. And I know what you're thinking ... at least some time I will see Simpson naked or too close. It will not happen, keep time with YouTube. You will have the best time of the film! <br /> <br /> Film editing is fast, acting cannot be interrupted, and why are they using blue screens? <br /> <br /> In conclusion; this is the sin of films that should be punished to the highest degree. Another reason why Willie Nelson always has a kind of father figure almost every Jessica Simpson flick and why there is no black, Latin, Asian or European people in this film?
