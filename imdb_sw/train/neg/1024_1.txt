I saw this film on the toronto film concert and stable prospects. The movie has a great cast and was closing in the concert so it should be good, right? how I was right. I knew we were in trouble when the film director was talking about how he was leading the part of the wiseguy met with an unknown actor named kevin spacey (director / author of wiseguy doing his element beginning = blah) ... well director / Edison author must have a sparking picture for kevin spacey killing a homeless person, because I can't see how he (with other actors in the film) will admit to this epidemic. <br /> <br /> This film is quite amazing! it is a mixture of each boiled comb. nothing new with Edison. acting was bad and the trend was worse. it seemed like the above mentioned wiseguy. this was automatically released directly to the video video I ever saw. <br /> <br /> Some of the shortest moments of silly in Edison ... morgan free dancing around his house without the music of rock and roll ... tuin timberlake get creative resistance from his belle when his house is surrounded by candles ... llcoolj car harvest ... 3 boys are shooting head ... <br /> <br /> This movie is opposite to good. EDISON!
