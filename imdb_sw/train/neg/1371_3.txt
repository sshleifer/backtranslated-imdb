I can't know how anyone can get the budget for this bad movie. It's like a TV channel craves anything, anything. They are buried under a snow group, the light is always lit and off, but by magically there is a continuous glow. Where does all of these (fake light) come from? That, and all the ignorant emerging between the characters. They seem to be more interested in complaining to each other than trying to try ways to live. I try to create a sense of emergency and help people. But because it is leading and acting as bad, you can't Florence Nightingale to fix it with this flick, sorry. I am joining the wrong opinion, and I agree that this is one of the worst movies.
