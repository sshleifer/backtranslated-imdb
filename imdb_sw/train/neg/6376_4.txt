Jennifer Cassi (Gina Philips from "Dead and Breakfast") returns to the house she grew up which she recently inherited from her dead sister, not known to her grandmother (Fay Dunaway) who still lives in it. Jennifer decides to sell it if she needs the money with Granny's bitterness. It also begins to have frequent pain of a string. There was no one associated with this film. Jennifer appeared to be cool, off, regardless, and narcissistic, when the grandmother appeared to be sympathetic, sad, and also narcissistic. The movie is beautiful and well done, but no one feels and I found it difficult to keep what happened. <br /> <br /> My Bridge: C-
