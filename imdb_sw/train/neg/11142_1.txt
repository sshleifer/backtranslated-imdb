This is the worst part of the trick that I've ever watched - it was really so bad that I was just looking at it :-) <br /> <br /> CGI is sooo bad it is fun! It's not close to the CGI's Shitty animation in Spawn, that's bad, inappropriate ... more from that way, 'reducing the cost of doing it can not be more than a few hundred dollars. It is very bad that the kindergarten could make it. Look and laugh!
