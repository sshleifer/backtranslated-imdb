Thank you for one thing and one thing - that this woman now will be thousands of miles away across the continent! Yay !!! This fully controlled program is much obsessed by Victoria Beckham has had a sexual immorality with her family outside the media in the name of self-promotion and 'Brand f' cking Beckham '. <br /> <br /> A few years ago I used to really like 'Posh and Becks', still admire very talented David, but I have no respect for him anymore. Can you respect a man with his wife's hand as he moves in front of him working as a puppet. It was clear that Victoria's hand was on the early withdrawal of Beckham from Manchester United and now that has happened to Real Madrid. I hope Beckham can live by the fact that although he can get a million pounds - he has made his soul to Buck America and finished his days playing for a team that would hardly find favoritism from Division One in England (no fault in America - but when Baseball and Basketball you rule - unpleasant football It has been years since I have seen on top, a completely false performance from 'Posh' - this is just the top of its cringe characterized red carpet displays following Rebecca Loos' debacle ', while instead of throwing all the cr' P in David was worthy, He stressed his hand trying to save a million pound-spinner his marriage has been. <br /> <br /> This stunt full of PR was pathetic. Why isn't he just going beyond that silence, helping her husband through a big job of his professional career and putting his head down? When was he so full of personal importance that he feels the migration of America should be associated with this great fan? Unfortunately, I saw David Beckham's document last night. At least he has taken a slide of grace and humility. Two things his wife does and learn <br /> <br /> One more thing Victoria -. you complain about always being followed by children !. Little delicious - stopping their tipping off your dynamics you fool woman <br /> <br /> Good luck America !!
