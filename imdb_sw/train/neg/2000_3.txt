I saw the speed of being glacial with the original story stuck in proportion to content. My wife slept in many ways and I did not try to awaken her because I felt she had nothing. When Holmes and Watson enter the house and may be found, it is unclear how it can hide all their login and damage tools quickly. It is also unclear how the door of learning is closed, preventing employees from entering. Something that really bothered me at the end when there was a glint in the eye of the broken law. I don't have any details that should represent.
