It looks the same way as many columns. Firstly it was good. The second was moderate and this, with the evil filling and stupid dialogue and also suspension of unbelief, this film was weak. It can be predictable and I can't stand that Henry Wrinkler as the master of that stupid eye, there was much more that they could do with this. I liked the first one. I would like to go beyond those lines, instead of what they did here. There were many details that needed to be explained, when was this and why was there an old phone in the room? I understand there is one in work. <br /> <br /> Blah!
