We looked at this twice in the theater because we couldn't believe how it was the first time. Maybe we were missing something ... No, what was lost was the beginning of the preparation. In fact I returned to Robbin's novel to see if I could find a problem, and I realized that what I thought was exciting and exciting back in that day is now a small amount of disappearance and a fuzzy rotation. So, the original problem with the film was to make it completely, and all the others lost the train continued there. There is absolutely no work - it's not a blessed thing. Some beautiful photography outdoor steamrolled findings and placement of a random camera in the interior shots. All actors look at the least worried - Angie Dickenson seems to be very good - except for Phoenix's rain, who gives the impression that she also doesn't know how her performance was so bad. Talk is a single, long, non-string string. Exhibitions do not mean from second to second, and the relationship between them is not. However, the film reminds you blindly, has proved that it says something big. <br /> <br /> This is very bad even being funny; it's just bad. Gus Van Zant has done some very good movies that I encourage you to see, and I'm glad he saved (and apparently he has learned from this).
