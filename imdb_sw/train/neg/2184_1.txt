This film is a compilation of anonymous analogue and abortion materials. The Weather History: The director of this film was evil who drove around with the local women's choice. His wife discovered the film reels, was forced to quickly distribute the story. He said he was doing a film called "Brain that will not die." Finally, his wife claimed to show him "the movie". That night he made other bonds with a friend and "Brain that will not die" was born. <br /> <br /> I love this film! Lesson Synopsis: The main character is killed in a tragic car accident (that was caused by ignoring clear traffic signs). He takes his head from destruction and makes it again. After restoring the head, he goes and takes a group of hookers. That's pretty much happening for the remaining movie. At the end, he fights and killed by a monster living in the closet. Monster looks without any details. However, the monster saves the hooker and I think that they live happily at all times. <br /> <br /> Description of the end side: The end of the credit screen claims that the movie is called "headless". <Br /> <br /> I love this film!
