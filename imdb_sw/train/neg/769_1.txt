The biggest mistake in this film is that it is impossible to believe any of these people will be beaten in Macbeth's professional production. To hear the soft voice of David Lansbury who worked hard with the talk "Tomorrow, Tomorrow and Tomorrow" could not believe anyone who would look at him with that role. I continued to believe that he did not find a place because he was a good actor; not because the big name was found. Then when we see places of play in practice it is difficult to believe the director is not a translating and hopeless, uncomfortable, worried actors who cannot explain or even understand paragraphs and directors who feel playing through their own screwball interpretation. Sometimes the directors are very eligible to make their films available (and the authors think they are capable of leading their own work) that put them down. This seems to be a similar example.
