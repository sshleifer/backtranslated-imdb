More than a hidden movie and other awesome features being hit; they are generally. It starts with a woman who has a dream that her boyfriend comes out of bed, gets into her baby's bedroom, and kills. He wakes up. Then, the man dies in the hospital, bleeding. A woman who was a visitor came, and she could contact him through his dreams (I think), and he wants to know who killed her before his body was completely destroyed in his grave. Not too much secret about who did it, or even how; Many viewers will think that long before being revealed. I don't know the way he killed it would have worked. However, the aspects of fear come in through: gory disruption, a dream of a man who kills a boy, a dream that an egg dish turns into eyes that are cut, and several shots of a damaged person in The pain of dreams and truth in his grave. I was a little surprised to see the volunteers at the end of Fulci for Clive Barker! Interesting.
