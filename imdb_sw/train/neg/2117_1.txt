The magicians die on the altar, and their corpses are lost. Everyone cares, but no one can see why and how this happens, and can't stop it from happening. Take me pleasure. Bela Lugosi is responsible for this, because he removes urine from these young women to dismiss his ex-wife and preserve it. Continue to carry me. Finally, the authorities know that a person must be an engineer of death and loss, but of course, they cannot think of an impossible goal. Let's just ignore the good deception and continue ... If you can find the first twenty minutes of this mess, you will be treated by Lugosi and hit his laboratory for disrespecting one of the girls who has killed, explaining that she finds sleep in the coffin much better than bed, and other unseen parodies of the real film of fear (type and budget and plots). Anyhoo - a female journalist tracks his nose to the suspect (and the police do not know where there is a view!), And then the fun begins. <br /> <br /> Movies and acting are the same. There are many well-dressed people, who look very well in this film. Redirect is right, and the script is better than the required devices. However, this film fails to develop the interest of all but a fan of a hard-b-film. The best thing about it .... That's finally ended, but not soon.
