Being a small film film, I usually will look at every movie of the slash which flows over my retinas, which sometimes makes more harm than good to my brain, I will say. When the station goes on to another night, Sleepaway Camp II occurred across the road with me. Of course, I wanted to explore out, as I heard about the Sleepaway Camp franchise, but I've never seen any (for shame, I know). I will see that since I have not seen before, my resistance should not be taken very seriously, because maybe what I think is wrong and it is deliberately and designing a franchise. Now '' Considering that the franchise of the Sleepaway Camp is, itself, joke on it itself. Hell, even the name comes as a joke of decision. Sleep camp? It's a good pleasure. I can understand the film by just wanting to put one of the most valuable camping items, but that's close to how I can go. Acting in this film made the first Sunday Sunday's 13th look like travelers doing Macbeth's instructions. Campy requires a bad acting, but come. Pamela Springsteen as a bad-to-touch assassin-and really did better work to kill my interests than she was killed for the whole cast. As far as the comedy goes, there was a few times where I chuckled, but it was few and far between. <br /> <br /> Finally, SAC II is good boring, and I really wanted to sleep off camp. Deaths are exposed and fake that you cannot know them. If you are looking for a slasher film playing with a good camp, I recommend Club Club. If your surfing station takes you around this, check and see what else is going on.
