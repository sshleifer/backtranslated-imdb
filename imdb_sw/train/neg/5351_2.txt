If you liked the first two movies, then I am poor you say you won't like this. This is true and unnecessary garbage on the video, perhaps TV was done. A modern idiotic scientist Wayne Szalinski (Rick Moranis) still lives with his family and has his own company, Szalinski Inc.. Unfortunately his wife wants to pull out the idol, Wayne is ignorant he eliminates his image and himself and his brother. Then he divorces his wife and his wife. Now adults should find a way to get home children to make them greater. Often repeat to two other for just one or two new items, e.g. toy car roller coaster, swim in dip, etc. Pretty poor!
