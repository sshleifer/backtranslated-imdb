I say I was looking forward to watching this film and looking for a new life in that would separate it from many Mexican films. I do not know why but I believed Yu, Pudor y Lagrimas to be one of the cleanest and bold in our industry. Perhaps it was because the sound of the voice (which I heard before watching the film) appears different from the others, perhaps it was because it had emerged to insert new faces (except Demian Bichir who is always recommended by Mexican film directors) into script and behavior modern social, perhaps because photography I saw in trailers was sharp and realistic than the exhibition. The film turned into a major attraction for people, and a huge stop. What Serrano is doing here is the very old "gender war" as "all men are the same" and "why all women ...;" blah, blah, blah. There is nothing new in it, however, it uses common ground and clichès that ultimately degrade without compromising the value of female / male value. Full of ordinary cassava for listeners like gags safe about the clichès I talked about before (those who always work, always) and the sounding (it's a good film in its environment) .. and by shouting I mean, really. The first of the most compelling characters who were beaten by Monica Dionne and Demian Bichir turned to Serrano's favorite ones. I totally disagree with Serrano, they should not be treated in the same way only as a marionettes for his subject come through ... he made sure that we have his message and completely destroyed their roles which was the only solid foundation on which this story could stand. However, it is after all, a lively recreational film and you may have a good time to see it (if you agree to use it).
