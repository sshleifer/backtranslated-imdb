The boy's boy, which was definitely one of the worst flicks I've seen every summer. In fact, it was on Sci Fi, and I didn't look at Sci Fi, but someone, talk about a thin plot with two dimensional characters to max. <br /> <br /> The characters were normal and extra, conspiracy and layout was not surprising, vampires were less frightening, more of a look-funny, Gore was necessary, special effects were less-right-awesome, and the end? Indeed, the only thing that is unpredictable on the end is when suddenly tomboy becomes a masculine and begin to do with a female vampire, which, by the way, is not really hot all the focus is it happens for almost three seconds, where you're near to "Is Hell?" what? " then "Man, it's hot." If this ever appears in return, Unfortunately, do not set it.
