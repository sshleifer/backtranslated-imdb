I was 13 and I hated this film that was the worst movie in the world I had lost my time looking at it and I was desperate for it on the lid and back behind the film looks good, but I was wrong. but when I saw the delta was quite different from the bad actor and I wasn't sure of how the two girls tried to be I was confused. The film was in other places confused and I did not enjoy it yet but looking at all the films to see if it would be better but it was not, it was interesting, not and I say BORING.and I don't think so many other people like like I am boring boring
