I was shocked at the 1970s film according to the story of Bernard Malamud. This is based on the story of the possible liberation, the preference of color and unfulfillment of life according to mistrust. The black angel angels are sent to help you plan and work hard with his wife. If Morris Mishkin (Zero Mostel) will only believe the angel (Belafonte), his wife Fanny (Ida Kaminska) will rise. The problem is that Morris has basically provide life and only refuses to believe that Belafonte is an angel. <br /> <br /> When she believes it, Fanny improves but the end has doubts and Fanny is suffering accordingly. It would have been very good if there was an English translation in the last area when the Fanny was talking to Morris. <br /> <br /> Jan Kadar, who successfully directed Miss Kaminska in Oscar has won a talented performance in 1966's "Shop in the Great Street" also leading this film. The Kaminska has been reduced to a film in many cases of bed and his kindness in his speech is not suitable for a serious situation that he faces. He continues to call her, their daughter, who did not listen to the Jewish religion. For the most part of the film, he does not recognize the appearance of Angel in his house. <br /> <br /> The place in the pharmacy is distracted by the area where Angel's girl friend fits Belafonte in their home, it is memorable but all too briefly. We don't know why Belafonte is in danger and why he is dead. Those who watch this film should have left the hall in a state of sadness and despair.
