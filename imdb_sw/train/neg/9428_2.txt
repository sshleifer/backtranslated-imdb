I don't usually take time to comment on which a few people will read, about a few movies they will see. However, in this case, I feel I must warn all who can think of wasting time on it. I finished watching just five minutes ago. This is, indeed, one of the worst movies I have seen in my life. Acting is terrible, the plot does not exist, and the production standards are poor. I know that even a small movie budget can be good, but it's not this. There is only one thing that can save this film for any fan of panic - more screen screens and moving! A total of three times that happens this is off-screen. Although it is appropriate and frustrating because it happens - especially the last area - not enough. The movie is very long for small content, also a heavy conversation, and so difficult to check. What happens? Put it all in short with the spare room, three innocent girls and skilled to go out to a special place where more than 20 girls have been robbed and killed. Their car, of course, decreases, and is taken to an old boring house designed by three madmen - one of them is a psychologist. All three are finally killed, directly, off-screen, after what is seen as ever boring, slow-paced nonsense. As I said, the only things that are worth looking at once are murder. Please do not give it or rent it for this purpose, and do not be deceived as I had the art of the false box and film details. Save your money and your time.
