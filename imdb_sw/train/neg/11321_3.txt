You can't go away when the original story is not all good. The needed blood cyborg is just dopey. <br /> <br /> Script is blas√© '. Actors do not have much to work with. The sets were carried out in the wilderness to reduce costs. It is a trademark that if history is desert, then the cinema has no budget. The lack of budget is the same, if there is a story. "Solarbabies" and "Blood Championships" are examples of good work from no $. but this film looks like it had to change their photos together to buy a camera sandwich. Again, forgiveness as the story was not just sand. <br /> <br /> Finally, this film makes the greatest crime of all: Not finished! Just approaching it as a business break away from all movies. But others have never come. It's odd. <br /> <br /> It's just bad.
