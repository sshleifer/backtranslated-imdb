Movie welcomes the public due to Ben Stiller's charisma and awareness of J. Aniston. It seems that we have here a catalyst for success, but nothing is successful in this film. Polly is played by Aniston, of course. This is a kind of character that is suitable for perfection. Bem Stiller is a tough boy like "Meet with parents", but in this movie comic pictures are few compared to the head mentioned above. <br /> <br /> Script is very poor without anything. With these two well-run actors can get very well - but they can do what when there is a bad story with the script. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10.
