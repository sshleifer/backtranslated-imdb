This film is bad and becomes worse for every thought imaginable. It is not just a bad act with a script and not blind and timeless destruction of the same waste on looking at it. What makes this film in my shy hall is obviously striving to become authors and producers doing and trying to try and make it funny. Jean Reno's parenting replacement is an old and learned lesson in the first film so that they can add a new girl who is given. Almost more extra surfaces and gags return even this time makes me want to rip my eyes out of my buttocks because it is losing a really good film. Persecution of regular camera cameras in any movie in this movie can put the viewer guilty of ethics. This second film takes a natural success and expels it out of his coffin and eliminates the corpse into the public square and for destruction not only the original idea and his heritage but also our minds. This distinctive film with a spruce goose could not fly because it had no conspiracy to heads who returned to 'necklace'. No script since it was written and added every day. No attention to the camera or shots in mind. Bad lights and special effects done for doing so. This film can not even pass a student film in a basic film 101. How this bunch has found no one can say. It was a huge investment loss and it seems that no one has the power to put these abnormal errors from our genes. This movie has one good place ... its it! This film is my # 1 worst movie ever, finally "Howard The Buck" is not enough anymore.
