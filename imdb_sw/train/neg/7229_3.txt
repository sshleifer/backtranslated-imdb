This movie seems to start in between, introducing peripheral players as well as it gives the key characters without any substances and thin paper and / or back-story cohesion. Almost no one is reliable or recognizing by their actions in this film. The color of the plot and eventually goes anywhere, the talk is clunky and says the director has a little idea of ​​how to get better from its executives. I feel like there is the first half of this film but never got made <br /> <br. We are telling that the hidden pyramid has been seen more than New York City and that Central Park has inexplicably being the Arctic world. However none of this seems to have led to a lot of stimulation among ordinary people and is only a small concern for the government. <br /> <br /> We are released by "bad organization" in Eugenics but that's really just pretending to spread the world with many small groups of power. All "Eugenics-is-bad" double-entender is heavy handed and never really pans out here. We should be concerned about the intermediate characters but we don't learn enough about them to know why. So much about this world is underdeveloped or completely undeveloped that issue off as 1 hour, 40 minutes of genetic rationalization for rape. <br /> <br /> On "digital" digital animated world created here, all I can say is that at the same time as this film was released several other directors made it so for more seamless and reliable results. <br /> <br /> After spending time watching this video more questioning left in my mind was, "so what?"
