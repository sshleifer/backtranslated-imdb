Jimmy Dean could not be more hammy or odd loutish. Hysterical as viewed through the Mystery of the Mystery of Science 3000, which I measure as 10. This ugly horse, rage should be placed with the "Booty Call", "Pumpkinhead", "Swarm", and "Smurfs go to Bangladesh". A film like this proves that sometimes actors, authors, producers, etc. are getting behind their credit, or are stoned. It asks you a question "who was a fool to pay for such whales?" But then, he had a good judgment and "Last Justice" has never been, then we cannot have a beautiful voice sound in "The Secret of Theater Theater 3000"!
