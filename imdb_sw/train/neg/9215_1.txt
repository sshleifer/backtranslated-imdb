This film tried to handle a series of problems that the main character, Robbie (played by Hanks) met in all the film. It was a fear of video watching about the exhibition that helped fuel D&D is the pursuit of the devil in 80 years. <br /> <br /> If you want to lose your time and money, clear the junk. <Br /> <br /> PS - Although the cover seems to be interesting, that's why I think my brother bought it, not available in the fantasy area, unless you think of New England or New York City to be that place.
