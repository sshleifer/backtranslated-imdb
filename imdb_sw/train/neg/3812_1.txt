Full House is one of the worst TV series! Why? Because all the characters are very irritating that it is impossible to carry. For the best character is Joey even even so very pleasant at all times. For DJ girl, who wrote her character? I want to kill my soul every time he speaks. mention when Danny started with his philosophy. Example: DJ won nearly ten thousand dollars or more in the casino. However, he is not eighteen so he should not play with the rules. Come, give me a break, do you? Since I have seen that the ignorant and child the event I finished the television at once. For some thing they say in this series even the child could be bought. What could the world think that the Full House is entertaining and amazing? Every single word that they say in this series seems like Shakespeare wrote Unless Shakespere knew how to write and except that he could not be that child and stupid to write something like stupid as they wrote in the script for the Full House! <br /> <br /> For everyone who has a bad heart or any kind of bad medical condition or any life or any feeling of the real world, I recommend in detail 'Don't look at the Full House'! Even one part as a quiz.To remove this series. Save yourself from folly and folly.This is the worst show of TV ever! I would like to watch this Teletubbies then. 'Don't look at this'.
