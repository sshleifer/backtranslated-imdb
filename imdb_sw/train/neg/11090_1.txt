This movie looks like it was done on TV. For many years I was waiting for a film about Rubin Carter, because I loved to see the box on an old MSG, and see that this film was very disappointing. I have a lot of respect for Mr Washington, but it was bad and interesting. Nothing could say about this movie unless I made it as a song.
