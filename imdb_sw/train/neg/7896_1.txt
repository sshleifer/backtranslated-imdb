I do not know why this film appears to have received this rave review. When checking the "Bang" one night on TV, I found myself tired of the nonsensical, random conspiracy on the screen. The whole movie does not seem to be any unnecessary exercise, art-fartsy to enjoy the part of the film manufacturer. The fact that the director / author goes to the same name strengthens this self-esteem. Those who are proposed on the fries of indie will be better to find something better written and dare to say, more entertainment than to lose for a while.
