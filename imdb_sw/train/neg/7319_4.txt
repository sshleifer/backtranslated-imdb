when you come to events involving Albert Brooks without his shirt ... try to beat the fur ball. I love Albert Brooks. I saw more, if not all his movies but it was the first time to see this. Modern Romance is interesting to take the issue of love. There are small movies that deal with the desperate love or too much like the Romance Movie, although the 1979 Chilly Scenes of Winter is very near. They are all concerned with caring men who are also attracted to psychological / perceived women. <br /> <br /> Where-like Chilly Events of winter fronts in the surrounding subject, this movie has the most basic basis and the issue of love because all people are already in relationship .. and out of relationship .. and return again. And because it is a movie released in 1981, it is time of fashion and such words. That's the main reason I like this movie. My basic rule when it comes to the cinema is "If it takes at least it may have some historical significance", you know the temporary things of the capsule. It guides me to the terrible events of Albert Brooks shirt without a shirt. That person is hair. Many hair. As she is wearing a red shape of hair-hairy fur. And what more is he almost seems to burn the victim-hairy. It is not interesting before and events with him without a continuous shirt. The early return of the men of 80 sex seemed to be normal and there was nothing surprising. But in 2009 see something like this is quite clear. Sorry, Albert! I would like someone sometimes said "hey let's try this area but with you wearing a simple shirt, I mean you can fear people". It is very bad and I feel a slow actor who had to deal with the body of Albert Brooks on it. He might have been pulling his hair from his teeth for a day afterwards. <br /> <br /> However, it's a good movie. It would be better if I did not see Albert Brooks without his shirt for what seemed like 10 minutes to continue because it would be permanent to view my views of this movie.
