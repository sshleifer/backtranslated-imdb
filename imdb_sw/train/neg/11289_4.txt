Elizabeth Ward Gracen, who will probably be remembered as one of Bill Clinton's "bomb explosion" (they have a prescription for it now!). In fact continues the form of fatigue of the Highlander-hero series ever meets another eternal eternity on the last time they met, but there is a crisis, and there is a fight with the last sword where you have the cheapest impact sequence. <br /> <br /> Then you have Nick Wolf's character. Basically, your ordinary hero of 90, and usually the "sex tension" story. (To a large extent, why you Hollywood think of sexual tension is more interesting than sex.) This was a joint Canadian / French production, so half of the series takes place Vancouver to emulate New York, and the other half is Paris ... as the Highlander did.
