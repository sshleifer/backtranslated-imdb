In a film that follows a styling, he played, obviously, and a struggling actor, this is not interesting for Chris Klein. He is trying to bring anything that he did not remember for the role and characters through an unknown script that can be displayed, what can only be described as, a leading bland man. The story exists, but that is all, and it fails to show any beginning of the beginning, middle and end and the viewer has left to beat his shoulders like nothing in the last hour and three quarters have happened really. One bright light in the middle of this is Fred Durst, who can stand on his seemingly talented stars and does his best to bring back the Legde back to life. If Fred can re-create this while working with a high caliber on cast it remains to be seen but I will look at him later.
