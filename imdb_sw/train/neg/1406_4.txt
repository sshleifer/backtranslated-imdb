This "movie" is like a music video. Kusturica said in an interview from 2004 that when making movies, she feels like making music, and while doing music, she feels like making movies. The best thing in "Give me this promise" is music, written by Stribor Kusturica. <br /> <br /> Kusturica said in the interview, that for him to talk in the movie is like noise. "Give me this promise" has a "little" noise. <br /> <br /> I loved "Life is a miracle". It was also like a music video for the first 30 minutes and for some later points, but it was a good plot. "Give me this promise" does not plot. I waited for this movie with great expectations, because I have read, that the script is written by Ranko Bozic - one of my favorite writers, who also participated in the "Life is a miracle". Ranko Bozic writes a good conversation, but for Kusturica they are "noisy", and a lot of regret, I saw just two conversations, which I could recognize as written by Ranko Bozic. Another part of the script was used by the director to make his video music chaotic to his son's music. St. Gord Mihic (the man who wrote the texts for "During the Gypsies" and "Cat cat white cat") said in an interview, that Kusturica is not available script. "Cat cat black cat" was the only script, which Kusturica said, that he did not touch it. According to Mihic Gordan, after Kusturica all return on the script, and if it does not, it does not make a good movie. And I think this is the case with "My promise". He should follow the script of Ranko Bozic. "Give me this promise" allegedly "comedy", but there is a very short time, which made me laugh. While the comedic is in the same style as "cat cats cat white," but it's not quite funny. I think the difference comes from the fact, that "cats cat white cat" is written by Gord Mihic. However, I know some people, who loved "Give me this promise", they get very much movie.
