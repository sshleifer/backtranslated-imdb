I did not know what the film was about before seeing it because Tashan had only teaser tractors when it was sold. So I asked my friends if they knew anything about it and said that "It is the beginning of the leader of Vijay Krishna Acharya who wrote screenplays for Dhoom 1 & 2 and the son of Saif Ali Khan Ibrahim is doing the first in the film to play him as a child in his flashback" . After looking at it, I understood why they were not the correct trailer because it had nothing in the film to show. The story was very big and even a 10-year-old child could come up with a better story line. There was no action and the camera trembled for every possible angle there and it is difficult to know who is killing. Also the action was daft & unrealistic e.g. One handgun was able to kill about 100 people and machine guns. <br /> <br /> When I watched Tashan reminded me of the film 3: <br /> <br /> Sin City: At the opening of the Koyla: A terrible English language of Anil Kapoor as Amrish Puri in Koyla. Jhoom Barabar Jhoom: The proud joke that was not very funny. <br /> I heard also the budget is 40 crores which are similar to Dhoom 2 and I don't know where all the money went. Otherwise if you love Dhoom 2 then there is no chance that you will like Tashan. The race was hot on the heels and which is a million times better. Only two beautiful songs are Dil Haara & Challiya and both songs are played in Greece in good places but what are they using in the garbage film? Even the terrible language of Anil Kapoor could not save this discomfiture.
