I've finished this on TV and what I can say but this is the worst movie I saw! I'm ashamed to be from Melbourne, where the film was released. The diabolical acting, the effects of the milk of the amateur and the sound of the worst sound. For a plot, well, that's even more stupid! Some events just leave me wondering about how bad it was. There is a reason to put these kinds of films on television - because they are trash! Avoid at all costs.
