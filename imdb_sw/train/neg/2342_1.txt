I don't know what will be so great about this film. If it's worse, why should anyone feel to see this? First of all there is no story. One can say that even without a movie story can be worth looking for because it promotes some kind of strong emotions (laughter, crying, fear, ...), but in my opinion this movie does not do it. <br /> You are looking at photos at +/- 2. There are more important things to do. <br /> <br /> I think you can say the movie is a quiz and surprising because it lacks all of the above. But does this have a two-hour value of your valuable time and EUR 7 of your money? For me the answer is: no.
