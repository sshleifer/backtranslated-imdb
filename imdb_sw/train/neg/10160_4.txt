A typical Lanza's flick of appeals with a small audience with a weak story line that was put together to justify Lanza's MGM contract at that time. <br /> <br /> As reported by Lastliberal member (above) Grayson could not stand Lanza because of its development of dirt towards him (and sometimes on the camera). In addition, its immersion and smell of regular drinks during the events they did together could not fail. After making their second film (and the last) together, "Toast's New Orleans", the normal Grayson quietly entered the office of Louie B. Mayer and told him without a word that he could not work with Lanza again? period. Mayer felt that Grayson was more valuable to MGM then Lanza, so Grayson's statement continued. Grayson continued with the star for a number of the most popular and most popular music and Howard Keel and others. Later in life when asked to compare Lanza and Keel his response was that there was no comparison between them, and that Keel was good to work and had more appeals to "real people" in the audience.
