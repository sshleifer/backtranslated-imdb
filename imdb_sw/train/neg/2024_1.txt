Trying to get money in the success of Making or Working with 1 and 100 comes this appropriate apology for entertainment - Show me Money, where the 12 shimmy girls wear dresses in red. The competitor is given the beginning of the words, such as "What team lost ..." with three choices, A, B, or C, each that completes the words. The competitor has three positions to respond to one of these elections 3. Chairman - William Shatner, in his amazing pleasure - asks the competitor if he wants to "get into the answer" and when the opponent says yes, he takes a "dancer", who cries "Show me money." ! He opens the volume, and if his answer is correct, he adds the same amount to his quantity; if he was wrong, that amount is removed. (So ​​theoretically, it is possible for a candidate on this dreary symptom to actually deploy on money Shatner money.) There is also a "Killer Card" and if the opponent takes a girl who has a bad book, but has answered well, nothing happens. If he has responded negatively, the game goes to a sudden death and answers another question. If they get these errors, they don't stop for anything. Before going to the broadcast, Shatner cries, "let's dance" with Shatner, the winner and 12 girls shake the hostage. At the end of the show, Shatner asks women to be "the last dance" and they all shout more. I offer these events to show 6 at all times, at a time when this hope will please the excuse for the game will be shown to the door. (It may be even worse - they would have been bribed through Cuba Gooding Jr to host, although I am the best player than 'Shat,' as they call him today.) <br /> <br /> 7/08: I think what - I was missing! It lasted only 5 events. There is hope for the world.
