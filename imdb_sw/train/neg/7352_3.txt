This was not interesting in 1972. It's not funny now. Unlike many other people, I am not interested in the film because it is a fantastic sex - I am a bit excited, or suppose I enjoyed the reproductive reaction in the bitter PC people - I beat them because it was not well written and acted. The only memorable character is Blakey, whose 25-year-old British people will immediately recognize since he was loved by the inspectors for a long time. <br /> <br />
