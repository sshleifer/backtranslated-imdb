"Ask the dust" has been seen appealing from the trailer, and we especially like all the characters. Unfortunately, the film was not obliged to be considered as a game, and it was not enough to be a comedy. Usually it seemed to handle itself, with no leisure effect. After seventy minutes to wait for this to be better, my wife and I came out, considering that we did not lose any time on these feelings. Not interesting, moving, funny or artistic. It looks like written, produced and guided by a high school child; however, it was a disgraceful waste of other talented actors, not to mention our time and money.
