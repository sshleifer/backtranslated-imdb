If there is hell, there is a screening room where the GRAND CANYON is playing regularly in an eternal loop. One can hope that the presence of many wonderful actors - Danny Glover, Alfre Woodard, Kevin Kline, Mary Louise Parker - will help to create the presentations of Mary McDonnell (whose decision is to watch her own films for ever). But, no. It seems that they brought those other actors and serum done by McDonnell. Anything is engaging, high, blaming (if not deaf or knowing anyone who is, be prepared for your blood to cook in a large TDD area). GRAND CANYON is full of people who are not worried, who are involved, but never give us a reason to love / encourage / encourage or even tolerate. With exceptional discrimination, they are unworthy who cannot be infected. There is no conspiracy to talk, no development of character (these people are unable to develop), there is no breakdown and the writing of the most arch you can meet in the film. The best thing about GRAND CANYON? His name. This is the one big hull of the movie.
