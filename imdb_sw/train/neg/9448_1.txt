No redemption features, this film is trash. His joke doesn't start to be funny. Children's humor is sad, and an attempt to appeal to adults increases sharp humor in a sad pocket. Sitting in such a way that my children make me worried about what might come next. I couldn't enjoy the film completely. Although my son who had a DVD was purchased was enjoying the fact that he had a new DVD, neither he nor his sisters had a strong desire to see it again, unlike Monsters inc, Finding Nemo, Jungle Book, Lion King, etc. which all received regular requests of replays.
