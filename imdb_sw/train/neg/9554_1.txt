This is even worse, and I mean the worst movie computer I ever seen. The whole plot is quite enough and evil. It means ... <br /> <br /> The person in this movie can really say with a computer as a real person. Now maybe you think this should be a small computer on high technology, well, it is, but it also makes it with other very bad and weak computers that don't even have a mirror interface. <br /> <br /> with a great idea how to load a "super" computer by connecting through a computer game on the net is very stupid. My mobile phone will shut down the lights down to save energy but it appears that this computer's hardware is not recommended to use its resources to tackle national security threats or to upload computer games. <br /> <br /> There are also other bad things about it but not just at this time. I don't finish believing someone can record a stupid film like this
