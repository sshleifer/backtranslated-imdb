'Frankenstein's curse' faithfully honors Mary Shelley's story with one word head, which was not as bad as the changes were quite good. The creation of a creature destroying the Frankenstein family has been completely excited and replaced by ... nothing. Heart and moral error has gone. It doesn't help that Frankenstein is a stupid, ignorant murderer; he deserves everything he finds. The program is a comprehensive list of Clien de Frankenstein. Even taken on its own terms, this is a trash: bland, a walk-in film involving a looking-looking creature with a hair ring of pudding. If it is the first film of the fear of Hammer, headed by Terence Fisher and the star by Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee, its place in the horrible history is safe. But it is a decoration.
