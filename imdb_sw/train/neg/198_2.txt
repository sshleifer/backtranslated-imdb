Burt Kennedy was a very good director, but you will never know for this cutting. It is not just a cheap film, it is cheaper - more than just the events of war have been raised from the supreme "Last Command" since 1955, and the picture, which was 32 years earlier, seems more modern than anything in this picture . Featured actions that have been shot for this film are not available, confused and insufficient, it looks like a shock like all the pictures. This looks and feels the bad films of students (and the budget didn't seem to be much more). It walks like molasses, acting in a large part is on top-over ham or under-comatose - although Raul Julia comes out better than all the other cast - and it's a chock full of annoying wrong history. On top of that, it is WAY very long. If you make a stimulating film, do for an hour or more and do it - do not hesitate on three hours, as this does. If you want to see a good film about Alamo, see the version of John Wayne's 1960's, or even the 1955 film that this movie stole its scenes of action. Hard to believe it took six manufacturers to make this movie lousy. Skip it.
