I did not expect much from this film, after "Life is wonderful". It turns out that this film is ten times more than "Life ...". I feel that the director / writer only plays with the audience: "I would like to see how much (audience) you can develop". The conversation is empty, ... the situation is minimalistic. In short, the picture is very good. A few sarcastic publications are half amazing, but it's really hard to laugh at this "comedy". I have cut myself to be able to watch the film until the end. If you can leverage on this director's fiasco, ... you will find a good job of the story (Miki Manojlovic, Aleksandar Bercek), and the best performance of Emir Stribor Kusturica's child. In short: very bad for a very good director! Emir Kusturica is still small and should make high films. Instead, he chooses to make this low-budget movie-only-to-private budget, with a proud attitude towards world trends and apathy for its former fans.
