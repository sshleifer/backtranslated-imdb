I have been willing to hold a lot from the late films at the end of the sun / summer, but in general it is based on the fact that many of them have money (for example, a special cooling effect, a pleasant plot, comic value, Steve Buscemi, etc.). This movie, however, did not have this thing. All we had was a fun less than a few minutes of the cleavage of Eva Longoria (the issue of Maxim is cheaper than film tickets). There is a lack of embarrassment, insistence, backward story, character development, continuity, etc.. I would go into a special, but certainly I've already-maybe forgotten many more movies. When I was in the theater all the time, I was stumbling not only to spend the day watching the 24th season on the DVD. Save your money on this one, people. Unless you really, really, you love the harshness of Eva Longoria.
