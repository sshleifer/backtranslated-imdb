Work in this film beat Sunny bhai at Gadar. Akshay Kumar has the authority of Leonidus in 300, Neo in Matrix with Spiderman and Superman. It's hilarious. Unless normally Akshay Kumar and Anil Kapoor comedy I can't see anything positive in this film. The story seems like the author told his 10-year-old son to write. The movie is so unreal that Anil Kapoors many bullets and shotgun are much more wrong with the director. Except for Tashan directors to make this film no other Tashan. I am hoping to lose my money on this movie and not recommend it to anyone. 1/10 is the least I can give to IMD or I will give you zero.
