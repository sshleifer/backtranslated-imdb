In recent days I have been placed under this film by "King Arthur", on DVDs chosen by others for "evening entertainment" and together they do not think anything more than considering the growing ideas that I have modern-day filming is totally free. , and it's content when you get "action". Both movies had garbage. <br /> <br /> Whatever happened to the character development? What happened a meaningful conversation? Something happened ACTING? And, when looking at something that says "historical", whatever happened to try to take a certain step of accuracy, some real idea of ​​the "political map" of the time, even a little flavor of the era, especially in his society perspectives. Why should all show the value of the 21st century America? I have read on the message boards of the consultants who are "less" of the dark age. Not so. Much of the so-called, and great knowledge of learning at the time, but these hikers could not have difficulty doing any homework. I just want to get 0/10 votes
