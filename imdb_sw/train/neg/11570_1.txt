The intentions of the directors have these films are very respectable, but its history of its production has found that this cannot be achieved as much as other film makers will do. put her 30 days of TV series in mind but also count in MTV its production "i bet you" which refuses its weight in any matter she she documented and also count on its production rather disappointment "supersize me" I did not have my optimism over . sadly this movie broke no heart at all. as to "supersize me" after a while I wondered what was the point of all this was. The main statement becomes clear after half an hour but all time of play is filled with unnecessary items and repeating things that have already been shown in this way or earlier in the movie, so it dresses and refuses to end.
