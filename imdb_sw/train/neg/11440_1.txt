Otherwise it is one of the worst movies I have ever seen - and I mean forever. My wife and I had been out of our mind within 10 minutes. Not to mention being boring, it is impossible. Women (non-lesbians) cannot bathe together - they don't kiss "kissing". The brothers and sisters do not live together well until their 30s and they move around to play together and share in central parks. Men have not found their wife and sister romantic kissing the night before the wedding and then never negotiate with the wife said. Of course not. <br /> <br /> Heather Graham is likely the worst player in the film today. He is shocking when he should cry and vice versa. The only movie that has ever been good at Boogie Nights - and that's because it wasn't doing. <br /> <br /> I can't stress enough how this movie was bad.
