This comedy has wonderful things in it, surrounded by many unwanted things. Almost every area that involves the staff of the fortress and their antics to ignore is a waste of time. And such programs are very complicated that makes you wonder if you really had a script already before you started to open this image, or they were just doing it when they continued. (* 1/2)
