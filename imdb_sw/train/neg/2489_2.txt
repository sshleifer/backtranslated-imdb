Saturday night **** Friday Night *** Friday morning ** Sunday Night * Morning Monday <br /> <br /> McBain (played by Gary Busey, before the name resembled a character in The Simpsons) is (usually) it is not the offender who gets the result but sends his heads over to decay. To avoid the shade of her boyfriend being killed at the beginning of the film, the plot instead takes a different position and sees she had to travel to Mexico where the top secret of the US super-powerful super tank and the ability to think has been used in secret, just taken captive with staff, and a group of terrorists. This look at the cheapest (even at 80s), a very slow movie was a wonderful job for Gary Busey after making a feeling like a fire of Mr Gun's fierce firearm Lethal. He goes through only his character card here, edgy and zany as ever (for 'butthorn' to be his trademark mark set for bad people), but without the material to bring him back. Henry Silva has a presence as a village of screens, but he is used quite here as a Arab leader (in red beret) and a bad script gives true clunky lines of dirty conversation that makes his performance look like wood laughably. He is just one of the actors of the act of film act, including L.Q. Jones and Lincoln Kilpatrick, who come but can't add anything to the mix. After the first half of an unpleasant moment without many exciting actions, things take a bit at the end, but it's too little to delay and no one can work to have any fun. *
