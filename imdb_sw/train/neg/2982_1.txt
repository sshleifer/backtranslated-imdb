Zombie Review # 3 <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Try this! /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> The bad in many ways for language as much as possible to explain it all over / over again, the film is known to Lucio Fulci that even with its standards it has no connection, meaning or reason. However, we cannot blame Fulci as it was wrong with him but Bruno Mattei, who doesn't even have a fulci style to help carry the film. Mattei seems to have brought a little film but it has not been reduced. Therefore, I am ashamed to say how I enjoyed every minute of Zombi's worth 3. It does not have the characteristics of redemption - for a known type for thin characters, weak stories, and lack of film skills, Zombi 3 pushes the boat but to do it is even funnier than City Nightmare. <br /> <br /> "Action" begins when "Death 1" gas stolen from military base, and destroyed in escape. Who is a thief, why did he steal, and why did the American army think that building the forces of the dead was not a good idea? All these questions and many will fail to answer in Zombi 3 .... After hiding a hotel, an infected thief may be mad from all the green plastecine to his face before being monitored by an army who loves the best way to remove the body its will burn, send "Death 1" up to the resulting sky ... zombie bird! Who then attack people and turn people into zombie !!! (If the zombies are insects, why are the zombie birds not attacking other birds?) Then we meet our "heroes", GI three GIs and the girls' burden. There are two other boys with them, but it's not important - nobody is important here. It will be very difficult to remember anyone's face, leave their name or find reasons to care for them. They take to hide in the hotel as a thief ("last week the area was full of life, now full of water!") But there is no escape from the undead. For this point you will be able to drink it completely or will change something that has been damaged. The script is amazing even though the world's largest works could not save it, so it's as much more involved - and not just humanitarian characters, acting zombie here is under all the time. There is no cooperation of how the zombies do - some of the attack on the respectable style while others are actively involved in fist fights or payments around the machettes, not to mention the zombies who are still able to talk (gimmick which gives the film HORRIFING TWIST ENDING). They die from weapons to the chest (instead of the head) and even inserted with a good left hook. How can you beat a zombie? !!!!! In fact the emphasis on the wrongs of the 80s wrong often makes it as part of V ... <br /> <br /> Zombies also spend a lot of time hiding, it seems to wait for hours in ignorance areas on some poor positions it will pass away and be afraid of their lives. They hide in forests, in garages, in booths, on roofs, in water, and even under pregnant women. One time a zombie follows a woman up to the stairs. To kill and eat? No! Push him into the water, those zombies with their sense of humor! <br /> <br /> There's a lot of though though. Plants are broken, wounds are pus, and there is a great way to eat meat and people get their faces closed. Nothing compares to the practice of natural exercise, but if the negative effects are your pockets you will not be allowed down. All this and I have never mentioned a bright music, the head of a flying zombie without knowing, a scientist who works really can stand as a real, or last punchline ... .. in a skill problem The original radio station exceeds the zombies, Zombi 3 gives us a real zombie zombie! "He has gone on their side!" Our cries of the hero, before they swear to continue to fight against the undead in a series whose anger never came. Zombi 3 is a garbage - it will not be a loss to the world if every single magazine has been destroyed and all records of its existence have been deleted, but somehow I feel my life is rich because she has seen it. <br /> <br /> Did I say I am rich? I meant a short minute ...
