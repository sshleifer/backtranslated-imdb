Shocking act for Potter and flat plot without tension what so ever. And with the gentleness of the female, it is laughable. I saw this rubbish when it was first released and though I found it worse than faith I am glad I went to see it. That's because now I have a quick answer to the question 'is the worst film you ever seen?' Further, I have the comfort to know that every film I have seen throughout my life will be better than Tango. But I must admit I was attracted to the way that Potter wrote a script that would hit a large number of council's aid from around the world (as revealed in closed loans). I just recently saw Orlando and I can see how Potter learned bad lessons from making the film. All it took was a group of beautiful dresses, a few hard stares for cameras and a leading woman, and an unintentional conspiracy to deceive the movie to the public. So why should he not think he can leave with anything that is a Tango Lesson?
