The original excitation Rudolph: Very good. The original cartoon of Frosty: It requires a little work, but it can be worse. But Frosty and Rudolph together on Fourth of July? C'mon! Give me a break !!! This was one movie that should not be made. It was bad. It did not go for any particular holiday, except on July 4. That made it especially worse since Frosty and Rudolph are often associated with the Christmas season. With any movie can be destroyed and sing too much. Regular songs made this film more durable than it was. The movie tried to combine two familiar Chirstmastime characters with traditional American holidays (which almost seems to "limit" to America), too many songs, and lloyy plotline. Results? The bad movie that can't look at any time of the year. I would like to give you this film even if you like Frosty and Rudolph.
