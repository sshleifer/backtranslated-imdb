Frozen frustration from start to finish. As they were saying about Beatles'songs, there was a secret message if you played LP back. If someone had the patience to watch these films from the start, you would come with the same degree of despair. <br /> <br /> In addition to all this psychedelic podge of fear and false start, the obvious characters were film helpers, out of revenge if the film was not given. There is nothing to love about these two either. Witnessing, screaming and threats were given in the comic book style. I think it automatically is overstatement. Well, so maybe so much type is rolling their eyes interesting in the fact that they differ from them, we just plebeians caught. Well I'm afraid there is nothing to get. With two cardinal sins of any bad movie carrying from the beginning to the end. The missing and sad story line if you want to call it, and far away, is not one character you care about at least.
