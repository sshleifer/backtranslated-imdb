Wow. Other films allow me to have no words. This was undoubtedly one of those movies. When I came out of the theater, there was not one word that was in my mouth. All I had was an amazing surprise for my head against the theater wall to help me forget the last and a half hour. Unfortunately, it didn't work. In fact, this film has nothing to recommend. The humor was at the first level of the bridge, for the better, acting was very ignored, and the plot was commonly approved. I hearby promise never saw another movie with Chris Kattan or any other cast-SNL.
