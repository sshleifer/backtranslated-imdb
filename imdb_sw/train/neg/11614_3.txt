Lady in Cement is certainly true on the social anthropology of the late 60. Writing, not acting, is located in the middle point. What? I say - a clean camp! Be prepared to worry if you are a woman or a gay. Big and dame are common terms and the spelling of gay and bashing are represented by what they were in the day (camping-wise). Many lines are not searched though there are good displays and very few actors. Practical events are typical but it's fun to see Dan Blocker playing a tough guy who likes difficulty bashing. And Lanie Kazan and your Welsh Racquel are at the peak of their work. Amazing recognition were all 28 years and Mr. Sinatra was 53. The color of the music, waiting. . . there was a mark? Well, you get a point. Watch with friends who want to laugh good. it's full of them.
