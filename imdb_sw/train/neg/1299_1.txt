This production is not entirely a story. Acting is a shame. The Dutch star promised Sophie Hilbrand star should not add this film to his CV. His acting is far from innocent and self - I think he has crossed the academic competence; related to how he puts himself in this film. This film has unwanted weaknesses, sexual incidents and bad language. It also shows bad pictures of the Netherlands (as many films do). Don't worry about watching this film: waste of time, losing money and a shameful record of Hilbrand, who has been seen to be better and closer to him on the screen.
