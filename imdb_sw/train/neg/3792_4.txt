I have seen a lot, a lot of Nutcracker. Now I have probably examined this film from the view of the filmmakers of the exhibition, but I was desperate. I am sure people in the special business of choreography of ballet finds this amazing production but from a romantic romantic view I have seen everything from design up to choreography to be inadequate and inadequate "image motion". None of the traditional “strange” and attractive clothing were seen as what they should have (ie candy was not seen as sweets, mice were not seen as mice but instead of chocolate kisses,) acting was weak, perhaps dropped too much, and choreography did nothing to me. This makes the whole show very satisfactory (better), as it was not the goal of keeping away from any other production. But remember, again, this comes from the artistic perspective of the exhibition director, not the player or the choreographer, but the director of the direct male leader.
