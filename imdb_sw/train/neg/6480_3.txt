It was good to see all the ordinary characters, but the story hurt me. We loved Ariel in the first movie - why is the second one considering his daughter? New characters were interesting and I did not like this plot. Further, Christopher Daniel Barnes did not come as Eric's voice! Disney, please refer to fix classic movies with this beautiful simulation.
