It was 1974 and it had star Martin Sheen. That alone says what to expect for this film. It was a movie. According to the film, Slovik had changed, he found a beautiful woman, and he did not want to fight. <br /> <br /> In real life, Slovik may be innocent innocent, or can only want to run the system. Every Slovik was or not in history to decide, but this was a film related to spilling when the country had questions why it was fighting, and the movie took sides. Regardless of servants who were in Viet Nam or in 1974 (such as Willie Nelson would say, let's tell us the truth, it was about the Viet Nam war, not WWII), EoES was as propagandistic as Gung Ho was in forty years. <br /> <br /> According to this film, Slovik said its position, clear and simple. She had nervous trouble. Heck, I have a clinical neurological condition, and you believe me, if I would do military duty, it would not be a problem for me just to let my nerves go and fail in my work and get a demotion or put KP responsibility or Funeral Functions without a problem. If we believe teleflick, Slovik had no choice, of course because of its criminal history. <br /> <br /> Whatever the viewer wants to believe is on the viewer. I have learned that movies from this decade or ten years, in dealing with the service or military duty, would like to take the same position on a regular basis. <br /> <br /> 1940 and the 1950s, to serve your country. <Br /> <br /> The 1960s and 1970s, shock your country. <br /> <br /> This is history. <br /> <br /> The whole movie seemed to have a picture of Hollywood. He refused to serve and only when he was bound to death he expresses feelings. This emotional anger can work easily for its benefit in its nervous state, but the movie would like to show him as a human and only when he dies he will be sad. I'm not a Catholic, but I thought that the hail of Mary and Ned Beatty and Sheen's last, with the Lord's prayer, was as beautiful as it seemed like they tried to see who could speak faster. I don't see how this film can be viewed without recognition it was for Tricky Dick Nixon and the Viet Nam war. I hope it was all worthwhile for Slovik and anyone who chose to follow his example.
