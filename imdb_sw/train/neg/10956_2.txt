I bought this film from the Michezotop discount of the movie bin and the lid made me laugh without control so I bought it for 99cents. The movie itself has decreased and uses as ten different monkeys in all the film that does not seem the same. Not to mention they spend twice twice that is just a short person in the dress and make a great attempt to pretend to monkey. The most likely leader made the suicide suicide and chimpanzi after the movie started in the preview of another low-tax film Warner Bros and finished paying money to the studio. It also does not help that he had no fraud for the worst work he did, he was also known for producing a poop-chute film. Why is this film ever made?
