"His only home" was one of the funniest movies of the 90s. Now comes "Home alone 3". I wanted to know how they could keep up with the same story and consider Kevin would 17 in 1997. Would he care for himself, right? So, what does the director decide to do? He takes the child just as angry and makes him sick. Is the child as 6 years old and the mother leaves her alone at home? What? What kind of observer team are these masters? I don't really want to get it in detail if you want to sad to see this movie. But please, I would recommend that you would stay away from it. It's not worth your precious time. Go to a piece of paper, do homework, balance pencil on your nose, or come down! It is advisable to do then check "Home only 3"! </ 1/1 / / 1/10
