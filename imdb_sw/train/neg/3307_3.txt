My opinion can be a bit of a spoiler, why it's worth. Leave now if you are worthy .... <br /> <br /> The Word of Recovery should be called the "Feature-Featured for Old Women's Women to Get High On-Screen." This film is dumb. Emergency music is angry as it is obvious, hackneyed tunes that occasionally pop up commenting on the story ("Spirit in heaven," for example - Oh, I get!) This is essentially Cheech and Chong movie made reliable and its environment English and the power of Brenda Blethyn's impressions to the audience using its own voice. I was able to hear people of the news on the High Times newspaper to get their jollies on the big "buds" that beat this picture. Worse? Simple. Brenda tries to smuggle its products on London's white dress suits. It's not funny. Not original. It's not interesting. Not a good movie. 7.2 estimates are the result of hard work on voting. Don't waste your time ...
