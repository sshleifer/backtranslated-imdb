I can only believe that Garson Kanin must be two people. The one who wrote the "Life Double" and funny "Born Yesterday" and co-wrote such a beautiful screenplay as "Adam Rib" and "Pat And Mike" and his wife Ruth Gordon and then wrote and / or explained as well as what was wrong, barriers sad as a "knowledgeable mother", "Some sort of Nut", and this. Illustration tries, but the script is tired and clich√©d that even the efforts of Brenda Vaccaro always win. Script dictates to nadir in a true sequence that tries to characterize Janssen behavior of the circles to ensure that it is not gay. Bad sequence, but sadly one that can play on the film today. "Tribal joke" is now quite a verboten, but "joke" of joke is still "good, clean, family fun".
