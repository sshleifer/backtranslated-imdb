I know no one cares, but I. This film is historical for one reason. It is a unity of two heroes from two major seven-year films. Well, one is good, and one is quite bad. The great man is really true, in fact it's the best. The worst is the worst, in fact it's worse. Of course, I'm talking about "Star Wars" and is a star Mark Hamill, who was "Luke Skywalker", who is the hero of this film about a child who gets his Vette turned and then goes to Vegas (front) and after all the adventures, finally gets it. (Since he builds cars I think you can call him "Lube Skywalker"). Along the way he meets the hooker and the heart of gold, and end up with the behavior played by Kim Milford, a hero from the seventh film film of the "Laserblast" film, ie, as I realized earlier, the worst films of the made film. Milford has a bad player who Hamill must steal his car from. I realize that no one cares about this meeting of two very powerful heroes, but I. And I must say that this is one of the best / worst movies. Mark Hamill's work requires power, the plot requires a thorough practice of the Jedi, and the behavior of the hooker played by Annie Potts can be the most negative of all time, ever, in any film I have seen. But it's an enjoyable movie to watch the last day of the week, or night of the night, late at night, too late. It is one of those films that are looking for something but without a complete search and at the same time, it's a whole purpose is, like a free-free jazz, just exist as it is. And it does. And what, it's not big, but you can't say it's not entertainment, because for an hour and a half you can feel burst, but you can't feel false. So open your mind, relax, and enjoy this muddy gem without any expectation, and may be strong, and always.
