This movie had what looked like a good premise: 9 people faced their fears to win one million dollars. Unfortunately, it has never been a good movie. There are several instances which are very high and uncertain as a play area. Just a few scores are the release of the camera point on the body parts of the female. Acting is bad, but some line is exciting in their evil. The strange thing is that toward the end of the movie turns to about 5 minutes west, and finally, the twists, which they had several, do not mean to all the movie. It seemed like the director added only things because he thought it would seem cool, when you easily turn the movie's movie up to that point. It didn't do too much. The only thing that was creepy is the ancient people who play in the hall, but that has not come close to doing for the rest of this mess.
