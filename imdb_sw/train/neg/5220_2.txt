The basketball basketball student is doing research on the genetic sequence, using human anus. He expects to be able to get treatment for all diseases and aging. She is faced with completing her research because it has not been published, so the university has trouble confirming money (I think). It makes a pilot in a monkey, which dies quickly. Then he tries himself. He begins a relationship with a young mother of a very young; he was the one who wanted results from the study. At first, it seems to have no effect on the needle, unless new power. He knows that he had a memory loss, and began to remember what happened. Additionally, he begins to look bad. <br /> <br /> Since the movie is called metamorphosis, it eventually turns into something else. You can't believe your eyes - or what you have turned to, or the most amazing dress that the actor wearing has to show what turned out. Surprisingly, there are more changes in the shop - the end of the film is real, no sad. The only thing that this film is going to be is that Laura Gemser is in it, but she has a very small part. I immediately saw a video box for this and a covered plastic bag on the box box. It may even have electrical equipment in it at one time, perhaps decreasing eyes (the eyes of the main character often turn green on the film). The text I watched had a box that showed the tears of tears where the glue was made in plastic, removed. The beauty box, if it still had it, would be the only reason I held on this film; I'm definitely wipe.
