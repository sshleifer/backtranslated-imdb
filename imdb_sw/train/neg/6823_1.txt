I had to believe my best values: No expectations - no desire. Instead, however, I expected to get a single jewel like Koyaanisqatsi (1983) and was brutally broken. Powaqqisi is my humble opinion except a simple financial attempt in the effectiveness of its predecessor, and - artistic - fails to fail. It seems that some producer collected the remaining material from Koyaanisqatsi, quickly threw it together, put everything in a slow motion and photographed the pins under the pseudonym of Philip Glass to quickly throw along the music banal background, which is repeated from time to time. Where Koyaanisqatsi enters the viewer for a quick and slow motion change, Powaqqatsi is a long-term sequence of common images in slow motion (if you look at your VCR in a quick review mode, you will see what I said). I defied the most, however, was the sound of Philip Glass's voice. I couldn't - and still can't - believe that these drones kind of New Age kind of commercial, which could be easy to be created in one day with any 14-year-old Casio Calculator, were from the same artist and thus included the emotional music and fully-similar to Koyaanisqatsi. All in all, a great waste of time! My advice: Forget business! See Koyaanisqatsi again instead!
