There was a specialist named Shaq his name was Kazaam, and he had had his voice was corny, these lines were bad boy stupid crying over his bad father, bad casting, bad effects whats next? This movie takes Prolly did not make 20 bucks lives in boombox not lights it hurts as a string as a stamp of rainy food ... special awesome. Oh, and his confusion as hell. I can't even continue. Let's just say, it's in "very bad, his favorite". Watch once with your friends and get a good laugh. But don't expect anything good.
