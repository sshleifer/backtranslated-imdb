This is a bad movie, a bad script, a bad trend and the end of nonsensical. Also, bad displays, except from Clancy Brown who is the name of criminal use here, and Michael Pollard. Watching this film was purgatory - it does this to download enough karma of the film to see more well below the line. The movie shows the father and man who seem like they could not all have been together. The role of male leadership is not well documented and seems to be insignificant in this role. You can see the point of the plot away from miles. The actions of the female leadership and his brother, the soldier, also have no meaning. Therefore, a great step for its part at the end of the movie is not suitable for the script-wise.
