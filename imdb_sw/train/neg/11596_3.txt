The "Fantasy Child" of 1989 is the fifth film in (generally overrated) "Nightmare" series, and recently from this advanced point, the series became a general garbage. Just a good film in the series were the original Wes Craven of 1984, and the third part, "Warriors Dream" in 1987. The second part was desperate and boring, and it was the fourth part where the former madman Freddy Krueger started to hate idiotic joke from time to time. The fifth entry into the series has nothing to offer except for the best (preferred acceptance), and one interesting place, the flashback series how Freddy Krueger was present. All the parts of this film are mainly our jokester-and-jokester screamed the clamorous clamor, and the old form of a group of young jackasses, who try to avoid sleep, because old Freddy is waiting for them to dream. Lisa Wilcox has already played the role of Alice Johnson, and the most irresponsible group, such as the eerie 's children' voices are added for any other reason than to have the right to do this an improper and attractive sequel. .. For short: No natural, decline of old form, and the most burden of sad jokes. My 3/10 generous rate is based on good performances, and especially emphasize the difference between the second followers, "Freddy's Dead", which is worse than belief. If you are not a lover of Freddy Krueger, "Baby Dream" should be avoided, and even if you, this is more likely to despair.
