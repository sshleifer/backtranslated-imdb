This is a large piece of craft forever. It seems like they spent more time, effort, and money to make it a DVD cover than they did on a real movie. I really thought that the DVD had been removed by a personal porno until I knew one of the actors from the lid. This movie looks like a man made it with a hundred bucks and camcorder and they used half of it in the mouse. The picture is clear, but that, with very bad lighting, movies, if you can call it, production, act, if it's really what they do, and the script, if it is one, makes it look for this movie worse than old porno. At least the old porno is sure. This seems like members of the PETA when they met and decided to make PSA true, meaningless about animal rights and feelings. This is not worth money or time. It doesn't have the same thing as the real killer of BTK except the name of the killer and some of the victims. People who made this film should be happy she is still free, or can follow them after they erase this bad movie.
