I love Chris Rock, but I feel losing this film. The idea of ​​returning to heaven could wait, but filmmakers followed the Turkey camp very closely. While Eddie Murphy thanked Doctor Doolittle and Professor of Nutty, he made them again - so they became films / Murphy cars, not just remedy of remedi. That's why they succeeded. If Chris had done this, this could be a very good film. A few laughs that come are when he does his act of standing - so he can also make a concert film. It would also be a funnier like a white man who sits in it was a truck driver or hillbilly. Why Hollywood continues to make junk like this? Because people go to see it - because they love Chris Rock. So make Chris a nice script and give us the best movies! Don't use films that were not good at first!
