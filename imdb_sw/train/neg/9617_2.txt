Three years ago, Rachel (Therese Fretwell) was going to the lake with her friends when her brother fell out of the boat and drowned. Rachel's friend thinks it's time to stop the beat and take the blame for something that doesn't have control. So grab alcohol and something to chew and return to the lake that has been in the constant pain of Rachel. As expected, the blood disease has already begun when two friends are decorated before even going to the party. This flick has a sense of playing high school where everyone forgot their lines and 'winged it' ... very bad! Marcos Gabriel put himself in a position as Rachel's partner today. Outside Fretwell and Gabriel there are some good pieces of blasting with a few characters that you would like to stimulate the skin before getting 'offed'. Considering the few players who had the courage to appear: Erin Gallagher, Andrew Williams, Jasmine Trice and Derek Nieves. This is one day that you don't think is missing.
