Diana Muldaur looks on Star Trek for the second time, but this time as a different character. No one appears on the board appears - perhaps it was hair. Regardless, at this time he is not the recipient of the god (see previous section) but it is a very popular woman with magical authority that enables to speak and see Medusan without going to heaven (a common human response). Unfortunately, a person who is very interested in him is a few cards that do not have a complete deck and is trying to kill the Medusan ambassador (who, oddly, lives in a little string - this is a good way to travel). And, unfortunately, Muldayr has not hurt all of it. What happens next is a dumb type and at the time it was on the first time I saw it, I was well opened. Looking at all the people on board to ga-ga on Muldaur was very good and acting in Spock when he went briefly was a young man. Make yourself a permission - if you haven't seen the show before, select a different location.
