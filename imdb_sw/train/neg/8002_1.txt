What's a bad movie. The tomato tomatoes had good marks for this too. do not show positive views; It was not terrible. It was not funny. It was not clever. You'll never even consider. I lost only two hours of my life to look at this. The factory produced by the computer was very interesting to see the first time. after 15 minutes is no longer available. The discussion was bad, it must be something of interpretation. another one that has been outside is the Wadi Americans. 3 were shown and all did not behave, mind and judgment. Now I will write a few lines to this pad for that we should have 10. Employees in the video shop should beat me for bringing this name to the counter.
