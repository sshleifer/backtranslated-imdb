This movie provided a new or worthless NOTHING. After seeing it, my wife and I agreed that the studio just took this out and could be worried down if it was entertaining. This is a good example of the "fancy" film - they have a concept about the film and other details are important because it does KNOW will only make $$ according to the original concept. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with Cruella from prison and continue to parole. He does not hate babies but he plans to praise them - he can not only hurt the flea. This does not last long after its release and return to its old ways. Period. The most sad news of the film was the support characters. Eric Humble as the voice of the Waddlesworth airplane made me to him - and that's in the way that I am a hard fan of Python. It was obvious that he did it because they gave him a lot of money (it could have no other reason). The Cruella Pastor, Tim McInnerny, was happy in the Black Adder shows but here he completely lost and did not want. And it must have had a few bucks to get GÃ©rard Depardieu but also had completely lost. There were other other actors but they were given how badly they were written, I tried to keep them out of my mind. <br /> <br /> Overall, you would only be better to let your children watch television rather than disturb them to let them see this drivel.
