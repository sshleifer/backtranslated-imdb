My friends and I rented this for "Night Night Movie" with great optimism, but the brain was something to be reduced. The brain itself is looking for surprises, but especially sits on its small platform. Who would have thought it would be cold that the brain was only available to three people in the 94-minute dismissal? This film has several things that happen for the first time, including Estevez-knockoff leadership with a bit of confidence (we are told that his great mind is lost in his extraordinary ranks and schools, which include placing the krazy ginger on the seat man). It also has a good line, out-of-the-frame and out-of-breath that becomes hard to be everywhere, and, yes, chick finds honey. However, the director needs some knowledge in the art of passing. In the last half things just start talking and continue, with at least 3 or 4 useless, stirring scenes to form the middle of the plot. The events in the complex of PRI are very serious. At least 15 minutes of this movie are people riding up and down under the same stairwell. I could fix the screen for this thing for half an hour-more cheese, more than a year, more dirt, more than a brain stage. If you are making a horrible movie, at least give me something interesting to watch when my superego opens. Perhaps the director was trying to bring the audience to his movie- I started to feel like one of the cities of zombified at the end of this trick.
