In the film, I feel it must be more than art. I think it should be more than that, the way to tell stories on the screen. This short from David Lynch describes the story but not a lot of one. I felt that it was strange but also wonderful that the comedy. It is a good choice of film but nothing else. As I said earlier, I am a big fan of David Lynch but I am worried by some of his work because I don't see him completely. That is definitely something that he has done right now but I know he still has a ton of talent and I'm glad to see what he is saving for the future. If you like Lynch, check this out but don't be surprised when you don't like it much.
