When I was a 50-and-a-half-year-old child linked to Disney it had a great definition. What happened? They are able to find all actors and practitioners wishing, best when they are. But somehow Disney manages to delete items even though they have many resources. Disney can afford the best authors, best producers and directors, but still ... they reduce items! This film is facing. Unfortunately, I suspect Disney in their pride does not even know when the movie is good or bad. <br /> <br /> It is due to the talent of executives that I can even provide 3 of 10.
