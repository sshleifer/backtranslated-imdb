SPLIT SECOND can be a good movie. Stories about the "highway of the road" killed, has Clive Owen very little to give good performance; BUT ... but ... <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, film creators take their own movie and work on the idiotic camera and bad editing. The camera jumps over creation in an unsuccessful attempt (I think) to reflect Owen's problems from business, family, and traffic. What this makes is actually giving the viewer a headache. Since filmmakers do not care about making a good film, but just interested in their dancing pictures, one should not waste time on this storage.
