This is not what I wanted to see. I bought this on DVD and under the movie I found myself angry and turn off the movie for a while. <br /> <br /> This is what I liked: <br /> <br /> 1 They shot at Dad /> <br /> 2 tribes were sad! ) looks for faked <br /> <br /> 4 The worst scientist was angry <br /> <br /> 5 The quality of the picture on the DVD was so bad <br /> 1 Jerry Goldsmith Music. This music is very great. I have a bootleg sound from this film. Unfortunately the quality of voice is not good, but it is the same for its time. At first we see dinosaurs inspire a kind of fear. <br /> <br /> 3 The child is kinda cute when he is in the water and plays it /> <br /> 4 this wonderful place and tent. Children who see this film without hope will learn that evil always loses.
