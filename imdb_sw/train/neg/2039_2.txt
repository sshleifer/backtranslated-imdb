This film was almost not interrupted. I can get more of the fact that it looks like it was shot by a video camera at home and that this movie should spread over a week at a time but the characters do not change clothing, but acting has broken the 4th pieces to me. I found it better to work in grade 4 grade. Besides that plot is useless. If the man suspects that the boy could send him. I trembled so much that all the killings were made by gun. That is not a copycat Zodiac did not kill using guns only the authorities would know that it was not him. Another thing that was very misleading is that they were called Disassociative Identity Disorder DSM 4 at that time the name of the book used to identify people with mental illness is not the name of the disease. In general I think this movie is not a kind of movie that can be done with a low budget at least not as low as it was or they could be sure to have better or more practitioners of a year. Many people have gone down the budget and out of having the awesome actors looking Easy Rider with Dennis Hopper and Jack Nicholson with a low budget.
