I totally agree with one of the viewers here who were happy "For Birds" won Oscar in 2002 for "Better Publications," not this material of disease, which is very hard and appeals to anyone, of course, who has no faith in heaven or hell. <br /> <br /> Animation was good, but it is also a shortcut for animation. And, on the way, I like dark humor but this was not from the beginning. <br /> <br /> For information here: a person around and around something but gray (symbol here) is being set by a TV set (which looks every few hundred yards away) that he is in heaven, hell, or purgatory. He always puts his head to his head and finds himself after hearing the news. I think that it will be funny in two cases of three.
