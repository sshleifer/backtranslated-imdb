Wow. I don't think I've seen films and many good actors who had a very basic role to be sad. Justin Timberlake is perhaps one of the worst actors to get into a great role during the movie and the power of the stars and money behind him that Edison had. His role was to consider. The story was similar to all the other actors who played with professional actors, heck, even LL Cool J was good since he had small pieces of teeth. How the director and the movie company realized that Timberlake was ready for this role there is no way to understand. His character destroys the entire experience since every time you are screwed you are a real root for the fighters who have lost his donkeys, and he needs to be a hero ... I can't lose money on this hall or video. If you have HBO and have nothing else to do at 2am on Saturday and get drunk and stoned, this can be the same. <br /> <br /> Looking at Timberlake in this role was like watching someone 'Kermit Frog' works in the Blockbuster of Hollywood, didn't work at all.
