To the extent that I can tell you, despite earlier comments sent by other biography, this film is now available on DVD. I saw just a few weeks ago. It is on the value of the DVD and I paid a total of 98 cents as well as taxes for it. I saw it in a cent cent shop in plastic bowl and existing chopsticks. Now aren't you people who lost out the beauty of voting for super-duper Swedish import limited edition version feel like they were? I thought so. <br /> <br /> This film was worth 98 cents. 99 cents, I can start talking to you. But clear the value of 98 cents. And remember those words about getting what you pay. For a small film film.
