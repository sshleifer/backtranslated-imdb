Growing up, Joe Strummer was a hero of mine, but even I was left cool with this film. For the best and bad, The Future Is Not Written is not directly "Back to Music" style documentary. Instead it is a biographical art film, full of interviews, performance pictures, home movies, and many animation animations emerged from the "Animal Farm." The film is the same but approaching more than half an hour. Fire forest system, when you touch on ideas, you are really very interesting in action. First, anonymous, it is difficult to know who half of these respondents. Second, who needs to hear people like Bono, Johnny Depp, and John Cusack mouth hosan licking about man? It had no meaning for the Strummer life and their views did not add to his story. This picture is appropriate when Strummer, through interviews and talks, touches the life of many people who did not know about: the suicide of her big brother, discussing with the death of her parents, the joy of the father. For me, these were moving because it showed Joe Strummer not as a punk mark we knew and loved, but as a natural man who had to deal with the joys and sorrows of life we ​​all should be like. <br /> <br>> There has been the best text about Strummer and The Clash. (Westway, VH1 Legends, and the Kurt Loder Report written in MTV Documentary since the beginning of 90 years comes to mind.) Joe Strummer: Finally It's not written it is only for the Kufahards.
