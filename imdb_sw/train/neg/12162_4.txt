This is not a panic, as the first part was: This is ("campy") lighter and pleasant entertainment. As in many sequels, the action begins immediately without an explanation. But there are boobs, so I can complain. And the real boobs which are. If I understand correctly, these are very rare today among young girls in the US. A. That brings my attention to the great actor here is Pamela "Bruce sister" Springsteen. This can't be thought without the first movie, so compare this. Again there are very few dresses (especially pants) and beautiful hair, it's not hard to say what years this film is being done. There are also very strange characters, this time even more than "pathological". Especially camping staff. It is like a summer repair of mental intelligence. People are older: Most of the actors should be at least 25, but I think they should be 16 or something. Some of the "techniques" used by evil Dyke are very serious. Actually this movie is not very good and the first part, and this is worse than every way.
