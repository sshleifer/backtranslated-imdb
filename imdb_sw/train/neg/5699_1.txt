WOW, this film was very bad. I'm so glad I didn't have to pay money to see this awesome movie. it was like a nut of history continued on the binge of coke! The verification of this has made it look decent but it was very bad. I will say the idea has been seen to be polite but to come. it was really bad. If you sit down and think about it you would also find it was wrong. go back in the day you think they had all things to work with. It wasn't like ben franklin sitting one day and doing a paradox of a damn. it was quite a concern, and you want to see a bad movie then by all means go see this. All films and all of HORRIBLE can be on my top 10 films I've ever seen.
