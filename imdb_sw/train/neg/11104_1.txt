I am not one of those people who go to the web after seeing the film and decided to call it the worst movie made. If you are joking, please see my other comments. However, for the first time ever, I saw the movie is so horrible that I wanted to write about how bad it was before it was. <br /> <br /> I like bad movies. For me, Ed Wood is a professional, I thought Bloody, Creepers Jeepers and many awesome horror movies were beautiful. However, there is not one good thing I can say about this film. <br /> <br /> The program is not available. If the person who reads my review is losing their money to see it, they can realize for themselves how the plot could be, but I advise you that nickel would be more valuable than watching this film. <br /> <br /> Special effects are bad. <br /> <br /> Acting is bad. <br /> <br /> Two directions are interesting, but that's all. <br /> <br /> I'm not a type of movie trophy for anyone, but I want anyone to give me an email on foxbarking@yahoo.com requesting my opinion on this film before losing a dime on it. I'll tell you nothing. I love bad movies, and I love fear and I love new innovative movies. I even love the fear of sex things like Hostel (which other recipients claimed that this was like, but clearly thought only so that Roger Bart was in this with Hostel 2). But this could be Number 1 of non-trivial and stupid video and dumbass EVER developed. And before you reject this review, this comes from someone who is not just sitting for the ENTIRE Premium of the Dead House, but actually purchased its copy.
