The movie begins in 1840 in Japan where a man reduces his wife and her dying partner and commits suicide. It is a very good series, bloody. Then jumps for the present day ... well 1982 to be correct. Ted (Edward Albert), Laura's wife (Susan George) and their bitter children migrate to Japan for hubby work. Wananchia house with amazing! The surprise - it just happens to be a house where the murder took place! The three dead people are almost as ghosts (makeup is very bad) and they make life of hell for the family. <br /> <br /> Voice sounds - but it's not completely lost. There is an opening of blood and ended with NOTHI occurs in the middle. There is a great crab attack which is just exciting! They seem to be so fake - I swear I saw the strings attached to one - they combine !!!!! There is a series of indecent sex in the first 20 minutes (perhaps just to show George's body), another after 40 minutes later (but that was necessary for a plot) and false freedom to the end. The battlefield between Albert and Doug McClure must be reliable. As for the act - Albert was the same as husband and McClure were as good as a family friend. But George - as always - is severe in the lousy film. He gives this film a very high - but can't save it. I'm giving this just 2 for him to open gory and install. That aside, this is a very interesting film.
