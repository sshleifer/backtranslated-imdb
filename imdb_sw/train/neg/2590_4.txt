The American pie has gone a long distance from the first. At first I think participants do not get a clue what they are doing and instead it's just a remake of the college party that went to nuts. The story sets as two university students (featuring the wrong young people) to dream of attending college so that they just get night parties, sex and of course booze. The plan is stupid and comes off with the original pie. In fact they were no longer the apple of the apple somewhere in the film. Luckily I work on a video store and I can hire for free. But please remember it's a waste of time unless you like to enjoy sex films without a brain and drink it. I am a young man and I believe even the powerful Evan could be the best choice instead.
