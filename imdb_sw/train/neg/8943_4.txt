John Wayne & Albert Dekker compete for oil rights in India's territory, and with the attention of Martha Scott in the Republic of the Photo Gallery is released in Utah, USA. The West of the most interesting variety from its characters and its more modern environment, and Wayne & Dekker are playing in the old and West groups. It depends on the story by Thomson Burtis who writes the script with Eleanore Griffin and Ethel Hill. Albert Rogell leads through work that fits his work. A common good story is actually saved by the last three, where the action thanks to it and we are treated for something similar to the blow. The path of romantic light is not fully justified, and the strongest fights of the two striking characters are destroyed by Rogell that he cannot hide men working hard. But hey, worthy people always deserve their glory. A consistent support comes from George 'Gabby' Hayes and Wayne as it usually has a lot of screenshots, especially when he blows his pistol. But despite his typical budget than the usual Republic, it is still a film of interest only for 1940 Wayne's enthusiasm. 4/10
