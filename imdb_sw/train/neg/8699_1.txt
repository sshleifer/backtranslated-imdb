Carnosaur 3 is bad ... very bad. Bad to the point where it's funny. How much I try to try myself, I can just believe anyone in this world can get this entertainment for a great reason. I mean, come, even the cover is bad! Okay, special effects are quite ridiculous. Those "Carnosaurs" are very foolish. The scientist tells the soldiers that they are moving so fast, but when you see them running, they run faster ... the actress in the ball suit trying to run as far as he can. And the blast is funny (no other word to describe it). At the beginning, the shot hit Jeep AFTER young people say "What was it?" ... And other explosions are also delicious. But the worst thing is the screenplay and the so-called story. You don't expect a good story (or, I don't think anyone hiring this film expects a good film) but at least a story tries to be meaningful. I mean, it's hard to make stories about dinosaurs killing people at least considering. It's very difficult if you look at this. Oh, and if you think it is easy to make reliable commands like your characters, tell the authors of this awesome, awesome piece. I mean, who is the patient who can make a cheap joke after one of his friends has died? And they do a lot. And if you think that the film about the killings of dinosaurs can only be at least a step, FINDA UP !!! This film is very interesting. Children (who made the name of the crippled person?) Attack (with a stimulating process where you do not see much happening). Soldiers think of how to beat (in the most amazing scenes where they try to really be hard but can't be seen to persuade them even a second). Therefore, they attack the carnosaurs, but their idea does not work (another disgusting chain). Go back to the settings (and a few joke popping up) in another ridiculous location. And this goes on, and on, and on. And let's forget the acting that is about to be affected as special effects ... and story ... Oo, this movie takes only from A to Z. <br /> <br />
