Spoiler Caution. . . I agree with you, it was almost there. This was a very bad movie, on a true and interesting story. It had that promise, but acting was ridiculous for the best. Some sets were good and true. Others are something outside of the theme garden. I found myself laughing when I looked, what we thought was, the big events. I wanted to love this film, but I couldn't. The best part was the battle between friends who ended with "King" dies. I loved Queens penalty. And, the last shot made a beautiful picture, though. There are many good movies to watch. I don't recommend this.
