I want very much to give a piece of GARBAGE zero, unfortunately, does not exist, so, I had to give just 1 to warn you about how this terrible stupidity of the cartoon known is true! The characters seem to have been influenced by the original readers, no, wait, I saw the original readers before doing well! I would "Misadventures of Flapjack" for this bad excuse for the cartoon! I probably say what others have said, two words: RIP OFF! Remember that part of the Dexter Lab when they went to karts under the volcano? Yes, Mr. Fellows even went into that idea and failed! They got even the Lugia Shadow in one place that Pokemon peon! (He even entered the same franchise!) That one character is the lowest price of Mandark from Dexter's Lab! Brother Fellows need to be charged with legal violations for this piece! Everyone has his own views, but those of you like the Johnny (RIP-OFF) Examination, you are talking about. Make your own permission, change the channel when this call attempts to destroy your screen!
