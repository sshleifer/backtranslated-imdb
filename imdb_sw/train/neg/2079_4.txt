I am a great fan of Ivan Reitman-I am Evolution and who does not like Ghostbusters? From the trailer you know already that the character will be removed by Luke's. So the building looks at the moment when it gives its power over it. But pay is not there. Hit the shark could not get (little) giggle but again, all was in the trailer. Nobody breathes so much as Uma and Luke is food Owen on his good days. If not by Riann Wilson you would sit there with a smile made up until your cheeks began to destroy. This is comedy, right? It is not bad - it stays just like a stale craale behind the fridge. This may be a brilliant screening of Superhero and Women's films but it fails for both errors. See if Jason Reitman can protect the family name.
