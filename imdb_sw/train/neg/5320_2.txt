This is a dry and blind feature on one of the most interesting events in WWII and in the history of the war behind the front row. The bad composition of the films is more serious about this film as a plot to kill Hitler to think it was a very big event. There is no promotional behavior at all and the idea that Tom Cruise thinks that a high-ranking commander who asks his inner thoughts into patriotism and immorality is totally insane. I believe that Mister Bin could play better. Typically, the film looks very much like a copy of a video of a good German TV film "Stauffenberg" from 2004, but it cannot reach near the film about any film feature. However, the movie appears clearly its financial goals and viewers of the corn maize who love the quick blood of Mood blood and the detailed values ​​of art.
