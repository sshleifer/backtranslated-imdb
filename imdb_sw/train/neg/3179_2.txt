I saw this film accidentally yesterday on the movie. I had some hope for the film because I like Spoorloos (The Vanishing) and the book is based. The movie starts the same as for the first time it seems to be a good thriller. As soon as the movie becomes aggressive and unpopular programs, the characters who have never been given and none of the attendees are concerned (like Marjoke) and bad editing. The movie has spread to black bits that are a very long way, which emerges that jumps and returns with many events that add anything to the story and can be dropped easily. After suffering through storytelling you will be treated for one of the worst ending I have seen for so long. It should also be mentioned that the movie has a lot of sexually explicit images that you may be using if you are watching many Dutch movies. It's hard to mention good things about this movie. Almost one third of the audience had already gone out of the semi-go to the film and I do not feel a word of love after the movie passed. Avoid this movie at all costs. completely destroyed any belief I had left in the Dutch film industry.
