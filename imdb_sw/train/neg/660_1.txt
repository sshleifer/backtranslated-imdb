Sorry, I can't even describe how poor this film is poor. Don't do wrong, I didn't have too much hope to start. Let's say it, the PG-13 flick of the slasher is designed to be out of ummm ... beaten, so nobody should be surprised by the lack of a year. But it was the level of uncertainty and excitement shown in all other aspects of this film which has hit me off. We have a protagonist who is absolutely completely useless that you find yourself rooting for a bad person. And here is the return of books ... RIGHT RIGHTS - thus breaking the cardinal administration of basic writing-character development. If you think at the end of this film the poor little girl will come and finish the ass and think again. On top of this, we have been given the least possible contribution (and obviously the little killer) who has the same kind of grace. I do not regret it when I say that Dora the Observer has more powerful attackers than this film. Finally, because all the power of tension or freedom is removed by the inept (and it seems to be thirteen years old) the director, what can be left to fill in 2-hour screen time? <br /> <br /> Clothing, yes. Many rooms and many rooms: many buttons, small buttons, connecting buttons, Narnia buttons, many bonds of damage do not want to wear yourself for another year. In fact this film should be called "CLOSET", and it had a big picture of a big deal on DVD. In the background it may have a picture of the audience who fell asleep with Roger's quotations and Ebert - something to the level: "what f * @! We lost our time to look!"
