The sensory school ceremony in Denmark, in 1969, "We Will Win" offers an awesome book to take American culture. Frits (Janus Dissing Rathke), a flower-rich, 13-year-old, with a half-bound ear and Mr. Lindv-Svendsen's master's Bent Mejding. Lindum-Svendsen, the school director, has been portrayed as a fascistoid trader, has an internal control community. Lindum-Svendsen has gone too far this time, and with his father, restored from a mental breakdown (indeed, he did not have enough game ready ..), and a hippie music teacher Mr Svale ('Hi, I'm called Freddie' ), Frits stands for justice. Tell me what. So it does not know, the top- (way-) made, and so full of trouble, that as a picture of this 'family' of this delightful-filled and cliche- excuse for movies fails to fail to convince the non-Scandinavian audience. Sorry, the good readers of Denmark, fall like this in your emotional trips. But it is definitely not a story about 'boy being a man to fight the system'. The boy never becomes a man, but it is still ridiculous, the big face of the eyes. If you call a small church of a small town, led by a dictator as a character of cartoonish "system", I have poor if I miss something. <br /> <br /> If you're in the family photo, go see the Happy Fun.
