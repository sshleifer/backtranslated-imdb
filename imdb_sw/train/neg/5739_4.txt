The small town is attacked by horde of bloodthirsty vampires. The only hope is the only explosion and a group of victims of ragtag <br /> It was released in 1993, "Darkness" found something of worship after its release. It is easy to see why-it is caused (and I have a large-scale delivery) and a year, and it is energy and enthusiasm, as it is available in other fearless budget budgets as "The Door Next Door" and "The Children of Ravensback ", is actually rather infectious. Even though that may be true, that's sad to do. The film was shot in Super 8, so the picture is sandy and dark, making things so hard to see (it would be nice to hide the characters being a bad mullet.) The split is also a sound, made by Casio angry Keyboard and even Death's death. Death (seriously, what is this with no frick of fear of the budget and the worst of the Death Death?) When a person does not expect the praise of Oscar, acting is still at an amateur, for actors sometimes seem almost confused rather than fear or threatened. <br /> <br /> At the end, I am sure fans of budget periods do not like this. All the others, however, would like to have a little more meat in numbers.
