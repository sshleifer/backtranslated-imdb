This film tried to be too many at once: to fight political satire, Hollywood blockbuster, sappy romantic comedy, family values ​​promotion ... list continues to continue. Failed for all, but there was enough interest to protect me from getting to the end. Though I enjoy the spirit behind the WAR, INC., Itinkiti sees great efforts, especially when it will be taken by its goals to reflect the lack of great difficulty, instead of writing poor, trends, and production of this special film. investigations carried out on the battle of the war. But exciting in this way reduces the real damage to what is happening. Reminds a little of THREE people, which also causes a real cause of anxiety.
