I love the series of 'Toxic Avenger', but this weak offering of Troma people has no meaning, and it has hit me all the time. The nuclear leakage (and growing weed around it) makes the Tromaville High youth go to nuts, which makes them join the group, have sex, explode, and nothing. There is also a certain breed of monster in high school ... My God, this is a mess of the film. Most characters have left their efforts after this and should. Waiting (it creates) began to get my nerves in 5 minutes ... <br /> <br /> Break the heart. 2/10.
