I would love this movie. Acting is very good and Barbara Stanwyck is good but the movie seems very always to me. The movie makes people of class work look low and cheaper. The fact that the daughter has embarrassed her mother and that the daughter does not rise above her always made me a little. Barbara Stanwyck as a mother worships a daughter but a daughter gives the mother a pleasure to be happy and well to make her family. I wonder how many others have seen this film feel this way about it. The act of work was very good and appropriate to watch. I don't like the story line. only personal recommendations
