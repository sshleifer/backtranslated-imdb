Nu Image, UFO and other producing film for SCI FI channel that comes with a budget of nearly $ 2 million. Some have serious consequences of working, others include infection and others are still included - for $ 2 million. <br /> <br /> Hines originally claimed that this film was a budget of $ 20 million dollars but obviously this could be be produced at 750,000 dollars if not much less than that. A few sets are used, several screens are hit on a green screen and many effects appear to be unimportant and interesting. <br /> <br /> It is painful to watch. Not so much because it is not properly addressed, it is not misused and incorrect but because most of us have followed the development of this production for a long time and we had great hope for this film despite its very small budget. All of us who believed in this film when it was announced previously joined the army of those spoken by PT Barnum.
