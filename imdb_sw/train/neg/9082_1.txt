This is the worst movie I saw. I was deceived into thinking it might be good because a couple of my favorite actors are in it. Now I want to beat Jason Schwartzman in face to take this responsibility. I was ill after watching this film. Certainly I don't know Hollywood sometimes. There are many people trying to break that I'm sure you can stop up and get better. The worst films you make are the same as Beliri's Ferris instead of this sludge. Gags like a doll of hair and by rejecting the shoes of the jeans are added to the humor of the film. I was excited to avoid this film and watch it on television. This proves that you should avoid the delivery of January at all costs.
