Singleton has great issues that will come to accept. I feel that he thinks he is very good; however, this movie is almost transparent and self-righteous. In addition, there is a "right-do-right" message like during our Nazi neighbors when they beat it. I mean, who in their real mind will carry it to a group of Nazi jerks? However, the Singleton way shows the "war" is a fraud and seems to be designed to show us the best qualities to fight off the main characters than anything else. There is another “bad guy” (in fact a boy-dressed boy) who lays one of the film characters. In this example, I think Singleton really does a good job of explaining it is probably a very common situation when a woman in question asks a boy boy to use a condom and he doesn't have one or does not want to use one. In any case, she does not accept her claim to stop and continues to have sex despite her prayers. I think this type of rape is very common and actually many uniform people refuse to accept the fact that even rape. Indeed, there is no meaning, this is rape, which may occur most in universities across the country. How to start rape, Singleton can handle? When a young man tries to call a woman, a man who refuses to put a victim on the phone, when a boy boy calls him a "bitch black". Injured respondents seem to appeal to the Ice Cube counsel, et al, who then humiliates and treats the male boy as a regular and long-term “forgiveness” for sex with him in his words of racism; however (it appears in Singleton's mind) a little rape crime was not mentioned. Again, no one should feel compassion for a young girl; However, Singleton seems to be sending two messages that racist views are more serious then raped and in any violence is right against jerks. actually has been on an important thing but Singleton, while of course the talented director, doesn't seem to be mature or deep to pull something of this size.
