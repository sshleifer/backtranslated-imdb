Anyone who thinks this film does not appreciate its comic skills should be smoking and two stones in the film. This film is not available ... it's a bad movie. We should not compare between this film with Guns of Naked or Birds since the last two films are well written and funny. The danger of Reunion is not that. Unfortunately, it had the same potential (good cast, lines of good story) but good jokes are few and in the middle. The events that were supposed to be extraordinary happened more than the excitement. Males, vampire, blind girl ... IS FUNNY. The only characteristic of the funny were the Delores (the one who sold his soul to the devil). Indeed I expected more from John Hughes.
