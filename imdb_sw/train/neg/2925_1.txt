After reading several good reviews and hearing the good things about it in the words of the mouth I decided to hire come to the Undone. I must say I was desperate. The story was hard to follow because the film was installed as a series of current and recent publications that are not very common. Anime, in spite of the best active effort is flat and not recommended. Sex and magic are more obvious than they need to be. I have never seen a film where it seemed to be not necessary for a plot. The end is to combat the weather and leave many unanswered questions in the story line that were not properly developed. In my opinion, waste time.
