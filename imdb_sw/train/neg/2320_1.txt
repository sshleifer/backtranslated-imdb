This movie is made to the Asian / Chinese market, focusing on Jay Chou's fans, one of the biggest music stars in Asia. Jay Chou is a writer / singer of a very talented song. He is a mediocre as an actor, although he appeared in several budget production ("original D", "Curse of Golden Flower"). Surprised, he won all gold horses (taiwan) and Hong Kong film awards for "D original". Selected help is well chosen, which attracts everyone from China. Released including popular film / TV actors, singers, even sports producer (Huang Jianxiang from China). However, they were not given enough time to show their talents. The biggest mistake is that Chu got the position of director and author. He has a reputation for making non-brain-based films according to non-equally scripts. For his story of the poor and the lighting, all talented talent, the effects of the visions of the concept and the tons of production money were lost. However, the worst movie is closed for $ 10 million, perhaps even more in Asia, which has made one of the most successful office boxes in Asia. The bottom line is: you can watch this film only if you want to see how money and talent are damaged, or if you're just accompanying your children who are fans of Jay Chou.
