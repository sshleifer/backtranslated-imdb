The director, bound in chains and leather, listened to the audience at the SF Frameline Film Festival on Friday that we were about to see the film "experience". Quiz? Leave the video camera on the back seat of the car, then tap with the editing in the dreck in the eye. The road to the road to show manqu√© which starts anywhere and takes the audience anywhere. Free violence that opens the movie chased more than one administrator from the Castro field. I would like to leave, too, but my friend of cine needs a home trip and has this thing about seeing even more up to the end. When the lights came, the audience was too weak. Tepid College. Pro's questions for the most visible director enjoying the products. Avoid this film!
