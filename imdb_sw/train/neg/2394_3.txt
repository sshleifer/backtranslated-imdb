This movie was wonderful ... I watched it while swallowing a quarter of cubicis psilcybe (mushrooms). It was really amazing. I'm sure you should look up, but mushrooms are not enough. I couldn't stop laughing. Maybe lsd would work. Movies are a group of things that are busy with other things, and play. It's very fun for today's standards but when it was released I'm sure it was good ... one kind. I could see how other people think that this film was good, but I didn't think it was very interesting, and I was on a mushroom at that time. If you have a party or something and everyone causes it, choose from where you will find a few.
