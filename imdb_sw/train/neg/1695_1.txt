Well when I saw the preview of this movie I thought it was very scared and was very excited to see it as I had. Now living in America especially during this election I see a lot of deception but we must say these previews were on the list. I don't see how many people are afraid of this film. I just noticed only two screens to jump and just jumped to one. The whole movie was very predictable and maybe it lost some of my flying screens. In the case of many sound effects they would be so scared that I thought they were doing well. Oh and catboy uhh where it came out and why? The worst noise in the whole movie had to be a strange cry. Does that fear someone? I can make that noise easily. Now don't get involved with me all the time that I have loved all these horrible movies that just laugh all the way but I didn't even think that this was the one that was quite clear.
