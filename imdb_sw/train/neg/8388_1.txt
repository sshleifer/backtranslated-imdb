It comes to this heart of hope. Hope that you will never tolerate anything else. * cough * brazilian * brazilian * cough * * While watching I heard as I was in a psychological attempt to find out how low films could get before people complain. When I asked him for my money at the end of the movie I was told that because I looked at anything 'I did not have the right to pay debt'. I was told by an assistant manager that a number of people had complained and paid back anyway. The overview of the film is very common. The midget thief steals diamonds and it is possible if the child avoids the police. Under this clever summary however, it is a repertoire of the original, clean and hilarious screens. Or not. Ask the following: What do you think? Would you like to see people being beaten with pots? What? Do you like fart jokes? Would you like to see midgets showing as children threatened by a thermometer in anus? What? Do you like joke? What? Do you think children say 'goo goo goo gao gaa'? What? You beat? <br /> <br /> If you answered 'yes' to any of the above then this movie is obvious to you. Although it has been published somewhere as 'The worst movie of the Decade', there is probably a movie or 2 that is worse ... somewhere else. I can't say for sure. I gave this 2 star star because we all know only one star review can show weaknesses on the part of the auditor and then the investigation cannot be taken seriously. A young player is organized for unintelligent listeners and I cannot have a good conscience for anyone. Save your money for something amazing. <br /> <br /> Honor
