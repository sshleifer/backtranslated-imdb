I will only look at the small intervals, but everyone seemed quite different from the next. It appears after the first season, manufacturers decided to completely restore the show, stop characters, set up new ones, and rewrite the entire power display. <br /> <br /> If you've probably found a doubt, the show has about quirky, a young man can't predict Holly (Amanda Bynes) enters with her sister Valerie (Jennie Garth) in New York City. Beautiful cluster enough: a few odd + fish out of water + jinx high. When I forget so many things of spoil, this unfortunate show is missing a regular score, and sad because they have a good talent On everything, they insisted on changing the show (Val was living with once of the bf season, then he suddenly went, so he opened the bread?) what when things change that significantly, you get a feeling that even * show * it knows it's bad. I mean, a completely new set, characters written off and regular regular display! <br /> <br /> For a side note (this is just nitpicking), I know this is a television show and not quite realistic, but Val and Holly end up living in a great duplex loft (there are levels) and terrace ... in MANHATTAN ! Are you sure !?
