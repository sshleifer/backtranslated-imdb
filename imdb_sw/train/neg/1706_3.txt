These, this was a very bad movie ... if you read in this movie the other movie has no plot, no development of the character, it probably has some kind of script but it is difficult to tell according to the actual end result. The edit of this film was not quite available, tends to jump from location to location without any connection or anything to help the viewer decide what is happening. All this is just a budget under the budget of a zombie that has not been considered entirely, has a bad acting, bad conversation, everything wrong. The only thing that saves this film from 1 or 2 is the reason for this, I think this should be where they spent any money they had tried to try to do this. <br /> <br /> Unless you (if I) have volunteered to search and view all the zombie flicks you can find, don't take this into account. Period.
