Black and White Tarzan of the ancient, with the same story and the best. Not to mention plans. There is one place in it I saw that everyone forgot to mention. * (SPOILERS ALERT) * Where she tries to save Jane and her father, standing so close to the water. Eww! Also, she and Jane are shooting at the beach, with the monkeys that fly and clap their hands. * (END OF SPOILERS) * There is a need to have an Awareness Surgery on this film. see Bo very naked in this movie, it will make you go blind.
