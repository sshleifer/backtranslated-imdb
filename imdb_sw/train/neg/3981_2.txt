This movie has no beginning or end. And it is absolutely true. Mary-K and Ashley are supposed to be working in an email room for the Italian fashion company. But, for some reason, they are placed in a 5-star hotel (easily located on the road from Coliseum), and all others who work with them are like a typical example of them. One thing that I've discovered in this film is the way that one of the twins cannot end up with someone. I think they tried to lose their plot of little size. You have tried well.
