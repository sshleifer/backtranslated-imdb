Steven Seagal seems to be lying through a terrible shot of the film almost almost entirely to hide the full lack of budget and resources. Taking technical errors - F / A-18 and F-14s takes from the carrier to air strike, and by a miracle that F-16s were hit by a real strike - could give the credibility of this film more than it deserved. It should say that the most interesting thing in the film is the credit names that develop and then disappear in electrical electronics, which is possible for all users of Final Cut Pro. Put all your creativity in your own loan puts Michael Keusch in the same category as Marcel Mandu.
