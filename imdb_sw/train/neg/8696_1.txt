I am Anthony Park, Glenn Park is my father. First off I want to say that the story of this movie and the creation of the Alber Alert system is good. However the movie itself was made well and acting was bad. The biggest problem I had with the movie involved the second half with Timmons of Nichole and Glenn Park father. The events surrounding this part of the story were not quite accurate. My father had psychological problems at the time and took Nichole without any intention of harming him. He loved her as a daughter and was under the assumption that she had redeemed her from some kind of harm or indifference that she might have believed she was coming from her mother who did not remember much more than 3 years and that my father had cared for her and raised her so much that her mother he may freeze. The movie showed my father in such a way that he went to harm him in some way or form. Interestingly, Nichole spent many nights with my father where Sharon would work or do whatever he did. The reason my father was previously considered to be violent was because he had things that could be designed to be a weapon in his car. My father was a viewer. The things they saw as weapons were the tools to put the land in his truck all the time. My recommendations take this film with salt, is good news and depend on real events however the details of the movie (at least Nichole Timmons - part of Glenn Park) is the right amount and shows the failure of the director to discover the truth by telling the story. Surprisingly, as the director could interview any friend of Sharon who knew what they said exactly what I wrote here.
