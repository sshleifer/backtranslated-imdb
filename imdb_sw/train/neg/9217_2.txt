Yes, the only thing this film is not remembered is that it showed the star Tom Hanks who is only a few years later will be a star in Hollywood. Here though it is not a film that will show its talent even a little something that can be considered to have some entertainment about this flick is where it thinks it sees monsters and runs man through. Yes, this film is about the evil of playing a game that makes a group of people use their imagination and try to come up with interesting events. Basically, after a special type of school on the Dungeons of the game and Dragons are written with a trick here as Mazes and Monsters. Apparently, the creators of this film thought that nerds should not be happy with any kind unless they go out and drink, take drugs, have many unsafe sex and harass other vulnerable children like all the popular children they were doing. No, these evil people were playing a game in which they really needed one to use in the brain, no heaven! Not, if they have their brain really can be able to think for themselves and that they have no intelligence with certain groups out there. Yes, I think this movie is totally stupid and wasting time. In fact, it could be a film against addiction, but there are a few people who died to take Dungeons and Dragons for a long time in all its life than to say what the alleged driving driving was like.
