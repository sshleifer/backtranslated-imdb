Vampires Vs. Zombies are not the original name. It was true ... <br /> <br /> Beautiful Lesbian Semi-Vampires and Two Zombies Get Hit and Cars: Special expert seen by Bob's Lesbian Gypsie-Witch with his dog, Random Mother with special strength and School Catholic Skirt Short Skirt Zombie Choir. Also on the Box: Warning: No Plot - only the author and director will understand the end, or anything else on this film. Overall, I would like bad movies. I love vampires. I love zombies. Hell, I enjoy even the scholars. This movie blended all three with an unintentional and confusing (or non-existent), horrible (meaning READY BAD) dialogue, with a random STUFF and people who have nothing to do with anything (or do you know ... . Oh, and I can't forget the green otime 'zombies' in rubber gloves (yes, the filmmakers were very cheap they could not even cover their hands of zombies in oatmeal and paint). Any way, the result was this well-known BAD film, if you even called it. <br /> <br /> What! the end had to be meaningless? Vampire was a guardian and another girl was mentally ill? Where Vampires Vs. Zombies? Hell, where vampires all the time ... you can't call girls fighters. Whatever it is. <br /> <br /> You never rent or buy this movie. If you are really curious ... okay, I will understand. Hardly, even BAD movie lovers will not be able to stand this. It should be a number 1 less than 100.
