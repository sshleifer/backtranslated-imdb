I can't have a longer period of attention, but this is the second movie I have refused to see all the way, and even bought it on DVD because of its "classic" status. At first, I thought the director was playing the joke, so I kept waiting for the resolution, something to laugh, something to keep my interest, but this resolution did not come. Instead, the writing was very popular, the film was caused by a feel of it, as a person who takes a television series and a feature of the feature. The college should have been on drugs when they chose this film for Oscars under eight. <br /> <br /> Once again, I tell myself again. This is the second movie I have refused to watch all the way. The first was "Exterminator". I hope this gives you an indication of how bad it is. 1/10
