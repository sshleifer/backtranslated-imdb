It is sad when you see what the film tried to do, and it is quite clear that it fell far away from the mark. Film students should take this as a lesson and warning. Will be a teacher has an idea. He wants total control. So he writes, he directs, provides, his work of all movies by himself. Naturally, its concept is far beyond its budget. Typically writes a script full of every tag tag that can come with. Typically, he is very impressed by the great story of the story rather than the nitty loyalty of working with administrators on individual events. Usually, he ends up with a movie that is weak in trying to try miracles on a small budget. Normally, he ends up with a series of encounters (we can't do justice by calling the events) which feels like they were written at the age of 12. And usually he ends up with bad events he did that failed to grab the viewer. When you look at the Judges from this view you can immediately tell them that they are just normal.
