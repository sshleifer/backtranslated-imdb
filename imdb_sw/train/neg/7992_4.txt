I remember seeing this movie long ago on television. I remember the premise of the movie being on a group of residents who are attacked by sores eating people. What I did not remember was how it was true! I recently got this film on television late at night. I am sure I should be wrong because the movies like this will disappear from the presence and are no longer available! Suzanne Somers (in the middle of her career at Chrissy's 'Third Party') plays vacationer in Lakewood Manor. Construction workers are installing a swimming pool outdoors and accidentally disrupt sand sand. Or I must say, * * NATO OF ANTU TO ANTS * !! One of the employees actually gets attacked by sores. One minute she takes her clothes straight, the second minute she is wrapped in them. The next section shows bones in the dirt. If you thought it was too close, you should see Myrna Loy sitting at the wheel of a runner who gets a flight from Manor through a helicopter! I could see her picture thinking for a solution that was leaving out of the film! The last events show Suzanne, Robert Foxworth and a third person sitting on the floor of the hotel room with their backs each other, blowing through the leaves and covered with ants. It is a particular movie. There is no appeal of "disaster" or "big star" approaching the film. It was intended to be a 'major television event at the same time. Now, it is lucky if it decreases at 4:00 am on your television station. If you want to seize Suzanne Somers at best, then see the Third Party Company. If you want to see Myrna Loy doing anything on the table and paying bills, then watch this film. 0 /
