for the film, this film felt like one of those after school professionals, the lowest budget and the reduction of everything else. I think this should have an interesting movie of some sort, but it didn't work for me. asetay.it has flash colors of Flash Dance, but so what then is not any excitement in this movie chat. , though that has a lot to do with what executives were given (or in this case-not) working with. upon it is a choice of poor song, and very bad lyrics.i felt embarrassed to all the participants involved. They all have talent, but you can't say from this movie. It's just my opinion, but I must be Flying AKA Dream believing 1/10
