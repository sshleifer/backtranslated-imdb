This Cannon Movie Tale is the worst of the vote, and it is a positive evidence that the five-minute story does not have full film length to do. Poor Sid Caesar as an innocent king, made to look like a fool, is hard to look at. As the affinity of pride, Robert Morse has no charming charm. Neither his innocent widow (Jason Carter) "Songs" are very frightening and only reduces what is a conspiracy. The direction is practically nonexistent, and the supporting characters increase very little. Lysette Anthony is as good as the princess, but her voice appears for some reason, the fate with many small players. And the film goes to snail speed. Hans Christian Andersen should be turning the witnesses into his grave when this appeared. It can honestly say, at least this story of the film, it is not surprising that it went straight to the video entry.
