It has been a long time since I saw this bad film. Acting is very moderate, the story is very bad, and I have to lose in terms of implementation. It was quite odd. O, and this is a comedy like Clint Eastwood's Schwarzenegger pregnant! One of the first events (one who has a television show - where is the spirit?) he got the right - cast was 80 percent of us to deal with them - forgot executives. If they were hoping to revive the job, then I think it won't happen to this on their CV! The document was capable, but 80 percent of respondents or director (who is an actor and clearly must have an actor) removed it. Fred Durst was the only one who seemed to be better than any of the others. Sorry, but if you have ever considered this look - I strongly recommend you to turn to a little something terrible, because it is not just a waste of time, but also a weak example of a bad movie that looks like.
