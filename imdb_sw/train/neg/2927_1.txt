Somewhere, out there, there must be a list of all the homosexual films made all the time. Someone with shots of overlong cameras sat and watches largely on space, or someone where they consider long kats kitty eating spaghetti. This picture of the disease is a story of a boy and a boy and they live and love and swim and stuck in the grottos and one of them has a depressed mother and one has no mother and they talk and walk and swim and have sex and get drunk and then break with someone goes to hospital for eight days and then comes out and there's a lot of quick and repeat and there are long shots of one of them looking into space or just staying and doing something. I think it is some kind of filtering techniques or maybe it's a very bad film to fill it for a long time, shooting because otherwise if they have to rely on a plot or film story it will be 14 minutes. Do not make a mistake, this is about gay films. the 30 which I have looked at in the past 6 months and some of them (most of them) have been a very, very creative and interesting but this is one of the worst of the worst when the best was "Good." So, I looked at this and after the first opening shot that had been lost and thought "What, no, it will be the sin of sin mah" But I gave the opportunity and looked at it and then I had a DVD into the trash. Sorry I did not like you and if you did, please if I missed it.
