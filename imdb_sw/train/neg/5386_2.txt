while one of the "stars" of this film does not have to give me a knowledge of skills, I know a little bit of what was in the first ... and what ended on the screen. I remember seeing the original cut of the "freshman incoming" and being very pleased. was funny, sexy, raunchy, all the main requirements of the car-in film. you should remember this was hit and opened before all others ... the animal house, pork, etc ... so by his own way, this flick was true before his time. for any reason, the film was given to the main suppliers who edit half of the original film, and then edited (do I say "shuffled?") more than random maps. the fat man, the head of the goat ... what was it? I am sure it is installed on an extra T&A, but it was very slow, it caused anything that was going on before grinding to stop and hurt. but all for all, it's a fun reference to me ... especially for that I am able to say that the worst movie I've ever seen ... I am!
