I am so confused. I've been a big fan of Seagal for 25 years. I've seen all his movies, and many times. I can only describe this film as "amazing." Steven Seagal shares to write screenplay and generate credit on this film, but I have a very difficult time to believe he could answer on his own voice with his many line, and a thin, lighter sound of a fool is not down. What I did not find is, if they had to design some of its lines, why would his own voice appear over all others? I expect Seagal age as we are. But Seagal in this film is not found a small part of the same swagger, courage, courage, charm, and sexual appeal he showed us easily in all of his original movies. I felt no more than all of it was her cocky, independent view and her bad ass sneer that easily change in that adorable grin. Where is your view and face that made that great star? I hope that this film is not a sign of what Seagal has dreamed to give us - if so, its lifetime fans will force that Seagal we all knew and loved has gone.
