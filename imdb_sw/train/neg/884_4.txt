New York, I love you, or rather you should have a name of Manhattan, I love to Watch Your People Sometimes Love, is a good example of the difference between telling stories and telling the situation. A step-by-step investigation, see two groups on a film, one of which Ethan Hawke refuses to smoke to a woman on the road and keeps talking to her for a fussy conversation, and another with Orlando Bloom trying to install the film and the non-profit by her director reading Dostoyevsky two books. When this end is not a great story for any stretch, it is at least something that has a beginning, middle and end, if the composer tries to mark, gets Dostoyevky thrown into his seat, and finally gets help (and maybe something more) from a girl who speaks like The relationship between him and the director. Ethan Hawke's perspective, however, is like something, and it feels like it, like a windy or led by a film manufacturer who called it (or, for that, Hawke and a pre-Sunrise combo and Reality Bites). <Br /> <br /> What does it say about the film in general is to see a few stories that work very well to go against one or two possible stories 'stories' and then all situations that are made to connect or interact with each other (ie bits involving Bradley Cooper, Drea DeMatteo, Hayden Christensen, Andy Garcia, James Caan, Natalie Portman, etc.). It is not so much that the film - always puts in * Manhattan * and not New York's Queens or Staten Island or Bronx (however, say, Harlem or Washington Heights) - it doesn't have a good deal of variation, since it's some. It is a lack of ideas that man is found in spades, for better or worse, Paris J'taime. It is certainly not available to New York, except for passing the records, and for the worst (part of Julie Christie / Shia LaBeouf) is not clear at a surprising level. So, basically, try for TV, and try to talk to the outside of the film - inside, that is, for three scenarios: part of Bloom / Christina Ricci mentioned above; Brett Ratner inspired part (yes, X-Men 3 Brett Ratner) and a wonderful story of a boy taking a girl at the wheel for just to come on a big twist; and Eli Wallach and Cloris Leachman as a happy couple going to Brooklyn on the 67th anniversary of marriage. All else can lose, even at the beginning of Natalie Portman's instructions, and return to Hughes's brother (just one, Allan) on the screen. The mixed bag is to do it gently: it is like you should look through a bag of nuts mixed with crappy nuts to get a few left almonds.
