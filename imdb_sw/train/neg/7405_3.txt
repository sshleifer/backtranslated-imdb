I think they allow the quality of the DVD to be off with them. I rented this DVD from 2 film shops and the second time I finally got it on the DVD player I tried. Someone else has this problem? It is very difficult to give the film through a non-selfish review after experiencing the problem of playing. For one, I have never seen a film of Finnish fear before I had a kind of bummed that the movie took place in English. Also because it has never been clear that it is the same as Sarah, she came out as she lost and therefore I just hope someone will hit the face and make all the horrible events go away.
