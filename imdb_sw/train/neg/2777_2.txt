Unfortunately, this has been depicted on star movies in Thailand for last week or so. It is full of garbage. As another member said, this film is a good example of 'how to do.' I haven't seen the movie so badly acting for a long time. Actors (can you call 'actors'?) It's completely flat and give their lines to the dog's passion. I would like to say that in order to better understand how acting is bad, you should see the film ... but that would be the same as being tortured. It is like a woman who leads her lines, and all others who are used in their voice (fake or positive) are very similar. Another actor and the fake concept of Britain was good, yes, but a good master had his bad feelings. Mix that with her (missing) to act and have a tragedy. He should only say and I would accept as a beautiful girl. Oh my, we got to a place where a lover of a woman says he says "I really?" after the area of ​​compulsory cries from him. Laughable. No, indeed, I laughed loudly. Settings / Artists and artists provide grace to save on film. Some sets are color and some events are very good (few participants). <br /> <br /> The old woman of magic? What ?! Another member mentioned a modern love song that was on the film. Then it is not recommended for a piece of the past 500 years. I understand that the film was considered 'Big Budget' in Thailand during production. I would be very worried if I was a producer of this film. Just going to show that the money is not recommended to make a good film (or even mediocre). I would like to give the Creator of the King 1 out of 10, but the dress and sets keep the film from such a score. 2 out of 10.
