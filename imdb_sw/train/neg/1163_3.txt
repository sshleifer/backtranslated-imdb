It was split, but still reaching half of the study habits, a different genetic study of two university colleagues: a talented basketball player but not a position, and a pot of smoking, making rabe. We don't learn why these young people are friends. They can share a mixture on the world and their places in it, but they don't seem to have anything else. To make its first start of the news, Jack Nicholson - who also wrote the scriptplay by Jeremy Larner, based on the Larner book - does not introduce to the characters for any definition, nor does it create events to help us identify with anyone on the screen. There are some decent displays here (especially from the visitor William Tepper in the central role), but many images do not know (perhaps for purpose), sketchy or point. Bruce Dern is playing hard basketball coach, Karen Black is an old man, Tepper married woman is having a relationship with, and Michael Margotta is a friend of Tepper's walk (by stop, over-over-performance). Nicholson fails to set up any order and taste, preferring (I think) to allow behavior interaction to sound the sound of the film; His script is no help either, and for that reason it is unclear who we should plead with. In a short time, when the random works (fighting supermarket between Tepper and Black, Dern visiting Tepper in his dorm room, all the events set in court), however, the third act of photography is a huge mess. He hopes to combine a key b-ball game with sexual harassment, Nicholson does not show the style in his craft (nor has he received points for chutzpah, since his events of these events are squashy and bad). When the director leaves his way to humiliate his actors, one should question his motives for doing so. Perhaps as "park, He said" finally made a statement of power in the business, the audience could forgive the filmmaker for its reasons of judgment and taste. Unfortunately, close to the surprising situation is as confusing as the whole film. * 1/2 from ****
