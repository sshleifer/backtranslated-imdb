I am very confused. What in the world was this film about? What is the killer's impulse? He seemed to be angry, but I still do not know why. There is nothing in this film made. It had a zero depth. Or under the depth of zero. Which I think would make a hill. Or a bunch. The crap. Acting was terrible. When I looked for a few of the participants in this film, they had been in a very few things I heard, and that was not quite surprising. I can not decide whether to treat them with compassion for being in this bad movie, or feel that they should not be given another job. Starting. . . NOW! (Seinfeld memory.) True, however, do not waste your time with this. There is very little substance that there is nothing there even just pleasing. This of course was one of the worst flicks - NO, one of the worst of all kinds, which I have ever had to look at, and I have seen quite a few.
