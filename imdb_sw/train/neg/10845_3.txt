It had a program! ;) I have seen movies and a small plot (I don't want to mention Asian films but ...). I thought the camera was not so bad for the cheap movie like this, and also the situation was not so bad. There is no real reason for many things people do and how they respond to what is happening. Although I think that about many movies, in this case it was terrible, of course. It removes some SO movies for just links. Acting was bad but I saw more. The movie was bad but I found it worse. Watching this film is an experience between weight, laughing, death, death, sadness, horniness and leisure. So if you like gory movies and stupid squares this is the right film for you. You have paid 3/10, because it can be entertaining if you expect to see a good film and you're in good shape.
