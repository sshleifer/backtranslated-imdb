Her shame! There I was, well in a chair with a beer with a popcorn bag, bouyant for the hope of another night of Muppet's entertainment. What did I get? Errors! What? How can the Muppets come from Christmas Christmas to this? The humor was terrible, the songs became worse than the Country and the West (and that says something) and the conspiracy was like the confusion with the poor like Blind Pew. I think the main problem is that they have left too much in trying the Treasure Island. A short story, such as Carol's Christmas, is perfect because you can pull the top of the Muppet spoons around .... here you need to hit together and stop all fun. Where is Where? What about the Muppets Wizard of Oz?
