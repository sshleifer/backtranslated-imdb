Filmfour should do better than this small snot film if they get a good reputation for their own reputation. This movie has been installed Glasgow (although only a couple of secondary characters have something close to Scottish brilliant). Cluster, about people whose lives are not anywhere, all of whom meet in the same cafe at the early morning if they have night jobs, they could make a religious, sensible, mysterious film. Instead we have a group of self-saddos and a plot that has been done for the bits I have not helped. X and Y are friends. X is sleeping with Z. Y sleeps with Z too. Oh you count it. <br /> <br /> Time damage. Negative talks - it seemed like something that a group of 16-year-olds would write for the GCSE game project. The woman's behavior was of no use - just as a woman in the hope that women would be included in seeing it. <br /> <br /> If you are a thicko boy who laughs on beer advertising and may appear to be lost in a packet shout on Saturday night at nondescript city centers then you will love this movie and find it "laff correct ". Everyone else, run, do not move away from this small misfit. The same question, when the group left the sea "sea" in the sea (salt unfortunately though they changed the name on the film), returned to Glasgow, why they did through Forton Road Services in LANCASTER in England ?
