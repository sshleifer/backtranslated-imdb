A truly awesome movie. Such feelings have been done in the early 90s and a single person who wanted to show that homosexuals are good, normal, people who crave. Restore up to the point of being bad, LTR shows that HIV and marriage are the recommended method for salvation for sad, lonely, sexually active homosexuals. Wow! Who knew? Supported characters are gay gay performances (buffoon, pain pain, queen, etc.) and the main characters are milquetoast, middle, middlebrow clones, of little interest. Besides the romantic and ideological struggle of the first couple are concerned, there is nothing to say: we have seen it all before, and we have done better.
