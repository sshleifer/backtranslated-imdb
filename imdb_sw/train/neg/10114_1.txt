This is one of the worst films ever. I like fun movies but this is just bad. What? Where are the photos in the film on the box? I think more money was spent on the DVD boxes than the entire film. Why is the company able to release the DVD which the lid is misleading? I feel like idiot to rent this movie according to fully on the box. As far as I explore IMD I had to do a short survey and make a list before visiting my local video rental shop. I have no one to blame but myself. I want my money and my time back. Do not keep this MOVIE. Even if curiosity stimulates them, close a cocktail for your eyes. It will be more enjoyable. You have been warned!
