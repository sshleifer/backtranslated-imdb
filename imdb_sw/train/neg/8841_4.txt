Parasomnia has attractive buildings, but the story is not done without any tension or even logic. They were healed without judging, even Patrick Kilpatrick, who did a great job in the film as Scanner Cop 2, Open Fire, Under Siege 2 and Eraser. Some of the cast are unknown (and not very good) except Jeffrey Combs. (Herbert West from the great trio Re-Animator). But he can play such roles in his sleep (which is a little he does here). The main problem is that the actions of the characters do not really know. The story is lighter and predictable and the effects of cheap computers mixed with some gory events, especially the end. This can be better, I won't get a good comment on this. It's less than the average actually.
