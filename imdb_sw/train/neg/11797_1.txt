Watching this film was a huge waste of time and 2 residual rental in my life. If nothing has been affected before the death, this would be the most painful experience of my life. Who has ever thought about this film, or money should kick between the legs, because that's what they thought when they made this film. It's about a overweight guy who is romantic love, and writes a drivel of defense which tries to pass it as poetry. She shares her dear friend on a beach trip. Where to meet girls and such. This fat just do not have a girl. Skin skin does not despise me, I take 'em to face face. But this film tries to be more skin. It's about the Child of Fat looking for love for a certain girl, but then meets another girl of silicone bikini who enjoys her poems. He gets his talent for volleyball who earns money for his family and attracts women, only has his wife anyways. The talk is huge-horrible for even the film's C. It helps tons of black racism, no character development, is a movie of the glory of porno, without any porn in it. Never look at this film.
