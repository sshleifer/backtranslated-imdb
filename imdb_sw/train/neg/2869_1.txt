The story comes like this, Netflix had gone to take me to my dvd so I went down to the analogue rental area known as "Video Blockbuster". Still bad, they have 150 copies of recent films to lose your fun to watch yet I've never seen any of them. So I saw BTK Killer there on the shelf, all independently. I would like to see the film according to serial killers. It's just a part of humanity that I will never understand, so I want to see that kind of stuff. Anyways I will keep this DVD and suddenly from second to second, it comes. I sit there and b. and we are like, "what is this kind of crap?" Implementation of unstable cameras, bad acting, - the first place that a woman is killed is wondering if she would like to just quietly calm her, then the mouse is hit under her throat. I am really surprised if the director has a hard way with this trick. There is nothing good about this "film". All I will say the director is "you own a freakin trip"? "Every shot was very strong. The music was bad. It was like they decided only one day to make a film. They were collecting people from WalMart to show and" act "to them. It's very clear. If you do a movie like this then lead it to your hobby-NOT you should do for life - It can not do for DVD DVD's modern gaming shops like myself. Best left home for your friends when you have a party and run interesting things to entertain them .... Then you can break your BTK film KIller and say, "You want to see this crappy movie I once?"
