Calling him a piece of surgery completely in the history of the movie is not an easy task, the candidates have been very much, but Nemesis 2 has been my favorite since I saw it. It was amazing we had to hire again the next day, and again I laughed hard I was walking around the floor. (This happens only when I see "Scott's Antarctic" of Monty Python.) During any film period, the feeling-heck-feeling is very sensitive to the viewer. I am very disappointed that this wonderful video house has ever made it a production stage. It should be good, but there is still no relationship with the first film. The hero has the same name, but this time "Alex" is a woman, although it took half the way on the movie to stop counting, what is for all muscles and artist-nomad dress! it's not just a plot, it's just a long tracking event, it's just a slow and senseless one that calls it a tracking location makes the sound of the voice more interesting than it really is. There is almost no conversation, which includes focusing on its quality, and then suddenly the film comes to an abrupt end after an open point area with a lot of gasoline explosion, without completely describing what is all about. Luckily, it is never found, because there is something wrong and bad going on all the time! Horror movies are often very interesting, but Nemesis 2 is a perfect mix of more aggressive and unnecessary destruction that is actually entertaining. Use this film, or buy even, you can't despair!
