Starting this film, according to the player said it has won the "best movie" at the "Worldfest" Film Festival in Houston, Texas. Hmmm must be a year of stability. It does not call this bad film ever but it really takes it, it's just as good as awesome as the rest of Aussie B "Body Melt", but at least that film was not seen as hit on HI video 8. br /> <br /> I think they are the creators of the film, they watched many film Troma, and the B-grade movies very bad, thinking that they can also burst in the business released by this film. Do not do wrong, I love low-grade movies, Only the fact that some of the characters put American fake marks, almost like that doing so they have more chance to sell in states or something. In fact the despair has also ended, the exhibition can be a more exciting way, and some good events to fight. You can see that the creators of the film are trying to copy the "Bad Taste" in general, the car explosion, rocket distributor, and the endless number of shooting people, but eventually it does not exist on high humor, or fashion as "bad taste ". If you would like to watch bad films of the year, or you are interested in making a non-budget film, see, otherwise you should not go away.
