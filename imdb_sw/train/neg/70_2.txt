This movie has never made it on the movie in our area, so it was available on the DVD I was one of the first to pay taxes. At once, I had to listen to the critics and pass this. <br /> <br /> With the best line of film actors was awesome. I can see now why it went straight to the video. <br /> <br /> I thought to have Bloom, Ledger, and Rush could have some value. They have all done wonderful work in the past. <br /> <br /> The movie was slow moving and never pulled me in. I was unable to develop much sympathy for the characters and had to fight a quick-forward desire to reach the end. I do not recommend this film even if you are considering leasing for 'eye eye' only. It is not worth it.
