I don't know how anyone could be awake during this show. Acting was a ham-fisted with an amateur, the story was an old story, and a plot development (or lack thereof) consistently had my brilliant sagging less than half the way for each section. That's about all that it says about it, because it certainly didn't have any substance of any kind. How do people like you like this? It's very stupid, it's insulting to your mind. I don't know how to explain more ... It's just like some of you will look at the junk like this just because you like how some actors look, or because, because of any reason, T we see the same way in dozens of several million times before . <br /> <br /> I just .. forget. This show has been added, and with gratitude has gone forever. I wish they would work to break down O.C. once and for all.
