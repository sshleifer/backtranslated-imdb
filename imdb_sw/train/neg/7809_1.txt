Definitely first for Michael Madsen. Madsen plays Cecil Moe, a drunken family member whose life has been hit near him. Cecil takes a phone book, looks at the preacher's name, and calls him in the middle of the night. He goes home to the preacher and discusses his problems. The preacher teaches Cecil to respect God's word and be with Jesus in his heart. That makes everything better. Ahh ... if only everything in life was easy. The fact that this "film" seems to have been made by $ 500 of course it does not help. 1/10
