The modernization level of a little budget we've seen a hundred times before - a group of scientists separated from something unknown alien, and in all places (surprise, surprise) Antarctica! The film includes James Spader and casting anonymous (except Carl Lewis, who is not a bad person for an actor) - who offers ho-hum displays that make a little bit to enhance non-thinking of script discussions . To make things worse, the film is slow, there is almost no subplot, and a few of the steps are stereotypical and not exciting. It's amazing that this thing went straight to the DVD. What is surprising why Spader - the best actor at the time, who won the Cannes Best Actor Award for `Sex, False and Videotape ', and did a good job in sci-fi flick` Stargate' - chose to enter this project of destruction. Or maybe not, looking at his work, for he seems to have invested his talent in misses than hits. The most amazing thing about 'Alien Hunter' is how they could complete so many features from many sci-fi films, and there is still something written and prepared. There are large bits borrowed from the `Thing '(original Haward Hawks' original and John Carpenter better 1982 remake), 'Communication' and 'Outbreak'; A few 'Alien', CE3K ', `The Andromeda Strain' posts, 'Kubrick'` 2001' (ie 'black guest' box) and 'Mission To Mars' (ie secret messages); and even a little dash of 'Sneakers' and 'Wonderful Mind' (though not sci-fi movies, they share the 'cryptology' link). Hell, there are even grain fields with Antarctica, such as 'recent X Files'. And the spaceship of the visible light at the end seems exactly like something that was given from the "Spirit". It is all done before and done better, although I will accept there was a few gentle surprises to the end. I could say a little about the plot, but there is no need at all. You already know more than half of this movie without seeing it. (5 out of 10)
