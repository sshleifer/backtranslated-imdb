Isn't something else on television? Are you tired? Then, see Phat Beach. However, do not borrow it and do not get it. That will be a big mistake. I watched this on television and I found a cake on some points. I had no laugh for a long time and did not laugh hard. However, there was a trick of the trick and the comments I made. If you are looking for a funny "hood" film then look on Friday. If you are looking for an emotional emotion (something that this film is trying to ....) look at something like a dream of hoop or Jason's Lyric. If you are looking for a good "trophy" to go to view the thinking of Dominique Simone, because the illusion in this film is not over. However, if you have nothing good to do and this is on the cable, continue and watch. You will be a little troubled. <br /> <br /> *** 3 out of 10 ***
