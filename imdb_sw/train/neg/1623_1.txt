Establishing a series of television on the work of the famous author is not a guarantee of success. Yorkshire Television learned this in a difficult way while in 1979 they bought the rights of books that are known to Dick Francis, three of which were announced under the name of 'Racing Game'. Mike Gwilym was Sid Halley, an old jockey turned out a personal eye after an accident where he lost his right hand, except to have his own fixed position. Gwilym suffered a severe lack of charisma (and looked like one of the worst people) when Mick Ford (who played Chico Barnes irritated) made me get a horse donkey while screens. For six weeks, this less powerful duo has been charged on the country, and to eliminate inappropriate plots to fix society, usually in the same way - betrayal, capture fighters or doping horses. Yorkshire television lost money in the show, but it was not. Weakness, sexuality, lost and repeat, had been locked in the knackers.
