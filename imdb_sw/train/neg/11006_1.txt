These film stars, among others, "SlapChop" Vince Offer (who also wrote, edited and directed) by Joey Buttafuoco - are not names that say "quality". And for such skits that lift as "Supermodels take damage" (what exactly looks like), a guy who stimulates sperm bank ("Rhymer"), necrophilia and corpse of decay, black market black market (with a guy scooping what they need to be out of bottle ), lots and gay votes, skit about the great phallus which is superhero and forced abortion. Skits are very bad (such as "Batman and Rhymer"), it is not well considered to be amateurish and the film is bad because of the bad ... and ignorant. I believe that a group of children aged 8 can have a funnier film and a budget. It seems this film was caused by "Slap Shot" Vince against Scientologists. In fact, I would like to know who will end this case! Apparently, he emphasized that somehow Scientologists destroyed his reputation and tried this film. It does not matter that the film is enough junk from beginning to end with 99% unfunny (for comparison, Ebola is funnier) ... and these are the most beautiful things I can say about the movie. <br /> <br /> The way, that's Bobby Lee (from "Mad TV") wearing a diaper and participating in an artificial fake film. It's amazing his work can win this.
