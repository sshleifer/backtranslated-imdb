This should be some of the worst trends I have seen. Close-up can be a very powerful shot, but when every area has nothing except close-ups, it loses all its effects. Tony Scott has a very good working environment and, behind Mexico, cantinas, real estate where Anthony Quinn lives, and the dusty cities go through a revenge. Unfortunately we find only the quickest of these sites before the camera is reduced to a large, large-scale image. Even transition events where Farmer driving alone in Mexico quickly cut off. <br /> <br /> The score is more interesting and intrusive, forcing every feeling we should feel. The story itself should be dealt with better. Among other things, most people come out of a place to help Costner together - it's just a beautiful text. It is a lively exciting story, but many others have taken the same premise and do the best things with it. The Way of Merchants There Is No Way To Have such a story, but it was the best movie. The end was quite worried and it happened to many spiritual films. This movie has never been good, but if we saw more of Mexico and this little header film could be watched.
