Sorry but I didn't like this doc. I can think of a million ways that would be better. People who made it plainly do not have many ideas. Interviews are not very interesting and no real understanding is provided. Footage is not collected through a very learning, either. It's very bad because this is a movie that deserves special features of spellbinding. One thing I will say is that Isabella Rosselini gets the best she gets. All is considered, this only gets '4.'
