Snow White, which happened in Locarno, where I had the opportunity to see it, of course refers to the popular story of the world. And it also refers to the coke. In the end, the actual Alps of Swiss has its place too. So all three headings are described in this film. There are many dots in the area, and there is also a black-colored girl, black-headed, who has to go through all sorts of trouble to help her. It is not a story story. It should be a real game living in Zurich, Switzerland (according to Tagline). <br /> <br /> Basically the movie is close to perfect. Unfortunately a weak plot, anonymous dialogue, abnormal abnormalities and acting mixes add up to forming legitimacy. So if the observer remained without meditation. <br /> <br /> Then there was a clich√©s, which leased madness directly: Snow White is rich and destroyed class of daughter - of course her parents have left and she didn't have enough love from them, because they were too busy all the time. Her best girl, on the other hand, has loving and caring parents. They (a metal worker and a wife of the house) live in a small, poor and happy flat - and do not know the worst situation their daughter is located. A good person (= big) is a musician (!) From the French speaking section (which is considered to be an economic economic breakthrough but the country's emotional). He has problems with his parents. They are immigrants from Spain, who do not seem to accept his way of life - until the father becomes very ill and admits his request for his child from the hospital bed. <br /> <br /> And so it goes on: Usually, the drug dealer is brutal, the bankers do not have a heart, the club owner is a player and photographer, although the woman (!), has only his work in mind while showing Snow White in romantic art pictures on the show This review does not require a spoiler to enable you to add these pieces to an open plan. I like other films by Samir, k.m. "Umuh Baghdad", I was desperate. Let's hope straight.
