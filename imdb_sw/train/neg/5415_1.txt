Dil was a memorable movie that brings celluloid a good director like Indra Kumar. The movie followed by Beta, Ishq, Raja & Masti were all the best. <br /> <br /> But every successful director offers a few bad movies with hits too. Pyare Mohan is the same movie. Even though comedies are told well but then fail the viewer laugh. Compared to the comedy films made today is dumb. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch the film and laugh, please don't see this. Because the exciting comedy will only make you cry. <br /> <br /> In short, the movie is missing out.
