Or maybe she feels that way. However, "People's Bat" is almost as flat as a rug, bland as a sack of flour and exciting as a rock ... and as intelligent as both are connected. Well, the plot in the brief (appropriate tool, that ...): the doctor (moss) is battered by bat while looking out the cave with his wife (McAndrew) and finally returns to bat - well, not bat but especially bat- like a creature that looks more like awolf who murders its victims in the view of a man's camera .... <br /> <br /> But there is a sheriff business (Pataki), who is about the sort of WORST of Sheriff: A variety of stacks. He accuses people, returns to married women, steals baskets from haberdasheries (EXERCISE!), Is burned by one of the cigarette owners in his mouth and talking at the same time, making him look and hear like Buford T. Right in "Smokey and Bandit" (this is the worst part) ... He is a DIFFERENT DEATH IN EVERY FILM! <br /> However, the entire movie is a TV-of-the-week-like effort (guano, in this case). It's AIP, to cry out loud! What do you expect, Oscar caliber items? And what else can you say about a film that even MST3K can save? <br /> <br /> Is about ... no star for "People's Bat", the full version Or MST3K version! The way, if there is ever this film, I give my TV.
