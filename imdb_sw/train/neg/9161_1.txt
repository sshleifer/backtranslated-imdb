... well, dial this on DVD, lose hours and half of your life that you'll never come back, and you will know. <br /> <br /> Working? What makes it? <br /> <br /> Crop production? Production? ... Ethics? <br /> <br /> Stories? Don't make me start. After many years of publishing on IMD, I didn't think I would like to see a very bad movie that I wished at a lower than one. I've always got at least a reason or two to see eligibility - if it is for the intent or effort of the author, director, cast or producer? In this case, we are an adult (!) who needs to get to deal with the truth, at least as shown by this useless waste video clip, that they don't have talent. I mean it would be a good reason if this was the "production" of the first secondary school for its first class of movies, but the "artist" mentioned after this fall was twenty-six during this miscarriage. <br /> <br /> How has this been done? Who in their right mind wrote a check for this? Additionally, do not allow the box cover to deceive you: there is nothing that looks similar to a good sex area or “good” tips on hunk on the lid. The last two things: there was one seconds when this "film" had the value of redemption: the "talent" mentioned earlier is being rounded by her lover. I was so happy! And, I learned one thing from this "film". There are times when something is so bad that it is true, it's very realistic. But not in any kind of delight; it's just a sad funny. For a very humorous sadness.
