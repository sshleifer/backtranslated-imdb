When it comes to horrible movies, I am more interested in stopping unbelief, ignoring the low productivity values, leaving the holes of conspiracy with horrible intent. These movies do not have a good offer. It can't even enjoy like camping. Bad talk, evil acting, bad trends, murder was predictable and no, music was angry, the work of the camera was bad, even the clothes were bad. I felt very bad for the participants, who were trying to expose, but who had to deal with the horrible conversation, caused by a clear understanding. I'm sure they get any training, either. It's a shameful look, and so boring than to do in the last "amazing" end it requires great patience. It is quite simply one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I don't usually write reviews, but this was so bad that I felt forced to warn others. This movie is a perfect waste of time. If you should watch this film, do not miss "Make" -featurette. The author / director appears to be under the impression that making a woman a murderer was a kind of bold, confident move. (See.) He and those who spend half an hour build this film as the age of "Citizen Kane." It's like listening to a group of third followers to take you back to the events of their Christmas page. They think they have created something of substance. It's sad, really? The only reason I gave this film is "2" is because I think "1" should be stored for the real evil, like "Manos: Hands of Fate" and "Mutiny Space." So "America's night" is not a movie of the WORST that I have ever seen, but I would like to say it is a part less than fifty.
