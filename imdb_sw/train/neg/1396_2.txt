This film about the secret attempts of the secret government and the abuse of civilians for hidden and shadow figures were able to become a very interesting film. But for me, it failed. I will not clarify over the confused line of conspiracy, but if you are looking for a comprehensive definition, the user's "worries" describe it well. But it didn't make a job description for me. I saw it slowly, which would have been the same but for the fact that it seemed to go anywhere. The observer is left in the dark about so many things to be able to get a deal on this film - in some films, one can say that the filmmakers wanted to stimulate the ideas and left things that were not caused. I don't think this is the case here. As for the long-term experiments of two buildings that have been described many times by other users ... I see that they are sure they give when the audience get other alcohol without missing any "action". And I condemn many viewers will welcome the opportunity to have several drinks on the board to find this way.
