Definition of disgust as described by Dictioary's Webster is "the reason for hatred or hatred." If a person can think of a more appropriate word or definition than in the dark, I would like to let me know because this is the best one I can bring. However, I don't feel that this word describes how this film was so bad. I went to see this film with my two members. One has the same tastes like me, the other is the action / adventure flick guru. This last person doesn't care about the size of the holes, as long as the movie has a lot of explosion that will go far. It is said we went into a reminder to look for Friday alone in the dark. Little by my surprise we were the only people in the theater. When you started I knew why immediately. It starts with a bad opening of any movie, and unfortunately I must admit that it gets worse from there. The opening part is made of 5 minutes which is reported. However, I understand why it's written. The director must have understood that only people who are illiterate could even recognize the ideas of seeing this movie. However, it is not just the first event of the longest rock texts in the history of the cinema, but it is also unwise. It seems as if the sequence we hear about the disappearance of the film. One is about the old civilization and the spread of ports, the other is about the scientist and his experiments of orphans. If you read this and you are confused, you're not alone. <br /> <br /> Then the horror story, acting, effects, and camera begins. Tara Reid is as bad as an actor. He does nothing even for the second time to make you think he is a museum contractor. Slater is bad, not convincing, and does not have chemistry and Reid. <br /> <br /> The plan is probably the worst thing that man has created. When I am with your colleague and the same tastes are asking questions like: What is this? And what's going on? More than this rubbing rubbish we have a few we described a sequence with Slater himself. Is it good? NO. Are they citing anything? NO. What? We at any time if viewers have a few minority why we should take care of what happens? Once again, NO. <br /> <br /> Then we have a normal sex area. We are told that Slater and Reid are together, but at any time they act as if they care about even another. But then BAM ... sex area. Once again I do not know. Well, oh, I don't know, 30 seconds after the horrible event ends with we have 20 weapons or military with the same number of alien things. This is installed on a metal-heavy song and causes more brain brain than anyone who has thought possible. And if that didn't exist ... <br /> <br /> There was no great madness. There is a scientist and there are things "alien". At one time the scientist controls the visitor's affairs and stands on the hill commanding them to attack outside the military. Why? How was the greatest of these things? Why do they listen to him? Once again I do not know. <br /> <br /> Movie approaching and Slater and Reid walking in a saved city. Why was the city relocated? Was the visitor's thing broken? Tell the army? Who knows ... and for this point he cares? I wasn't with you. But at the top, Slater and Reid are attacked by the alien thing. Although it is stated that the alien objects will be killed by the sun. And that indeed, you have changed it, is in the middle of * &% $ a day and it's as bright as possible. Maybe the stranger's thing is bought a pair of sun glasses, I don't know and I don't care. Now after the movie was completed I ran out of the theater, every 6 inches of 6 foot, moving my hands and shaking my afro to tell everyone not to go and see this film. Even my gung-ho / aventure shareholder (who could take a look at the film and hit a 2-hour blast on 1 film that was the biggest thing was created) admitted that the holes of the conspiracy were very visible in this film. <br /> <br /> Connecting this CRAP-FEST will give you 0.0 / 10 and I will give you down if I could. transparently, the worst film is made. I don't want this film to my worst enemy.
