This film is a traditional traditional bollywood away from the power of the stars, feeling and love of the triangle of emotions. What was so bothering me about this film was the idea of ​​a strange woman's mother. A woman who gives birth to a child and a person after having sex with a child (not a child of a child) is not a mother of a child. Neither is the best candidate for the emerging mother. I have seen Indian movies and television programs that have made 10 to 15 years ago that raised this issue with more insight. The whole concept of the movie is ridiculous and not quite possible. I know that many bollywood films are not intended to be plausible, but they do not make them either. This film wants us to isolate ourselves with the characters, but this can not be done by the ignorant, caused. I would like to expect the best from Abbas and Mustan.
