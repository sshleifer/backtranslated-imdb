The most common Italo-Western way, a stupid storyline full of clich√©s and lack of logic, other uncomfortable actors, dirt arrangements, lots of fighting and people are shooting dead on a large scale. <br /> <br /> This does nothing to do with Django. - At least not in my version of the German translation, this German-release DVD is called "Adios Companeros" and has a Callaghan Macho fight with Butch Cassidy and Ironhead because their group killed one (he is the survivor). Then you have a Cassidy Butch and Ironhead to fight because they fought with a split group. And you have to fight with Ironhead against everyone because he is only limited to the youngest ass. Yes, it is, no more maneuver in the story, hehe. The role of Klaus Kinski as Pastor's Cotton is amazing (that's why I bought this DVD). In one place he tries to separate the two men to fight and blow and shout "I said love!" and in another area he succeeds in winning the horse and goes to nuts for the second - FANTASTICFANTASTICFANTASTIC !!! It is also interesting that JOE of AMATO aka Aristide Massaccesi made movies - I love the master of improper exploitation, so it was "aahhh" to me.
