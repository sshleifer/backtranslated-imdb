I've never thought I see a movie worse than "Lisa Picard is famous", but this came very close. As constantly from time to time in all comments, predicted; Five minutes on the movie you know will be locked for the results of the change. This film describes pain / avoiding everything from "Something about Mary" to "Panther Pink Revenge". Author Greg Glienna (Meet with Parents) needs new material. It is only a male / police partner who is followed by internal issues, but even the opportunity has been lost. Most of the Seattle Space fabric publications need to hide the Canada's clear shooting area. Some of the worst parking on car screens and almost no effort to hide the fact that the car is being carried through the city on the trailer. Geez, at least turn the wheel or put the brakes once in a while. Selma Blair is inert and short haircut is a crime. $ 3M for Jason Lee, why? I think it hits a skateboarding! So here is who should see this film: Fans of Bee Gees who want to hear two actors singing "Islands in the Market" badly; People who can't get enough for Julia Stiles. 1/10
