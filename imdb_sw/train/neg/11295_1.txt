I understand that this film has been made for children and as a parent I sit in many movies that do not care about my interests, but I can understand from the perspective that builds on receiving my children. Parents should be encouraged after all participating in the activities of their children and monitoring the quality of the entertainment they feel so there must be something that attracts the adult audience to a certain level even in children's movies. Disney has understood why this is why it is difficult to understand how it can allow a full piece of drek bear its name. <br /> <br /> In fact, voice editing is bad and all the sounds of over-dubbed and odd conversations. Personally I hate it, but it was twice the worst in the discussion itself seemed as though it was written 12 years old for the school project. "Acting" reminded the play of school and no child actors have any feeling in their voices. Thanks was a very short movie. Now, before you come as a video-geek to test the children's movie with an adult stick, one thing that can save even the worst movie children is a good message. Far from me to decide how the message should be given as long as it is correct. Let's take it through this film to see the message given: <br /> <br /> If you are lost, don't worry, you will find your way home. wild animals without fear. <br /> <br /> You can win any competition just because you "know" you can. <br /> <br /> and my favorite, the last message left in the film: It is okay to ignore the statistical data and do what you think is right.
