Tonight entertainment has been decreasing the hill for the last few years, but as a last night (August 17, 2006) they reached the bottom. In an attempt to spread their advertisements, they decided to publish JonBenet Ramsey's original picture on their teasers last night. The two pictures were both colorful and expensive. One was on his face and head / neck and you could see a clear string that was used to beat his neck, and fell on his face. This was so bad, I couldn't believe it. How does this relate to everything related to Entertainment Entertainment of Hollywood? Nothing! They have dropped the level of respect and values ​​for less than below .... and shows. This was the first show of looking ... and it's just a garbage now. <br /> <br /> I'll watch the Hollywood Access from now on.
