Not only the quality I expected from Morris (the eye of the copper eye and the blue leaf). This is as if it is not a bad film of students. What covers me, in all of this is what to do with the BAFTA? Morris shares 'mediocrity' (Ayn Rand) in most of his work (Nathan Barley) and even with this piece is running under the backs of talented people and tells us his rain! I only hope that he chose a subject that I would like to fight (humanity - terrorism) that will not go to the crocodile, and lose the opportunity to report on the far-off ignorance and views on these emotional and powerful events.
