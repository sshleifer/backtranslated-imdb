JESSICA: A BUDGET FACTORY is as a name means a spirit story. The theme means to be afraid but it comes next to the comedy! The woman comes who has been brutally returned from the dead. This makes what this film tries to adopt as a plot. Certainly nothing more. The movie includes a series of linked links involving a boy who was connected with this woman before his death. <br /> <br /> Immediately from the opening events, this film looks "straight-to-DVD" bid. Unlike gems such as VACANCY 2, the film does not mean the direction or creativity and certainly offers a "direct-DVD" movie bad name! The trend is as poor as it may have a complete lack of doubts, fears or tension. Even the drama elements can be dealt with to represent something worse than even the worst soap opera might have a chronic misfortune. Working on the board is very bad and no actor has been involved in collaborating and showing even the least possible work to work. <br /> <br /> Everybody's experience is too long, too long between the exchange. No! The only reason I give this movie a 2th place instead of 1 is because some bad acting with the worst talks made by a few unnecessary spells. I emphasize the word "few" in the sentence. This is not one of the "bad-beautiful" movies like good as BLOOD or NAIL GUN MASSACRE. If you want to laugh hysterically, check out those movies. If you want to see a horrible movie about ghosts watch LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE, CHANGELING, RINGU, EYE (original Korean version), GROUGE, GOD MISSED LOGO or PHONE. <br /> <br /> I advise anyone who has been fortunate to get rid of the ARIS: MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS continue with good work! Just forget this film available. Don't give thought to him!
