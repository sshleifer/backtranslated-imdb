First of all, this film reminded the old movies that I was supposed to look at in the class at school. That's not good. Basically, it's just a preaching and engaging of dirt, such as the left "left" series. I don't miss religious movies ... but I miss when these religious movies just happen to be so bad. I would just say good things about the Christian movie but it doesn't seem like that will happen anytime soon. If I hit you if you have given the Bible to reduce the good budget, they still can't come with anything good. Just avoid this. Also, the fact that the "American Family Association" (basically, Pastoral Shepherd Pastor) is beaten on this film on their website is another reason to love me. In fact, after watching this, I went home and saw my NC-17 copy of David Cronenberg tested "Crash". Forgive my father because I have missed. Hahahahaha!
