I don't want to go off here, but ... this is the "worst" film I saw. Worse than Avengers. Poor promotional, typing, and bad acting are the only positive elements. Photography on a very cheap video, looks like a high school project, but without feeling. Lighting often looks like Sun-Gun one. Sounds are better than one couple on the camera, but everything else about this thing is just bad. The program is moving abnormally with no foundation or future decision, the techie is very strange, and editing appears to be worse than cutting off. It's not bad even enough to be funny. It's just bad. BTW, installation is misleading for purposes. The Lion Gate gives me $ 4.00.
