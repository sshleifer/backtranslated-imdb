I hated this film. It was a horrible, poor, poor, DIFFERENT TIME, true true criminals who were not BITI in a funny (unlike the first home movie that was very good). All the boobie traps are weak, the pathetic claims of the wrong ideas of the first two which simply mean that people writing this film were lazy because their payments were not over 20 weeks a week. This film is very good, not even renting. In fact you look even at t.v.! Go to your eyes in the most important way to see the first two! I BARELY offer this 1 star (out of 10). Just believe me when I say, if you liked the first two, and not a perfect fool, you don't like this film, don't see this film !!!
