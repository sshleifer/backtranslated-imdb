The only reason I watched this film was because I had recently read Robert Hough's perfect, but interesting, fiction story of the life of the Big Cat Mabel Stark. Beaty looks like a character in the book, with an unpleasant light. I was not aware until I watched the film later on the IMDb that was previously serial. Anyone who changed the first time of the 233-minute run to the 68-minute version on the DVD has done a good job. The condensed version only likes to b any movie of that period in spite of many 'duh-what?' time. For example we really hope to believe our hero sang that the trap of tiger's foot twenty without the morning without even getting his dirty jodhpurs? Looking up the names of the chapter I see the number five is called "The Gorilla War" and the eleventh number is called "Gorilla". There was no gorilla at all in the movie. I think that's where some of the discounts were made. <br /> <br /> Interesting History.
