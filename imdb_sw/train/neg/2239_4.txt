The plan has already been described by other critics, so I will only add that my reason for wanting to see this film was to see Gabrielle Drake in his undefined glory. Miss Drake will be one of the sexiest models, very good of "posh totty" which is installed for cell cells. Between his age and the ilk, the most beautiful Jane Asher came near. What about music actors and music brothers? (Nick Drake and Peter Asher) For those who like me enjoy Gabrielle, its events in this movie will not give up. He has a good figure and none of the left to mind here. Overall, the movie is very bad and time-consuming, very cheap. The song that covers the opening credit appears to continue forever and worries.
