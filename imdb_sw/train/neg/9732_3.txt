First, shot, Brad Dourif is KOOK. If you are trying to take this film seriously, then I'm sure he will destroy you. If you don't take him too much, then he is a kind of fun to watch. Like another inspector, I loved the area that Lisa (Cynthia Bain) and Dourif are declaring their love for each other - between hitting the hot jets of fire out of her hand in the car. Another great thing about the camp was to look at John Landis as a radio radio producer with a stimulating and sleeping room. In fact, I've got the last 15 minutes of the movie being a stop-riot - I don't know if Tobe Hooper translated it so.
