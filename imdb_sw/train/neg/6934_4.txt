Okay, so ppl was clear that this was a good movie in 1955. .. fraud. The characters are fantastic pictures - but this film is not meant to strengthen, it really means that a great surprise is not? <br /> <br /> Dean and others, are very old for their parts. People say Dean is good in this film, and also, maybe made part of it and can also be. His character means being 16 or 17 or so. But Dean was 24 years old when he made this film. Seeing him bothering and giving us a little violence like a 4-year-old boy ... it's fun. Natalie Wood is good, but the early events at the police station where they cry and stretch do not accept much. It sets a bad example of the film ... and in others, you feel a challenge every time one of these emotional events happens. It can be good for him when, but, in fact, his shadow. We must have a sense of Dean's death which has caused more of the film's reputation.
