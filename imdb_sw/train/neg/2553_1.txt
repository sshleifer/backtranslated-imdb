Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. What else can I say. Kate Jackson must have a desire to lead. Maybe he should return to work ... for the second thought he was a bad actor. Who would put money in producing something wrong. I love movies to fight with Christ and have a good laughing and horrible but this is just a bad one. Acting and star was worse than what you find on the soap opera. Special effects, if you can call a few, where you lose. I can't be surprised if you play in slow motion you will see the roots that the blood comes from. We had to change the disc after just 30 minutes. This so-called original original film should be destroyed, all disks' and tapes have been destroyed and all people involved with the film's efficiency should pay money to people who married a movie. Then those people should not be allowed to act, direct or film any thing but their movies at home.
