Instead of the long drums and close ups of the characters that caused the film - the film would be better to be used to describe the story and the motivation of the characters. Nubo, the minister, daughter, mother - and sleeping under a strong and significant collision between hatsumo and mayhem and hatsumo and the planet made the film with deep depth. If you did not read the book you would understand why Sayings loved the Chairman and why Mameha was once his counselor. <br /> <br /> Watching the film was amazing - and all actors performed well with C level script were given, but that was all good about this movie.
