Starting with a poster (involving just Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey), the whole movie was a fraud. One example after another, this film had nothing - or nothing new, at least. After 10-15 minutes, you realize that you have just paid to see Justin Timberlake and LL Cool J explaining their way through other ideas. Basically, the story is about the demolition system for some of the city, all supported by the secret business and spine business, under the eyes of the eyes of a shot of politician. A powerful and over-law organization is called FRAT and I think what? they have a donkey donkey ass looney and beat for non-worried, girlfriends, you call it. FRAT traders are corrupt and greedy, so they end up making mistakes that are discovered by a small and talented journalist (!!!). One hour later, after a series of abnormal and worst shooting events, everything is coming closer with joy and we get the last layer: you can't hit the system. Bah! Don't see this film loss. Freeman and Spacey have no 10 minutes!
