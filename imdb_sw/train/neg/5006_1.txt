There is no film about a group of friends who are not just loving and reaching a point of neglect, but they do not have the characteristics of redeeming by making listeners * like or understanding and any characters either. There are very bad movies are good (film Ed Wood or Tod Slaughter), and there is just plain bad (like 99% of "work" of Uwe Boll). This film cannot be tolerated even if you are a skilled MSTie player (k.m., Mystery Science Theater 3000). Thanks when I have talents in this regard (how my mind is doing all the time), for those who are not very talented in MSTie saying, eventually in this * film * you just want to pull your own head, sadly to know the movie "Taboo" inspires you about an hour and twenty minutes you'll never come back. Even my MSTie talents were not the same as this short, exciting game. The most amazing feature of this film is that the * person * who weighs the green and / or sponsored ... I lost "Taboo" to Amber Benson who has a talented talent, who must definitely have been included in this film. I have a small film of her in my rental queue, comments that I would like to read first. Typically the ideal shape of the film was its interesting house of labyrinthine to the local area area.
