This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. This makes your TV film running look like a dog dog. According to the book by Britney Spears and his mother only this is a garbage without a good performance bar from Virginia Madsen (I hope you have been paid well) to save it. The story of the red gill gill gill who achieved the scholarship in the prestigious music school is a little but a drive to pedal Ms Spears Pants music for consumers and generally accept that the face below should be the way. There is nothing good going on here and all the beats as possible as night after day. Never again.
