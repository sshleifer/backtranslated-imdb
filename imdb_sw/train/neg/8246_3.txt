Daddy Florence Lawrence and Dorothy West are receiving severe news at the post office, they don't know they are being hit by Charles Inslee's gun. Meanwhile, David Miles's father receives a message (from little Robert Harron) that requires a father to go home; so, when young women come back, can they be? home alone. As those living in difficult conditions sleep in the evening, "The Black Ball and the Tans" of the inside begins; and, a dark-colored drinker shows more risk for D.W. Griffith's duo power ?? <br /> <br /> Mr. Inslee has one of its best roles of biography, stealing the film from "Girls and Father". Surprisingly, Griffith Director looks like one of the black faces in the "Black and Tans" faces. "Girls of Biography" Lawrence and West are delighted later "Griffith Girls" Lillian and Dorothy Gish, especially in the "Orfans of the Storm" (1921); and, they love the bed! The voice of racism is unfortunate, since the burglar story was set aside to save its victims from the high risk, it is happy. <br /> <br /> *** Girls and Father (2/1/09) D.W. Griffith ~ Florence Lawrence, Dorothy West, Charles Inslee
