This movie was the worst movie I saw since the "Modern Date." I laughed out the whole movie instead of being afraid. It was how the snake could find a part of the passenger body attacking, for example, eye, tongue, butt, chest. If we have seen a national geographical center we know snakes cannot remain at the clinic when bite. For each area the snake could bite the passengers and would sit on the body to humiliate the person. I believe the producer does not learn about him and his behavior. I do not believe that I have lost my money on this movie.
