There are three movies with this animation style which I fondly remember since my youth. This movie, "The Unicorn of the Last," "The Birds of Dragons" and "Hobbit." I have a copy of both "Dragons" and "Hobbit" (both better) and I didn't see "Unicorn Update" for more than ten years. That was up to date and now I would not have. What made me so confused was the script. It was very strange and often eighty. Things will happen without reason and other things can happen without an explanation. We're not just talking about little things here either either; we are talking about the key points of the plot! The story itself is not important to start, but it would work if the script has been decent. Not near. On that music was bad! I know that music in movies like these have what can be called common pieces, but the music in this film has made me to hit without a bowling ball. This was one of the films that I was going to show my children some day, but it has been cut off. I don't think I could stay that way again. Stress is to put it gently.
