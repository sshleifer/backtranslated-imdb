This is the worst document from Canada ever! I am happy to see people haven't made another film. All they want to do is get a film made and it is not appropriate to be the ones they have written. They continue to change the script to follow the person who calls. I couldn't get out of the hall quickly when I saw the Toronto Film Festival that year. Please never see this film.
