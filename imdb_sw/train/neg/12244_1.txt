This film is bad. CGI is the cheapest CGI of gray. Crocodile looks like a gray gray gray. The worst thing is that no effort is made to make it or appear to be alive. That's a CGI photographed which is installed on events and almost you expect to see a hand that causes cGI smudge around the screen. This is one of the worst examples of CGI's effects I have ever witnessed, and I have seen many Sci-Fi Channel movies very much. Besides the terrible lack of special effects, the cast consists of low-cost practitioners who may work as Ministries / Ministers for dinner while waiting for His break. Perhaps the most ridiculous place in this movie is when one of the bad people try to attack Kate and the big crocodile emerges out of the water to the second floor of the villains headquarters and through the balcony and evict the evil man Kate and instead of falling directly through The building (and crushing Kate) Croc begins to return to the same angle in the water. No physics laws can apply to this film or special effects. At least there is respect between crocodiles.
