One can think of a film about a young person who agrees with his homosexual homosexuality. Think again. This production should be bottled and sold as sleep therapy because it is ten times as strong as any sleep aid on the market. It is almost like the creator of the film * is considered * to make a film, but was lazy and instead decided to run random images (and by optional pages) and events to go anywhere, thrown on a real-time screens in real-time, pretending that the good light The needle is needed in the film making process, and close the film's "arthouse" attractions. This is a kind of crappy product that makes it easy for a lot of traditional films for poo-poo film indie, and which enables the public to easily create indie movies easily. If you are interested in films that are relevant to this issue, you would like to be very good at some of the short films found on the Colors or Renting website Get Real. Better yet, read the stone of Butch Blues. Whatever you do, skip this long dreck piece.
