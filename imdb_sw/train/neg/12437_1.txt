'Home alone 3' is the first home cinema only not showing Culkin in the main role and the same criminals. However, the plot is similar to the original 'Home Peke' film. Instead of two interesting criminals, we get three or four of them. This film includes some traps, but also has a long-term area with a remote control vehicle. The slapstick humor is also consistent, but the little boy and criminals really can't make an impact on this film. (No punctuation.) This film does not offer anything new or different from previous films, and no warm feelings, attractions that other two films have. It's more than a comedy, but it did not make me laugh like the characters really did not do it for me. I will not recommend this film; is very good. If you are looking for a good family vacation video and comedy, then watch the original 'Home Peke' movie.
