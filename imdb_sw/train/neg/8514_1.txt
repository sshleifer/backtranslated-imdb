I give this ONE film, in fact it's a bad movie. The voice of the DVD is bad, it really hurts my ear. But the vision, no matter how it has come out, shows something in the Italian society. I can't understand in detail what really was amazing, but different events are quite unusual. So for a kink value, I give one. Otherwise, video, photography, acting actors / actress is just substandard, joining people who love foreign movies. however, the children in the movie are over 3/4 years, and they are realistic and the movie provides a view of Italian life.
