Considering that I felt like picking up a new Jet Li film to see some blowing and non-brain hand, I took this head. Unfortunately, this film has more gun battles (Ala Chow Yun Fat but no place near good), than anti-Jet Li and an acrobatic fighting. So it was reduced. The clash of the pipe was interesting and even amazing, considering this was something unexpected in the Jet Li film for me, more on the line of Jackie Chan. <Br /> <br /> But listen I would like to recommend the Fist of Legend, Tai Chi Teacher, or even Assistant to delete this. <br /> <br /> Measurement of 4 martial art rating 3 for the overall score of the movie
