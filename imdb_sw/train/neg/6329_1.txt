I saw this weakness of the movie in the dollar hall and a friend in 1979 (back when a real ticket was sold for $ 1). This is the only film I have ever gone out (with my friend, while idiocy which is "Illustration Laser Bra 2000" was on the screen. Obviously, my response to my friend on the film was normal. It's not that I got an offensive film (like 18 years old or now), but instead of being stupid and irresponsible, without even an unexpected humor that makes Ed Wood's film appear. This is the reason why NBC refused to close, instead of failing to understand the "vision" of Mr. Mike (except, of course, his vision was to run film assistants in bankruptcy). I was still surprised today that this film does not seem to have published "10 bad films at all times". Certainly makes me. You have been warned.
