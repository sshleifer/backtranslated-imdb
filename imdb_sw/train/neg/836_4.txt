A dedicated fan on TLK movies, and one of the first to be a bigger and second one probably probably the best Disney player has, alongside this movie, now ... of Timon / Pumbaa's hair in TLK mode. Although not bad, it does not add anything. Basically this movie is a great joke ... and that's about all that saves. Make a real TLK3, Disney! There may be potential. <br /> <br /> 4/10
