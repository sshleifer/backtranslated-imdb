See this piece of work on fest film in CA. What was my God, the director? The pastors of the film should use this film as a case study on what they should not do while making a short film. First, this project makes absolutely no meaning. The film takes place in a "Way", some of the rainbow in the middle of anywhere, where nothing happens. It is the worst job. It's not so bad that I almost thought it was comedy. The leading actor Julia Reading is a step down to act in many amateur porn movies. There are good or two exhibitions, including boys who played Jacob and Fenner but it was like the director was not aware of how to work or use his artists. Nothing worse than acting was a conversation, which bordered with ignorance. The author (who I think is also the director) writes each character as they are examined by the authors of the comic book. <br /> <br /> The total value of production is good, but being honest, and this bad film is easy to ignore. The production structure is good, although the route looks like any ordinary bar. Dress and decision making are the same, and I understand the productivity worked with a small budget. Only when the characters say, or are trying to push the plot forward, the film begins to get into the trophy. <br /> <br /> As I said, this film is very bad. It's like the director / writer watched many sci-fi films and threw all the places he liked to be blender and came up with this. My only hope is that he spent the money of others on this, because if he spent himself, he is a general player.
