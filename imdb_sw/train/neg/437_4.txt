(Spoilers) I wanted to see this film, after hearing that it was wise and cunning. I had to give up half of the weight that I had heard. The concept behind the film would be acceptable: indicating the way the relationship between man and woman is changing, through all the problems and problems that two people living in a big city can experience. What made me like the whole film was two things. First of all, the film was a down-to-earth that looked like, by describing the problems that couples should solve on a day-to-day basis, it became itself and common. Second, total sleep, production and discussion that was not understood. Don't worry.
