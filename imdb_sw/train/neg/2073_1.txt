My God. oh my god, I can't find this movie. It was a bad-god. horrible, awesome! Don't waste your money to buy it at 99. No, avoid all the costs I warn you! It was a very bad movie I saw. In my life. In my life! <br /> <br /> First of all, G-girl? You call me. Get realistic that looks like a certain type of new doll of Barbie .. Super Women? You call me. It was so fake fake fake. The people of the city did not seem to be concerned that there was a blonde that just crossed the way around the city saving fire .. Ohh great! Jesus, is it just me or did it? The movie seems to be bad? I think what you need to be a great hero is a couple of D's two, spinning hair, not glasses and leather skin skins? If it was trying to be romantic ... than .. god, I don't know. It was awesome, if the love means taking one to the show of art and rather than having sex in bed. It was sad, everything went very fast. First that the boy was a husband, than he had a G-girl girl. Than they broke than he said that the girl Hannah .. and .. just continues. I say this film has made me wonder. How did hell get this in movies? <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie at all costs.
