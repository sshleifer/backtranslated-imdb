I looked at the anime but I'm not a fan of the dead die. and not read manga. I say this because most of the consultants who look at the film about this film seem to have a history. I found "Wort St. John's," and though it is not a hub for any point of thought, it has made me take "Shinobi," especially since everyone seems to love. Well, I watched this afternoon, and fought very hard to keep. Yes, it is very good - scenes of slow water, autumn leaves on trees, even CGI eye flicker - majestic. I liked hawk, clothing, even some of the fighting events, but in general this was lighter like dirt. It looked like someone took "Romeo and Juliet" - the translation also describes it as a star star - and threw some "X-Men" to a good measure. Two characters divided the Wolverine's strength - a man in a robbery with his claws and a gray-colored boy had his ability to heal himself. Then you have a girl who has a kiss of poison - that's the Poison Ivy (from Batman). Why do they give these women the power of dumb? The poisonous girl shows her leg and kisses it. Man, that's a great power to you. And another girl, she can create bugs from this yellow dust that blows hands. Another woman, one of the star lovers, has the power to watch. Wow. I did it at the end of the film, making it fast, and saw more trouble than I expected. Other people are comparing this with the "House of Flying Daggers" and "Hero." Don't make that mistake. They can share such prospects, but that's where the end is the same. "Shinobi" is done by amateur - some films are made by an experienced film manufacturer. I would say to avoid this film unless you are 12 to 18 years old.
