David Lean's movie is worse. Even 'what we serve' was'nt is as bad as this. Usually a very good film like this, has at least some features of redemption, which makes someone understand why it can be considered normal. But after looking at this I couldn't find just why this piece was so interesting even in 1945! I did not like acting, a little mouth mouth of Britain, a story, a script (which can be when a witch but without quite unfunny) and soundtrack. Elvira's characteristic is interesting and interesting, but it was really bad and it had a sad and sad voice. Just another film that helps you trust the film features. Another more than 'British classic'.
