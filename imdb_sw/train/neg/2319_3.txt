Many holes of the plot in the film. First we see him watching his master's kung-fu, and die in his gym. That's the same with me. Then at the end of the film, we see him using kung-fu which he learned only by watching his master when he was still a child. What? Is that possible? I don't think so. <br /> <br /> This show is for fans Jay Chou, and the film has no depth in terms of character development, cinema styles and unlocking conspiracy. Anyone knows that the captain of the basketball team (forgot his name) and the player hit by Li Xiao is very similar, how much would you think it was one with the same person? Long hair, looking for sun-boy, tall and strong. Both seemed like they came from a factory of mass production designed to produce products that make young girls scream in orgasm. It is not that these two actors had any value to contribute to the overall movie for the film industry. The area related to the four bosses of Jay Chou are coming to help him out of the basketball court, decreased in a worthless plot when they began to defeat their opponents of the Royal Rumble style. Any more, when 4 masters won the war, the crowd began to rejoice, and the match continued. Was really WTF? time. At the end of the show, when winning the match, all thanks to the best of Kung Fu's Jay Chou. How he acquired the kung-fu knowledge is a secret, because the show has some way to gain knowledge by looking at his master. the very director of the filing director. In short, this is Jay Chou-flick (instead of the "chick flick"). Just look like Jay Chou is your fan. If you are one of those whose tastes in movies are very controversial with those on the top 250 listings of the time, then this film is not for you.
