Good! This film hurts my head. and not in a good way. It is probably my only hatred of growing kind of action, but even as a child when I have reinforced like the Navy Seals, I still saw this film unlike. now I despise them completely. <br /> <br /> get one story of beauty quickly. keep the name and give others away. instead of using the story of the next gladiators of the half-sister of the future which is full of conspiracy holes all in danger of collapse (why is there a base of rebel in the middle of the field, how about the camera? in bakersfeild in the unsaved room? <br /> <br /> The whole film screams in the nineties, from the truley scores of bad to shiny goofy dress. life. Do not look at this film. I know other people liked, but some people come from being treated and I don't know them too.
