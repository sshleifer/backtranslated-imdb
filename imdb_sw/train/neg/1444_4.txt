The movie is very long and unfortunately is different from Novel. If you want to see the film then do not read the first novel if it will surprise them. However, the cinema movie was the same as if you are a person who loves the kind of adventure that looks at Africa and then you go. Making enough displays is enough, however, many important events available in the novel are not opened. In the novel, Sir Henry Curtis was looking for his lost brother instead of looking for his father. Gagool was cautious and killed in a cave where he was shown to be a good man who preferred to stay with the new king.
