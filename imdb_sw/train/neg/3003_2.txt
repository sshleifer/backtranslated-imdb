We all know that countless duds have wiped out 80 types of slasher and are often unsuitable except for the most disgusting. Maybe that's quick but damn as "Top Slaughter" was not quite normal, even with flick slasher. Best of all, conspiracy involves a child who has experienced Carrie's insulting at secondary school and returns to a building that came out to retaliate for a group of former attackers who all show remorse. If you would like to expect, they are killed by the madman of the holes in April 1 through electrocution, burning, hanging, and changing beer chemicals. I have many problems with the details of the plot and the layout of this film, but based on the end, I feel the need to overcome my complaints and just say this is a full time waste. Ignore any view of this movie ...
