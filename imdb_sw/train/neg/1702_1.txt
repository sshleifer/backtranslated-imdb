Let's be honest here: the only reason someone has bought this, the only reason anyone has gone through this, and the only reason that a person can claim to enjoy this is because David Lynch did it and because he wants to have David Lynch's children. But guess what? Even David Lynch can produce a piece of skin. It is possible that Lynch wanted you to adopt the most common experience and experience in itself as a clean image to know. Perhaps the voice of anxiety, cacophonist, and chicken-start pictures should represent something about the humanitarian space on earth, about our relationship with the Real, on the ignorance of all. <br /> <br /> Instead, it just says one thing to me: I lost just 20 dollars. If I wanted to refuse because of the refusal, I could reinforce Hansen on and allow me to have blood ears. If I wanted to wonder for a strange reason, I could just pick up the waste on the plate and check that for 33 minutes. <br /> <br /> There is one quality of redemption for Dumbland - it's meta, meta funny. That's very bad even not funny because it is very bad. This fact, however, is a little funny. If you hate and hate your money, then buy Dumbland. If not, put yourself in pain.
