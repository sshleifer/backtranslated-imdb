At the beginning this film seemed good even though it was moving fast and even though it had a $ 60,000 budget it was good but if you found your sister dead in the lake and know who could kill him why you would go around him and pull a gun with just one shot and lose finishing run from him all lost and suicide himself? More after you find your sister dead in the lake and get a clue and decide who the killer is why not give your finger on the police you think you have killed? And at the end of the movie when he acts like his sister who was a waitress and speaks to a bad person she should meet him somewhere with his memory saying she is dead and what happened to her "evidence". I don't know I was not happy with the end. This film can be very good if it is a long time and acting was better and if the end did not bring the worst! Don't waste your money on this film because if you do it you will write a review here and it will not be happy too.
