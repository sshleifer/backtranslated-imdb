Back in the days of the Toxic Provider, the kings under camping in Troma films tried to take the highway (OK, a little-down amount) to produce pictures of slasher directly. I would like to think that looking at the results here is what prompted them to stop all the deficit and go to self-awareness. The Splatter University is another film of artists in the audience. As it does about two different pieces and non-meaning items, it really becomes painful to watch. Let's see if I can shorten. After learning that the psychopath danger has fled from the local hospital, the move goes to a Catholic university (I don't remember that name, but with the title of the title, let's just call St Splatter). Students do not have a list and bother, and they argue with each other, slackers before their time. At the same time, a new professor, Julie Parker, completely confirms his work. Children experience relationships, honesty, unwanted pregnancies, clever priests, and how to avoid any work in the class; Julie is concerned with a lover of pride, a free administration in St Splatter, advising unmarried women, and a clear demonstration of those with no clear views. Nothing means anything or is solved in any meaningful way. Oh, and every time, the POV shot comes and beat one of the girls die, but do not insist your breath. There is a Red Butcher, and then a very sad fight with a real Killer, then it's back to inheritance and inheritance. The downturn and small quantities of the bulk are seen almost counting the sense of confusion to the viewer, which is supported with the editing of choppy, coffee-quality sound, and dialogue that has no meaning. And the most sad thing about this film is the fixation of the killer on women - men in this movie are just so worthy. I paid a good money to see someone from a jerk and a pregnant girl, or Lothario's lunch who was losing close to her girlfriend, or any of the attractive priests. No right.
