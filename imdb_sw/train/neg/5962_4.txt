Paul Naschy made many awesome films. In terms of quality, they have a difference from the right to the garbage; and, unfortunately, the Horror comes from the grave is close to the end. The program is your average story of a witch, wizard or (as here) the warlock, who is killed - but not before retaliating for those who did ... etc. We get celebrated with one thing leading to another, and soon The war of war has been no longer possible. The plan is slow, very sad and the film feels useless. Participants connect theatrical films and never serve the film in any way. Paul Naschy wrote a script, and if you ask me he should be connected to it because the discussion has been very common, and it only serves to make the film even worse than it is already. Carlos Aured, who also led Naschy in the Blue Eyes of Broken Doll and the Devil's Curse provides a good direction here, which you like to talk has nothing to help with the film. Sometimes they beat a film like this has some charm on them; but fear comes from the grave does not. This is a very exciting film that has little or no interest.
