The Warren Beatty director intended to turn the famous Chester Gould artwork into the cartoon operation (with Beatty himself standing as a square-square explorer) had a good mix of innocent nostalgia - odd and amazing from Warren Beatty. Unfortunately, the image is required ham, enjoy for a while but eventually refuse. Dick Tracy tries to bring down the young boy Big Caprice, assisted by Tess Trueheart's love but was attacked by evil Mahoney. For the first half hour of an hour, the orientation of the Oscar art and setup set is amazing to keep but, as the links of the plot together and predictable (without speaking the truth in the scriptures), things begin to open. Al Pacino was surprised to support the selection of Oscar as Caprice the bad boy, and Madonna (who is widely used as decoration ornaments) gets to sing Stephen Sondheim's "Quick or Future (I Always Get My Person)", which hit the award for Best Original Words. A lot of heart, thanks to Beatty - who volunteered for his vision - but the picture is very cool and has calculated. It has no heat. * 1/2 from ****
