After a few years, 1968 was a very good time for Elvis: not only made a special "Comeback" ceremony but also became a father and had a star in two very good movies too? NO a little life, a little bit. Therefore, my soul can forgive him for the bad cause that was STAY AWAY, JOE which, for the better, emerges as a fascinating misfire and not too bad to consider. Indeed, Meredith's Burgess and Joan Blondell are really shy? as, respectively, the dopey Indian father for Elvis's character and the bunkender bartender who has his eye on Mr. Presley too - but the man is delighted to see Elvis surrounded by the famous veteran Talent Hollywood as Katy Jurado (like Meredith's Mexican wife), Jones two ? Henry and L.Q. - Thomas Gomez who is very amusing as Mr. Thundercloud, who is the father of Meredith who has heard it still gives his old leader's clothes on today! While there is surprising (if it is not accepted for their common evil) the lack of songs, it seems that there is no shortage of free-to-all Indian men vials at the moment when the acts of Presley his female skills behind their feet! As far as possible, the 'western' state of Arizona is the main property here and sleep, bathing cattle is not only good but the main point of the plot. On the other hand, 'serious damage to the house' is the place we have seen many times since and does not work very well here ...
