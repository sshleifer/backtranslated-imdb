This is a very scary film - and unfortunately, the company that made this shorter did some more. Briefly it is a single-joke idea that was not starting to start and can also offend you. It really makes me worried to look at the very young children (most seemed like 2 years old) whistling and pretending to be adults - in this case, the dancehall girl and the bar guardians. It's kind of humor that you can be forced to laugh from your children if they pretend to be adults, but I can't see anyone wanting to see this - especially when little Shirley is wearing instead of slinky dress and acts like vamp !! And then, some children act like adults in certain adult situations. At that time, I am sure they haven't tried to appeal to the nearest children, but when you look at it today, it just comes to mind! For this reason, this incredible film also struck me out and I hope you never see it again! Pretty wonderful and pretty bad.
