Wow, here it finally is; act "movie" without action. In the real budget environment (do not miss the flying saucers that occur for a few times) of Seattle we will see no-brain hardings who want to take revenge on their childhood. Nothing / even natural or interesting on the plot and the performance of executives is beaten only by the stupidity of attempts to steal from other films, especially "Matrix" without having money to do so with justice . Yes, we can see some run on the walls of a slow motion (around 45 degrees) but these events are on frost like the stupid effort of making a joke about the ignorance of the male regularly. And, yes, we are also using a number of headings that are not anywhere at all, such as the script was considered and released earlier during photography. <br /> <br /> I don't believe it, it's as bad as possible to get. In fact, it shouldn't be taken seriously, but maybe I'll be able to do some of you not to lose and save your money.
