Prior to the release of George Romero's type of the dead of the Dead Dead, the zombies were good-natured creatures. In fact they had a better table in the old days. But the social etiquette alongside the best periods did these original zombies go to public-go to the public? Watch this film, nothing. The story is about a trip to Cambodia, whose purpose is to seek and destroy the mystery of zombiefication. One party finds its own secret and sets up to build a zombie army. <br /> <br /> This film is primarily a love triangle with zombies. But to see if this is the 30th movie, the zombies said it is more like somnambulists than the kind of meat-eating we think of today. They seem to respond to mental control, rather than enough desire. And, in fact, 'rebellion' is much less. The whole thing is very realistic. In addition to lack of fear, there are no high melodramatic tips to keep us. It seems impossible that this would provide many entertainment even 70 years ago. See if you should see everything with 'zombie' in the head but otherwise I would advise this jump.
