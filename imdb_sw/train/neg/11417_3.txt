A youth group in "St Elmo Fire" who just graduated from the university seems to be able to do so through a four-year secondary school at any famous university. For the most part, these children have no responsibility, selfishness, ambition and ignorance, but journalist and director Joel Schumacher appears to touch them as a touchstone of touch. With the current impetus of "up and comers", a natural symbol that appears to be similar to the "Terms of Endearment", and writing which leads to the smugness of this circle on us, "Fire" is a hot blaze, one that takes more shame like years go on. * 1/2 from ****
