I'm on bad movies but this has NOTHING going to it. Despite what they have said, it is not funny. I know comedy with underground movies but this is very boring that the Director / Author should be banned from leading anything but access to the internal cable again! Love movies and comedy is despising this film. I can never get on how unwanted and boring this work was. If you like this film you are the head of the head if there is no one here. SUFURI! If you need to compare the underground film, see "Modern Fried Kentucky" or John Waters early. The movie starts to define satire and I will resist anyone showing me satire. Rule of comedy ... If it's FUNNY you can say or do everything but if you're not funny you are not satirical, you're not edgy, you're just pathetic with this movie not just funny. SUFURI!
