See this film for having enjoyed the girl Gregory many years ago. This was the drivel. The program was not too worried by the teacher and her most spouses of 14-15 year old girls in very short skirts. The original publishers seem to think that this does not matter, but I've found it very bad. If you have children in school then the last thing you want is to think that every young teacher loves after his pupils. We were surprised that the censor then through. Apart from that film was a waste of time. Script was inferior to John Gordon Sinclair trying very much to restore his school image, a little wacky and a wall. Why would anyone expecting him in this performance be wonderful. This film has failed for all errors with me. Fear. Please don't waste your time looking. Life is very short
