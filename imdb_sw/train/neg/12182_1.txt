Yes, where do I start? I think it's very scandal Annie's original with Aileen Quimnn. I love the movie Annie, and I expected this to be a talented film, but I was desperate! Acting is bad, Annie was originally a few years before birth, I am now 25 and Annie is still one of the favorite movies, so I was very excited to see Annie 2. Acting was very bad in the film, were the original characters? very written, directed and done. This is not the film I want to see again, and any partner Annie I suggest that you do not look at this film because it will only give you despair. Little girls sing is not bad but it is still incompatible with nature
