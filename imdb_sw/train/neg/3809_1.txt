Show this is just awesome! I feel actors trying to try to be funny (especially Bob Saget), a laughing song trying to cover the sad jokes and the "Awwww" track comes to unwanted times. The most advanced children are not different, especially the Olsen twins. Also, this show is clich√© city. If you look at the word, you read "Full House" Every line of story has "life lesson" to learn the end. The slogan speech makes everything better and even has the ability to make the child more aggressive and to recognize the sudden GASP badness of this is not possible in real life. I don't know how one can watch this show without a bad mouth character of the characters or track laugh. I am talking on the TV saying, "That is not FUNNY / SAD / CUTE" If life was like this, the world will fall.
