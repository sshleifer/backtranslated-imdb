This is not a proper reference since I haven't seen many movies. I stopped watching it. The film is very violent, and traders with bad drugs and street punks, but not because I stopped managing. There was a problem: I just looked enough to be brought to several characters, all of which was not interesting. Everyone was a lovely, disrespectful psychopath, without the attributes of engaging, gave me something to expect. I found myself not too young about what they could do in the future or what could happen. If there was one person of interest, and I stopped a good or good person, I mean an interesting person, I could sit with him. See "Grace status" to see what I'm saying. In the film Gary Oldman character is the most endless, but it's * very * interesting. Al Pacino probably did a good job in Scarface, but his behavior was not just involved.
