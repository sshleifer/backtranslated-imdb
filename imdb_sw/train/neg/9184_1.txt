F * ck I! I have seen the most frightening movies at my time but this takes p * ss! In fact I can't explain in words how this film is so bad. In addition to a plot that is not true there, it works efficiently, the terrible causes of zombies; You know what, I could go all day. Any little thing in this film is either stupid, useless, loving or shy. I tell anyone who wants to watch this film ... not! <br /> <br /> I'm ashamed to say, I have this on my rack. Hidden similar to a god under a huge bunch. I could not even offer this horse-sh * excuse for the film. That's very bad.
