I will admit that I have seen five minutes of "Jerry Springer". I don't feel like a snob, but I think I'm on looking at what's on his show. You should try to lift yourself over this too. I saw this movie as part of the social studies I did. I was told that this film had little connection with Springer, but it is the foundation of the life of those who will appear "Springer." Effectively, this film could be really amazing how the lives of these people are truly interesting. I will accept it, I felt sympathy for Connie (Molly Hagan). This is all he has in life. It is very sad that he feels he should go to Jerry's show to solve this. I feel sorry for Molly Hagan appearing in this. What? Have you found that after this film, he has been featuring "B" roles on television? I will say this about Hagan. She is a very beautiful and intelligent woman. I have no doubt that she is very zealous in her act and she tries to play her roles with many sympathy. The problem is that Hagan can not carry the area alone. He just does not take the responsibility of leading. His best work will always be an angel on "Herman's head" (a show that was not good, but his heart was a good place) and when he came to "Seinfeld" as Sister Roberta.
