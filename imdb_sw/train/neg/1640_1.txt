This movie did not exist ... everything: stories, acting, surprises, skills and spirits. Fifteen minutes inside, I looked at the screen saying, "Are these all unable to get together and feel like friends (even without a girl)?" Fifteen minutes inside, I was praying for Peet as Amanda as possible. When the bad movie has taken the wrong head, the eye candy is a good comfort. But he did not have much of it! On all borders!
