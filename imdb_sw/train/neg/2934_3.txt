Simon Pegg star like Sidney Young, a very wonderful Brit workforce as a famous journalist in this US comedy. After getting a lucky break he starts to work in a respected Sharps newspaper run by a thorough Jeff Bridges form in New York. It is more than the devil wearing Prada than Shaun of the Dead. The possibility of love is given by Kirsten Dunst who works well with Pegg for laugh but they are not sure to keep the screen enjoyable with their enthusiasm. Sidney finds emotional challenges when trying to decide if he should forget his principles of journalism to get material in the magazine. Of course it is finally beaten by glitz and pleasing to the world of celebrating especially the small Sophie Maes (Megan Fox Transformers). Shaun's dead fans, Hot Fuzz and Spaced will ask whether Pegg has ever heard the same feeling in real life with this film and how much Fat Fat Run Run as one of the best comic talent of UK is destroyed by the US. <Br /> <br /> All in this is a comedy to forget. Please return us Simon, we can forgive and forget.
