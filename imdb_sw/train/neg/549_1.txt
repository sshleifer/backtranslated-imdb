I can't believe that the Indian film industry still makes money as a third as Waqt. At the beginning, the storyline is completely implausible? The damaged child is thrown out of the house to teach him self. So what does he do? He continues to win the national talent competition by making a star jump in front of a panel of judges (I honestly not interesting here). At the same time, his father is dying of lung cancer, but he keeps it hidden from the child, but he lives long enough to see his son famous, seeing his new grandson and also making a toy cloth with his own hands. <br /> <br /> Acting is a worthy cringe in his hammer? no efforts have been made to try and act in any way to influence any of the main players in this film. As usual in Indian films, the family lived in a big house and it seemed to be unthinkable of the real world concerns. Being honest, the main lost when the movies are made by the viewers who made the mistake of seeing the film. Actors, like Amitabh Bachchan and Akshay Kumar, will still be honored as God and those people who have nothing but blind faith in Bollywood.
