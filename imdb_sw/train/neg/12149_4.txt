Set Providence, Rhode Island, Feeding Masses tries to have a satiric look at the role of the media in the government. Ideally, it can be used in how the United States tries to control the media during the Iraq War, but it is about to feel the holes. There is never any tension in the story and acting it is not very good. Worse, the direction of the movie is angry, more focused on the tiny camera that fails to convey anything more. Special effects are very serious ... at one time the video of the blast is green on the city, and most suitable. <br /> <br /> The movie has good ads ... is advertising for post-zombie services (including rental services and bus association). But it's very little to make the film worthwhile. <br /> <br /> For the best movie of zombie, try Hide and Creep. It has the same value of production, but there is more magic, humor and talent behind it.
