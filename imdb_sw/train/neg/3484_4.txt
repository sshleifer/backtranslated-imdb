I remember when this was in the movie, the comments it was awesome. Well, I didn't think it was bad. It was exciting and had a lot of language-in-cheek humor about family close to vacation time. Ben Affleck is a rich young man who needs to find a family for Christmas to please his girlfriend. He is going to visit the house he grew in and beat the program to hire the family there for Christmas. I liked the lawyer's place where they signed a contract. That was interesting. <br /> <br /> So, it makes silly family applications and even writes scripts for them to read. Of course, the family has a daughter of fire in the interests of love. And he learns that holidays are not so bad after all. Also, all doo-dah activities were interesting, especially when they had finished the first place with a black man, and the parents of the women were not 't even saying anything about it. And the place where the doo-dah is hitting "his daughter thought." VERDICT OF FALIA: I thought it was worth considering if you caught on the cable.
