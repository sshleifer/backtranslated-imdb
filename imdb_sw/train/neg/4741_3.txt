Wendy Wu: The Homecoming Warrior has a good plot, powerful but damaged by cheesy notes in the movie. I am a little boy and I didn't like this film very much. I thought the effects were bad, but it might seem to be entertaining for young children. Matrix causes damage to the stage, you know that it was completely fake. Then there was Yen Lo, a bad spirit that has long had people who are not responsible and the home that Wendy was struggling to win. It all ends up as a movie to feel good when Wendy and its buddy monk cousin Shen defeat Yen Lo (and destroy him forever) at the end. So Wendy learns the lesson ... blah, blah, blah. I'm ready for the next DCOM.
