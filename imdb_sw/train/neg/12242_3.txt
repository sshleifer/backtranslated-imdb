I expected a bad movie, and I got a bad movie. But I couldn't really think in my worst fantasia how this movie was bad. I even don't want to try to explain what blood Surf is about. Do not over the outbreak of blood, but the wallet of $$. They complain about the fake shark in Jaws, but Spielberg was wise and did not show the shark until the end. Here the crocodiles are often displayed, and are the most fake crocodiles I have ever seen, and they are not trying to hide. If you want to see artificial crocodile check Lake Placid. <br /> <br /> The director had the opportunity to make a good film of surf / shark, but he had to make a bad movie of the monster b. He got the opportunity to make the original movie surf, but he wanted to make a movie of the monster. So you understand how this movie is bad, does it have a good place? It is not true, it has got dirt, and the sex area that is taken directly from the movie to play. Acting is not half bad either, and Kate Fischer looks good. Such a bad he does not take on it off. Lead artists are not bad either. They had certain abilities. The area was nice and the movie will start well with beautiful surf screens. This is about the author and director not mentioned. The discussion is some of the worst I have seen, and the script is very badly written, and the director did not have the talent that ever was, not even fantasy. <br /> <br /> Don't look at that. Even if you want to look good Kate Fischer. It's not worth it. See Sirens to watch Kate nude, and see Lake Placid if you want a good crocodile. Because I have a good atmosphere, and Maureen Larrazabal looks good, and Kate looks good (but it's a good actor,) and Dex Miller, Joel West and Matt Borlenghi did a good job with a piece of sh # t they had to work.
