I think I've seen a misogynistic film of all time: Darklight. The essence of the film - Lilith was the first wife of Adam and was considered to be perfect and canceled from the garden of Eden because he felt himself equal to refusing to present him. Look, I took those words directly from the script. Then the film goes on and though he is the film heroine, the only time that he accepts is when he does what they tell him to do! He completes the film under the control of all the Faith-group! <br /> <br /> Other than that the script was predictable and FX were bad. In addition to the obvious hatred of women which is usually more subtle in modern films, there is nothing original about Darklight.
