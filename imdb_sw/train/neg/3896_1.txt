Well. Astronaut Steve West sits in a plastic capsule space, saying that "you have never seen the sun through Saturn's rings", while the sun's mid-day sun circles through the window, when suddenly it has a nasal nose. Then, the West returns home to a private hospital, a gelatinous gray melting pot that goes berserk and causes a chunky nurse to run through the fake glass door. Apparently, the West "gets stronger as melt", which makes sense as anything in this area of ​​ambition, which is appropriate. Then dopey "Army Brass", who looks like a kind of Coleman Francis (director of many bad moovies) tries to cover information, but a goo man runs almost to kill everyone who sees it because it melts. He attacks the couple of the collision because it melts. He makes one of the scary actors screaming and playing for 10 minutes because he melts. He smells because he melts. Fx and Rick Baker decline should be stars here, but they look at the hokey. The film is very destructive and everything looks dark and permanently difficult to do - not that it will help any. MooCow says who cut the cheese with this? : = 8P ps - "Do you not get any crackers?"
