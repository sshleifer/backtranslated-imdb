I love these actors, but lost in this flick. Can I just ask myself, would they be thinking about agreeing to this trick? Debra Winger struck the inside; Dennis Quaid and Arliss Howard were caricatures. Some people thought it was deep. Well, if you liked "Wave Wave", you probably like this too. I hated both. 3/10
