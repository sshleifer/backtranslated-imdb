I had two reasons to look at this swashbuckler when it was revealed on Danish television yesterday. First, I wanted to see Gina Lollobrigida - and here I had no desire. He seemed good. Second of all, by reading about the film I had found the feeling that it shows extraordinary humor is not different from what can be found in the film Philippe de Broca. For this account, however, I was very sad. I saw a predictable joke (except the good words of war on the subject of war) and quite one-dimensional characters. Also, acts of action were given in a mysterious way, with no real meaning. I kept looking at the end, but I got so fast and I sat there, waiting for the curtain and Lollobrigida.
