It seems, this is what happens when the director allows his 14-year-old nephew to rewrite the discussion about setting when he is in alcohol at the same time; as I said earlier, although it always wanted to find one of Paul Naschy's images werewolf, this cruelty served as my introduction and, as horrible as it is, is still committed to pursue other entries in a series, at least very slowly With a high desire. of the profile such as Joe Dante of the HOWLING (1981), I love the photos of the whole butwolf but, being honest, I lost interest in the "plot" of this film and stood there on my TV screen to count its deficit as it was. There were too many to mention them here but I say two that struck me as especially hilarious were schizophrenic nature of Werewolf persona (ie going from a sharp beast in one shot to dazed, a zombie-like situation in a very next one - if that was in A typical midnight trip into the country, with a completely different wardrobe of boot ... and, yes, I knew the reasons for this before), with the "Phantom of Opera" Check out the Wolfstein character! But I know what - maybe the full length of this aggressive length would have been very good to be a horror of the horror!
