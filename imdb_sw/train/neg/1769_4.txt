1 watched 4/29/2007 - 4 out of 10 (dir-Mick Garris): The movie's vampire-like Stephen King movie has many amazing and goofy things that start laughing over extreme weight about 3/4 way to go in The movie and you wonder if this film can be a cult that follows the fans of the King. It is the story of a mother and baby who is sleepwalkers (shape-shifting feline-like, eating meat, requiring life, almost a reproduction of humanoid) who migrate from city to city seeking widows to eat to protect themselves alive. They come as ordinary people of the top class except their secret lovers and cats hang out of their homes, day and night. Buffalo is a death to them, so it sets traps in their yard to try and keep the population down. We see them breaking their necks when they are fighting (which is also the first in my experience of the film) â€” of course no real cat hurt when making a film. The boy is after a beautiful girl who has to crush until he becomes "sleepy" and then just wants his body. There's a lot of unique movie to this movie that would have been better if it was all the comedy out of town life, but the rather director tries to stimulate every two minutes until you just want to get on it and bring it a year. Finally what happens with the wind of the film under it is the last example of Stephen King's murder. The movie is interesting because the King's humor comes more than usual but his enmity is also very much and what you have a movie in which his fans probably likes and should be in their collection, but as experienced movie experience does not really cut.
