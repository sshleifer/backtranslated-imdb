Kudos for the patience of Paul Muni, who spent hours and hours in the room to make every day watch part of Zola. Muni was one of the biggest stars in the 1930s and I wonder how many people today - one of the classic buffs movie - know anything about it. He was a giant in business for at least a decade. He would have won the Academy Award for this performance, which would have given him two consecutive, as he won for the play of Louis Pasteur a year before. My opinion is that when he tended to overact a little, I still think he was one of the biggest actors of "Golden Age." Anything he played; . You would be riveted to the screen to watch its <br /> <br /> Unlike Pasteur's role, I thought this information was smacked a little bit of what we've seen in the past 60 years: going overboard to do a Liberal Hero. Even in 1937, Hollywood could not prevent its breach for the police or for the military, here make it a point to tell us how "corruption" these organizations are. Traders love only when the authorities are faced with failure. In this regard, this film is the way ahead of its day since we have seen this great time since the 1960s. <br /> <br /> However, it should be known to help this story. It is also not in any way to decrease the success of Zola as social reform, to overcome certain evils. Good for him! I would like to spend more time showing that, than considering one attempt.
