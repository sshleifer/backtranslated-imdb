This movie was not one of the best movies of Mary-Kate and Ashley. I didn't like you very much, and I was disappointed in the movie. For some reason, it seemed like a movie that they put together very quickly. In other places, it was very boring that I had to do it quickly. It had no bloop or any other exciting place like their other movies.
