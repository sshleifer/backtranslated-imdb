What? Germany's main TV channel can announce such a mess? It is amazing how the chief executives avoid all the talent of working - even Gottfried John is very well known to do the poorest - especially in the double murder area - how amateurish ....... The screen program is very, very extended - perhaps filling part 2 of the movie. Be careful sleep when you look! The set is very often a blue screen, f.g. The scenes on the ship and the unreal sea in the background ...! In the German sound and dubbing version is very poor - perhaps the reason: different language practitioners - but: another global production covers more professional. Advice: don't show - it's a divine waste of time!
