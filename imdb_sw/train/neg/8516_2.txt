Last week, I watched the weekly Nielsen levels, and there was Veronica Mars, who claims to be "the best show that you look at." <br /> <br /> Well, they are sure that you don't look at that. It was explained twice and was replaced by 147 and 145 out of 147. Translation: this is the most tested show on any network of web sites ... and so it is ok. I tried to look at it several times because of the coverage of all the news as a "big show", "real look" in life and all worthless. The truth was otherwise. Veronica Mars is bearing. It is as absurd as it gets, and it deserves to be canceled. <br /> <br /> The only secret is why CW felt compelled to keep its launch schedule to the lowest memory, after two years of continued commercial and artistic failure.
