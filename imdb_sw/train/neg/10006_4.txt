I don't know who is being criticized, worried or unfamiliar director. It seemed to be one of those movies where you paid for many stars (Angie, Charlie, Denise, Rosanna and Jon) that didn't have enough left to make the movie. This can be very entertaining, but there was a veil of cruelty, even fear, which is closed on each scene. Since it had a rating R in what way did the swimming zone of the bubble was hit by a 70-year-old woman and not Angie Harmon? Why Sheen sleeps through a possible fire relationship of TWO SECURITY INDUSTRY AND WORKS in the world? If they were looking for a laugh, why not lose Whoopi Goldberg and Judy Tenuta instead? This was predictable to see that the director was not five years old. What is it, not just for the audience but also for actors as well.
