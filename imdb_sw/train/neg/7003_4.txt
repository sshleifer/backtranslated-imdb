(aka: TRINITY ISI MY NAME) This view seems to have been done so that you can succeed in the success of the European Office of the TRINITY SECURITY, this time only Joseph E. Levine and the photographs of Avco's like to use America too. The worst was not so far since the pictures of Hill / Spencer have had little efficiency here in the United States, and this stirring, stirring film is not good. The Trinity and Bambino swear by their dead father (Harry Carey Jr.) that they will be successful complaints and take care of each other. Later they are involved with armed traders who transport guns from the shelter, and who mistakenly think it is a pair of federal agents. They all fall flat fall despite several incredible events, especially which Trinity and Bambino are in the French fancy restaurant and do not know how to carry themselves. And the events with the pope of the card were humorous too. Gene music opening songs by Gene Roman looks like Bobby Goldsboro's first song of 70 songs when the music is selected in all the best movies. I don't know if I would buy the sound of his CD but others can. <br /> <br /> The movie may be half an hour off and not mentioned for a long time. It looks like many settings are covered here. In fact, I lost interest on 2 / 3rds of way through. The DVD is also horrible, and the occasional hum in the sound of the voice and poor print that looks like it would have been sent to a huge hole of the scrap in heaven. <br /> <br /> Great action from the previous film. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
