This modern, so-called exciting, had five small squares that were held at the same time at the end, but ended up more like a net. The quote was emerging, the speed was slow and the characters were boring. George Clooney looks like he needs to get into practice, Matt Damon locked up and others seemed to read their lines from the teleprompter. <br /> <br /> The worst part of this movie was that it was careful to be politically correct and thus to say anything about big business, oil and Middle East. I found the document giving more excitement. Watch it only if there is nothing else to do.
