Like most of Steven Seagal's fans I know I'm not going to expect a hub every time he makes a film but I hope to have a film at least to have a certain budget. The main problem with the photographs I watched was awesome on photography I know that in some of this film is done and I admit that but when they overdub with different voice actors and keep doing it out of the film it does not take the magic of overdubbing off. The sets also seem to be built regardless of whether in the same area on the top of the mirror of the secret secret library there is a great understanding. I was disappointed with this film and only hope the Stevens project will be completed before sending the film by buying / leasing. The story of this film was astonished if I watched a sci-fi film or not a part of it was considered a guest but did not fully explain what was going on I found it very complicated.
