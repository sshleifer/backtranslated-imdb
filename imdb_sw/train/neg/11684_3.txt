This movie has no meaning, there is a huge pile of big enough to drive a big NYPD through. The characters don't do anything. I will put my comments on the chat board, but save your time and money, this is stupid. I can't stand when Hollywood spends millions of dollars on flash bang devices and uses the concept of cooling and cool music, and it doesn't even have a plot that depends on even the most basic level. But it is advisable to see Denzel W. on a Person, who comes in 3 tastes, Jodi Foster, Mayor Bloomberg and Capt Von Trapp. There is even a nice little child with a video game that is good.
