I have two good things to say about this film: the environment is good and Peter Falk provides good performance (considering what he has to do in terms of conversation and direction). However, this said, I got this very hard film. Watching the dry color would be more than entertainment. It seemed longer than 97 minutes. Starting with the opening chain, where everyone speaks to Paul Reiser repeats everything that he has told him on the phone, an irritating movie. The film is filled with clich√©s and shtick, not to mention the endless events of Falk sounds. Also, the director seems to have difficulty determining whether it is the purpose of laughing or tears. There are some procedures that touch, but all play for laughing. If you are interested, you like, and "good" to appeal to you, you will love it. But if you were hoping for something with more substances, see different films.
