This is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen, everything about it is weak and unavailable. Acting is wonderful, the dress is even harder and the story does not exist. This planning and film adventure 'poverty line' meant to capture some of the achievements that the "Great Animal" and "Conan" enjoyed but did not give us any reason to follow. The leading behavior is lighter and lighter, can not even fight with sword and sword from the 16th century. Don't bother with this trick.
