I heard many stories about this film being good ... Well, I used my chance when I saw it at affordable prices Ebay last month. <br /> <br /> I watched, and I have only a few ideas about it: <br /> <br /> 1) A bad story, 2) Bad actor, 3) Bad fighting events ... <br / > <br /> I haven't seen any worse films in my life away! When the storyline is bad, than at least make a fights something more attraction. But TIME happens badly ... <br /> <br /> * The only positive thing about this movie (in my opinion) is Nikki Berwick. God, looks good in this film. <br /> <br /> That's up to it ...
