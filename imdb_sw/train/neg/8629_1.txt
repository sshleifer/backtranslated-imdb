Dear Richard, I know we all like to Home Improvement with Tim Allen. But with weight, do you? Don't have anything else to do except the sequels of crippled to Air Bud? I would think Tim could give you a little responsibility for the moment or even be his personal assistant. I know that it seems to be surprising, but the benefits of paying are the greatest gift. Everyone would see you near Tim and immediately think "Time of Time". You can even get a job with Bob Vila more often. Instead, it appears for 10 minutes with Golden Retriever and murmuring. I know there was no multiple script, but you can add. I mean, come. Tim gives you one debt. <br /> <br /> But with weight, this film has nothing to do with the Air Bud line. Conversely, fake teenagers are brilliant than actually seeing dogs playing games. Initially it was excellent. And you, Mr. Richard Karn, you know that more than anyone. <br /> <br /> This is a "F" movie.
