This movie was so bad it was almost ... almost. We love music, but not this. Even with the sound quality of sound, bad movies, and many actors who can't sing or dance, Anthony Rapp was able to give good performance (especially towards the end). Marjorie's behavior, a drunk woman, was happy to enjoy, too. <br /> <br /> The program is unlikely and may be funny without the awesome singing and music of the piez. Admittadly, some songs (fantabulous) are very good (but not in a good way) <br /> <br /> Open House is a funny movie just looking because it's bad! We think it can be music of good action (and better actors).
