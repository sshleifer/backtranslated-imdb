This film is very amazing; - The whole columns are Bunkum; The fact that the main killer (vampire or otherwise) can fly around without removing and killing as many people as the film shows is laughable. Vampire himself did not look out of place on the Bela Lugosi film. Most of the acting are so wooden executives should be treated with dry rot. I am waiting for a day when someone makes a good film from Steven King's novel (except, perhaps, of Standing with Me). This film is experiencing what many films Stephen Stephen makes - lack of money used for "special" effect, poor actors, terrible behavior and discussion. This film is cheap, facing and fails in everything he tries to do.
