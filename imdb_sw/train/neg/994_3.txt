This movie tracked open and simple. Well it is basically about a girl who gets raped, and retaliation gets another boy wanting a man. The offender is douche, but the girl's victim is part of the blame. I mean they all go into a heart condition and start kissing things, but when the refugee tries to have sex with him, he doesn't allow so the fighters should talk to him. And the thing is rape rape for a girl is very short and does not give out or show anything, but when it comes to raping a rapist, it is a long-term rape area. There is no basically in a story that is worth looking. <br /> <br /> 3.2 / 10
