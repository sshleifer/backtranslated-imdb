This film has a few things happening on the bat. Have Dani Filth as a leading actor is automatically going to make some people like this film. In fact, I love the Cradle of Filth and listen to the sound of this film before watching it. Dani Filth is a well-known character and makes great leadership. The independent filming style is good because it attracts. There are some GORGEOUS artists in this film. Since the low budget, special effects were not bad either. The ways people died were very creative and night. <br /> <br /> Now go. There is a tiny talking on all this film, so make it very little like character development. It's hard to fear for the lives of the characters, the destinations. When there was a little talk, F was a big bomb, coming to random places. Yes, I understand people swear but it looks like a fifteen-year-old boy wrote this and he felt it cool to insert the whole language. Story story, what I was able to do, was good though many parts were left out and the absence of dialogue often stops wondering what is happening. At the end, the Cradle of Fear is like a porno for people who love sex and abuse, but as it tries to pull a story, it doesn't work very well. Buy it, if you are a disgusting person looking for your blood and meat desire.
