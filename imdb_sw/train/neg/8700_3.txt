I believe that Concorde / New Horizons is not trying to make a bad fear, or even movie action when they make Carnosaur 3. Movie is flat-out silly from start to finish. Even humor in C3 is funny because it is bad. Of course the highest water mark in the 'worst form is good'. If you like to enjoy the worst, this is for you.
