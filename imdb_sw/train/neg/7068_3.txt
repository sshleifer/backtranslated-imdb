Chillers begins on a cold night, dark and stormy as buses come out of three passengers outside the bus station, a young boy named Mason (Jesse Emery), professor of Doard Howard Conrow (David Wohl) and a woman named Sharon Phillips (Laurie Pennington) ). Inside they find that they have missed their merger and be beaten at night. In the waiting area they get two other people, Ronnie (Jim Wolf) and a sleeping woman named Lindsay (Marjorie Fitzsimmons) who now has a horrible dream ... During swimming in the local pond Lindsay meet a friend named Billy Waters (Jesse) Johnson), sometimes Lindsay sees Billy coming into the pool and then appears disappearing into thin air before the fall. Shortly after Lindsay discovered that Billy Water died in a dive accident 5 years ago ... Lindsay wakes up and tells others about his dream, everyone else answers by saying that they have also found a confused dream soon and the decision to participate to pass The time ... <br /> <br /> Then is Mason who says the story of how she and two friends, Scott (David R. Hamm) & Jimmy (Will Tuckwiller), are shocked during a camping trip ... br /> <br /> Then it's Sharon whose story spinning journalist named Tom Williams (Thom Delventhal) who he calls, no time at all Tom is in his front door but he actually turns into a Vampire ... <br / > <br /> It is on the side of the next Ronnie and tells how he knows that he can raise the dead, unfortunately he brings the killer murderer Nelson Caulder (Bradford Boll) back to homicidal life ... Last Dr.. Conrow says the story of how his two pupils brought the old Aztec war god called Ixpe (Kimberly Harbo ur) to return to life ... <br /> <br /> Then it is back to the bus station for the last loss (predictable) ... <br /> <br /> Written, made by directed by Daniel Boyd Chillers is one of the worst anthologies that I've ever seen & I usually like this small type. Boyd script lacks what is needed for films such as Chillers to work, you can see the last line up to kilometers and every story is lame. First of all it is very important and it is not found to be the last and the best thing about these stories is short stories that have been hit and lost. The second story predicts &, again, ends without any payment. So it continues in the Chillers that every story is very exciting to look & do not charge for doing so. Characteristics and discussions were not written badly, the stories seem to have no original ideas of their own and generally the film is looking for. Of course every story does not last long & I love the idea behind the connecting groups. <br /> <br /> Director Boyd was working on a very small budget and shows. All I can say is that if you want to look at an unusual 15-minute story that was put in the swimming pool then the Chillers are for you. Stories are not clever, scary or have any kind of tension or build up anything. Having said that it has a few beautiful scenes & some amazing abilities shines sometimes. Violence & wise wisdom is not much happening in the Chillers, a broken heart, a broken head and a hand biting as it gets. <br /> <br /> Technical Killers are poor things that cannot impress anyone. Primary Style, bad music, special effects of cheap and low-quality production standards. Chillers also includes one of the most popular theme songs all the time, period. Acting is also very low. I am sure many attempts were put in Chillers as a low-budget film and at least the filmmakers tried so they will give you credit to be at least, but that still has not stopped thinking is decorate. Anthology Movies such as Stories From the Crypt (1972), Asylum (1972), The Vault of Horror (1973), The Dror's House (1965), Creepshow (1982) & Stories From Darkside: Movie (1990) is far away Chillers might look at one of them instead.
