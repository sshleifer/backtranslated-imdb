Cassidy (Kacia Brady) puts her gun on her head on her head Neal (Jason Dibler). Cassidy was the chief singer of "spirit of demons and death" that could not visit the feelings of sadness of ignoring his boy (you know, I can find other good ways to solve this instead of shooting your head). She returns, however, with the spirit of Dora (Jill Small) her friend who is taking her to the voice so that the group can finish the album rejected by the death of Cassidy. But, Cassidy made a plan with one dark and soul should be gathered ... it is used by this anger towards Neal, but all the members of the band or anyone in the music studio dies when they fall to prey to those who believe it rather than despise Dora. nor Cassidy returns to pay. <br /> <br /> The flick of a small budget of fear appears to be cheaper, it has an affordable cast that should make plans in another line of work, and tend to kill killings that are not 'slightly effective'.
