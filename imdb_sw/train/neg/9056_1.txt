I have seen movies coming out of my life, but this must be among the worst. Step down below 100 (imo, that's). We follow two couples, Dodds (Billy Bob Thornton as Lonnie Earl and Natasha Richardson as Darlene) and Kirkendalls (Patrick Swayze as Roy and Shakira as candy) in one car on the Reno road. It seems, Lonnie is very unhappy with his sex life, so he hates his wife and Candy, who tries to have a big baby. Roy, at the same time, is not too sure if his sperm is the same and so he gets examined by the doctor. Now, I read back to the DVD, but my girl did not, and cried out in 20 minutes: 'oh, she will be pregnant but her husband can't have any baby'. Dial, for this film is soooo predictable. With boring. And anger. You have no meaning. Surprise. Scary. <br /> <br /> How much of this film is running out. Two couples have entered their main car towards Nevada, when they are stopped by 2 police officers, because they did not stop on the stop signal. The boys are aware and ultimately bribes two officials with beer cases. Not only this event that is not offensive and not important (or even important) for the film, it takes about 5 minutes! It's talking and talking and talking, without going anywhere. <br /> <br /> I still have to avoid thinking about the end. Apparently, Roy doesn't have trouble down there so he's the father of the child. How many times that happens in the movies ... try something new! The hated wife eventually forgives her husband and the best friend to have it and all live happily at all times. Yuck. <br /> <br /> The best shows of movies are at the end, with several shots of Grand Canyon. Why couldn't they just keep the camera for 90 minutes? One can expect more from this cast (although Thornton really tries), but you can't actually blame them. Authors, embarrassed on you! </ 1/1 / / 1/10.
