Today, I visited Cinema of Athenean with my two children (ages 6 and 8), paying 3 x 12 euro (total sum of $ US $) without mentioning gas, popcorn & soda, was asked to restore my 3D glasses after leaving the field and "obliged" to see what could be the center of a 3D film but proved to be just a "cold war" as a propaganda film, if nothing I saw in the past 20 years. BEING MOVIE FOR CHILDRENâ€¦ THE NAME OF THE DAY! PS 1: The average working Greek makes more than 850 euros per month (approxiamtely 1050 US $) <br /> PS 2 My children liked ... but again not more children> in Greek: mora, morons> as writing script & others who did "3D attack" happen. <br /> <br /> Animation PS 3 3D is amazing but it gives ....!
