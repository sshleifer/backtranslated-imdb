Cafe Lumiere is an undefined weakness. I do not know the work of the director, I am well known by the film manufacturer who is responsible for paying taxes - Ozu Yasujiro. While it is not close to Ozu for beauty, Hou has not communicated any depth of feeling and concentration on meaning within the closed space. One of the things he misses is Ozu's attention to behavior - we can't even "be brought" by Hou to his leading character (the incomplete page). There is no medium or close to his people. One additional DVD provides interviews with administrators and gives us the accuracy of what Hou does - look good on their faces. There was a great Spanish film and Bardem called Nunca Pasa Nada, which translates to something like "Nothing Happens". That would be the best title of this useless exercise. All through the film we are given an indication of a Taiwanese composer who some of the work we hear in the voice of the voice. But the symptoms, like everything else, adds something. Unless you are a train, this film has nothing to recommend.
