I lost these ideas might be interesting, and could be a fascinating story but that has been told in such a strange way. Hard to follow, amazing editing, emerging storyline, visible characters, all in all dirt of time. I can't just go in and I don't care what happened to the characters - even Ian Holm could save this film. Unless you need sleep therapy, I'd like to jump. 3/10, and that's generous.
