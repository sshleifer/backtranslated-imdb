As many others have said before me, I have to say that this film is bad, but it's not the worst I saw. There will be no direct references to movie stations or surveillance in this view, because I hate the perpetrators. I felt the feeling I was looking at the part of a TV or something festival, where they got $$$ more to spend on CGI (I found it worse than that) ... if you have any knowledge about computer and / or technology at all. There's just a lot of this time of insulting make me feel good, and I just found that praying for all last - fast - half by way. In addition, there are many “simple” ways available, which are also insulting to your mind as a man who thinks ... The embarrassment of damage even they should call it sequel. <br /> <br /> Two stars from me, because of one thing and only one thing: the performers are not half bad, based on the regurgitated trick of the script they had to work with. Still, they should never sign on this film. It's not really moving to work, but I think we all have to pay bills. For those who gave this score on the film ... you should be in the studio or something, that's my only note. For all who have not seen this: in all ways, see and create your own mind. But reduce your expectations on the floor (and then some).
