I went into this with my hope, for twenty minutes on a movie that I couldn't leave more. Despite thinking that this would be the worst reference, I put my high hopes that maybe ... maybe maybe someone could get this time around. Sadly, Prom Night is on the same level of quality as the recent day of Fools Fools remake, bad script, bad trend, cheesy overdone acting acting and generally bad fears. <br /> <br /> From beginning to end is boring, repeating and deserving on several eye lines. We've seen all of this before and we've seen it done a million times better then this. If you are going to watch Prom Night in the theater (I would like to say a DVD or PPV), be prepared for the audience to laugh, because they will laugh. Laughter is not on points in a film that should be surprising, it is in response to the "exciting" moments in a film that is being done as destructive as you look at a more new feature of the Scary Movie. Hardly, was this thought to be a remake or spoof? The film staff missed the mark here, that a large number of listeners in the sports field I attended went out through the movie. Which in the past, I would like to do. It was not me, I had to struggle and hold on to them with the hope of being better. Not to say No. The events of "fear" are a dragon, not so much because of acting but because of the direction, script, "special effects" and function of the camera. The movie manages to look like they used the fortune to produce, but still out of it and movie movie movie. I half expected to look at the shop tags on a certain dollar and I have been thinking I will see a porn star in a certain place. These videos are scary, if this is the future of the biggest fear of the budget then the type of fear will be punished.
