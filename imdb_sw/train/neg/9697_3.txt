I saw the first movie star and sometimes I had a little fun to look at. There are many of the most popular television / journalists seen in the first place and presented, in fantasy clothing, the most common events of the Set-Up program and especially are the second movie trouble should fight with. Everything was already there .... nothing new to get. You know and many of the sad and dumb “joke” and always feel like their goal is to put every Comedylooser of ten years ago who wants to return to action. There is nothing important about the story: the story of the legendary story of Rumpelstiltskin, without any significance. I expected something like that but not something that I could complain. In fact I complain about the lazy journalists who had a whole history of history; Their only business was to get a lot of joke and local parodies but they didn't get it. This crap except the great appearance of Helge Schneider time and money damage (if you do not like him then remove 2 points of my assessment) If you would like to save your money and get a bad joke then look for a broad string every Friday evening on SAT1 or RTL for free. I am sure you will notice some of the "laugthers" I saw last night in the movie.
