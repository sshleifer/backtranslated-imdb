Many people thought that this is a good movie but I disagree with it. At the beginning of the movie, the ground that was broken down on the ground and some foreigners fled from the compound, then killed some people in the world, but for any reason. Also, it's in the black forest, I can't see anything on the screen, I can just hear the sound. After a few days, the pastor came to the world but nobody had sent a sign before him, he should not know what happened in the world, so there is a contradiction. Finally, the animal found the head of the aliens and killed him without cause. He didn't live on earth, not his business about things that happened here. Finally, the film time is only 90 minutes long, the summary is very short and you cannot tell the consultants about the story. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I don't think this is a good movie.
