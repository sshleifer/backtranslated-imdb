Way back in 1967, a certain director had no idea about the galaxy, far or near. He was trying to complete the film with the head of THX etc. this is a remanufactured history of a particular George. Sorry has only damage to protect. This is just advertising ads to the director, executives, et. al. It has a small artistic value. It's a brochure. Playing George, it's very good, as is the character of Leia, and the behavior of ersatz Darth. All else is a clear soil business. What is it. However, I got a job I think. Some of the movies are just lifting water to kill when I think. just a brochure.
