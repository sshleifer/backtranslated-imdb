I liked to love this movie as a child but, again, see 20+ years later, it comes. Until the Academy could be before the time back in 1980, but it has almost nothing to offer today! Movies like Caddyshack and Strips hold better than this steaming dogpile. No T&A There is no good joke except for one towel we've heard for millions now. <br /> <br /> I recently bought a DVD for hope that it would be a gem I remembered it. Yes, I was gone! The voice sound had only 2-3 obvious errors (not a collection of others that were mentioned) and the frequent sounds were awesome. The only thing that was interesting to me, was what predicted what the lines of behavior were before telling them. Yes, I watched this film that was very back! The only reason I write this comment is to give my two cents why this film should forget, sorry to say. :(
