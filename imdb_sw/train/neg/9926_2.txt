I just looked at the 30th edition of Sadning, and one of all my friends! The TV attempt for the Black Black trunk. The plan was absent and acting was not good. It was clear that the attempt to benefit from the success of Saddles's fatigue and there has been a television show that has succeeded in making a big filming, but this has never been worked. Considering that for many years the television is not recommended even the voice calls during the movie television, it is impossible that they thought they could put a show on TV and "N" a word hit around. On the other hand, I enjoyed seeing many common faces! There were a few actors / actors that I realized from other exhibitions over the years. I had to write all the names and make a short search. It was fun. I was calling with my mother if Steve Landesberg was from Barney Miller or Mash. I won! :)
