My first movie full of Heston. The movie in which everyone already knows the end. "Sci Fi Thriller". The reason for the camp. Everything that goes with this film was hurt on my head when I used it, and the morning I looked at it, it was a great movie to look at the situation I had (I didn't want to move. Put the player, hide in blankets). And though I tried to understand what was happening so that the end would be destroyed forever with pop culture, it certainly did not. Everything was everywhere, the relationship had no spinal cord, the end had no leadership. Everything was just kind of there in some form of madness and the player has no choice but to leave some amazing part at the end of time, because even though we all know that they are people, it's quick answers about WHY people are doing any attempt to enjoy the movie for anything else except the lost damage to the window.
