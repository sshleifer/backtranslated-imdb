I should never see this film. The style of publishing can be considered to be very much for others, but it is considered to be migraine-resistant to me. I think it might be an interesting plot, but since I couldn't look at it with a stretch of time that I missed so much. Stimulating and stopping motion videos have created my brain. I stopped looking in the middle and back to the second attempt. I think if I was at home alone in my lighthouse evening black and stormy, this could be just a ticket ... PS I don't know if the lighthouse / fashion film could be considered a spoiler, but I don't want to be listed on my first inspection;)
