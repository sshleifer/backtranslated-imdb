NO SPOILERS. I love the awesome movies, but this should be the poorest attempt to make one ever. Call it "movie" is also stretch. This "emergency-clips-of-the-fake-and-tacky-abuse-and-bad-woman-try-act-sexy-planned-bad-combined" is not recommended to watch. <br /> <br>> Watch this is about looking as interesting as family vacation pictures, and has the potential you can expect when you send your ten-year-old in your forests and new cameras, and tell them to make movies. <br /> <br /> Horror.
