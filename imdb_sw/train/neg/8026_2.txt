Remarkably how this show is still shown. There is one man sitting together, married, and has children, but everyone is broken. What to continue with this? The show can be entertainment at the beginning. You see all the girls like about one person, that almost all like once. It's like in real life! Girls begin to take sides, combine it out, and show their true self (or so we think). But one person has decided to decide who can decide to marry and live happily at all times. <br /> <br /> What! What is the real love? What? How can you fall when someone has to take it? This period is wonderful. Did you think that online friendship was bad, but people should go to the television so that they can love? Not true. How can a girl have someone while going with others, doing with them? None of these questions have been answered, and eventually when the show is over, you know there will be a happy end in the future. For all we know, everything is written.
