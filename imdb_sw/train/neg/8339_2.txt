This film just goes to circles, and the viewer doesn't know where. At first I thought ..mmmmm, it could be kinda movie this winter, but it is approaching and continuing, and finally you don't know what's going on. A good woman is a good actor and played very well, and fella psychologically, it is interesting, but after a little you care exactly what happens, because this film just goes on. Shame really, this would be better. It would be though it was a woman's and psychological leader, she would have a good job in front of them, but they will remember this film, by making them known, or by the film they regret.
