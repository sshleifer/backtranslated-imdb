I have never understood the Garbo appeal. He always comes in his films like stuck, not all that is interesting, and the sound that has heard that can stop part of the bear. He was also a very young actor, like Gloria Swanson's best left in the era of silence. In this last film, its performance is very moderate and even uncertain. She tries hard but all comes free because the script is even worse than her work. <br /> <br /> A will be a scooter romcom which never never trusted and never falls down (although Melvyn Douglas manages to find attractions on ski screens, which is just exciting here). It was capable but the script fails almost every department, losing every actor in it. Douglas and Garbo had good good chemistry together but this is not even a spot on Ninotchka, which I also found to be very standing.
