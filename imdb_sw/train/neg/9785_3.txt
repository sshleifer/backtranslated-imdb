This film, for special schools after school, is not bad, and that's a problem. Nothing happens. You feel like you're still in class. The boy teaches a group of young children how to be good color players. We can never see these poorly doing wrong if a good player teaches them. They all turn to good players for meditation. There are also many characters and no character development. Most often it uses the main character and her sexy sister and is not enough for some other children. This may be 'Bad News Bears' feel (the original) since there was a girl on all the boys' team, but it didn't have any feeling for this movie completely. You have no sense and leave the dirty pain in your bones after watching it, not happy for the bag, it is not worth looking, and it's just like ... there. Plain. Decay. Something you would like to watch after school before evening. As lighter as the day is long and has been a long, long day watching this film.
