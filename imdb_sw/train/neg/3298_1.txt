When I heard that the Hazzard rebels were being discussed with the current executives and the script firm, I was like, "surely, I will give you an opportunity, it won't be better than the first, but we'll see what happens." Well, I saw what happened. I saw at the end of the end of the 70/80 years that it was a classic, basically tested by Hollywood. It is sad to see that Hollywood traders cannot come with something natural in these days. They seem to take a great exhibition who had the audience of a great focus, and try to "GET" a classic show. Say UP Hollywood ... It was not working! However, more about the show. I think they could beat the actor better than Sean William Scott (Stiffler from American Pie) to play Bo. I am sure John Schneider is definitely desperate and how his behavior was shown and taken advantage. Also, Get in fact, Johnny Knoxville, like Luke Duke. What less can you go? The jackass actress of the dancing Luke famous. This helps me. Also, I will give Jessica Simpson a beautiful woman, but her acting is trying. Catherine Bach who played the original Daisy, was intelligent, strong, powerful, thoughtful and beautiful girl of IL. He was the example of young girls growing up! (I owned a doll and Jeep - thank you very much !!!) However, Jessica Simpson played a donkey ass, a slut of 2-bit as Daisy Duke. Daisy never was blonde. Why they had to throw him. Jessica Alba could play Duke's Great Daisy. He can talk to the great horizon of the south, and he is good, and he could do a good job. However, I would like to say that this film hit something serious. I feel like I have been bought to pay $ 8.50 for a ticket, and they should restore my money. If you like Dukes of Hazzard (original series) they don't see this movie. It will only defeat you. CMT (country music television) has Dukes buttons all night afterwards. So put your TIVO and go with something real, not copying on the big screen in Hollywood.
