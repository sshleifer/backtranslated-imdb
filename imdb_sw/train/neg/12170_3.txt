It is not surprising that Pamela Springsteen gave the job to be a full-time photographer; it is the best idea to be behind the camera than the front of one. Although this film does not contain its attractive features (tablets from hell, etc.), it is provided with errors. For one thing, Angela, an assassin, seems to be on the same age as staff. Having a more threatening camping director could do much for the film. And then you have murder scenes. The budget was considered to be very low to implement most of them well (no planned pun), although swallowing a person in the outside toilet is certainly original. But in general, there are tons of movies out there which are more difficult / more to spend an hour and a half of your life.
