Why, 'WHY! ... have I taken this one? Okay ... I wanted no-brainer at temperature, and the lid looked good. Of course I should be well known. This is a real, bad movie. And it is frustrating when the creators know it is bad, and try to cover it by adding other good / beautiful women, and other sexual experiences. Well, people ... is not recommended, not recommended! If you would like to have a cool film about a large fabric that is very real, very good, it is playing and laughing: go Rent Lake Placid! (that's command)
