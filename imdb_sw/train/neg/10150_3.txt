Humphrey Bogart did not want to be in this film, and had to play the Mexican part or could be stopped. Believe me, made the wrong choice! It is possible, after the success of "Dodge City", Warners tried to track with Errol Flynn and its usual list of friends, such as Alan Hale, Guinn (Big Boy) Williams, Frank Mc Hugh and John Litel, who have yet to submit. they made a big mistake of trying to present Miriam Hopkins as a passion for Flynn v. Randolph Scott, and as a singer doing bad things, because he showed one thing, and that can't sing. The story was not too bad, but for Bogie openly, it was a poor West that was high, and for a small budget, but equally, the color would not have helped.
