There is a group of TV operators of Fox sitting next to the right-room table wondering what a new show of commission. <br /> <br /> 'Would you like to do something like 24 or West Wing?' says one of them, but all agree that it is too expensive, and the cheap TV should not hurt the facility if it passes. <br /> <br /> 'Well, how about connecting with a great comedy writers and making a quality sitcom?' it produces another and is evicted. 'What! You don't know the good authors lose so much money! ' big holes of chiefs. 'That's why we made a real television.' We can make another crime scene ... 'shows a man with a bland suit. 'I'm listening ...' the master responds, suddenly interested. 'People like CSI, then let's make another copy of it,' Blandman adds. <br /> 'But there are already many CSI talents out there, what can we do to stand up?' A foolish woman asks and is thrown immediately. 'Stand up! If we do that people can be confused! Let's give them more than what already! loud noise. Let's just add more violence and make it real, we are Fox after all, 'another suit shows' 'now you get' the answer, from the principal. 'We can make them a Crime Unit,' she keeps adding, open on the roll.

'Well, that will certainly prevent people from the common labels of acting with the poor,' Blandman says. <br /> <br /> 'Then locked, we just need a name,' the great prince declares. 'We can call it Sexual Disease?' <br /> <br /> 'In fact, how about Killer Instinct? it causes violence, but it seems a little like the Primary Foundation that had many sexual partners. ' 'Puufect', great key responses and then all clap back and go and delete Capacity Development.
