Recently, I have been studying very much and expecting this film so much that I was about to see. In fact, after seeing it today, rating 5.8 is quite understandable. I think that if you expect a very big thing that needs to be in great need, it seems unlikely. Certainly, Mountains have eyes 2 have their time. It has a very cool and highly developed story that combines well with the actual product itself, but the whole thing is so defensive that it is difficult to follow. And if it wasn't for the production of Wes Craven on this film, it was nothing to do with the original remake. But the whole thing makes you go "Is this supposed to be awesome or COMEDY?" because there is a lot of ignorance, when flying randomly with pieces of stupid (IE "There's a hand in sh ** er!" or "You cloud ** er! I will kill you all the children of gold b **!") and acting (God did not remind him even how bad it was. <br /> <br /> STORYLINE: (this part has heroes, beware!) Movie begins with a baby born baby mutant (ooh la la!), and then the screen becomes black and head We are going to this office where there is a mannequins of war-random wars. We see that this is for one scientist holding a song of people who want mutants. The tracking tracking box has gone, and everyone dies! After opening the voice, you would like to expect more. <br /> <br /> Then, we are going to one team of military training in Baghdad. For the captain he calls "good work for folly", their last day of training is New Mexico, The desert where the last family was aligned beca their use they were arrested. During training, things may eventually get worse, people die, and ... do I need to tell you again? Because right now I just have the gold precaution to force me to stay here and write this kind. What is wrong with TH2 is that it is not suitable to work. There are no restrictions here, and the end is pretty safe ... but to lose! Fool, yes. I am absolutely sure the Ultra Super Director and the Hologie cover and the Ticket of the Eyes 3 eyes will show all its end, but for now, I don't know if I care. So in all ways, if you loved the first THESE is almost sin is not seeing this, then by all means, see. But like others, then, Avoid at all costs. It is for your own benefit. <br /> <br /> 3/10
