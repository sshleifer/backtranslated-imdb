I can't believe I lost my money to rent this movie. I thought it was a flick of the video when it started and it has never been getting better. Acting, music stops the actors. Horror. Save your money! You have to read the film all the way through b c they knew music would exceed the lines of speaking. I've never had a part about slaughter or need to continue to show the cow and pig. What was that with the BTK killer? I understand why there were no prominent actors in this film. The script would have opened me in the first reading page. You would be better off looking for a dry color.
