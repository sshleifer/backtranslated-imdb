I was so surprised how bad this film was. Nice Posted by beautiful theme you can just take a movie so far. I was hoping to rerun the Hero, but this is a lot, worse. <br /> <br /> This movie is why kung fu movies got a bad reputation in the first place. There are no trusted characters (even in the cartoonish world of kung fu movies, these characters are concerned), almost no plot, and the story of ignorance decreases. <br /> <br /> This game is exciting and so sad because it reminds you to try to play make the game believe with the child. Every time you think your silly war makes sense, it prevents some useless misunderstanding ("Ah ha, you just think you have given me your super powers and 10,000 guns, but I used my own plutonium and teflon gums, so your guns don't work and I can't with great power of your high power ... pipe pipe is no importation of one PLUS one. ") Children can continue this season, because they don't care if anyone listens to it being having fun time. However, for the viewer, especially the adult viewer, this long film is worse than bad gases. Watch out for kung fu filters, (a) if you have a knife in the back hurts unless you are on a PCP, then your kung fu case is not strong, (b) going back to your back , which has a knife in it, will hurt more and make more damage, unless it is a fake wind, (c) blows to the heart and knife, dies, especially in ancient China where no Kaiser Permanente near the corner, (d) the fight fu does not live for an hour when 3 feet of snow fall, and (e) sometimes it's worth while explaining your characters and their motivations. <br /> <br /> in any event, go look at Hero again, because at least within his own little world is understandable.
