To quote the film, "It's good not to know, better to forget. Better to be left." Oh, irony. <br /> <br /> The story of the spirit and all the technical improvements of the Hollywood film, but the horrible chat after the first quarter of the film, and you feel like you are being preached from the beginning. It looks like a text-based dialogue can be incorporated by bad TV text and Jerry Springer's show. Put, perhaps, for a film like Hitcher, not a terrible movie of Russia. The result is that a good environment and some of the events that occur from events can be lost and not just a threat, not a horrible or meaningful.
