Oh if only I can give this garbage under one star! There were two interesting parts gently in the whole film and that's it! one there was a line or two from the song Don't worry, Be glad you sang and slugs and the other is where Roddy fell into the toilet tool and came to his feet and feet away so that everything else was walking on to go down to defeat him in the groin. That was something worse than that, at least not to me! Doctornappy2 is not right to say "Shrek fans" of the horrible can enjoy, but the "Wallace & Gromit" fans may turn to hate. 'If I loved Shrek 1 2 and 3 and I also love Wallace and Gromit. You see what explodes is that if animation takes place very well then it is important to watch, this however was on a far distance to do as well as you can get! Continued errors were too large for the number. Others were told by the creators of this site others were not. I can't tell the rest, but here there are a few to see: When a little girl leaves at the beginning of the film to capture the door of the castle comes down and the hook on the right side looks straight behind the rounds so effectively verifying that Roddy cannot enter and still does only with a rush. When one ruby ​​falls back to Roddy and it comes straight to the air for Rita when all the ship goes forward. In the next area Roddy has seen it again. This is impossible. Seeing as much as the ship continues forward the only place when ruby ​​was removed out of the back of the Roddy shirt only part that would have dropped it into the water not in Roddy's hand. There was one third I wanted to show but now I forgot it. Many, because of the unfavorable word, 'joke' was repeated in one way or another, had no time to connect any kind of characters, characters were holes, inferior and empty, and the whole film stopped you wanting .... want to watch 85 minutes of anything else! Drying paint or grass growing is two very good options!
