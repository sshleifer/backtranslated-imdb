I read all the reviews here after looking at this piece of movies and taking me at least two pages to find out that someone did not think that this unwanted montage is not interesting for 70 years or actually any other era! If this is not a small comedy * comedy * I have seen it do it until it comes. The part of the skits has already been made (and much better) and actions like Monty Python and Woody Allen ... If I were saying that a piece of animation that is approaching 90 seconds is an example of this film you should not yet approach how to lose and walk this minute 75 minutes is. Comedy Festival? It is in a world where the seminar really means semen. Scatological humor? It is in the world where the scat is actually stool. Introduction joke? Just like therefore we mean that this is a book of how not necessarily do a comedy. Vitamins and beds and beaver abnormal. Good ... if you're a pubescent boy and at least one hand free of charge and you have never been Playboy available. Give a break because it was 70s early? No. There was a comedy artwork to return at least ten years before. The only way I can even forgive this film even made is as if it was on gunpoint. Retro? Not possible. Illustration about clowns for false misleading children can be intense in certain circles (and can actually be funny) but it comes out as truly quite sad. What made me 75 minutes? Put faith that they may have saved a really funny skit to the end. I paid 1 film because there was a low score ... and I can only suggest to those who are not worried or sick with coma ... or maybe people suffering from lockjaw ... their jaws will eventually clear out in unbelief.
