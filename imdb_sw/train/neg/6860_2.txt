The more truth the mad people are and there are religious nuts out there. <br /> <br /> The characters don't mean more time more. <br /> <br /> The movie doesn't have a real start, middle or end, and nothing has been very much explained. <br /> <br /> The movie opens with a young man, and the impossible name of Hazel Motes, seems to return from the stint in the army. He is going on a trip to a two-story home that has been very damaged, windows climbing. He goes into the house, goes around and finally writes the notes he leaves there. This place comes free, and we don't learn anything about the house or its history. It is not described exactly who their house is, or where the people have gone, but we are given the feeling of Hazel perhaps has lived there at the same time. Hazel decides to go to town. Why - we don't know. Once we arrive in the city he writes the name and address he saw on the bathroom wall, and may visit this woman, who is a wonderful pitcher of oil. He sees him for a moment and then he can't see him again. If anything else in this film, nothing came and it did not use the purpose. A young man named Enoch, tries to be his friend, but Hazel really does not care, although they continue to cross the path. <Enoch is about things like you can get. One of his character is to go to the zoo and stand in front of the castle where the pit is and talk to them with contempt. We do not know why Henoki does as he does, or why Hazel does as he does, most of the fact Hazel had an overdose of a terrible, religious religion through his grandfather. The future Enoch faces someone who is wearing a gorilla suit, and can get a gorilla suit from him and then move around. <br /> <br /> Hazel, who is seriously injured and seems to be in the limit of the limit limit is a bit of preaching on the street. I felt he tried to isolate himself from the deception of a religion that was hit in it. He has several encounters with his preacher and his daughter, although their interaction does not exactly make sure, and there is no line of conspiracy. Hazel will eventually decline to complete religious enthusiasm and start using it. <br /> <br /> It is a very rare film. It is happy to be unusual but not that it doesn't have anything going. It has a good job, but this film cannot be given either a view or story story. <Br /> <br /> The movie also has characters around the word N frequently without connections to all conversations. <br /> <br /> 2 stars
