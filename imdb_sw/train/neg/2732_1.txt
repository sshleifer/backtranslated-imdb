When 'Deja My vu, my Deja Vu' planned last season, I was happy. Explosive, I thought, is doing something clever and special about the concept of displaying pictures. Instead of retrieving the picture, they look at jokes through self-awareness, and I am very happy. <br /> <br /> I found it unfortunate that I was missing. One subsequent season, they missed what almost all the sitcom do, show show ... and it looks like it was put together with an experienced child experience. Dr Cox's head on the head shows how lazy editors were putting together, because it doesn't appear again until 'My Products' after 4 times later. I can't imagine that wig is a lot of effort when it comes to maintaining a well-built. Who knows why it was planned there, it seemed only to be lazy and out of place, reminding me (in large quantities) of events that took place during the past year. The second three parts connected with the back music are an additional DVD for the day (very) rain, not a part of a major television show.
