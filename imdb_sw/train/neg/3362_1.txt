Haunting is still worse than being affected by special effects of damage and great stripes on screenshots and do not have any redemption features but maybe for movies.You remakes not all bad but remakes directed by Jion Da Bont are obvious. I think the A-List executives (Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta Jones, Owen Wilson) are there to stop us from a triggering program, special effects of ignorance, and a horrible experiment in an audience of concern though this is a movie not tabloid magazine we don't care within us we care about the characters and the two stories this film has been lost.The storyline is like taking a classic novel The Haunting Of House Hill and overcoming four chapters and then using whatever left for the film is so boring and a lot of these have not been explained. it is thin and when acting is good it cares especially about any characters. Lily Taylor gives a bad performance and looks like she is 8 years old when giving her line without mentioning what a scary cry she is.Lily Taylor is not made for a kind of horror at all memo is fools and cheesy, they look like a Casper The Friendly Ghost group and the spirit of Hugh Cain looks like a man dressed like a bad guy of Hallo ween and smoke machine. There is this creature on the roof of one of the rooms that are a huge mouth of purple and even not funny without just a sad sadness. pretty and well designed that is probably the only thing about this movie looks nice but that doesn't save it from brutal everything else.I can honestly feel like I was wasting my time watching The Haunting on TV at no price so I'd be more than $ $ ed if I gave it to see it but by chance it was on the Scream Channel. Usually Haunting is a stimulating remake that tries to harm you for certain harmful effects, an unpleasant trial.
