This is the story of a young woman who was treated and then was betrayed by her lover, who was married after being pregnant; he wronged himself, and all his family, through black magic? which, in desperation, he did not make himself but has another man doing for him. Good ethical production for Flick of fear. But the bland script does not always have to emphasize, the director thinks the material quite naturally, and the last act loses the sympathy of the audience to the victims by giving the direction to the wind. At the same time, character has a great chance to kill the dead, and instead it rises and runs without picking up the gun. Wrong writing? it goes into it! Some of the effects of icky, including the last tasty end of fetus and one person die from having hundreds of live eles come out of his stomach. It is only recommended for genre producers who only need to see every awesome film produced in Asia over the past 15 years.
