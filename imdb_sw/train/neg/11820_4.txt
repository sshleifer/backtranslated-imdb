I saw this on DVD (It is known as the CORRUPT in this format) and blurb on the casing actually emphasized how the character of Harvey Keitel Frank is like he played BAD LIEUTENANT in "This gritty and powerful police force". Something that casing was not mentioned is that this is an old Italian movie. Theo is how old? Well when the music playing music is not suitable for a CD player, it provides a great plastic item, puts it in the form of a spherical hub where a mechanical arm touches anything that causes music to be heard. Do you see my point about this being an old film? The DVD trial did not give this clue was a movie released 20 years ago. That is a good film production, like many Italian films that make it like America. With the exception of Keitel it is very bad though the performance of Johnny Rotten is a wonderful rather awesome, the movie is enhanced by the image and sound quality giving the impression that I watched a pirate copy of the fourth generation (I don't know whether it's under dodgy DVD or if it's bad The very film print and the worst is the score Ennio Morricone`s. It is not possible to make a person who has made an interactive music into CORRUPT is the same as the musician in western Clint Eastwood. <br /> <br /> All of these are compassionate because CORRUPT has time. That is not the most exciting psychological stimulus that has been planned but has held my interest and as Keitel always does in good performance as a nuisance officer of the nutcase. The only film was not compared to its high standards
