Sorry but this is very serious. I have told people about this film and some of the worst acting in it and almost don't believe it. There is nothing wrong with the idea, modern day Japanese soldiers find pulled back to the days of the Busido fighters and their modern weapons are matched for almost everything. When the first soldiers realize the strange thing happens, do everyone else behind the transport need to say "Hey my watch is standing"? Think of similar lines of 15+ times before you say anything else and you have a short film size.
