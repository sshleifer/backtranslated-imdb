Did it mean that a comedy or a big drama? This film begins with a heart-barking flag among three women. Good. It goes into conflict between women when one of them meets someone. Good. There are a few antics among them. Good. But when the plot spreads and eventually becomes black I start to wonder if I have been describing the first part of the movie. It continues in this vein for a long time, tries to return to the heart of the original heart light. But now it is too late. It is difficult to see why these women are still talking to finale. A true lesson (for British filmmakers however) how to make a film. It's hard to see how producers believed that this film would work. And the box office proved to be true, because I couldn't hear this film until this weekend (four years after release).
