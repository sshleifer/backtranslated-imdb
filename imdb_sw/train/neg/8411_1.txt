We looked for something good when we went to see this bomb. It is usually Broadway to play the film. Music is very bad. No one memorable song in the film - hear any hits from this film? You can't because there is nothing. Some of the music numbers go on for so long that I have to go to the bedroom and get the maize pop and it was still going when I arrived! If they were good songs well - but it exploits. The action is slow, the development of odds. Leadership was proposed for his singing but it looked like he shouted every song - it was impossible to stand. This film has no NOT to give anyone but the Broadway executives die hard. This is undoubtedly the most tested movie I have seen throughout my life. The full waist of time and money. There is nothing to remember about this movie except Danny Glover - who was not on the screen enough and whose character was not built up enough. Use the video and you will agree - this movie was expensive, produced, dog hit.
