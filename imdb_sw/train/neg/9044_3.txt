I really wanted to love this film, but much was stolen / borrowed from other jobs - some borrowing is very bad. The New York Times observation showed that their bottles of singles remind them of one purpose in the famous cartoon of Warner Brothers ('Hello my baby, hello darlin', hello ragtime gal ... '). But I encourage anyone to look at the Fox / Blue Sky Robots animation (2005) feature and do not get an incredible reconciliation in: storyline - a young player growing, and one creative organization incorporates all the great discoveries. City of the city - The most common pieces of cameras create a very futuristic city environment. <br /> <br /> ... robots ... - Robot serves in Robinson's house has a very similar structure for those on Robots, and both use a kind of retro-futuristic look. All this seems to be a sharp contrast with an obnoxious quote from Disney at the end, noting that the company has been a permanent teacher who never look back (which is also contrary to their entire list of films in the 90s which was the exhibition A lot of each other, with another small problem with story and ethnicity). Film partners seem unable to let the story tell itself, and instead send out the items and sounds that come from our direction, as though we can't be cautious for anything. The expert is well-created and very interesting, and enjoys watching. A large part of the film appears to be cast-together. Some themes appear as CGI from mid-90s. <br /> <br /> The film really opens for short short Mickey Mouse. At the end of this cartoon, we are reminded that Disney had no great interest in writing good or beautiful stories - they seem to think that just getting something on the big screen is enough evidence of their goodness.
