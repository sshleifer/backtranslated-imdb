This is a good story and it was just the beginning of the balance in the United States. (We continue to work too.) Yet despite this fact, it is still a movie and this is a movie site. I recognize free films have a hard time getting good actors, but wow. One alone is even very good Ossie Davis. But even he could not do with all the actors (including the one who plays with him as a young person) who works very badly. Certainly the script was very closed, but however you should find other dignitaries! I will not recommend this to anyone because it does not work for each type. Read other books about Mason's true story of U.S.S, because it gives men the respect they deserve.
