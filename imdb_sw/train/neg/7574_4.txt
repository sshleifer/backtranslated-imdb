But it has a good idea and a plot that is very interesting. Nevsky acts as a builder of the body and not all that appeals to, in fact, IMO, he is UGLY. (his knowledge has nothing!) Sascha plays very well with Joanna Pacula, but he needed more verses than he was given, his character needed to be developed. There are many ways in men in this story, there is a zero romero, many steps, and also a dumb way. It's very violent. I did it even like the environment, this movie takes you around the world, and that's a bonus. I also loved how it had other things about the mafia in it, not too much or too little, but it was enough that they were considering. The executives needed to be more beautiful ... The main problem I was was that Nevsky was very common, not very much. I think for many boys, Sascha will be enough fire, but for us women who are fans of action, Nevsky does not get. In general, this film was good, I did not like it or did not like it, we see it is another common flick.
