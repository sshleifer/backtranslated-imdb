I saw this film about 5 years ago, and its memory still attracts me to this day. I was fully aware of how dangerous it was to get into it, so I myself have a blame. But as many, I did not believe in stopping all. Being a fan of Sandler, it seemed only that one of his movies could be very bad. I thought it was just the opponents of the Sandler. I can't be more wrong. <br /> <br /> We have here a comedy which does not even 1 second of anything funny. That's exactly true. You would like to think in a comedy of 90 minutes, they would have an obstacle to something even with an exciting off. But no, it's just awesome. It's not "very bad is good", it's just bad. You can't laugh as bad, you can just cry. You are waiting patiently for the joke that you will be able to make, but never comes. <br /> <br /> What! Did you see Gonga's film? Where people watch tape video and die 7 days later? If this film was on the video tape, people would die immediately, by their own hand, and there would be a smile on their face when they realized their bitterness had ceased, and that would be the first smile since they played. <Br /> <br /> You can have a look at just seeing it bad, can't prevent your curiosity. What? Please do not. Believe me, I benefit you. There are 2 types of people in the world, those who think going up is a very bad movie made, and those who have not yet seen.
