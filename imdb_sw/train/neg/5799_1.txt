I lost this film yesterday because of the good-looking and summary art given behind the jacket. After I got into my DVD player I looked again at the jacket and even though I took a barrier from a plastic viewer, I can't read the details of the production notes on the film. This movie has an evil name on the jacket and it can get it by going to the movie Films website to see any connection here on IMD. The impact of the specific effectiveness made on the film was very good ... There, the verse-reading actor spoke. O dear ... read this actress was seen as a jock of high school fights with the sound that his voice managed to change the pitch, and no attempt to go beyond reading lines from the script. At first I thought I had a bad disc from the sound synchronization, then I saw that it was a foreign film since I couldn't read jacket ... English dialog installed. If they beat the right person by posting a discussion, this film would be honorable. I paid 20 minutes before I wiped it when I discovered a bad line reader didn't want to be killed, but be like a regular unit. Yes, it's bad! The cloak cover and art made in the film is good, so it has given one star, but reduces 1,999,999 stars for decay conversation. I don't recommend this!
