'Metamoprisi' is a story of a small lost scientist, honored at the university, brings investigations and financiers to college. This makes him take shortcuts in the usual mobile phone mode. My first thought after this conclusion of the movie was this. "It's not good, but it's not bad, for the early-middle thirty years." Of course, I realized that it was in 1990, which put it close to '4', but decided to put it to '5' 'which is. Metamorphis makes a few times, it looks like a good movie trying to get out. Acting, when not stellar, has more potential. You can even see the regular glisten of normal quality. Pacing is a big problem with the movie. After thinking I had checked for ninety minutes, I realized I would just look at the clock. Specific effects are not stellar, but the director seems to be able to work around the weakness. Leadership, a compassionate man who seems to be trying to connect to Tom Cruise and Christopher Reeves, reminded me of the character of Matt Dillon in 'Meat'. The female heroine does a good job, but does not recognize herself in any way. There is 'the role of the bad girl' here, and the actor does what he can with it, but it doesn't seem like a lot. There is a child actor that the director cannot decide whether he is a happy, wise or wise woman. Pacing, as I said, is the worst problem with this film, until the last battle with the evil man who will make the Power of Power. It is strange and unknown, until the last area that is supposed to be great but full of hilarious, filled with every crafty trick of cameras and mix which can be emphasized in approximately thirty seconds. <br /> <br /> when one of the honors look at 'Mill Creek 50 Chilling Movie Pack'. Nothing will bring you back, and nothing to buy alone.
