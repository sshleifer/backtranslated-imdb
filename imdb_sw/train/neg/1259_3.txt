Thank you Hollywood. Yet another classic movie is completely destroyed by cheap, deep, impact-heavy and redundant. The original "Apes Planet" was an intelligent and stimulating movie with a very clear message. It was a very thought-provoking film, which seems to be lighter but it was really very interesting. This game, on the other hand, seems to have taken away the best conversation. Instead of a good movie we get a wonderful hard two-hour movie. Negotiations have been reduced to a minimum, a partnership of character and development is not available and much time is difficult to find out what's going on. Instead, we find an unforgettable session of time, some of the most interesting pieces and some of the casual conversation. Something worth mentioning about this film is that it looks quite amazing. The success of monkeys is very good, and the sets and nature are also good. However, this does not distract from the fact that the "Planet of the Apes (2001)" is a very very and very simplistic movie, filled with paper-thin letters, stupid dialogue and almost no plot. Please Hollywood, stop damaging good movies by turning them into useless councils. Well, the end didn't make ALL to work. <br /> <br /> * out of the **** star, especially for illustrations /> <br />
