I can't believe that piece of writing and the direction of the film cliche made. There are about four beautiful shots to watch (the director should think about switch still to photograph) and that's yes. Strong casting is completely lost, repeat events are unlocked at a time not recommended and the script does not say anything new. Please install this film.
