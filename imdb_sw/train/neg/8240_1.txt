Don't waste your time looking at this! Unless you want to learn all the wrong things you should do to make a good film. I am not naturally investigating the movie, but this is personal. I lost valuable time that they cannot return. I feel compelled to write this report to warn others not to waste their time looking at this trick. If this was a student project, I'd say not bad, but for the first 15 minutes ... after being irritating. screaming, bad radio, bad video (good camera man could be better). and yes, what is the effect of Blair-Witch? no budget? I was hoping that it was better, but it was not recommended. Now how did hell make it 4? 2 is more right but 1 to waste my time! I said my peace.
