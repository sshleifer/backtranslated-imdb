Considering how much money was planned for this film, you could expect more from the general story. That may be a completely meaningless movie that I have ever seen. There was no real development of anything. Character design, small. Plot development, perhaps. Fun, no. I don't know what factors tried even made. If you want to see a film where terrorists are a good fighter, American CIA bombs everything that does not agree with our opinion, all citizens are corrupt, and you like to see anything similar to the development of stories and death, have. For those who know that it does not help to kill a good person to make sure, we'll be connected to other movies. In summary, this was a horrible attempt at the '11 Ocean' attraction because it is not just you know what is going on, no one has made the film. Home alone 3 was the best piece of movies.
