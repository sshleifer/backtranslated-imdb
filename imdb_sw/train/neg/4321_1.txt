This was the movie of the WORST Christmas I saw. I took my two little children to see this. It was a very black plot, a very bad family, a mother lost her job, a father is killed in a bank, a bank robber stole a family car with two children behind and after being expelled, they drove the bridge and left them in the river. Mother is left alone. It is not surprising that her Christmas partner has gone. The Angels of Christmas do not save children who have tried, and Santa does not return to the dead father! I thought this was the mission of the mission to send children. Better to tell that there is no Santa than to show them a movie like this !!
