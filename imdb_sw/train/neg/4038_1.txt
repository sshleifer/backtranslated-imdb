In order to remain a Shield problem, you would have to write pages and pages, so it's okay to say it's a bad guide. <br /> <br /> "When Directors Go to Awry" they should be the name of this production. In fact, directors should do their work in the sense of a visual and story story. <br /> <br /> What! Always shake the camera and play with the "zoom" lens? What is the propelling story before? Of course there is also a "random editing number" regardless. It seems to be just hip cutting randomly. <br /> <br /> I think it's a great job to make a good editing. That is, it has made it a lot of work for many people to look at the Shield which has fallen as one of the most and most unknown of all time.
