An unmarried woman named Stella (Bette Midler) becomes pregnant with a rich man (Stephen Collins). He gives him a sense of duty but he brings him back to the flat and decides to raise the child alone. Things go well until a child named Jenny (Trini Alvarado) will be a teenager and things gradually (and predictably) get worse. <br /> <br /> I have seen the silent version of "Stella Dallas". No one was seriously affected (and I cry easily) but they had done well as a date. Trying to fix this in 1990 was just a stupid idea. I think Midler was able to adequately after the unsuccessful success of "Beaches" to get this. This (predictably) bomb. Stories are interesting and installed with today's standards. Even though Midler and Alvarado offer the most beautiful films this film is very simple and I was inspired by ignorance to the end. Stephen Collins and Marsha Mason (good actors) have no support in supporting roles. Flimsy and quicker. True - who thought this would work? See the 1937 version of Stanwyck instead. I give this 1.
