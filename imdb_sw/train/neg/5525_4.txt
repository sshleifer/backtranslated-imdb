The problem with the family drama is that, outside the television series on the way like Lifetime, many people don't want to look at them. And those who look at have a sense of the current or higher problems or issues in the news (or recent news). Movies that describe or explore humanity is not popular. Particularly a youth group that will be the foundation of Miss Lohan's fan or a group of young people who are more likely to make less-known movies but financial success for the studio. The specific problems I have with this film are the cartoonishness of some features. It was too little to complain of all Lohan's behavior to carry out (loss of car, drug abuse, etc.) on what his father had done. When it is not possible, it's just a little anticipated to swallow listeners. Additionally, other features, such as giving a young Morman boy, oral sex, or that he could be a good helper for vet, who happens hard to have something for his mother, etc.. certainly help this movie together. It put more in the comedy feature to try one of their “incredible great events” then made for full fully, well written film feature. <br /> <br /> When watching DVD and listening to commentary, especially for other alternate breaks, you can see all this is a sharp view.
