If you want to watch a good film about how women can fight back against sexual violence, then this film is not the film you want to watch. It was a social definition of a woman who had been attacked and fought back. Spoiler: Rosario Dawson returns the table on his advocate. Instead of using a criminal justice system, the victim has a chance to use caution. He actually prevents the judicial system. The film "The defendant" was the most beautiful film because the victim uses the judicial system and success. What do the "deficits" are to tell victims of the attack that they should use violence? What is the best victim that the defendant? No !!!
