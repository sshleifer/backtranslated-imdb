Entering within three hours and a minute and twenty minutes, "Salaam-e-Ishq" is a very good but high opera opera from India that manages six stories of romantic love (which is at least four myths in my account) ) The video as a cross between MTV music and the Super Bowl beer, movie is a foreign mishmash arrangement, colorful colors, sexy, high-stepping song-and-dance numbers, dream and fantasy, negotiating winking asides, corny talks and high-way displays - all the best things according to sound events these days. It is only a stimulating task to try to keep all the same characters as they play, preparing and introducing their way through an unreasonable story. There is a lot for the viewer to want his eyes here - not under all the dead women who are dirty - but he will need Job's patience to take him all the way.
