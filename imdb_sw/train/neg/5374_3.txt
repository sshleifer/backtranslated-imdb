The CRIMSON River is one of the most advanced, top-up, over everything I saw come from France. There is nothing worse than the French production trying to outdoor films made on Hollywood and CR is a perfect example of the wannabe / act / buddy. I was about to stop half way because I knew it was nothing but French boys trying to show. <br /> <br /> The movie begins off faithfully, like a horrible movie type, but quickly converts a variety, from fear to action for a file type x to buddy flick, that at the end, CR is all and none of them. It's so full of clich√©s that one time I thought anything was comedy. The pain and the silence of the fly, and the exhausting out and spreading only the right during the fair exhibition, opened me. I thought only the films made on Hollywood used this hackneyed technique. <br /> <br /> Conditions of expulsion, with Vincent Cassel running after the killer, is dominated by more and more that is almost a matter of beauty. The period on the mountain, with the stupid revelation about the murderer (s) and Cassel and Reno playing "friends" as Nolte and Murphy in 48 HRS, completely destroyed the trust of the film at the time. It is difficult to believe that the director of RIVER CRIMSON also described GOTHIKA, which though it had its part of the problem, does not even come close to the filmed, cracked film.
