Second Renaissance, part 1 let's show how the first machines were against humanity. It all starts with one case, which machines claim to have the right to live too, while human robot is something that they themselves and therefore can do anything they want. Though interesting background, the story gets silly since then and for (violence!) The protests between robots and humans. Somehow it does not seem to be the same, as another commentator says, it's very little clever. <br /> <br /> Animation stories that sit next to the matrix function (especially Osiris) for better works. As for the second part of Renaissance, I would like to say that it is very violent and is also quiet. 4/10.
