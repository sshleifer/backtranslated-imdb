The movie was shown here in Bangkok with all the fanfare and even in the theater, failed miserably. It seems that the storyteller does not have water. Something was missing. In my opinion people should have a reason why they look for it rather than historical history. The accuracy of history is not just what we expect in entertainment. The only movie requires any substances. The only way to do this was the right to the film was somehow making a change where it stands as a kind of story rather than just a story. And the story will have some things that try to tell you something that people have forgotten in time, such as the meaning of sacrifice, nationality, etc.. It's called the middle head. <br /> <br /> The movie fails to answer, why will I look again? Some strange story of Flying Elephant stories, a psychic king, or an intellectual king such as "King and I" would be good, something else added to the appeal of the movie. I think there was no appeal except the movie of vanilla. After receiving an appeal, then the story is another thing that we consider. In the marketing terms, we call it "must ion". After hearing the name of the film people will be able to say, Oh, I must see. Now where to appeal to Kingmaker? Why not just redo title and call it, "How not to be King?" and make the black comedy ancient Siamese, in the style of "Dr Strangelove". That would be more interesting. The experience of the stories of the King's injustice from the first people who were doing would make the movie very interesting. The most popular movies today have "appeals" of appearing, such as Spiderman, Men X, these names mean themselves. If they do not have regular characters, other movies such as, The Island, were appealing when the ads were asking "Do you still believe there is a Island?". Or for the film, it said "AS that the King" can ask a question, "Do you still want to be King?" Parhat
