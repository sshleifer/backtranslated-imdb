What a bad show. Fiction fans of Fiction seem to look no longer regardless of quality. It is interesting that something unique like Firefly takes one season, while the trash as a remake of Battlestar Galactica is easy. This faces sympathy in every aspect of the show. Acting is young and not available. The characters are a clich√©s of everything that has ever been in the worst of Sci-Fi. Stories are bad. Talk is worse than opera during opera soap. The direction is shoddy and sets are bad. Caprica is losing film, wasting time and losing effort. This is one stop that has never been made.
