This movie is a very poor attempt to make money using common themes. I loved Superman movies, but this made me shoot myself. A very serious act, a special impact of preference, and a plot similar to zero. In summary: Superman leaves in the world, because scientists discovered the pieces of his home planet, others were in place (duh), they don't tell his girlfriend anything before they leave (duh again), takes on a line (?!?), Coming back I think 5 years later, and I hope to talk again with his partner again (who now hates his son, this son, in my opinion of humility is at least 7 years old). And what about Luthor's Lex? Try to grow the whole continent to sell the land? Please! I vote 1 out of 10 for this movie, because I am not allowed to vote 0. If you have anything to do with your time, don't go to this movie, and even if you don't have anything else to do, stay home and watch TV!
