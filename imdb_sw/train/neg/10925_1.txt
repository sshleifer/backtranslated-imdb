I am at this very moment discussing whether I should even finish watching this "poppycock" movie. They had a very interesting idea, and put a buried film, and that was. So far this incomprehensible mess has no real story. There is a set of burial, wolves dominated by a monster run amok, tasty, and a group of evil actors attacked by a masked wolf whatever it is. I had missed, I would have a good sense of avoiding this evil run by dune buggy, some C.G.I. The worst, the most bizarre dialogue, the worst C.G.I, and the fight of the hero's war is cut. More than the original idea, this film has a zero-free features. My error to continue watching. - MERK
