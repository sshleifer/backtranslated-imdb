The foywonder review of this cheap STV strikes the nail square on the head. Be sure to read it. If you do not, a group of scientists move into the deep forests of the north-western Pacific, in order to erase near the skeletons of animals in the cemetery. The Big Foot Family is not recommended for this sympathy, and continues to take the team directly, largely on the mirror. The Big Foot himself has a special face of face, but it is less awesome than Harry from HARRY AND HENDERSONS. Most of the films are made of wood, volunteer actors pretend to be scientifically perverted around trees and offshore. This is a non-budget movie that happens very little, at least on the screen. We look at the sexiest look of women swimming when one of her male companions look, but nothing comes from this.
