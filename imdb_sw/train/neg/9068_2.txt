Selected for oscar "very bad script" in my opinion. There is no good news, acting honestly, very good humor. In all possible ways, if you have personal dignity please do not waste your time with this film. Although you can see actors can act, it leaves you dumber after watching it. Braincells of value are killed to watch this trick ... <br /> <br /> I warned you the wind MOVIE
