This movie was delightful! Yes, there is a short time for fun and joke, but you can't start the whole movie on that! The characters are also a few, no real stories - but short periods with long characters, who are not enough to make a real plot. Shame, because most of the actors are accepted in Hungary, the secret to what they did. This is not a * new hope for Hungarian film. It was boring, though it meant to be true or unique. They could try more than this ... 2 out of 10
