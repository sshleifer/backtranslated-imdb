"Valentine" is another movie of fear to add to the falsehood and movie list (think "Halloween", "Friday 13", "Dial" and "I Know What You Did Last Summer"). It is certainly not the same as the movies I have described, but it is better than the ripoffs that came after the "Friday" of the 13th film. "Valentine" is the most beautiful film than that, but not to say a lot. Plan: A young nerdy boy is rejected and healed by his classmates at the beginning of the film. Then the film moves years later when all school pupils have grown, then they are taken to each other. The murderer is thought to be a young man now grown to seek revenge. But is he? Or could it be someone else? "Valentine" has an impressive casting including Denise Richards, David Boreanaz, Marley Shelton, Jessica Capshaw, and Katherine Heigl. They do what they can and the material they have, but the script of injustice does not do any justice. There is a terrible time, however. <br /> <br /> ** (out of four)
