First, chief executives should need money ... The surgical exhibition was interesting .... and indeed they should know that people with limited medical knowledge will be able to find this very amazing ...... Anesthesiologists do not leave the room during heart transplant .... do not make surgery in a small room without apparatus, lung heart lungs and reproductive techniques ... in the just ... it cannot focus on the line of story because of all stupid surgery events ... no The blood, no staff and then the bra hero come up and take ... not the film of adults who think .... Also the budget must be reduced ... the road events were the same but who is the technical consultant ... It looks like The total idiot .. Save your money and wait until it comes out of the DVD and do not rent it.
