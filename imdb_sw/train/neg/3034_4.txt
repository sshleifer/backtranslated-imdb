This film has many adult star killings but it is not good to attract you through adult film. Among all stars you can't find your kicks from each screen. The movie is shot in a dream as a central medium set which is a cheesy embarrassment. Acting is worse than Keanu Reeves, sex events are exciting as listening to your neighbor's discussion on their child in college, and the discussion is the worst I've seen in the movie. The plan was also worse for ten times. I would like to connected to an amateur way. The meaning of the sound was not useful because it is skin skin but even that was also bad. Except your hero Jenna Jameson fan there is a little here. 4/10
