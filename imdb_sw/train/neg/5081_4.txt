Is there one positive for this film? Critics who knew nothing about video games can see gaming errors made. There is no damage done by the apparent destruction in the beginning to be the basic model. And I might have missed something, but it's not Super Mario Bros 3 let's say that the game has never been played before? Well, if so, and I did not have anything ... the attitude of Fred Savage, and even a girl, to know a lot about the game already? We say things that others don't know about their second or third game. More than true and guessing errors there is a low quality of film itself. Nothing here is very precisely memorable. The child was not even good when playing video games in the picture shown. Most of the kids I knew back in those days had more knowledge. On all of these acting and stories are simply easily in their power points. The characters are bland and they do not totally agree, 'Pastor' (the youngest child) is very quiet, the very young child of the little child who can never talk because of trouble. It is not that this is untrue, it is a fact that it had to be healed on the movie in fact even starting to plan a plot that will multiply even 30 minutes. If you grew up with this movie you would like it if it was good or not. It was about children playing video games, and when you saw it it was likely to be a fight with NES as well. But unless you like a child there is not just anything going to keep you interested, and very little that will keep you from preventing it. <br /> <br /> No master, I did not like you.
