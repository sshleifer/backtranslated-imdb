I think the rounds of clapping are so that anyone emerged along the trailer for the latest release for Rogue Pictures, 'The Return'. I myself, with everyone else we are separated to believe is really a terrible film. Conversely, though, it is really amazing odd. It's not bad not a little exciting thing. 'Return to the Stars' Sarah Michelle Gellar as Joanna Mills, a young woman who has had personal problems since the age of eleven. It was at that age that he began to have a good vision showing the murder of a woman he had never met. While in Texas on business trips, he is guided by this vision to the city of a woman killed, La Salle. There he comes face to face with someone who is often seen in his vision. One named Terry Stahl, who plays with Peter O'Brien. Joanna is now searching for desperate answers. The search you may ultimately lead to its own murder. I don't know where to start here people. How should I first mention? Acting anger, secret leadership, or bad story? Nothing that I choose my word behind each other is the same: they just absorb. Screenplay of Adam Sussman is a good position. Its not interesting. Its not forcing. It's very clear. I continued to wait for something to fly "film" (I have put a quotation close to the film because I don't believe 'The Return' should be called a real film because of evil.) And at least give them a little chance of hope, but nothing happened. I was left out in the freezing frost free. Even the stellar displays from the actors themselves could save this disaster. Of course you probably knew this read the script then accept to do "film". I think this is why the act was so bad. At least that's what I choose to believe. I believe that the cast does not take pride in their exhibitions. They need immediate treatment if they do. Now leadership was bad, but I can't completely crucify Asif Kapadia. (I could, but I haven't since I am a very good person.) I look 'The Return' as a test for Kapadia because all of you who do not know, this is his full length of the full film feature. ”He only gets his foot at the door and still learning Sometimes around, well if there is a future, hope will have a much better improvement. The only thing he could accomplish here was almost the visual form of the Marcus Nispel's 2003 'Revolution of the Chainsaw of Texas'. "The film" was released that, but unfortunately still no receive from me for it. To imitate someone else's work is not something that I think is an appropriate character. (Even if it was from a film I was very excited.) > I think Jim Sonzero of America again making 'Pulse' now should tok on the name of Worst Film of the Year 'Return'. It is more than a question that deserves that name for almost every way considered. has, benefits. It does not matter though, it cannot extend or even resemble the success of the previous Gellar efforts, 'The Grudge'. For this information, there is one last thing I would like to add. I can honestly say that I have never been embarrassed to leave a reminder hotel to see 'The Return'. That's something I don't want to ever get again, with the "film" itself.
