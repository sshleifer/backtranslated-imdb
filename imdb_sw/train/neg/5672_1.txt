I am ashamed to have this film in my collection. The reason for the most liberation of owning DVD is a short film in bonus elements. Voting me for this movie is a great ZERO of oil. Don't understand, I am a terrible girl. but I want some meat behind the story, not to mention the evils of humanity, not to be perverted in the watch, which was seen as ever, parts of animal breeding. Violence acts in silence and bad work. If I had to compare with another film, the only one that comes to mind is the Hakocaust of Cannibal. Bad, boring, insignificant and look totally uncomfortable.
