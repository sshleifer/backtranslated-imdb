The cluster hated me, but it was clear about 30 seconds since this was either David Lynch or something big. Interesting look just run through the basic laundry list. I can be a pastor with a spiritual spiritual piece (Romero comes to mind), but there is nothing spiritual about this. The message seems to be that we must make it between 80 (or just get a lobotomy - Jennifer what happened to?) And follow the Bible without any kind of inquiry or we'll cause a second coming. It is a kind of perspective that makes people jets jets into 110 story stories (I work around the corner from the old WTC website). I like to think that God is greater than that.
