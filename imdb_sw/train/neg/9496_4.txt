Playing a romantic led by Clint Eastwood about the love of the growing love between the beautiful hippie (Kay Lenz) and the real estate agent in Los Angeles in its golden years (William Holden, amazingly easily within this well known system). Script is a bit but not without passages to consider; yet, the situation is a picture of the present now that many images come out as puerile. It may have a better job with different headings: Holden and Lenz don't get well (its link is very few seem to be a tower on it), making their events almost more exciting than just worrying. Done, romantic, and memorable. ** from ****
