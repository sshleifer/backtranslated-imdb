O, come on people giving this film break. One thing I liked about it is ......... Sorry, I still think. Oh yes !!!! When John Wayne came and killed the bad people. Ooo, sorry, inappropriate film, I was thinking about the best film. Let me see now, I'm still trying to protect it. Oh, the chick from Clueless was in it. Do not keep Stacy Dash. I mean, we all make mistakes. But the boy, Stacy, you've done dooooosie. This, one thing that has never been done in the west, even a female, gave the woman from the tree. That may be the first western. Although his neck had been broken and he survived the problem, yet, you should give the director the attempt to try a western attempt. Also, I have never seen a woman done from a horse in any west, although that didn't happen in this film, I thought I would give you another idea of ​​the Gang Of Roses # 2, which should be done after Ed Wood's The Bride Of The Monster # 2. this. Life, especially with all African women giving out a eastern cowgirl. Heeey, if the creators of the Gang Of Roses want to make a series of this mess, you can have a slang such as, "Hey, don't put it on home children" and "talk with hand, child, talk with hand." You can also have a deputy of a kind of surfer type of dude which says things like, "That gunfight was quite a RAD man, completely." You know things like that.
