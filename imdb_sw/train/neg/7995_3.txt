I remember watching this film when I was young, but I did not remember her head and then going through the horrible movies I find and I think myself “yes”? This movie is a kind of film tragedy / attack of insects and a few stars known in it. It is also boring too, for it has a television vibe where you can see the erase movie for advertising and such. The program has this kind of rest being invaded by ants. I think they were frustrated with construction or something going on around, but don't read about it. The most memorable war for me in the whole flick was the first to involve a child who falls into the swimming pool after having waves and of course Summers attack the area too. What else is seen in this is the end of the end that the survivors use to breathe. In the end though as many movies on this movie the movie is very tame and not scary for much less unless you fear in front of ants.
