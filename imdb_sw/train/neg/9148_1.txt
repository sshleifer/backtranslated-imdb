I was looking over Imdbs down 100 because I thought id never seen anything as bad as the program 9 out of the outside or Roller Ball remake, I was missing. Ben and Arthur have beaten both. This is from a number of movies that I have seen is the number of bad films than I have seen. Bad Direction, Bad Habits, Scary, Horror Stories There is no one but Sam will say anything positive about this film. Sam was a terrible terrible actor but his leadership was too bad to destroy Ed Wood. The director should embarrass his work unfortunately I must give at least 1 star but it is worth it - to be a starred star.
