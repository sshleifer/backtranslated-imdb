I am Puerto Rican and this is one of the worst documents I have ever seen. You can see that people on it are clueless. They don't have much about Puerto Rico and its culture. They say that Puerto Rican because they are from the descendants of Puerto Rican, but maybe they know less than others who do not come from there. You can see when they talk about that they are against themselves. If you would like to see real, and I mean a real document from Puerto Rico, then you must see "Puerto Rico". That's a great memory, real. Not like this piece of junk. Rosie Perez based on this basis on himself. I thought I thought I was about Puerto Rico. They continue to repeat I did not know. Well, that's about the only thing that is right on this so-called document. I hate to see that piece of rubbish made in the name of the Island. It brings rates.
