Phantasm .... Risk. Phantasm II ..... amazing. Phantasm III .............. ... awesome. Even though I would like to cling to this film, I can't really. The movie seems to be "sold out". The first bad sign comes when the video has other film tracks at the beginning (something others did not do). Also many useless characters, good examples of a kid (who is a shot of crack, funny original but soon want to die), a woman who uses karate to fight the balls (erm does not work, or maybe should not) and breeding zombies (what hell they do there , there is no link to them in other Phatasms). There is also a severe lack of surrounding circles. <br /> <br /> Just fine bits are starting to open and, of course, Reggie B. <br /> (Probably SPOILER comes) <br /> <br /> To me this film looks like filling in II and IV as additional characters only leave at the end to proceed to the main 4 in IV. <br /> <br /> Overall, VERY disappointing. 3/10
