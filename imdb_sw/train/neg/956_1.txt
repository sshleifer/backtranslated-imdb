It is interesting that this film is in one of my songs after all. It is the number 1 bad number I saw. I have never been bored before (by chance not more than 1,5 hours), a boy's pre-humorous experiment is not close to getting but one of my horn's little mouth. After the first part of awkward very much, you expect to hope that other parts will be at least a little more. You expect free, just come down from there. <br /> <br /> Movie does not have a good story to say everything and repeat this is not three stories. One can only hope that by some miracle all the remaining copies of this movie have disappeared forever and Trent Harris no longer reaches hands on the camera again ...
