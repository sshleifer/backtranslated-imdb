I think this is experiencing ice, because it has dropped a cube, and give us a lot of information about who and why. The original CUBE did not leave the cube, and left everything to your attention. This fest fuse however, gives you all. and I didn't like it ... Although acting is stable, I think this was a decline because it had been made by other people than ORIGINAL film writers, if they had Vincenzo Natali to do this prequel, or even sequel I think it would do well and it would be more real for source. therefore I recommend staying away, away from this, and HYPERCUBE, another movie I even want to discuss ... (I gave 2 to just do)
