Every year I look at hundreds of films, including the most disgusting under-budget of a straightforward budget that no one has good sense to see. I have seen thousands of films during my time, many of them, many of them forget. The Nation of Zombie Will I ever remember as one of the most awesome films I've ever seen? in fact I have never been from the experience of looking at it. The next day, looks like some kind of fantastic dream. Did I see what I thought I saw? Why does the police work outside the warehouse? Do the voodoo priests strongly recommend that 'zombies' eat cheeseburgers? Is it safe? Is it safe? Is it safe? I can't recommend the Nation of Zombie if you want to see a 'good' film, nor do I recommend as 'bad' good. However, if you are welcomed by the prospect of looking at the most popular movie? this is for you. Now, everyone asks me what the worst movie I saw was, I will say the National Zombie. I think it is the most serious crime to make the film more aggressive than the bad, and Ulli Lommel deserves a loan for producing a film that really hits you for weakness. He is actually Ed Wood Jr. The digital age, and I for someone can not wait to see if she makes another film like regularity of ignorance like this.
