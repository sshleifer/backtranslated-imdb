Its first time after the death of long-term friends of John Belushi, Aykroyd shows a lot of fatigue trying to pull a habit that would not be for Belushi. Instead, "Doctor Detroit" gives us a professor of the book Aykroyd pretending to be a surprise, powerful violence to prevent a rival named Mama. That is very bad, but it also has teaching classes, dinner to attend, four women in the evening to protect with Pimp Food (or something like that) to attend. It is not surprising that Aykroyd seems to have been sent for a long time. Why should the viewer be alone? It was on this film that Aykroyd met with future wife Donna Dixon. At least some good came out of this chaos. <br /> <br /> One and a half stars. You want good Aykroyd, see "Brothers Blues". You want bad, see "Doctor Detroit".
