Interesting? Not possible. The 'scientific proof' movie provides its own point (which is the basis that the Jews are cancer) is ignorant and crippled, it is almost laughable (if we did not know what happened at that time)? And. I can't imagine the Germans (even at that terrible moment) they would like or believe this movie. Compare the Trieff des Willens of Riefenstahl. Now I was a movie I was attracted to. This is just rubbish. The 'Best' section is the area of ​​M (one of all my favorites) where (jew, if the advertiser keeps reminding us) Lorre has a child-molester and a murderer. With the eyes of the creators of these films, the only sensible cause can do so. Uh-huh. Didn't know M was a famous movie of Hitler, right? It is just, it's just a STUPID open. Even with a variety of thick-propaganda. 2/10.
