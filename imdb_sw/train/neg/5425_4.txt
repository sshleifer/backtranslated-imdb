I had Mirror Mirror especially because Yvonne De Carlo was in it (I thought she was the greatest in the Gothic US) but sadly did not play a very big role in this film. It takes OK and the speed goes along well ... but the end begins to get a bit and pleasant. That is not to say that this is a boring film, but it is very moderate and there is nothing surprising. I did not like the "posession" and did not have a good year. With the 'main' story was very controversial and the endless meaning. I did so even though the story surrounding the Gothic girl and how she had taken revenge on her torturers. I don't recommend exactly Mirror Mirror for fans of fear - not something to strengthen yourself.
