I often enjoy the early films of Loretta Young: she was light and bright, and she knew how to wear clothes. But this is just a stop from the word to go except to turn funny help with Glenda Farrell. The boy is a girl who talks to her husband (Paul Lukas) to be a champion player. It's not more movies than games, and a long part of the conversation in which their marriage falls off just about killing the film. <br /> <br /> There is one interesting little though. As Lukas and Ferdinand Gottschalk start their bright game, a series of quick shots shows the flight, train, football games, even running in the middle of the air, freezing in anticipation of the event. It is the first use of the free photo frame that I saw in the American film. All others want is that invention-and funny.
