I saw the movie last night and I wanted to love it. My expectations for the film were going on and dropping since I heard it was being done. A couple of days I would like to see something interesting and of several days I'd like to be disappointed. But that kind of fan me, I had a great hope for this film but last I was desperate. I loved Richard Donner's movie I did not like their original nature or the changes it made to Superman's character and strength. Even though they decided to take the worst of Donner movies and put them in its version. <br /> <br /> When his Lex's Luthor is a little black still has nothing more than shyster, conman and common mistakes. He doesn't have more intelligence than when Gene Hackman played with him. Kevin Spacey does what he can to play Luthor well but ultimately he falls victim to write bad and unremarkable dialog. <br /> <br /> its killers are more than two sides even comic book killers. Many of them have no discussion in the movie. SPAILERS AHEAD **** Kitty Kowalski is almost a character similar to Mrs Tesmacher. He seems to be as rough and cold as Lex Luthor but he proves to be just underling who melts after seeing Superman in trouble and quite predictably deserving Luthor. <br /> <br /> The great desire in the movie was Frank Langella as Perry White. I wasn't a big fan of Perry White in Donner movies but at least he had a spirit. He was after all to say and done, an old writer who cared about the truth and good news. Perry White's Langella is not just something but corporate company. He wants everyone to look at stories related to Superman because it produces paper even if every other paper does the same thing. He doesn't care about the real news, real acts like out black and what Lex Luthor is on now he's out of prison. The worst thing about Langella is that she quicker! Some pastors may be calm and prudent and still have less underneath that lets you know that water still runs deep. Frank Langella is fashionable. Brandon Routh is not a bad act. He is the same but again no memorable line on the entire movie. It's not an actor's fault. Its movements are clearly visible to attract, such as even a little movement of fingers causes a way out. But it still looks choreographed and fake. <br /> <br /> Lois Lane when the worst written was awesome well made by Kate Bosworth. Unfortunately, again, to win the Prize Pulitzer journalist and author, he is on as eloquent as any young in Dawson's Creek <br /> <br /> James Marsden was a favorite actor in the entire movie, especially because she looks more like. Superman even than Routh. Without any older managers to think the message Lois Lane's, flies aircraft in place, gets on the board boarding board and save Lois and his son. <br /> <br /> just moving while in the film is when they are all pulled as much as it is flooding with water and sinking ships. You see them slowly getting into the water. You know Superman will come at the end of the rescue but you still can't help but treat them compassionately. It's just as I said before the plot is not very good. Unlike Singer said, this is not a film about returning to the superhero and trying to find its place in the world. Once the world returns it is welcomed with open arms. Lois is the only one who is not happy to see him again. Even Luthor is happy to have Superman back because it gives him the opportunity to solve a score with a metal man. Superman is shown to be perhaps the most amazing heroes in the world. A large piece of meteorite was stolen from the museum, Lex Luthor outside the prison, now he has knowledge of Superman's strength and weakness, and still cannot connect enough dots to know Luthor would use kryptonite against it. <br /> <br /> According to the film's only thing Superman is good to lift real, very powerful things. The process of all steps is very strange.
