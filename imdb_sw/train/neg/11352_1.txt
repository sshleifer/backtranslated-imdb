this is what you can get if you allow a 10-year-old (American manic) to write a story of a month trip. Absolute waste without the features of liberation Perhaps it was held a fascination in 3D dept. but if the animation of the story and entertainment did not do anything to lose the value of an hour and a half time. Save your time and money and look at BOLT instead of <br /> <br /> Dial. It is not enough lines, but I feel that it sends them ... well, I agree with the above audit - this is like the story of the propaganda of the winter war. Perhaps it would have been more interesting if they would have made it on the flies that hits the landing on the moon, or if the rivers had died in the first minute. BTW - why all the main character is getting worse? - not one who had full conscience of feet!
