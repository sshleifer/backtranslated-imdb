I can find very little to say about this film. I am sure the idea and the script have been shown well on the paper but the film and acting I am afraid is not the standards they expect from very talented people. I would like to doubt that this is very relevant in their Filmography. Michael Caine appeared on a regular basis in his role as Doctor, and at any time I really believed in his behavior. The program was not particularly focused on the victims of the child. Some events reminded them of another film, which I once wondered if it was a fun spoof. The lamp was always dark and this was added to the view of a small movie budget and many stars mentioned, wondering why I was having trouble looking at it.
