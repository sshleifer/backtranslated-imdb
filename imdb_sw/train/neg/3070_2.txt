Oh, my master .... They have turned a movie that has stimulated ideas into the joy of the testosterone. The previous 1971 version of this movie was very clear about our hero Kowalski. He was trying to drive from Denver to San Fransisco to win a bet. Why was he willing to risk his life at a few prices? We are not sure. We had the little ones that gave us a picture that was a junkie of adrenaline, and perhaps had led her all her life trying to make it sure. The move looks far away where the left and right shoulders of the road come together, and the road itself disappears. He lives only to be free, and says no one is sick. We saw several times when there was an accident that he had completed to make sure the other driver was right before moving, even the fighters who were driving him off. When she saw the shortage of her efforts she took her life instead of being arrested and living a life of imprisonment. He died as he lived, blazing. In Kowalski remake has a whole history (including the first name, even.) He tries to get to a hospital where his wife has problems due to her pregnancy problems. She is a dedicated husband, and excited father tempting. He comes to the decision to take his life after hearing his wife's death at the time of delivery, but even leaving the question when they suggest that he can fly out of the car before running on tablets. They paid even a part of the “great spirit,” DJ who was blind (clearly shown by Little Clevon in the original) for JASON PRIESTLY?!?!?!?! Give me a break.
