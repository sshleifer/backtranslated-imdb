I can't tell you how angry I was after seeing this film. The characters are not a bit interesting, and the plot does not exist. So after waiting to see how the lives of these characters have been interrupted, hopefully that 2 and a half hours ago they were moved to a certain point, what do we get? Storms of frogs. Now, I understand the biblical references (Exodus) and the basic head, but first, it was given without a definite resolution, and the second of all will be lost to anyone who has not read the Bible (important part of the population) or Charles Fort (still a great part). As someone who read well, I thought that this film was pretending to stabilize the poor seinfeld section. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time. It would be better to use reading ... <br /> <br /> ... anything good to be honest
