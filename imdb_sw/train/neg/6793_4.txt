Gritty, west dust from director Richard Brooks, who is quite seen in this kind while putting all the common clich√©s. In the early 1900s the horses of the horse attracted the little cowboy (Gene Hackman), the suave gambling (James Coburn), the cocky baby (Jan Michael Vincent), and even the woman (an amazing game of Candice Bergen). Once the original is not appropriate (with predictive arguments about whether a woman should take part), this becomes a fair intervention, although one is not suitable for new land (but resembles something from Gary Cooper). A good look, if the top piece has eyes on the floor and thrown well, the order of the plot gets very quickly. ** from ****
