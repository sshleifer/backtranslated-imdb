This is one of the films that make you want to spend time looking at, and then, like you have carefully spent time, when you have access to a video shop, etc.. <br /> <br /> First, check: It's grainy, it's a low budget. Now that itself does not do with bad films. But the way it makes it seems odd, so it's kind of terrible. <br /> <br /> Then, story. 3 gals go a week of gal away with guys. Of course, if everyone does during a camping trip, it leaves a way to get the ring. When they get to the place where they will stay, they get pulled by Mr. Alien Mr., who encourages them by throwing cigarettes smoked out of the car during the fire, and then drives where they are going (cabin away). Of course, 2 "good boys" are walking in their neighborhood, and Bambi (yes, Bambi) and Aubry are beaten immediately, but Bambi appears to be beaten with anything with two feet. Mady is still frustrated with these developments because she was expecting the weekend to forget about her past to get sh ** - and stoned her and her visitors. Oh, and I almost forgot, there is a generation of meaningful age that lives that way, maybe someone doesn't do it, and location and cabin where they live have a kind of "reputation". In fact, sooner or later (unfortunately, later in the future) some of our guests at the end of the week start to die, and get a lot of booby traps (though a few of them beat less than that) and of course, the remaining camps are understandable. No receiving for mobile phone of course (who would lose the opportunity to check their mobile phone for reception in the movie again?). Mr. Ranger Mr. continues to increase in unusual times and his behavior seems odd but he said he would get help. It is amazing surprising for this that you don't want to lose too, if you still wake up. Request to get up on the blank screen. This action is awesome, the production values ​​are terrible, and all the work is disabled & I see this amazing also was released. Avoid at all costs, 1 out of 10.
