I'm just a rating of this film as 3 of sympathy because it tries to be worth. I like to praise the great movie and I am not interested in the "male" movies. Without the blonde was the best film. The rule of Georgia on the other hand, was unprepared, weak, unwritten, a fictional example of film decisions when the worst. The end of the film was not worried who was asleep or if anything was solved. The most important thing in the film is good news. This story is weak and has not continued (just because it is deep, it doesn't mean the story is good). Good story has powerful characters. Powerful behavior is one that affects a major change of behavior, and is beaten by these changes during the movie. In the rule of Georgia, behavior change was sudden and manufactured. Second, there were many very powerful characters. Removing very good behavior is hard work and takes time (you have only a few hours in the movie). That means that many tried powerful characters will be greatly influenced by their personal change. Even if I ignore the bad story, and the garbage of the weak characters, I can't say that I even loved anyone. Each character was aggressive. That's good if you write the beauty of America but not when you try a wonderful comedy. Georgia was a horrible mother, her daughter was a mother and daughter terrible, and Lohan was a horrible excuse for man (no I forbade anyone because she was attacked, crap happens to everyone and we are all responsible for our own actions). "Dudley Do Right" The son of Mormon should have guts not affecting his religion and promises ... and Simon, I mean so much, what kind of boy who enables a 17-year-old girl who has just been struggled to stay on a regular basis (except he is an actor or politician). This film is worth watching if you want to remind you what to do the best of the film is not!
