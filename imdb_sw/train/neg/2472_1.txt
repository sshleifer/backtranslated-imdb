Anyone who was able to sit through this film and walk away from feeling like it was a good film does not like high-quality movies. This movie was the desire to watch, the leadership was the quality of class of film classics as well as movies. The Blair sorceress project had the best movies and I hate it with enthusiasm! The story of the story was able to be a very good film but it fell flat from the first 10 minutes through the remaining movie. The person mentioned that this film was about the child's thoughts, even though it was beautiful and beautiful. But they could still do good things with this script than what they did. I mean coming, Indian in the shop. Is the child looking at a small image and suddenly thinking Indian and whole story about Indian spirit called Wendigo? Which they refer to the shopkeeper and he says no one but me who works here, so you think of the beautiful weather conditions, but then he just places himself in the amount of the image and we forget about the little child seeing this boy. That was so the cripples go more interesting. Finally it was left you wondering not just happened to Otis in the hospital but also feeling the OMG !!! Why hell I lost my time to watch this! This is an argument that I recommend NOT to look at, there is definitely the best film out there that will not hurt your mind! Thank God I have never paid to see this film, I'd like to return my money! For those who were easy to accept this film .... it is very sad that you have reduced your rates to this level of film making you actually say that it was a good movie.
