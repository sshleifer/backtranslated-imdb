CQ is very slow, and I am a fan of David Mamet. The movie follows next to a small film manufacturer who is making a very film Barbarella-esque. Later the movie began to lose me. Deep and deep? Not true. The movie "Dragonfly" made in CQ has a problem of having an end. This is similar to CQ, which also does not last (in my opinion). I was lucky to find this movie at the SxSW film festival. I had only high expectations after watching Y Only Mama Tambien and other great movies. I was also interested in the performance of Jason Schwartzman. But it was not a simple film to enter. If there are on 60 sci-fi or less movies that may not be anywhere, you jump. <br /> <br /> CQ feels like a student film. If you want a recent sci-fi-esque indie movie film, Donnie Darko, will not sleep.
