It is interesting for me that most retirees think of this masterpiece. I am not a runner to reach high-quality films, and I will agree that from a technical technical perspective, and to several characters were shown, the film is in the class of merit. But there is no sense (for me) of this film really going anywhere; I mean, by taking the viewer anywhere. It is a series of emotional events, perhaps as wonderful as, but I want more from the film. I am looking for stories and movements and fulfillments for arrival, not one that I have found in this film. Yes, it can be considered poetry on the film. . . but there are many poems that I can't live for the same reason: that has a color image without going anywhere. Another thing that can be mentioned is that it runs the mid-middle English middle century, which must be limited to its entire world. I was so surprised at what a young British youth had to live, at that time and place. After growing in the United States just ten years earlier, I can say in a voluntary way that the difference is great. I can't help to ask myself if this difference has had some impact on those who go through the film. In other words, there may be a tendency to judge the film on 'the film of the film' (which I realize is there) and totally ignore its lack of importance to the nature of the actual experience of remembering?
