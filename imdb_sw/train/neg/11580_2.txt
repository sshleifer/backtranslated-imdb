If you want to see the secret, don't look at this. Although there are direct external features of Elmore Leonard, this comes closer to the section of "Dynasty", since the film manufacturer considers "character development" - that is, long-term, the boring dialogue between the ignorant, non-involved. Other people can make interesting movies without real action (see "Exotica"), but not this. Avoid, especially if you like the characters involved in this.
