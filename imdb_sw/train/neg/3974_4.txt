I agree with everything Calamine said! And I have always disagreed with people, but what Calamine has said is true, it's time for girls to continue to better responsibilities. I would like to see them very successful as they had a very interesting pair and I would like to see them grow as people, managers and their work and their personal lives. The producers, please give the girls an opportunity to develop something that goes a little further, moving them into a new direction that informs each other and their talents in many things. This movie is not so bad, but as I saw more in their movies, their movies are similar to a common plot and typography. During Rome it is good for the audience of a little generation but adults who were children when twins were children want to follow twins in their achievements and so I think we adults would like to see them doing different kinds of movies, maybe some like the sixth sense, hour chocolat, a kind of movie - not to say they have a very bad film to them, and they laugh too, but instead of seeing them in different roles for what they played on their latest movies like this minute with New York. (Note: I am from Australia so my spelling exempt weird if you identify with s instead of z)
