This is a very bad movie. I laughed once or twice, and the storyline follows! There's perhaps one of the good jokes, it's stupid and it's boring. Through the entire short movie, I was sleeping and wondering when you were going. Nobody does man, and everyone is ignorant and ignorant. Rob Schneider who acts as an animal is not something I paid to see. It seemed to be surprising, but the bottom line: Do not miss that you have a bright time on a good and bad MOVIE. I was wondering when it ended, although it's a short movie. At first we thought it would be better; but it becomes worse. Fools, all the way to the end. I walked out of the theater, and I would like to remember that the film is very bad forever. <br /> <br /> The author and lover of this film is the author of Simpsons TV, but this is not like The Simpsons (this movie sucks !!!)
