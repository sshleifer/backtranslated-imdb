This movie is just bad. Bad stories, weak leadership and less acting acting. What I was really interested in is the broadcast - always - to an internet service provider known. It is obvious that some events are written to do just that, advertising. This film is being beaten by anyone who paid money for this. <br /> <br /> Don't look at this, it's not worth your time.
