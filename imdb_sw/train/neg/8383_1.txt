... forever. This is below. I am not happy. The play area should have some kind of warning. 'Remove all hopes you enter here' would be appropriate. <br /> <br /> I do not have words to describe precisely hell which this film is. His unreasonable foolishness will not be disappointed. This movie is definitely aimed at some of the slow turtles in the sandbox. The story was stolen from the 10-minute cartoon of Bugs Bunny and then put it as a wonderful master for 90 minutes of bitterness. I remember when the Jews were playing. I think the Hollywood problems for them to produce crop crops are a blame for the hero who leaves at a fixed rate. I am sad and angry that they think we are ignorant enough to enjoy 90 minutes of kick-in ---- balls joke and plot plot according to cartoon. <br /> <br /> I didn't like anything about this movie. I can't destroy anything but the child is actually midget the face of Marlon Wayans very badly on the body of the midget. I liked if you were the last. It's not a film resolution, but the exact end where we were all standing and walking out. It was worth one film, but it should be down. I don't feel that the six minutes they used to write the script is worth the star. This deserves Razzie and I ask God to find it. What will people learn; if you stop paying to see this idiocy will stop deleting. Seppuku is a good alternative to this film. Avoid at all costs. You have been warned.
