This is a weak film and a worrying history of cuts and mentioning again. It doesn't work all the time. First dramaturgy is all wrong. It is very slow to move for the first time and then fast and exciting goes to the end. But there is also (and that relates to cuts) walking failures between types. It grows and exciting to be taken to the value of the face and then decreases into farce than satire. The latter can be funny but it is also very clear that almost I felt that it was embarrassing my mind (it's a bit there is). So the film tries to be everything but it does not really fit at all. You can also see that in the development of uncertain behavior. You can get Connery's feeling has three roles instead of one.
