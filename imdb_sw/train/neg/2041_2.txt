Well, I will start with good points. The movie was only 86 minutes, and some of it was very bad. Now for lower points. My first warning sign came with a "real" warning on the film. When you started the following "warning" you were shown: "The movie you want to see has images and images. Because the opposite of popular belief is not fun, good or romantic." I had to be saved for 86 minutes and close it. The first words of the film were: "I'm in a glue factory." He was someone talking on his phone, and was referring to a nursing home as a glue plant. I don't know why. So the basis of the movie is a young child considered by the Zodiac killer and begins to imitate him. This film's budget was at least 50 bucks and they should be able to use affordable cameras that can get. Acting was worse than I read directly from the script. That sounds like they did. The script was awesome, and the "misleading" great was that this person who wrote biography on the Killer of Zodiac was really Killer of Zodiac. Of course they tried to show this trick but they did it completely in the first 10 minutes. Without any pain of the plot, here are some important elements of the movie. They are trying to make Killer of Zodiac comparing himself with the "one army" because the soldiers are just killers. Then they tried to try the "devil worship" to show some people in the black hood at the meeting. The great "hacker computer" received this kid's address when someone gave him the name of the child and phone number. For some reason he had to intervene in the FBI to find the address. I don't know why you didn't just look at the phone book or use whitepages.com. There was a random preference to 9/11 for any reason. I also learned that no matter where shooting, blood will come out of your mouth within seconds. So if you like a bad act, a small script, a bad camera function and a conspicuous conspiracy, you will love the Zodiac killer!
