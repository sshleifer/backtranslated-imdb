When you are between 10 and 14 years (except R), there are a few things to love here. One or two lines from Kenan Thompson, David Koechner (we should see him more) and Sam Jackson are happy and Julianna Margulies are as good as they can focus on their surroundings, but sadly, it is. Inappropriate plan. Bad work. Writing and delivery worse. Special effects are bad. Also the whole situation is an abnormal and serious shock, the key condition that has entered all of it is very similar. If we focus on the practical aspects, there is a very inexpensive practice in some films that make you giddy and there are some that you find. This movie has only the last type. This leaves little left. I am very happy to pay for this. Besides any harvest, I can read and think, and so I look, I didn't expect anything good. I had no expectations, but I had some concerns. However, if the fall of the train, one can not just look away. And even without expectation, I was revealed. Bad. Even 'bad, it's good' material. I am _very_ to withstand bad movies, but this makes the "Secret of Samurai" (which I liked) Oscar deserves. No, this piece of garbage more than CGI is in the same company as World War, Little and Gigli. How this is currently tested 7.2 has already caused me. Brainstorming or somehow hitting a voting system is everything I can think of as answers. I would like to go on but I'm ready to say that tonight, I witnessed the collapse of the train. I need to go wash my eyes. 1 of 10
