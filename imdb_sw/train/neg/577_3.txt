First thing, Jon Bon Jovi does not seem to be the place of a movie of the vampire. Along with other uncomfortable characters and the story of the poor whole movie is predictable. If you continue to be in mind and you are a fan of a vampire movie, you can have fun with its pictures. Don't expect any shape of the Tarantino style here and neither the story of Rice Rice. (I expect to have forgotten the entire film and tomorrow;)
