I saw that attempt and saw more than a few of the 3 lbs and the House, M.D. The character of Tucci is brilliant but the society does not have the choice of choice, similar to the character of Laurie House, but without the acerbic wit that Laurie brings the House. At the same time, the 'guy' of Tucci, the historian Seger, has not been made more attractive, like Cuddy and Wilson 'suitable'. Characteristics of Indira Varma Adrienne Holland is similar to Jennifer Morrison's doctor of Cameron to be co-events. <br /> Another person in CBS saw the effectiveness of the House, MD and told his staff to send him a similar show, hoping that mimicry would prove. However, imitating the show as the House requires a high level of wit and doubts with Tucci and the company not only on the challenge. I didn't know the show was opened until I read the comments on IMD, but it doesn't give me a surprise.
