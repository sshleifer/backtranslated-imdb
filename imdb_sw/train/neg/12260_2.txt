Sometimes I rest my head and think about why the movies about killer sharks and / or crocodiles are still found today. They have been doing these withered “jaws” copies since 70 years, not as much as they like. The idea is still the same. So we have an animal that starts killing people. First it takes other secondary characters, then begins to attack the main characters, often played by several nobodies except for the most popular person, who includes a professional. One of the most common characters die before others kill animals in some way, usually with an explosion. Then, we get the last shot where we see that the animal is still alive, or put eggs, etc.. "Krocodylus" basically uses the most widely used ideas, and does not have anything to form even a bit of difference. Unless you count the fact that "professional" is a captain in this one difference, so your case is very good. It's funny that he played with Duncan Regehr though, he as completely used Zorro. Tell me it will give you a bonus point for it.
