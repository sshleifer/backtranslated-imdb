"Everything big document can be" ?? Yes, if a man is not, he is mute, and blind. Everything means, that is, the way of seeing, and something interesting. Besides that. . . This is a film that does not completely. Doc of adventure adventure, doc of war without feelings of war, sent to the camp without understanding of wit. It does not mean anything, it feels like nothing, and carries the wrong message that nothing is involved. Not surprisingly it has many IMD fans! Of course, going to you know the movie leading to Skip Lipman will not have a culture, no mind, no wit (except the jokiness of tearing young people), and human feelings do not recognize? only adrenaline. "Darkon" is not a film - it's a panic attack! Avoid. There are many real and very few documents in the life of a loss in a building-up as well as "Darkon".
