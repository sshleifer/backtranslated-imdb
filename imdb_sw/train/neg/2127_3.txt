Why? Because for one reason, it has never been more interesting in any movie than Ann Margret singing "Bye Bye Birdie" during the opening. He repeats the last time, too (in different circumstances!). All wonderful. Use and see. Even if that's all you look at. You will, I am sure. <br /> <br /> Everything about nature was just so much better did not need to remake, sorry! Jason and Vanessa gave the best performances, along with Tyne and Chynna. In fact, all participants and singers in this new edition were giving out 'all,' but it's like trying to try to improve "Casablanca" - it can not just be done! It's even heard to find yourself comparing two ideas if you try to grasp the remake, and it's just a short falls, through no fault of executives.
