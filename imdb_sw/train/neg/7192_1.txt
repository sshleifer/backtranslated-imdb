5 minutes on this film I was making, shaking, and mixing with pain. And it's not a good way. The story is about a group of religious children who make a telephone call for psychology which is always a good idea. It turns out psychologically does not like the call of phone because for 2 minutes she is at their door killing poor Williams mother and father. Enjoy ahead 15 years and guess what? Still mobile phone prank still. What? You would like to think that the evil killings would prevent them from doing it again but no. So after two hours later and many ways of shouting I saw that this film did not give anything but bad taste in my mouth and a great desire to take my own life. This piece should not even laugh at good production, "acting", or Rutger haurs decreased work. I love awesome horror movies but this is an exciting piece I've ever seen. Not only.
