I don't know what Diane Silver was thinking when she was making this film, but she certainly did not have any connection with Richard Wright's novel, which the film has been built. We read this novel previous summer for AP English 12, and just watch the film. When checking regularly and looking at the clock, I thought about the chances of being hit by electricity. Of course, the sky was quite clear, and I had to watch all the film ... and then write a 5-paragraph essay on it. The Wright novel was discussed the real, realistic mind of the killer and psychology behind it. The film was turned into a killer to be a victim, which is not Wright wanted (see: "How He Was Born" 454). <br /> <br /> I'll do this short and sweet: if you want to leave your consciousness, in the words of Raphael Lambert, without deleting, running the movie and reading the book. 1986 changes are not material that causes thought. <br /> <br /> ... :: sigh :: Now I must write an essay.
