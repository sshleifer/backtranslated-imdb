'Ninteen Eighty-Four' is a film about a future society in which the government manages everything and no one can be trusted. It's a very black film, and it's one that will not make you feel good about yourself. It is about the love that takes place in this society and the betrayal of lovers and on human nature to be selfish. The film has very good ideas and has been done well in showing this community of dark tones in color (unlike fun and red color in the dream) and a general sense of loneliness through objects and people. However, despite the cleverness of the film in the idea of ​​this idea, the film was very slow and did not seem to have any idea. It seemed to spend a lot of time being clever rather than telling the story.
