Happy, the most common woman who pretends to deceive all her lovers to strengthen her bank account. Nicole Kidman has Tracey's fraud, married Andy's marriage (Bill Pullman). When a former school friend Andy named Jed Hill (Alec Baldwin) returns as a surgeon, the problem is not behind him. The script fails because it does not take care to develop the premise of success in the effectiveness, stimulation, and lack of a strong impetus of behavior, history and development leaves the perfect display. None of them are able to generate interest in their unknown characters, especially Bill Pullman, who is well-known and Andy cannot think. Little director Harold Becker has left to raise a project that is impossible to do, and he can't do anything from anything. While the 'secret' of the plot will be revealed, you do not care. <br /> <br /> At least the cinema has Massachusetts looks good. Also star George C. Scott, Peter Gallagher and Josef Sommer. <br /> <br /> Sunday, February 25, 1996 - T.V.
