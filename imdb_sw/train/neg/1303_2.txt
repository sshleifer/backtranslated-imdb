Tattooed player Edward Montagne should play as a thriller of crime and a small film film mixed with taste. Instead, it is an improper task, looking carefully at the low budget and non-film. The plan is amazing and hard work with the amateur. John Miles, who had a very thin resume in the industry, grins and guffaws around, and everyone else acts and the same as the characters in the film made film on the safety of the driver. The movie expects to show as 'Stop for Beaver' and 'Father knows Best' in its unnaturally beautiful view of New York in 1950. Why, the viewer even sees anyone light on smoking until a shapely woman is interrogated in half of the flophouse through the movie. The only thing that the movie goes (rather than its short) is the best shots of the site organized by William Steiner. The lowest film budget works for the favor of the movie, as the viewer is given to the well-installed shots within New York City and exceeds. Unless you would like to enjoy the film with the choice of the landscape and the corners of the camera, I propose to watch practically any movie.
