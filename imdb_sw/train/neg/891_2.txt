After loving 'Paris, I' t'aime ', I looked forward to this film and I admitted that I came in with great expectations, but I had lost much for several reasons. However, I was not expecting again to return to 'Paris' in New York I was expecting that structure. I liked about 'Paris' was reduced to the suburbs. You have the meaning of every style of directors and stories they want to tell. In 'NY', there is no clear distinction of the story, with different points in the film, the characters from different stories match each other that has made me confused as to who I was looking at and what is really going on. Also, the leading change was obvious but not confused since there was no flow. Another thing I liked about the 'Paris' film was different that takes love. It was not all romantic. There was love between parents and their children, an unloved love, a woman alone, a middle-aged woman who loves love, thought of the many layers of love between people. 'NY' seemed to be just going to the world, on-top-over sex. There was a brief release (the older couple had lived a short, short life of Julie Christie), but the film '' YY 'did not stir up any feeling for me. I do not connect with any characters as I did with 'Paris'. I remember looking at 'Paris' and hearing a great sadness, loneliness, lust, hope, wonderâ€¦ it was just a lot of souls. For me, there was no soul in the 'NY' film. Maybe if I would go inside without having 'Paris' coming back to my brain like comparing this film might have made the most beautiful answer, but as a personal name for 'Paris, I T'aime' I was very disappointed.
