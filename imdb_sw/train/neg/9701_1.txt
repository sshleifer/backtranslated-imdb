Very good. Part 1 had a lot of funny time - part 2 is bad (through boring) and clearly made cancellation out of fans. <br /> <br /> Shame you, Otto Waalkes! It's just a short time in the film is Helge Schneider who seems to be pis * ed about other characters. It is easy to identify him ... <br /> <br /> The image publisher is clever / non-existent. The director should make everyone grace and leave his work immediately. Acting is worse than playing a grade 2 class.
