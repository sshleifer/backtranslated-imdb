Kurt Russell (like Steven Post) works as a boy's letter for the anti-television station UBC (that's the United Nations Union Union); he goes anywhere in the workplace, giving non-profit projects like "Dog Lincoln Doctor's Dog" to laborers - because Lincoln, doctors, and dogs are popular. The director of the software Joe Flynn (like Francis X. Wilbanks) wisely refuses to recommend Mr. Russell, but does not know how to take a TV show. His Secretary Heather North (like Jennifer Scott), who has double duty as Russell's partner, has a chimpanzee who is bound to Russell when she wants to watch TV. It returns, the monkey looks at all the popular exhibitions, and can choose hits easily. Russell knows the talent of chimp, and uses him to develop his own work. It is understandable, things get HAIRY for Russell and cast! It reduces chimp (addressed to Frank Lamping) does well; Raffles looks tired and / or was corrupted during a few events, when the chimp should appear to be interested; these can be corrected by re-taking or editing. The fierce wind of satirical current - consider cutting the monkey to the TV shows! AND, it's a monkey who gets BEER during advertising (drinking in Disney film)! Look through the cast disclosure s group of television actors to discover and try to set. You can make a game of drinking, in honor of the 'guer-guzzling' raffles, for guessing executives, and where you have seen before. Here is the beginning - Hey, not "Dr Bellows" from "Jeannie's Dream"? Less cutting! <br /> <br /> **** Executive of Barefoot (1971) Robert Butler ~ Kurt Russell, Joe Flynn, John Ritter
