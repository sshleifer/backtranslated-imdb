This movie is a disgrace to the Franchise Premier League. I live in Minnesota and I don't even believe they gave Cleveland. (Yes I know when the real Indians were very good, and Twins had taken under them the American League, but still be consistent). go through the series. You can't tell me this was not a program after the second film was completed. What happened? Also if your true Premier League fan make your consent and do not look at this junk.
