I have shown this (I just checked seven times) four stars because most of the joke / set-ups seem to fail. Some are not quite funny, but others are good - for a 12-year-old boy. Silverman gives out of what he has, including the kitchen sink, when he asks that a few things hold the wall in his efforts to be funny but different. However, what "has found" is often not enough, as if they do not have a kind of follow-up through a good player to succeed. <br /> <br /> All businesses are like potatoes under done.
