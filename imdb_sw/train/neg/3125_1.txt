Boris Karloff is Matthias Morteval, a lost fig tree, who lost a living in Morhenge Mansion and other servants and told his doctor, "Do not try my doctor, doctor! I am bad!" She invites her children and relatives to her home and warns them to inherit genetic disease that causes spirituality to "brain decline" (?) <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> Morteval / Karloff finishes dying, and the "practice" of murder (created by his dead brother) began to kill relatives. The mini finger is a real shot in the face of the boys, a knight of life in a weapon attack and ax and playing Sheik beat people with a knife. One young man is wearing a shiny face. Finally, Julissa and her boyfriend find Karloff still living and hiding out of the pit where metal doors are locked in the room. He plays musical instruments (the death of the deaths used for murder), the brother's spirit begins to talk ("The whole house will go with me!") And the house goes on fire. <br /> <maana ni
