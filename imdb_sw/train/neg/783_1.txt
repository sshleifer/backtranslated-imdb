I watched this show and I just didn't get it. It may be the first part. Recently I recognize ABC is playing a lot of stupid shows these days and it's going down as a station. All the characters on this show are good actors, but even if they were good jokes and script is good awesome and would still bring the show down. I would like to say that I believe that this show will be deleted, but by seeing how ABC makes it very bad for the quality of the performances they are playing, they can only set this just because it's average compared to them.
