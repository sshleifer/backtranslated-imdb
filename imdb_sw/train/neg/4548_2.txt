Decay. Small levels. No character development. I entered this film with great expectations from the book. It can be an amazing film. It may be perhaps a cult group. No, it was great to stop. It was well beaten and it had special effects. Was it difficult to identify who were bad people: rebels or military or church or all? I am still surprised by some mini-stadiums from the film. I have been disappointed about certain aspects of this so-called "prophecy", which have never been fully explained. I felt like I was looking at the corny part of the mini series on the sci-fi station. It looked very much like a film made on TV. Don't go to see this film. It's a waste of time and money.
