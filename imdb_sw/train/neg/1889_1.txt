This film is not suitable for entertainment but it looks more deep in the dark side of the human nature. Connecting the twentieth stories of the most horrible, sexual offenses, lust, abuse and tolerance. All steps are played over a very hot and hot day in Vienna and the heat is perhaps associated with anger and hatred in the film. For me the treatment of a lost girl and a security agent was about the worst part, followed closely by alcoholism and destruction in the 'slags' floor. You will be scared and hope to be shocked by this film. I hated it but I felt compelled to see it. 1/10 for 'fun' 8/10 to show 'person' as sometimes.
