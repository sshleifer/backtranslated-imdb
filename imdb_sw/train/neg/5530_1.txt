Of the many problems of this film, it's worse; and reset it to the VHS for the campus college center many years ago, I tried to understand what caused it. What seems to have happened is that they actually painted the longest film and then cut it down by looking at the usual performances. How long? to fill all the holes in the plot as we need about three hours of development and story - especially due to the fact that the film we have is slow and takes itself only seriously. <br /> <br /> That's amazing; Will Halperins have tried to achieve here? Their original movie, "White Zombie", was a low-budget attempt to reconstruct the original Universal Studios monster (The Mummy, Dracula, etc.), and as well as admitted to my zombies mythology that North American people they will know from popular newspapers. The Zombies rebellion, on the contrary, seems to have been changed as some claim for modern politics. This not only describe the opening, and the change of the character of Dean Jagger being a ruler, but also clarifies why the zombies do not do much in the film, rather than standing around, looking at horrible, and waiting for orders - they 'are just obvious soldiers, not animals of the undead which we have loved to ignore in the zombie film. I'm just like anyone in my hatred for modern war and politics - but I think the film should be the first entertainment, and only later, maybe, education. And indeed - the film about zombies should be about zombies. One of the most amazing films in Hollywood history, but not one I can suggest, even for historical value.
