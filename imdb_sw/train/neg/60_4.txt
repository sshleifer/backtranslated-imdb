I love Goldie Hawn and I wanted one of his films, so I saw the $ 5.50 Protocol on Walmart I bought it. Although amusing with gentleness, the film is not quite available. Other events as part of the party in the bar develops only for a very long time and has no meaning. <br /> <br /> Then, of course, there is a preaching area at the end of the film that gives the whole film a bad taste even though I'm concerned. I don't think this place was added to the film all the time. I don't like ignorant comedies trying to teach me a lesson, written by some '60 burn out! At the end, though I am happy to have another Hawn movie, I am not sure it was worth the money I paid for!
