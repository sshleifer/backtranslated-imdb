In the show of Steve Irwin, he is good. He won't try to be funny and he's just but his movie wasn't even what I'm going to call a film-I mean when that person on his car is trying to kill him he just says' Oh, this is too bad to dial! and look directly into the camera. He put his face in the camera very much! And then when the boy fell off the car he did not want to expect him to be dead? And Terri had the worst work I had ever seen! As when the nearest crocodile ate Steve says just 'Steve'. He was not afraid or nothing, it was just 'Steve'. I mean to hate them in a meaningful sense but that is not worth seeing. I love Steve Irwin but his movie was just stupid.
