Well, let me say that I did not expect the film ahead of Jerry Springer to be the cinema, all that I asked for was the movie ... and it was not. It looked like a bad home movie. It has worked well, written, and filled with the roughness and dirt of the unhappy people I have ever seen. The film's "mark" of the film focuses on a class of low class who decides to go to "Jerry Farrelly Show" to discuss a lot of things between mother, daughter, father and daughter. From there, the movie emerges and continues to have a unique experience: pictures of white paintings. There is red sex, sexuality, even sex between Jerry and his wife? (Yuk!) This film encouraged me to want to eliminate the theater and get second circumcision. At least it was short to gentle. Disgusting and losing. African-Americans and the US working class should fail. (Howard Stern should be pleased however, he did not have an attempt to test the film. He was smart, funny and entertaining) <br /> <br /> MY BUSINESS: F +
