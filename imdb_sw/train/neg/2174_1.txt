It's hard to believe people really like this to break! I think children can enjoy it, but I am a parent of a children's kind film can't bear a stay. A predictable mark, borush of borish, and perhaps the least smaller of all time. I will give some director the role of the child, but he was very bitter to look at. I feel embarrassed for him now, having people know he is. When he sang the Spangled Banner Fourth I needed to turn off the voice - then I came back here and realized they did it because he won the Star Search. I've heard Jim Belushi embarrassed to trade in the name of his good, lost brother, and this trick shows why. Star zero.
