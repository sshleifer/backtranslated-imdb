I rented this DVD for two reasons. Release of major actors, and director, although Robert Altman can be beaten or missing. In this case, it was a great miss. The Altman's attempt to construct forgiveness fell on his keester. After seeing Kenneth Branagh in a good film like "Dead Again", I didn't think he could contribute to the same Turkey, and I hope that it did not damage his reputation. Robert Duvall seems to have fallen through many Oscar players at the same time. On the lowest expansion that includes working in money-making films like this. Duvall was once a good actor in the best film, although its excellent performance was not "The Cheerful of Tender", but "The Great San". This movie was really a waste of time. I offer 2 out of 10.
