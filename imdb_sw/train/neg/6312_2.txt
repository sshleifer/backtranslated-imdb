Over the past 20 years a large number of British films are about how poverty has affected the UK and how our young people do not accept the opportunity to live a good life while living in the English-speaking city. The UK film industry takes into account the 'broken UK' idea. Trainspotting, This is UK, Kidulthood, Soccer Factory, Kes and From London to Brighton. Bullet Boy is just another UK movie added to that list. The main character shows the desire to go straight but still insists on hanging around the dead beats who carry the gun and fight with gang members on nothing. I have never believed that he wanted to go straight if nothing prevented him from seeking education or business. In fact it would have been breathing fresh air if he had to go straight and we had a character who turned his life around. Instead he uses his time to help his friend try to kill. I don't feel sorry when he is shot by another boy at the end of the film, which is sad because at the beginning of the film I loved the whole family and their desire to succeed. I believe the creators have missed a great opportunity to show the world that success is for those who are already striving for the truth (as a Happy Monitoring). I know the purpose of this film is to try and paint a realistic picture of what life as a young black youth living in the UK workplace but we don't have enough films in the UK and the same program? Is it not the time for talented producers and writers to give the Britains youth something that they desire and show them the best life is near? Thank you for the creators of Bullet Boy for not uploading a full video of intellectual violence to try and achieve success because of shock (like Kidulthood, Soccer Factory) but at the same time this film does not give something new to A long list of British films that are not recommended and sad. There is no end to happiness for this movie or any other I mentioned.
