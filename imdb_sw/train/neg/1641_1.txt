This film is not funny. Not entertainment. It has no second nature or mind, nor did it lead you to a little interest for characters or situations. Added it is such as new movie like anything in recent memory. It is like a group of 14 or 15 high school children who never met or had any kind of relationship with a real girl was sitting and writing movies according to their incorrect fantasies about what being an adult would be like. This movie is awesome, horrible, and sometimes offensive and disgusting. Often, it has one or two times that makes you laugh. Also, it appears twice as long as 85 minutes.
