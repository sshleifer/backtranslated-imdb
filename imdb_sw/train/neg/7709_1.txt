Never see this film. Trying to be a modern film on the 1950s and 1960s movies but all that follows makes you want to be so bad that you have looked at one of them and not. <br /> <br /> It is very crippled. The finger should have a certain feature that has the highest quality on it. This movie does not feature it. <br /> <br /> Close yourself. It's too late for me but ... don't look at it.
