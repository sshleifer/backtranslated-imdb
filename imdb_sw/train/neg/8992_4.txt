This is a good quest but a young man who wrote a screenplay seems to be a bit in the dark as what actually makes a movie zombie cool. No, not CGI bugs and software companies. Actually I don't know if it's a software company - I saw it without subtitles so I had to guess what they're talking about. However my point was - instead of wasting your time with a dumb bug, why not throw more zombies and more action. 2/3 of 20 minutes includes news, bugs, some men talking about something. And make things worse (more boring) many deaths occur off the screen. I realize that it is very common to no movies, but then there are some amazing effects (well, type-of) which I wonder why the director (or screens, whatever) chose to focus on how the epidemic started - it's short, nobody he cares.
