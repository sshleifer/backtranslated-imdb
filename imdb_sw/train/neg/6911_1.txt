What a large spoon of ivory. Shot-on-video (True crappy camcorder, NOT digital) a bunch of trash. Of course, the stupid thing was done. The fact that this trick was completely released is completely unimportant. Everyone who sees it will become stupider for having a look. Great. I felt like it had killed several brain cells after looking at this waste. A good review of the $$ trick was clear and "the film manufacturer" (and I use the word in a large way) and / or his family and friends because there is no ordinary person with a squirrel mindless if this waste life. I don't believe, you have to go away from this video. You will thank me for it. Avoid as herpes.
