This is just one of the accessible films that you find on the TV Life that shows the dislike of a woman who is disgusting in a kind manner. With other very bad films like "The Burning Bed," "Enough," or "Monster," this film takes offensive crime and try to try the viewer why he's not such a bad person. Give us a break! Here is my question for the creators of the film: If LeTourneau was a person, and Vili was a 12-year-old girl, would you like to have a picture of sympathy and appeal to this person? Answer: Hell. Think about changing madness in this film, and then you will see why I and others here think this piece of waste. What? Girls have been changed, there will be no attempt to feel with the offender. Instead, we expect to be treated with a show of pride and a witness with a young girl, her charming character is locked up in prison, and her brain survivor of Stockholm Syndrome. The only reason LeTourneau does not get the same treatment in this film is because of its sex. <br /> <br /> Let's take a column. LeTourneau is a pedophile. Narrow and simple. There are nos, ands or buttons. He is a criminal who is in prison, and deserves to be despised and despised, but certainly not our mercy or mercy.
