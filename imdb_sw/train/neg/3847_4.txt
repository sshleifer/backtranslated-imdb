There is any issue with Helen and nothing. Shelley Winters and Debbie Reynolds plays the mother of the Leopold & Loeb's mother as killers who move to the west to Hollywood to avoid their past. Reynolds, creates Jean Harlow wannabe, opens a dance studio for children and Winters is a piano player. Soon Winters (like Helen) begins to burst. It's very slow to go and though there is enough real time (bad phone, Timothy Carey's visit to the ink), the movie does not exist of any real fear. However, it is still a good recreation. The work of divas is good and the production standards are strict. The music title by David Raskin, the movie cinema and Lucien Ballard and Oscar-chosen clothes contribute to power. For this, PLACE IN SUN and LOLITA for his loan, does anyone do things like Winters? Guided by Curtis Harrington, master in this type of non-use of the movie altogether. In addition to Carey, non-inclusive support include Dennis Weaver, Agnes Moorehead (as Aimee Semple McPherson as evangelist), Yvette Vickers and Micheál MacLiammóir (Ireland's Orson Welles) as Hamilton Starr, a wonderful hammer name.
