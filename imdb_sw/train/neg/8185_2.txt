Oh my. I decided to go out to the movies with other friends, wanting to look at one of the most sensible Christmas movies, and I would go out with anxiety. The movie failed. Put it completely. Paul Giamatti who I think as good actors played his character and began to be very scared, with Vince Vaughn who has been my favorite one. They try and turn to the Christmas movie, in a new style. Bad, mixed and good varieties, but all happened very much. Ten minutes or first minutes are not too bad, but when we saw Santa, it was gone. Not better, the standard of staying the same, there was no development of the character, and it is certainly one of the worst Christmas movies. Don't look, whatever you do.
