Well it must say that before the discovery of the 'monster'. saying that he was not sure of that society, just something strange that had feelings of anger! And personally I think granny can run from it, but nevertheless. I really was coming into this film, although having a great drunken character and the victory of the heroine didn't come as an appeal. But such events when he runs away from the train, and you can see the illustration on the door was a creepy type, also where the guards were just killed by 'monster' to put his hand on the screen. But the tragedy came to create time when the monster was revealed was just your average fear, with small or awesome thrills. Gradually I was so tired, and I wanted to install it. I would like many people have said that there were roots for homeless people to do so, especially that person, gave me a few laughs here and there. I think this film could be something special rather than what everything that fears today is! Just boring and well not worth the money. <br /> <br /> if you are looking for a terrible cheap here and there, or a fest fest gore (which is limited, hardly any really) by all means give you go, but for all your awesome viewers looking elsewhere, film much better out there.
