I would like to give this film zero but it was not an option !! This film takes !!! Women cannot act. I had to know that I would be able to absorb when I saw Bobby Brown. No one in my house can believe that I didn't change the facility after the first 15 minutes. The idea of ​​black women as gunslingers in the West is ridiculous. not just a matter of race, it is also a gender. The combination of two things is ignorance.I am sad because some people in movies are not bad actors / characters but the movie itself was bad. was not believed as a film. it can be 'entertainment' for a certain group of people but I'm not in that group. lol. and use a great line from a great movie, good ... "that's all I say about it."
