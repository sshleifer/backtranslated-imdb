I went to see this movie just to see what all the hype is about, and I was like disappointed as surprised how 6 (?) Oscars and 7.9 rating on IMDb as today. <br /> <br /> Kathryn Bigelow must be the best director to win the best and best pictures for Oscar for this kind of bad movie and I wonder why? What? Anybody's story of the release of the cowboy bomb 'means anyone that I have failed to see? Why I kept getting a mental picture of which this movie was a remake of the old bad movie of the West about a cowboy doing 'brave works' in Wild Wild West catching 'evil' Red Indians; but only that was installed in a different background at this time? Was he given Oscars because the director of the former James Cameron, and made it a good story of the story (TV) for TV shows that you deserve it? Or was it the type of King's clothes - where many people found it to be junk but they could not say it because others were not seen speaking out loud? What was it and what was the sniper area where they showed the shell of the shell that causes high-resolution-super-slow-mo as to present 'deep messages' or something? Something in the line 'EOD staff makes good snipers suddenly and they will get evil terrorists all the time'? Is it the only one who felt like there were many pieces and pieces here and there on a movie hit because there is no clear? And you can get Oscars to edit and guide it to it? If you haven't seen this yet, don't lose your money on the ticket. Wait until they run on TV in a few years. You can't miss a lot.
