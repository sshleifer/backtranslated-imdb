This was a blind to buy a used DVD. It was completely killed a good buzz that I liked when I played. <br /> <br /> It is a comedy led by a bubble, but it's um. squalid. The program is ZANY! <br /> <br /> Maybe the box leads me to expect something more than an unfamiliar film, the goofy caper. (I know, I know, posts in the box & the Academy Prize Selection doesn't mean anything.)
