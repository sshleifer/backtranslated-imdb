RATING STAR: ***** Function **** Just Misses Mark *** That Little Bit Out of ** Lagging Back * Pits <br /> <br /> In this first quest for Nick Nick loved by dog , they are forced to fly up to a month when the beautiful Wallace runs out of cheese. Even with a few more features for only 22 minutes, this W / G adventure is also the first and shows the kinda. The animation of the plastic is very little and funny here, a sort of note of the animation of Mork about the little man in the box. Even though the previous crafts are, I have never been so much in Wallace & Gromit (maybe it's very fresh and traditional for someone of my generation.) The only one I really enjoyed was the Wrong Plate (and that was more from the time I was young and I don't know, we'll say, the joy of life.) I was driven to search for these early efforts from the revival in popularity due to the most recent film's success. It is as interesting as the first two (all things have been taken into account!) this is not a sense of sensitivity to the supporters. It is said, it is a very good pleasure as the first attempt and certainly set the level of great things to come. Two stars, but two beautiful stars. **
