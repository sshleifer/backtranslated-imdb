Someone wondered how the script was written. <br /> <br /> Wayne and other artists do good work but if not comedy, romantic thriller or anything else rather than despair. A person feels like one of the threads had been made would be something of value. However it is interesting to see the real turkey of the story presented before the US to be directly involved with the war. I wonder if neighboring politics had something to do and try to make a film for all the taste but ended up with something that doesn't like someone. It has a historical value.
