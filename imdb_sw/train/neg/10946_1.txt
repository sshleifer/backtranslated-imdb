"That 'Malcom' display on FOX is actually doing murder ... can't we make our own version?" I say and resemble, of course, but in our hearts we all know it is true, and that the only thing NBC added to the 'Malcom' metals was sex. And, boy, did he add sex ... Tucker thirteen years old gets a boner and covers it with his skateboard. Tucker walks by accident with her aunt in the shower and accuses her of looking at him and beating him. She is a spies on a beautiful girl in the next house from her bedroom window, and she knows she wants to see him who doesn't have a top but tells him with an exciting and closing window. And all this is in the experiment. <br /> <br /> Taking from an adult-adolescent boy is so sex-crazy and testicle driven impossible to make funny for ordinary viewers. Once anyone has ever been in the movie, you can count those in one hand. It is not surprising that "Tucker" has a warm and appealing room for the player's club. Did the network think we want to look after children with pregnancy? What? Are these things that people go to jail? If you doubt the destruction of this show consider this: 13 sessions were done but NBC canceled after only 4 sessions were given; then they made an abnormal argument of "burning off" the remaining events by convincing them in the evening so there were no children. Surprisingly since children were originally targeted audience. In addition to its great disruption of Tucker it has a voice from the leading character to the body outside the text of weakness. Even in 2000 it was a very horrible, and is an interactive music with a great sarcasm. I can't have any enough characters laughing jokes and jokes didn't come miles-minutes ... Shock on NBC for this deficiency of dirt ... they are better than that GRADE: C-
