This was about 75 minutes of my life. Acting was angry and the plot was ridiculous. It refers to evil owners who find rich men to lie with him, and then leave them for money. One of the victims is the DA candidate, which causes problems in his relationship with his wife. Another is a plastic surgery, also married, and a bad pastor happens to deceive his wife too! Meanwhile, a beautiful lesbian girl doesn't care if she is lying around. It is approaching the end of happiness where all are forgiven. Women are also very naked, especially in situations that make the truth. worst bad.
