"Smokey And Bandit" was not exactly Shakespeare, but nobody wanted to be. It was under a slapstick, but it had a brain. It had a very smart script with a thorough and fun-fun characters. People came from an exciting reminder. "Hooper" does not provide anything. There is no exciting reason. If it is supposed to be a tax for Hollywood Stuntman, it makes them appear to be lazy by giving anything except a fight against one of the jumping cars that I have ever seen. It all seems to be bad, badly beaten for a purpose. Poor Sally Field (as a partner who claps his hands on the other side) is given a weak role, without one or a single line ("If you do this jump, I won't be here when you arrive"). Burt Reynolds continues to watch the camera and lie down, but the joke is on the audience living through "Hooper". * from ****
