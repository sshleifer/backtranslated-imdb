This is really very bad. Lamas only shows how the second-stage actor does his work. But what is worth looking at is an area where the OJ furious takes his fellow soldiers and throat as to kill them when the jukebox has a song and a voice "I have evidence on you!" (It makes me feel all the songs - provided by David Gregoli and Leslie Oren but I couldn't find it on iTunes). Talk about seeing in the future ... Too funny for words. Others of the film are forgetting. Results and songs are more attractive than script. Ditto good. Which asks the question why they would make the nominee even. My understanding was that overseas sales provide many movies for B. It does not say much about the world of look at the world.
