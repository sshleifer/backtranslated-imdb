WOW! I didn't know that someone would make this film! it's bad! I am written under 5 things that can explain why you don't want to see this film. <br /> <br /> number 1: "is the biggest rave ever" where does it hit? I would just see a few people playing around .. <br /> <br /> 2. when they are on rave, they can only see blood everywhere, no people, two tents destroyed by one step. drink! <br /> <br /> 3. The worst executives have ever seen! The captain and his staff .. bad! When one of the people blows a normal gun, it runs 30 times without reloading! I did not know everyone in the world could fight like a pro! it must be something new. ‚Äù/ / <br /> I wonder what the producer was thinking! "this will be a great hit, it'll be a classic" .. certainly u dumb s ** t never see this movie, waist time. MY MONEY WANTED!
