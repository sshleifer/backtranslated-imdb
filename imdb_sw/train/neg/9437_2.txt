I have never considered myself a "student" when it comes to watching the film, I look at them, comment and yes. But Unhinged changed this all. This film is undoubtedly an unsuccessful attempt in the film that I have ever seen. Every child standing at the university thinking that he would be the next Spielberg or Tarantino should be approved for this film and a book called "How Not to Make Film". Not just a story that is not available, the film makers were not able to make a movie to watch. It has been a time since I saw it, but all I can say is to look at the shots tracking heads in the opening scenes. They have no end! It's almost like your teeth are beaten, not very happy.
