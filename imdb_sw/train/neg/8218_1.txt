I've never finished this film because, it was awesome and that's just working. I wasn't sure that the film was on tbh didn't make much sense and violence was bad. I mean ususally I like some nude in the film (lol) but it was just sick because of what is happening. All the characters heard me and it was just a great voice and the camera was cut in part and it seemed like a good to blair and a project but without any good reputation. This is one of the worst movies I have seen for a long time and would like my time back to please. I will not recommend this film to anyone or even see it. (N)
