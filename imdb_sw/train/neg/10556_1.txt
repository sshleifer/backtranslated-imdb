This is a good example of how not to make a film. <br /> <br /> There is very little discussion, no context of events, and frequent cuts between seemingly related events. The result is confused, a non-clueless viewer; The plot is impossible to follow and the ideas presented are of course without listening to the director's comment. This game has a lot to do with humanitarian violence and tries to show how appropriate it is, and insist on child abuse. It includes true stock publications, violent acts of violence, including war killings. Although it works in the context of the film, I feel that behind the movie's ideas can be made without using the very content. This film is not suitable for those who are weak or worried, and should not be shown to children under any circumstances. <br /> <br /> Period is a climactic fight compared to the contents of all films. If you listen to the comment when you appear it may be lost. <br /> <br /> The director's description was a single shot, "sit down and let him save, no cuts" type of definition. Although this is not very bad, the director ends up running very often and often spends a minute sometimes complaining about his college, hideout photography, co-producers, bad films, and eleven other things. Constant shortage prevents from what else is an important tool to understand the film. The movie was hit many years ago on the 16mm and Super8 film for four years on a very low budget. For this reason, video and sound quality are poor. That alone does not make a bad film, but it does not make the film worse.
