The cloudy cloud is a traumatic film. Very difficult, it takes every shot as a work of art. You get the feeling that each shot has been designed and designed for the quality of services that have limits on deficit; Describing how the movie has continued since the first film was hit out in the nineteenth century and implemented their construction, the camera here is never appropriate? away from the camping time and the number of color music. Common noise is taken at a minimum and a valid word is spoken. This fascinating but beautiful device encourages listeners to focus on their own ideas so that, like the story continues at the speed of the snail we feel we are twisted. Unfortunately, for me at least, this immersion begins to open a section near the clock logo. I started to feel like the film was a challenge for me to keep looking at it as hard as the minutes mentioned so that just a look to be a war of love. What is in this film has not been as sex as it would undoubtedly be even more open to the Western audience. As is the case, there is a lot of female vulnerability and sexual abuse of a woman who is not aware (or perhaps dead) that is very serious, although it can talk about the damage that sexual studies of men and women (users and used) are. The most diligent in the manner that chooses to make its point if effectively deliver it useless. Of course the worst and most active participants of the explosion content in existing content will look for this film for all the wrong reasons and look at it with their finger on the fast forward button. Over all his problems, the film is obviously charcoal, and the more you think about it is the more important things it seems to do. Surprisingly, for a film that occurs a bit, the viewer will probably have a charge for a second or even third look. For me, however, once was enough ??
