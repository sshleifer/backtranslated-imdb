Vulpine killings must be this true film. And the identification line should read "Confirmation of making your children plunge!" This is a natural game that tells the story of the family of wild foxes in a remote area. Starting with the accumulation and connectivity of two young foxes and regular births for large families and experimentation. Talking alone takes place in the story and the tree that stands on the cave, giving insight into the animal likes and surviving ... The beauty of the landscape and beautiful pictures of animals. Shows good huh? Well from there things go straight to hell and then start digging to the base ... <br /> <br /> *** Low Spoilers - Or they may be Warning! The first time we learn one of the fox is born blind. But it seems to be well together and there is a good color of music according to him ... And then he dies ... Then we have one of the brother's adventures. Then it dies ... One of the sisters gets her time screens ... and then dies ... And so it comes as a terrible horror movie as one shadow after another is killed by nature, in traps, just up and lost, even with a bunch of snow! At the end of the film almost all the foxes have been attacked. Although sympathy is not shown on the screen. (Then it's not the version we saw.) Unlike the "Tarka Otter" death in this movie is almost all without meaning and until on the sadistic in the way hope is built and then burned out. One or two losses would be accepted. It's a natural film after all. But not nearly the whole family. Do not go to see this film being cheated by a cheery box in safe thinking for children. Looking for some insight that things cannot * go smoothly and that you or your children can stop hearing badly depending on how you feel or them. You can enjoy it. Or you can't ...
