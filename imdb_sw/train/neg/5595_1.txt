Wow ... Okay. So, after reading a little feud here, I decided to see this film myself. This movie is HORRIBLE. I stopped watching it. I strongly recommend cleaning the room instead of watching this film, you will be more damaged / distracted. <br /> <br /> It is a low budget and bad acting. Anyone who filters this 10s film is not quite accurate and should be ignored. <br /> <br /> I have no relationship with other retirees. <br /> <br /> Make it, this movie is not worthy to watch. <br /> <br /> So, BAD MOVIE so much.
