this, not one of these films is one of the many pieces of voting that I have ever had, the function of the camera is trying to be flashy but actually just forbid the whole thing looks like a diary red diary, but without sex, the only reason I bought this I was looking for trying to dvd and this was the cheapest I could get, maybe bought more of my life and it could put you off the dvd forever, the sound of the voice is realistic and many films are composed for a long time of part of the first two films, for what anyone would make the film as bad as this is more than me, if they had tried to make the original film and failed I would be nicer in this audit but they just don't have the right to reproduce from the first two and then edit and repeat this film and about maybe of the three natural images that are close to the levels of school students, do not give this film. The only entertainment that this dvd can offer is if you would like to reinforce the microwave and look at the lights! UTTER UTTER UTTER UTTTER GARBAGE Reliable! 0/10 if the voting system only allows that.
