I only believe that no classicists / historians felt "Cleopatra", or, as they did, that they took as a laugh. The movie is very bad, more laughably, even, than "Gladiator" (which is at least a well-written script whose history mistakes are describing and relate well to the story). However, it is Octavius, the successor of Caesar, in the Senate before the murder of Caesar: at the age of 19! In addition to this, acting is mediocre. Timothy Dalton has more of James Bond's feelings in him when he says, "Caesar Julius Caesar". Billy Zane is a dense laughably Marc Antony. And Leonor Varela tries to be a deceitful Pharaoh (who in real life did not look good) but comes as impossible. So this is a warning to all historians - this movie is not true for life!
