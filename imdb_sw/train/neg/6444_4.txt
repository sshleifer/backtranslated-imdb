Most of the college students feel lost in the elite bubble, and they are exposed to communities that learn and live. Their conversation is being done with fellow students and the faculty of the university. The Documentary of Steven Greenstreet is a prime example of a university student who judges the whole community for a small contact with a small number of its members. Documentary focused on a small group of people who were shown as representing large groups of people. As always, people who shout loudly get many media attention. More than the improper public displays that the film was made, the document was made well. My only controversy is that the emotions and disorder shown in the film were associated with the whole community rather than a few people who explained them. It is usually necessary to explore such a conflict and to make people aware of the differences between political views, but it is ridiculous to imitate the whole society in a few radicals.
