There are good reasons Edison went straight to the video: it would have dropped in the movie with crumbling thud. The movie lasted a very long time and was bad boring. Head only on the bottom (for thanks to Freeman and Spacey, who certainly had two extra weeks before their next film), the evil boys are like laughable and action as almost nonexistent as Justin Timberlake acting. I like to hit the man, but quickly realizes that pop is better for him, it's better. <br /> <br /> The movie is not all bad ... especially. I love the fact that LL Cool J was given what appears to be shot in that he leads. He deserves. And, unlike his fellow singer and co-star, he can act. Kevin Spacey is almost always enjoyable too (you can see him dancing several times as he scans the scenery), and Freeman has the ability to lift this flick for three stars (out of ten ... he's not that good) The last error with this movie is that it is a perennial and poppycock fragment of the pseudo that does not prevent anyone. It also fails to make anyone give a good logo about any characters. All in all, t is very clear. That being said, this lease when you are experiencing sleep.
