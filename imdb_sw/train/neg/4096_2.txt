This was a session of something that should not be. Gloria was now one mother, her husband had left her because she could not live in the region with her (she was mad that Reagan was chosen and wanted to return to the community). Right now and where I had trouble with the series - I come, I tell myself, is this a good Mr. Michael Stivic which described the right philosophy of Arnee Bunker? The series continued, but it had no pizazz any. Nothing big Sally Struthers received from all the families had gone a long time. Perhaps, as a series you were given another name and you have been shown to be completely self-sufficient in the Family, it would have worked. Ah well, that shows business.
