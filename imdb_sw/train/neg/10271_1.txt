This movie had to be the worst movie of the fear I saw. Acting was awesome, terrible and cheesy and talking about a predictable plot! I will not look at this film again or will not recommend this movie to anyone. It's a waste of time! First, once the movie began I realized what I entered. All they did for this film were copying scenes from many other awesome movies out there and hitting them all on this one movie. Call phone, halloween night, psychology, and one knife! It is absolutely ridiculous. I wasn't very afraid during the film, which I thought the terrible movies had to do. For the film's decision, it is very good as they all talk about how this film was so big and awesome. I mean what you do not know that movies are ripping away from "Modern Scary" for example. At least get good actors there and then maybe it would be pulled off as a good movie of fear.
