I grew up Scooby Doo Where You, and I still love you. It is one of my favorite cartoons with Darkwing Duck, Talespin, Peter Pan and Pirates with Tom and Jerry. Show this though it's good for kids, sound is good (Don Messick and Casey Kasem is perfect as Scooby and Shaggy), the tune of the theme is allowed and has a good animation. Yet it is a desire. I usually do not know Scrappy, but when it appears to be like the main character, it hurts quickly. Complete with Puppy Power Puppy Power, Scrappy is much worse than usual. Also half the group does not exist after the first year, somehow did not feel like Scooby Doo. And the jokes and lines of stories were generally lame and abnormal, a few minority young people or announcing baddies. All in all, it's not as bad as Shaggy and Scooby Doo: Get the Tip, but this show is desperate. 4/10 for animation, sound, theme theme and truth is good for children. Bethany Cox
