I went to this film and I wondered how cheesy was. It was a combination of every fearful / exciting fear, trying to comment on many things including religious love, Satan's worship, undercover cops, things, religion ... and it was a mess. Acting was good for the trip; The child and dude Jesus were the same, but away from them .... Any. I like the effort (although it has been a small failure) in an attempt to show the Christian people in different ways ... even though they did, how they presented the gospel was a little bit of stock and religion. But again, it can be since he talked to a little child ... no. In fact, I have decided that it's just almost bad. music ... oh my gosh ... awesome ... toooo over-high. Okay. I felt bad for people who made this film to the Prime Minister; It seemed like a project for poor students. I will stop right now and say the bottom line, go see this film if you want to lose an hour and fifty minutes of your life on the trick. there you go.
