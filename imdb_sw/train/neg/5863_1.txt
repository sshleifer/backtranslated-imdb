In fact I do not believe that this film does not exist in more than 250 IMDB, it's quite awesome. When I first saw I remember talking about it in a college class and two other people also saw it. We were telling other class members not to see it because it was terrible. When we had done it the others wanted to see it just because they couldn't believe anything was as bad as we said. Don't be like them, just pass this. I am sure everyone involved with this film also likes you never to see it on this film.
