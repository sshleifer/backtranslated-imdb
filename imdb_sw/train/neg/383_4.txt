The plot of the person who does not sleep is not a bad idea, and the issue is quite surprising. But, while watching this film, we were saying loudly, "These merchants are having trouble finding good places, lights are good, makeup and hair are good ... why is the sound bad?" In all the film sounds that was echoy, garbled and much of the conversation was unknown. <br /> <br /> There are some good acting in this film, and I think Jim Thalman is really a good actor. This story, along with some of the same actors, would be worth doing as a big budget film. <br /> <br /> I can not just repeat enough - if you have a small budget, more volunteers in good voice. Sound is a great part of the film as a picture, and it is necessary to do right. It could get 6.
