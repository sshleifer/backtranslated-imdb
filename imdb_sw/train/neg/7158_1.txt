This is some of the worst work I have ever seen. I love Nadja's Almereyda, but this is quite a dreck. Apart from the shortest time of spectacular performances and music this film is just non-standard material that is not available. Jared Harris is very bad, but no one in this is far good. The plot is a joke, but it's not a kind of haha. I don't even know if you can forgive movies that are bad. Please delete the hour and half of my life. This director did Nadja and another girl another program?
