I saw his film at the Ann Arbor film festival. I am a film student in the Univeristy of Michigan so I know something or two about the film. And the Crispin Glover film is a crow. He primarily uses mental problems. Not only the Temple Temple against Christ (which I admit is a little funny) to tell the mental mentality to kill, but there is an obsession with the snare of murder. Crispin also plays with the idea of ​​having love with one of its actors who are like them all, it's a mental challenge. PETA and Human Rights should be on this matter. It is not 'dealing with culture' as Crispin said in the Ann Arbor film festival, exploitation.
