seems to have other talents, Maria Bello is always good. but this is a dreary time, showing every character as a person being beaten and used to make a film from an 'interesting story'. well, I hope they have removed their systems. unfortunately for the audience, no awareness, no sensitivity, no environment, and no real humanity. which is all right, but it has no cries, no fear, no context, and nothing can say about a story trying to tell. bad things happen, you sit and watch, don't care, why? 99% of the time, the words 'according to the true story' makes the unintentional warning to the audience. means the director and the image writer are lazy and are attracted to certain events they have heard about somewhere, so they just leave them on the screen and expect the 'true' nature of the story to make the audience hear something without filmmakers. I hope they had a good time to make this film. landing on ice.
