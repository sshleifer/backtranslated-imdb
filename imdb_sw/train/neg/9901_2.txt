This should be one star, but there were many, clich√©s, predictable deviations, all the appearance before the slap flick parallel that I actually give the bonus star for the truth has made a laugh ... though this was never the Direct Directors I'm sure. <br /> <br /> Not often write comments about the film, they should be feeling, or in that case is very bad <br /> <br /> Being honest, once I saw Jeff Fahey in it I knew it would be poor if he has a special nose to take the worst film. Somehow all its farce has made me look at it all through the way, perhaps by the MR Tactor's voice, (don't put Mr T, but you'll know what I mean if you're bothering this), if you look, make sure you pay see it. This might have worked if they actually put a keen interest in it, but I'm sure you will find an odd laugh here and there on all the farce ...
