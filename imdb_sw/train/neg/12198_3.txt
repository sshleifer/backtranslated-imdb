Growing Up With the Warriors of Animals, I did not know much of the original Reformers, and now I got an amazing film, and now that I have seen an old cartoon that depends on, I must say the original cartoon and movie action action more than the average War. <br /> <br /> Not that I do not like the BW characters, I just think that characters like Optimus Prime is better than Optimus Primal. <br /> <br> I mean, "AUTOBOTS TRANSFORM AND ROLL OUT!" looks better than "INFORMATION DETAILS!" The original Optimus Prime voice still makes me a powerful believer to be a real commander, more than Optimus Primal. <br /> <br /> Besides, Powermaster Optimus Prime is more powerful than Optimal Optimus. Just check on the web! Megatron in the character of BW was seen more as an exciting version of the most evil version in the previous series. <br /> <br /> In addition to what's cool, robots change into animals or robots transform into cars and spaceships? Gimme Transformers The original day on the Battle of Animals!
