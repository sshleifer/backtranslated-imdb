Before I saw it, I have seen the most beautiful Christmas movies. But once I saw this, "Jingle Way All" looks much better than "Godfather". "Santa Claus" is a fun film on Santa helping other children, but almost feels that demons are watching it. Santa's jolly ho-ho-ho is a spontaneous laughter of the devil, which I am sure has taken many kids away from Christmas. This murder program is very strange, which fits with all the exhibitions and conversations. Santa lives on top of the World in North Pole where he, and children from around the world get ready for Christmas. But Santa has an enemy named Pitch, or Satan. Pitch tries to destroy Santa's Christmas by making three naughty boys, and by creating diversions, like moving the chimney and making a fire of doorknob. When the pitch causes Santa attacked by dogs, it is on the assistant of Santa Pedro and Merlin Witch to find Santa out of this. Everything about this film, as well as very bad, is very strange. Satan plays a lot and really seems to be happier than Santa. Santa talks about giving gifts to both boys and girls, but seems to give only 5 children in Mexico. Reindeer is a wind on toys, and when the reindeer laughs, I'm surprised it doesn't bring tears to the baby's eyes ... it's terrible. Everything is awesome. The first 10 minutes are Santa just playing the link when children sing. Probably one of the most amazing events is Santa shooting Pitch in the butt and mini-code and uproariously laughing on it when the dance Pitch around in pain. I think parents are better to tell their young children about where they come from, than to show them this. Good alone is that you will laugh hysterically if you can understand bad movies. <br /> <br /> My rating: BOMB / ****. 85 months.
