Pastor Patty Duke wrote a well-known, fascinating book about his work as an actor, his love-loving life, and his manic incidents of injuries and suicide attempts that make him off. For this rich material to draw from (and Patty struggling in the last act), one would think that the television director Gilbert Cates could make it all on the film, but "Call Me Anna" is a shadow of Duki's autobiography. For those who have not read the book, the example of the figure (jump in time) has not taken place, we are not allowed to get our professions and what is happening, and production seems to be faced with a low budget. The vendors have not been addressed, and the value that Duke himself has finally seen does not pay - the fact phony film is too thick for this point that Patty cannot bring stability to the environment. It seems like producers were honest enough (with careful thought) to persuade the film for the ultimate understanding of Duke and freedom of mind, but they left many opportunities for the system.
