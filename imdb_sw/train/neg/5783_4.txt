Ah, the sex movie and gore. It's too bad they don't do it again (unless you live in Japan). But if they all turned like this, that's not a bad thing. The movie essentially consists of two beautiful bumps that take "johns" along the country's road, taking home to their castle, having male and female sex, and then eating (except the first victims, who continue for any reason). Things are difficult when a woman is camping and her husband is very clever about the strange women who keeps seeing. It gets very bad from here. At the end, two vamps are in the same blood that they eat everything in front, and manage to allow their victim to evacuate the flight. Lo, largely being in secret. The fact that two vampyres do not know to take their clothes off and cheat around each other is the only thing this movie is going to do with it. Otherwise, it's a blood clash, which combines (why is their grave away from their fortress?), Just looking for a few minutes of vampyre playing. The only thing I came out of this movie is two valuable advice: shot girls will not kill them; it will only turn them into the riots, and, do not take hookers along the road to the country; maybe vampires. Other than that, he had no value for my time.
