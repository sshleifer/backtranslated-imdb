The 60s is a recreational film of entertainment, most of this entertainment is from laughing on the film. It is very different, and it includes a lot of irritating things. Take for example switch between black and white, and colors. If it was done the same, this could be effective, but because it was done badly, it turned into trouble and only prevented from the bad experience; The amount of film had an unusual feeling. Acting was not too bad for the Flick, but it was also a shame sometimes. Many things were not good, and ended up being confused. What? How does this family live in many major events during the 1960s? The latter was also sappy to my taste; because it was hollywoodized, everything was sure to end. I would like to advise you not to waste your time on The 60s and do something else for your time. I am happy to look at this in class, and not my own time. I think I can safely say that the best part of the movie was to install Bob Dylan's music. That's my mind to run on flick. I hope to take my advice, and keep away from this.
