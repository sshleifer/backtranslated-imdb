Råzone is a bad movie! It's very simple. It seems they tried to make a film to show the life of reel. Like Zappa did many years ago. But unfortunately Denmark has no good young people. Leon is for many still a little girl in "krummernes Jul", and Laura is not good enough to play such an important role. several times in the film he plays with the outside soul and this is destroying the film! Though I see it a movie you should see. I don't agree that young people live like this, but I think it can show how it can end, if you let your child be down. It is also important to support Danish films and new companies as "Film File"! All in all I think people should see Råzone. Not because it is a good film, but because it is movies that are relevant to the theme. Also I think it's important to show that there are some incidents of violence in it, and in fact it is in these cases, Laura does a better job. - as the end where he holds the gun!
