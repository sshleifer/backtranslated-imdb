Definitely one of Eddie Murphy's small films is a trick about a child of a fraudulent kidnapped, three hundred-year-old dragons and "Elected". <br /> <br /> Murphy is a "Elected" in question, and as the opening song suggests, he is "the best man in the world". The lost children and missing, is found by a wonderful Tibetan woman (Charlotte Lewis) who tells her she is "chosen", and that is her destiny to find and save "The Golden Child". Since the child was to die, compassion would die with him, for he is compassionate. If these hats of hats are not damaged for you now, it will be once the movie begins. It is worth saying the plot is disgusting and damaging the entire film. For that other car for the brand of Murphy's fun (comedy is not very big intelligence), the movie fails at many levels. Even Charles Dance as evil Sardo Numspa can not do much for the case. Very confidential and disappointing. Sunday, December 12, 1993 - T.V.
