What was the beginning of the film when Julia Roberts's behavior was treated by her fierce husband and husband played with Patrick Bergin and I felt ready to have a powerful film on the same level as Burning Bed Farrah Fawcett. Well, if the summary says I was a golfer. This film was not like a Burning Bed, which was powerful and Farrah played a part of a woman who really felt, and felt her pain and her need to live. Sleeping and Enemy was removed after the first act of fun with Roberts making his death to avoid her husband and go to Iowa. Her husband for the first time believes she is dead but she begins to grow suspicion that she can be alive and stops after her. Another part of the movie is essentially a cat game with a mouse and Julia to find a house in this small town in Iowa and change its identity .... no mention of how she got the money for this but this time in the film I don't care about it all. He meets a boy (Mr. Nice wimpy) and falls for him and her husband finally find him but not before planning a soup surgery and overcoming the kitchen. This I was thinking to give cheerful pleasure to the audience. But I was not worried if she was a abusive wife because the film as I said to deceive the audience. If it had been standing I would certainly feel for her and her situation. Of course the husband is killed and all is well for the younger Ms. Roberts. If only the real world was close to this .... See the Burning Room and you understand what the film thinks as on the effects of domestic abuse.
