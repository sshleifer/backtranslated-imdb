I was expecting to see children of dreams for a good time ... what and every delightful reviews, selection and attention of the media. And I must say, the first quarter of the movie was good! It showed real black music at the time. However, as the movie wore, I and all my family were honored due to our wits. Singing just went on, one after another. I mean, just one number of music and it would have broken even with RENT. Additionally, I found hardly any development of behaviors in any characters; I just didn't care what happened to them! Even when Eddie Murphy's behavior died from drug abuse, I knew I had to be sad, but I had no feeling for that attitude. The characters were given a background of flimsy about singing in their childhood and whatnot, but there are personal characteristics not revealed enough to catch me. Finally, the crisis was not enough enough to look at the viewer, which goes along with the lack of character development. This movie reminded the movie-based movie Ray, Chicago, and Tax (Ray and Chicago were good movies in my opinion). In general I think this movie is suitable for a person who doesn't care about the general story, but will still enjoy two fun and interesting exhibitions.
