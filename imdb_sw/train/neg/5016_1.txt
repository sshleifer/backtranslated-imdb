Nick Stahl's name, a girl who was beaten with an attractive VHS cover made me buy and watch this flick, hoping to see a beautiful movie of the youth. What a trick! It's full of clich√©s screens, conversations and displays are horrible, horrible, horrible, terrible, terrible? to summarize, the full waste of time. There is no fear, black humor, just a very sad story, and points of shame of conspiracy. The movie begins with six characters, in fact three couples, as a group of friends, but in fact they are very bad guys who seem to be enemies, playing a stupid game called "Taboo", and each one writing yes or no certain issues of taboo. That is: no initial development of the characters, the viewer does not know who, their intentions and relationships. Then, there is an ellipsis up to a year later, and the group gathers together in the New Year's New Year, which is offensive. But the plot and misleading are ridiculous, predictable, largely and unknown that it is not recommended any extra line in my opinion. Only one advice: don't waste your time or money on this trash, you will certainly regret it. My vote is one (bad) <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Tagoo ?? Jogando Com o Assassino" ("Characteristics Playing with Assistant")
