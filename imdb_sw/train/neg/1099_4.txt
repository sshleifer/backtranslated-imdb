I was shocked by the amazing plot of Tigerland. It was a fantasy of kind of how the army should be. The negotiations were difficult to swallow as well as things of Colin Farrell's behavior were allowed to eliminate his chief officers. I continued to think, "Hey, there is a reason for the boot camp is hard. They have to put soldiers in battle and turn them into a single unit of cooperation. There is no chance of cocky view and men who can't follow orders." The reason was dangerous for fellow soldiers. I don't want to fight with someone like him in war because he was more concerned with the feelings of people than doing what was needed to protect his unit. <br /> <br />
