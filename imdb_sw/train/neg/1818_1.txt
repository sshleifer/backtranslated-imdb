Connie Hoffman is very good and very interesting at all times. <br /> <br /> That is, people. The only reason to consider whether to watch this film or not. These pieces of the 70-year sex assault sometimes make entertainment because of their datedness (pants, big hair, Zapata hips etc.). This is not. <br /> <br /> Script is bad, acting is bad, direction is bad, and the idea of ​​having a senior sex guide is very bad. The head, which hates the sex comedy, is very corrupting. I recommend you to resist this as a blow.
