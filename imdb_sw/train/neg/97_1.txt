I have not seen many low-budget films I must admit, but this is the worst movie probably perhaps, the main character that the person said like, had a lobotomy and losing power to say more than one word every 5 seconds, 5 years old can do well . The story had the worst conspiracy, and the young soldier had set up what he thought was an army and then went just over, I just looked to laugh how bad it was, and I was hoping it was leading to a real movie. I do not believe that it was less than 2 night rental thing in blockbusters, rather than please take this for free and get out of our presence. I think there was one of the best half actors than the woman, I think the only thing right and the budget was built, but it shows every important area of ​​the film at the beginning of music. Just too bad.
