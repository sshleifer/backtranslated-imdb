The little boy comes a lot of money and begins to live. Unfortunately, someone whose money happens to be very bad. He wants to lose her again. When he realizes who has bucks, he starts to try to get it again. He continues to be weakened by this little child who is lucky enough to stop falling into the hands of the wicked. Voice recognition, I'll have to. Very likely, not quite interesting. Come with a little something different, real boys?
