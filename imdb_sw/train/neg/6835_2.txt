I don't see how anyone likes Van Damne would like this film. <br /> <br /> The movie really begins with a certain promise. I would say the action scenes at the beginning of the movie is the best. Practical events and ward counts trying to save twins are a good start and leads to a great story. However, the film is a whole mountain down. It would be nice if the director could sit with the original premise. These are brothers born in different parts of the world and learning different skills. One brother should have skills in Martial Arts, but another brother should have skills in weapons. It is so simple when it happens that a brother who has never taken a gun before suddenly is a great markman, and a brother who has not read any military art is suddenly making division and upper boundaries. br /> <br /> plot, action, etc. is just plain ignorance. My favorite scenes? When is Van Damne fighting with armed soldiers and AK-47. Soldiers are almost nadi yards. Instead of the aim and shot at Van Damne he is making a cry of war as he has the battle of war and run away from him. Van Damne begins to pick up a pistol from a fallen soldier and fetch him, ... while he is still around 75 to 80 kilometers. <br /> <br /> This movie has one of the last despair. Bolo Yeung is a skilled artist. However, instead of fighting well. Bolo is throwing barrels in Van Damne as Donkey Kong. A very modern movie that had many promises. If your fan of Van Damne, forget your time and see Hard Target or one of its original films.
