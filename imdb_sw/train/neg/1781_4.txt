Written by Stephen King, but these treatments were not as strong as most of his stories on the film. Mother and baby enter the small town of Indiana. They are Sleepwalkers, the species of fiber that brings young people. This small story has its parts of the effects of the gore and specific; with breathing tips. Alice Krige is better as a mother. Others seem to be Madchen Amick, Brian Krause and Cindy Pickett. Check out very small roles for John Landis and Clive Barker. Stephen Stephen King as guardian of the cemetery.
