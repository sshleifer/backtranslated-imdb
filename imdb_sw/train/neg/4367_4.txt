One of the real clinkers of Boris Karloff. In fact Karloff's death (looking over 120 years of age than he was) a scientist needs money to finish his trials before he dies. Moving from Morocco where his support is taken by another person is going to southern France where he makes a doctor while trying to give enough money to prove his theories. Failure of money works with a good shepherd of cotton wool. She gives him a bag if he helps her husband so that she can take her money and continue with the gigolo (who I think is married). If you think I got it by watching the wrong film, I had to read how other people were published to find out what happened. Why? because this film has lost me for two minutes. I had no idea what was going on with many of its characters and many lines of conspiracy. Little is written and many are not recorded until the end and when I don't care. His improper defect for interest in Karloff's performance is common at times. This is the only time I have ever seen him as a member of the wonderful Lugosi area. Not every area but few and it makes me wonder how much they had.
