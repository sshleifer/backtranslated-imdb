One of the most worthless movies about computer software. Looking at the filmmakers do not know the realization of the world organizers. <br /> <br /> 20 top apps in the world, software that have satellites own (why?), a software that uses a satellite frek, someone who kills a person to compose a code (why?) and a lot of stupid time in this film . <br /> <br /> People who are not programmers will see something big in the movie, because they are not experts on this. But people will not see real things. Observers will see that the most unusual and frightening film - because much time in the film has not been addressed in real life (why the film is not suitable in this case?).
