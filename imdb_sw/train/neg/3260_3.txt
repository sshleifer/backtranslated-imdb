Doc Savage: Man of Bronze is a bad movie. Written for evil, most of the work, and just plain silly. That is said ... in fact it's a enjoyable movie for a certain level. This film asks to be viewed in the group with full supply of cheap beer. It's one of those movies like "Santa Claus defeats Martians" or "Yor, Hunter from the future" ... is very serious. If you have a right group of people this film is an explosion outlook. It's a campy. It's fun. It has Sousa head. If you're looking for a good film though, look elsewhere. 3/10. <br /> <br /> BTW, I've heard the rumor studio looks at the possibility of remake ...
