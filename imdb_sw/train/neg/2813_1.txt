I usually didn't rent a movie like this, because you know it would be just bad to look at the box. I beat seven movies at one time, including a dream on Elm Street 5, 6 and Night Night of Wes Craven. Unfortunately, when I got home I realized the video-video boy gave me a wrong tape. In the Night Night box of Wes Craven I've found this highly relaxed movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is very awesome, acting is bad and the plot does not mean anything. It's hard to write a good review, because I don't know what the movie was nearby. At the end of the film you have more questions then you answer. <br /> <br /> In 'Max Power Power of 1 to 10' I tested this movie: 1 <br /> <br /> PS I would like to correct Correct Correction (below below mine). He says Robert Englund breaks horses, riding a horse, etc.. The boy who did these things was Mahmoud, played by Juliano Mer, not Robert Englund.
