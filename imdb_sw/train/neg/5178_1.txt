I feel it is my responsibility as a lover of horrible films for other hot people on this horrible and worst movie "fear". Don't waste your time or your money on this film, acting is bad, the story is just one of the bad things I saw and the script was so bad. Nothing about it is good, you're about to figure out why I'm looking at this trophy. The plan had many holes in it and it has never been opened at the end, it was so bad, I don't know how a horrible film could be made. As I said before I loved the horror movies and I was leaving it, it was 18 but you see a little blood and no scares or fly altogether. Also what he heard is how stupid things happened in a film that was not sure of a plot at all like a brother and sister kissing, why? it's all I can say. No worries, there are many more awesome films out there, don't waste your life when it's too short.
