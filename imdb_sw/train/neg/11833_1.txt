So do not think about this lease from the mall, because this is a one-on-one movie bad. You think JJ Abrahams has written this movie. Basically, the mouse faces a toilet and somehow has to come out. The “Shrek” fan of fans can enjoy, but “Wallace & Gromit” fans will be loved. Also, why didn't they do it in plastic or clay? I mean, animation of CGI? For the AARDMAN movie ?? !! Obviously, Aardman circled during allowing Dreamworks to do the whole thing. Wrong, wrong, WRONG !!! Almost every single character is bad, away from the frog boy, who is just the same as the movie boy. But everything else about the film is DULL, DULL, DULL !!! I almost slept with the weight of watching this film. No, waiting, in fact, I had already slept with the weight of watching this film. It's just awesome. But thanks, it's not as bad as "Shrek."
