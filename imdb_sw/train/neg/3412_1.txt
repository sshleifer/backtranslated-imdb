First, the IFC runs Town and Country, and now this. The difference between that stinker and this Pink-up-off Panther is that the Town and Country was watchable. This is not. I can only find out that they are registered for this so they can overcome Europe on someone else's dime. Belarus is particularly aggressive. His status with Candy (making De-Zuise of Z-grade) was tortured. Speaking of torture, five minutes of Pastor's talent, and I bound the prisoners in Gitmo without resembling walnuts! The real "crime" (rather than having green color) is the attitude of Pastor: mousy wife who takes casino Monte Carlo for half a million bucks! If you buy it, I have a marine property in Arizona you might be interested in!
