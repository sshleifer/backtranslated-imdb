Woo Allen has lost his ability to write dialogue or characters who are clearly defined from each other. This is the case with "Melinda and Melinda," where all the characters talk to the modern architecture of Allen and have trouble with views of opinions that cannot be restored to anyone outside the fourth area that Allen lives. They also share the same ability to afford many Manhattan rooms that seem to have been created by professional professionals regardless of their financial status or what they do for survival. <br /> <br /> The character that is outside of these positive thoughts is Will Ferrel as a duty of Woody Allen. Although he does not know just like doing just Woody Allen sensation (like Kenneth Branagh in god-bad "celebrity"), Ferrel has no charm or charisma that Woody real was when he played his own part in his best movies. The end result is another in a string of enough cars from one film manufacturer who has been doing business for its former reputation for years.
