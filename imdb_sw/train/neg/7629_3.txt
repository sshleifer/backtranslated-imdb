I have given this film a very good place, and it has denied it. This is much less excuse and white excuse to produce spiritual out of the audience even though Bogdanavich's pride (who made the best way with TARGETS) gets "a great exhibition" out of tons of hams in their debuts. There is a lot of clich√©s of young sex from this film, such as Making a Teacher's Wife, Impotence, Making Ugly Bride (which is very beaten and hitting things to complete, not that things had gone anywhere). <br /> <br /> I think this movie should be funny because of all sexual intercourse, to me, it was just to upset. I was more happy to clean my finger nails than to watch this mess.
