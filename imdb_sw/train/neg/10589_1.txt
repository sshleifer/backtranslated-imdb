Universal Army: Return is not a very bad film made. No, that honor would go to a film that tried to make some kind of statement or achieve some artistic work but failed in a sad or offensive manner. However, there is probably no movie I have tried in a bit and it was as successful as the Universal Army: The Return. <br /> <br /> This film is a sci-fi / action travesty which has nothing to recommend. Acting is as bad as any movie I saw. The plan is awesome and impossible. Special effects are awesome. In short, anyone even connected to this film should be ashamed of themselves. United States: Returns creates the initial position of Van Damme to be seen as the center of the filming decline. Some movies are very bad, it's good. Believe me when I tell you that this is not one of them. I'm not sure of what else to say here. I assure you that many people were considering watching this movie if they were not ready, but only if: they don't.
