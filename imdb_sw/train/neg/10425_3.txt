This movie is good, committed - but in a way that tells the story of BAD very much. Stella is very bad, and has never learned better. Her husband is a wonderful snobby and a small mind. Nor did he learn better. What? Is this true? Somehow, Stella understands that her daughter is embarrassed by her behavior and dress, but she can't understand that she just needs to drop down? I don't think so. Stella is a beautiful woman, and a very good mother. Submitting yourself, so his daughter may be associated with a group of overdue snobs is disgusting. Much of what we see may be common at times - people with beer or two, enjoy the piano player, dancing - but it becomes a certain kind of decline. "I can't have our baby living this way!" Give me. This story tells me the same thing: that the Risk of Unemployed Work can never expect to be desired on the Top Things. And that's just a hogwash burden.
