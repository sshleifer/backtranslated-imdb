Although I have never been a kind of person who does not know someone else's taste; if you like something, that's okay. But, this film was awesome and there is no way around. I don't like Ani Difranco very much, but he is a guitarist and author, that I can accept. But I can't accept that there are any features of redemption on this film. Many people have the way that it is an appropriate exhibition of issues that high school students face. Maybe, but everything is very displayed. There seems to be an attempt at "Guns Naked" - a form of the esque comedy, but time is discontinued; there is a great space between each line participants, as they hold the laughter (he had nothing). Anyone who wrote the script was on the place. They tried to call many controversial issues together in one film, almost never to fully develop any of them (especially the girl getting impregnated by the teacher). I did not laugh at all this film. I was so trembling with this quest of humor and satire to do anything but my eyes on the screen.
