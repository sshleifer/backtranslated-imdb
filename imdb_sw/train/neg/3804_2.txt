This is a bad film at any rate. The story in the Match Match had a certain genius, with a focus and writing a particular fascination (Woody Allen combining its own culture with that of the classic English killing and examining what could be done with it). <br /> <br /> Scoop, however it doesn't have this thing. It is well documented, two guidelines are hopeless woods and the story itself has no interest at all. Type that spoofs requires at least some kind of subplot and description descriptions and tie-ups (why the Tarot card and the keys placed under French corners in locked rooms?) various mobile phones (Jade Scorpion / Pink Purple Cairo etc.) have given us many pleasure for years. Even the end of Hollywood had a great idea. Sadly his inspiration has left him this time.
