Wow. I thought this might be bad but it was worse than I thought! Sometimes I like to watch a good film "car-crash": those that are so bad that you can't look away because you want to see how they can get bad. This is the only reason I can leave the TV. It was not a lot of work, which was more special or worse than one could expect from this, but the premise and the plot that should not be seen to be the light of the day. This document, too, is ill-inducing. As for the cinema, did anyone else see that they used a device "drawing" device, like in the 50's show of the TV ... but without hearing? At first I thought they should wear but the movie takes itself seriously to have used this in a language-and-cheek way. Don't even ask about the mark ... just the top shape is the last song, and Morcheeba. I think they wanted to leave people for something of their $ 8 ... pleasure I saw on TV !!!!! Just stupid! I wonder if this is why Timothy Hutton has been struggling to find a lot of work soon? I think if you don't expect too much, and you want to look at unnecessary desires, it would be better to spend evenings making your notes, that's why it is appropriate 2.
