Madhur gave us the power of the movie Chandni Bar in the past. Her next movie Page 3 was one of the worst movies all the time. It seems to describe the story of other high class in India. After seeing the area where the person empowers someone for sexual reasons in the Movie. I felt like screaming and breaking the DVD. I correctly did it. The reason why the film had child pornography and abuse. I burst and was surprised to see a movie showing children of honey. Smaller components, there was no need to show children perfectly naked. One of the rich people like to beat the poor children and sell them to foreign people, British men in this film. I am shocked to know this film was Hit in India's locations, otherwise Super Flop in the UK, USA and Australia. I am from England, and this kind of stuff makes the disease, should not be released in the UK.
