From the beginning of the film, the impressor tries to show something, it means to say that instead of a story describing the style in which the film should be made, he has gone in a different way, he was a kind of argument that he wanted to do, and wrote a story to follow. And he is very defeated. I think he was trying to make a stylish film. Any way I think this movie is a waste of time and effort. In the director's loan, he knows the media he is working with, what I'm trying to say when I see the movie worse than this. Here at least the director knows to maintain continuity in the film. And actors have also provided good performance.
