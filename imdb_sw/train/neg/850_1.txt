This should be a stupid film that I have ever seen (fronters)! First of all, the plot is stupid. The young child is old and they move to a hotel because his father is a guardian. We see that the child has a gift, "Shine". This gift has never had anything to do with anything except to make the child as cold. Then the movie gets more boring and stimulating until that person finally goes crazy. He continues to kill a child and his wife because ... well, he feels like that. Why would he do that? Suddenly we see a naked woman in a tub. The man kisses and knows he is dead dead, which is absolutely disgusting. Somehow the black man comes to the hotel and is hit by the ax. Then the baby and the woman take the black man's car and leave the father, who dies within a minute of hypothermia. Many movies are not full of time, but this falls into that category. Music is a trashy, the characters are corny (except Jack Nicholson, who is a good actor), the plot emerges and resembles the details of the concerts, the end is very predictable, the storyline is slow, stimulating, and stimulating. This movie has been imported too. AVOID MOVIE RIGHT IN ALL. I am surprised that it got the highest score on IMD.
