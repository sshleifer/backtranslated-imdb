I couldn't expect much from this film, but a young man, I didn't expect the movie to be bad. Chris Rock does not show a good act here, you can't get the impression that its main character is real, I think the movie would be better if it was a dance or romantic game would be a small part of the movie and more / better humor involved. The movie is like the film creators had a bad hangover to do it. In "decisions" do not show one smile. This is a very bad film! I paid three out of ten for a few waiting to give me, but I never did!
