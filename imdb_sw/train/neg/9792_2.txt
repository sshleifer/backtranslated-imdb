WANTS TO BE REQUIRED TO REQUEST IN MANGA IN MY EDUCATION. <br /> <br /> This animation has been very disappointing because it has removed the comedy and the above stage of manga and OVA. What left behind was the horn of what would have been. Many of the characters did not have the depth that appears on the manga. Alucard is not a compassionate attitude that requires death in secret. Walter's story is not good. And the Nazi victims who intend to bring the world into the war never cease. Instead, the anime provides Gary Stu villain Incognito who has failed against what appears to be wrong. My primary complaint is not that anime comes from manga, but it does a bad job.
