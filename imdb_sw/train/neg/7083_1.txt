My husband rented this from a video store thinking it was suspended. (He has not read parallel). Well, it'll be funny if that thing could be seen. Not only. One thing often, no preference, and where did they find someone leading? The leading man, Michael Des Barres, even the most beautiful, especially for this given role. Also, sexual abuse in the work is nothing, if you want to see, lease "Cricton" of Michael Crichton. At least Michael Douglas appeared well in the early 90s. Alexandra Paul, who appears, plays a shameful place here. There are more lighting effects than your home network. Don't waste this rental time. 0/10.
