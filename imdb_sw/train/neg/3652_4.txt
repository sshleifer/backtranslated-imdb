I watched this film in DVD format. My text may have been affected but I was treated with a lack of DVD's screen. I will say that my first reason to watch this movie was Claire Forlani. During a fun look, I feel that he did not live up to my expectations that I have now from his other films. I was really glad to see Arkin changing the performance. The other two characters didn't have much knowledge and so I can't compare their performance, however they were happy too. Acting is the only quality of this film in my opinion. The story line, while others could say a little compelling, did not have any leadership. I feel that the main problem comes from the script and not the direction of this film. If you enjoy any of these actors at the right rate then I recommend this film, but otherwise leave alone.
