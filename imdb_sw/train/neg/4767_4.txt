I watched this film if I liked a plot, a group of visitors was closed while trying to find out how it was connected. <br /> <br /> Layout and columns have been affected by the first (and better) Viewing the movie and although there were not many steps the story moved at a good pace. There was access to comedy ion type of arguments 'Alpha men' two and it was a welcome surprise (for me however) to see Melissa Joan Hart did not stop on acting yet. A few things leave me alone; 1. The predecessor was the most effective way to get him to give everything from children to bodies. MJH's line about his girl 'found him in this' when he was true, was a little eligible person to be there, he did not have KNOWINGLY contributed to events leading up to capture. <br /> <br /> 3. At the end ..... what kind of movie only crowded in the middle of something going on? There was no resolution, no hanger of cliff, no end end ... it's just the last <br /> <br /> And so alone I left two stars off my rating. The second word I could allow to slide but not end!
