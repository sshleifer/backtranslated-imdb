A romantic and false sense of unemployment from middle-class artists and well-born ... It is clear that the author of the author never had a direct unemployment and certainly has no personal experience. If you are reluctant to believe this unfounded story, men who are unemployed of all ages act like young people, they are not angry, afraid, no confusion, etc.. All characters live on daylight by carrying tanks, joke jokes. They never look at the work, never never refuses to refuse or pain, etc. Live on the dollar is just like a summer vacation from school ... Fraudsters. Especially if you can compare with modern work from Lo Loach's lovers, etc..
