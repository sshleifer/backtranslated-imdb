One of the worst films I saw. I was very tired and opened it in the middle to watch the news. When I turned again, I fell asleep. The movie begins with a dream, continues to dream, and ends with dreams. Then there are several more dreams in the middle. Come, what should put me on that? Film needs to have an interesting reason. The minute you saw that the film was just a dream at any reasonable time of film-goer is determined. What? Has anyone ever insisted to tell you their dreams and what it means to them? This is !!! <br /> <br /> Pre-awesome.
