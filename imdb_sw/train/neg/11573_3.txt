I came here for last night's inspection before deciding on what TV film is in front, and the ones I found made this visibility impossible. How wrong I am! First, it needs to be explained in advance that this is a very afternoon movie. The exhibition is a timber, every effort is a 'poignant' attempt through the day-to-day cinema and many soap houses have been, and are based on that predictable and entertaining foundation that men (especially soldiers) are violent and unkind. The whole movie is about the 'drama' that is seen when the male characters threaten to develop a second dimension. If that seems to be itself (or even fun) to you, then be warned. The German motivation of Linda Hamilton, a very good time, is very troubling - like her face, for some reason. Other exhibitions are no doubt the cause of shame for their criminals, and the characteristics of a narrow and clear pain are a day-to-day procedure. There is a little surprise, but see the supply of endless food and drinks for 'Monty Pythonesque' which comes with a miracle of starving soldiers! I expected the action, but I expected a good or a text or a emotional charge. I found it a very bad story of a 'feelgood' Christmas that would have a minded audience involved in all situations. Looking at the bottom of the situation: 1: Nothing else. 2: You are a fan of 'housewife' predicts take men with the success of television movies. 3: The only way that you can appreciate the true story is when Hollywood returns to a feature film. 4: You have been spontaneous enough that your feelings can be easily influenced by an incomprehensible story.
