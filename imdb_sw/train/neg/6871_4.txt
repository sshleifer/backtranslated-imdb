A great idea has gone wrong. A bad job, even writing more .... After looking at the first two pieces I was wondering why you ever made it two seasons. The characters are forgetting, the text is poor, the set is the same. Specific effects are only sad - better is done at the same time - where money goes to this? The first time that starts interesting then goes down the descent - the command of the whole show is just silly. Now don't suggest, I am a big fan of Sci-Fi and 'geek' - but this just shows it doesn't cut it. As I said at the outset, I am really surprised that it did this for the second season - the best is deleted after just one season (Jake 2.0 for example). This version was very bad.
