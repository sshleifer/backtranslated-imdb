Where to start. The movie was beautiful. When the movie started because of previous environmental events I thought I was on a good film. Then the bigfoot cgi showed .It was seen as drawing pictures of the king of the Lion and the son of King Kong's love. Now I realized there was no Bigfoot to hunt people around the forest for no visible reason but cartoon cheesy cgi. So from that time the whole movie was shot to me. It was the most costume cost ever no one could compare with him. I am a fan of the Bigfoot movie of Hardcore and I warned about this film but my compulsion led me to see this film and I had been encouraged as the previous comments told me. I know after reading this review you will still say "I should watch the Sasquatch hunters, you must look at the Sasquatch hunter." Then you will say why I have lost my good money on a very bad movie!
