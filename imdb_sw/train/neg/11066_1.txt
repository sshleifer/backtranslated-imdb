Before checking "Dahmer," I thought no movie could be worse than "Freddy Got Fingered." I was wrong. In total "Dahmer" above, it is a story about gay gay killer that involves no murder and almost completely to meet Dahmer with male males before being killed. There is no plot found, and it is not even used as far as telling us anything about "Dahmer." All you will learn about Dahmer from watching this film is that he liked to have sex with men. Poor acting, leading terrible, writing awesome, everything horrible ... If you should choose between watching "Dahmer" and vomiting for a projectile for three hours, going and vomiting .... it would be more ...
