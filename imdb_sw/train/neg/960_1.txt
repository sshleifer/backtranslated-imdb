O dear. I was shocked that this movie was just a hit for Ringu in Japan. Well, I think U.S. made their version too, but at least it was a clear remake. So, so sad. I enjoy enjoying Filipino movies and knowing some of the things can happen in such a small country, so I can't believe that this is done. Claudine and Kris are great names there, wondering what they would be linked to preference. For filmmakers who are out there in the Philippines: You have to come down here to get money. There are many films that look at Filipinos films and have fun!
