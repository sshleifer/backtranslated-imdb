Basically this is a great shadow of Higher Honesty, which was a beautiful and awesome film with several characteristics of winning turns. Watch the explorers nothing. The geek shop geek has removed its feet and the mysterious woman of quirky is beautiful but does not fully support or sufficiently, because the very weak script and miscasting of heads, not to mention any lack of any visual story-telling. I mean, this film is standing next to the MOVIES, but itself is uncinematic! That's a great failure there. <br /> <br /> But the main problem is we are not just worried about the main characters because the script and executives (Murphy and Liu) fail to make them true or any kind of real way. So the film becomes just a series of events involving two people, well, not very interesting. Oh, yes, another thing: For a romantic comedy? It's not funny. And romance is not very romantic, either. <br /> <br /> So avoid. Even in its run for 90 minutes it's just not worth staying through ...
