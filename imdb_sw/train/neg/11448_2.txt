In fact there is no bad film like 'Perfect Stranger', but not just interesting. Could not connect to one type of comedy - jumped from SNL, to Adam Sandler-esquire, for romantic, for small teen scores, for string, and for 'Loser' comedies. Although there was a very exciting time of the fall (falling down the hill), nobody had a wonderful color or better in any way. The 'Schindler' list was funnier (and short-lived). never knew if Andy Samberg was supposed to be in secondary school, leaving a university, or just someone living at home with her mother - Sissy Spacek, in her worst position. And the poor Ian McShane, the magnificent Masters as I just had the same name, is given a crap read in the camera. The story comes out and predicts until the end (no destroyers here if the mother of Adam Samberg wants to see it). Do not use any money to see this film, and maybe Lorne Michaels will get the impression and start producing quality (Yes, the World of Wayne's movies and Tommy Boy are quality).
