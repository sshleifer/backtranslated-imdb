The above title is used to introduce the film "Gen" to its audience. Gen is about a little doctor (Doga Rutkay) and a sick mother. The film begins with the departure of her mother to start her new career. When it runs, we realize that he is not a close house as the hospital is located in a remote area. As soon as he entered the hospital garden, he saw the body of the patient's death. This is the beginning of a dream for the next few days. Two policemen come to the hospital to investigate suicide. In fact, they will have to stay in hospital because all roads have been cut off due to poor weather conditions. All their contacts with the outside world are also cut off. There is no way out! In those few days, there will be more serious killings. Now everyone is accusing one another. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the idea is brilliant. It can be very scary. There are beautiful sides of the movie of course. I really like the beginning of the film. In particular, when it runs the hospital and its first time in the hospital. Works are suitable. Some of them are struggling to be difficult and frightening though. I think the last shock should be spread inside through the film. What I say is, it was a good twist but instead of showing it as a parody at the end, we should realize that it was coming when we see what happens. The director needed to clarify what I think did not work well. Also the most dangerous in the movie should be 48 years old but his body seems to be small and fit for a person who uses most of his life at this hospital. Finally, I would like to say a few things about the director. I am sure he will improve. This is his first attempt. I recently found that he is only 21 years old. That made me feel better about him and his future films. I can't measure this film * without *****.
