This movie was like "Disney Center after Darkness." Taking the language "is not naughty" with the theme and you have left with conversations and plot devices that insult the mind of anyone not explaining "Saved by Bell" as a high-quality television. The discussion was beaten and dirty, one could think of the screenplay was a barrier to Aaron Spelling and Joe Eszterhas in the room and the command to generate an amalgam of every bad script every hand got in creating. If that was the intention of Roger Kumble, the message was completed.
