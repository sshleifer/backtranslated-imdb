It should be the event of high-tech corniest on the air. This is probably the escape of Jim Belushi and all his bad movies. His brother drew all the talents out of a little brother. I hope this show has been deleted and has not been told again except for abuse. Jim should retire or something. Please let them get air. If I am here joke from the show I will throw my eyes out with a toothbrush. Id instead of being taken from the devil himself rather than looking at the full half of that clock piece of software. I still don't understand why the show is still in the air and runs. We all know very much that we want to shoot our TV screens when we see Jim's face. In conclusion, not more please.
