Can Pix can ever, ever, do anything right? This movie meant to appear on TV in the format of the letter. Since A-Pix does not believe in the pan and skan, we see all the events where the shoulder side of the screen speaks to the right side. Of course, it's not that you lack a lot. This movie is very bad. It is very difficult to enjoy a film where characters shout at their lungs during 80% of the movie without cause.
