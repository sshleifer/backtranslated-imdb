It has never seen the original film in the series ... I believe it was the best movie than this or the series carried out in the 1980s if not how these two terrible sequels were right. This movie had a good leadership when they announced to be displayed in one of the old independent stations that is now a thing of the past. Anyways looks like it would be a good movie to be awesome. It was, however, a film that would make movies of Walt Disney see dark. True, this movie was just a group of light fluff and virtually no boggy creek appearance. Just seeing it is close to the end when you see its shape during heavy rains, except that there is almost no sign of a creature that was very tired as a child. The story is in fact the old hunter of evil should kill anything they see and after a village of boggy village with your children out to help each other or some hairy guy of random in the forest that likes to pull random boats through water. It is not worth looking at that I would even see the original, who made the arrangement of it would also make a bad creature of the 80-year-old bogus, but also made a very good movie of the slasher in the 70's "The Town The Dreaded Sundown".
