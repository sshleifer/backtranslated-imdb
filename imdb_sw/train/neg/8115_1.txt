This movie was a horrible experience of the lost film that I have endured, and what is worse is the fact that I had to look at it, and I had no chance to stop because it was school! Actually, the story of the story was good ... but I've had to do a great deal! Away is Marianne Jean-Baptiste, I thought her performance was amazing. He was showing alone, without him, I doubt I could watch the film. Every time I hear someone says "awesome" I cringe! I almost attack the customer the other day because they said "it's". It made me remember one of the worst hours and half of my life! <br /> (I apologize if this has criticized anyone, I only show my opinion)
