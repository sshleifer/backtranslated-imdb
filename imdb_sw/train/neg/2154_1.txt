Let's confess. I saw this video being used and purchased because Guttenberg appeared as sexy in its underwear on the jacket. But inside was another story. In addition to the fact that the movie was essentially a parody of the "invisible" special effects of a variety of forms (visible and other notes), the script lost no chance - it actually came out of its way - to undermine all non-WASP communities and real gay or-thinking. Every verbal abuse from a person in the script was either homophobic or racist or both. Approaching your leaks, with shaky sounds, photo camera camera pictures and melodramatic stories. However, the latter is the amount of surprise. But when you come there, you can't keep a little. Such a bad, can be a very good movie.
