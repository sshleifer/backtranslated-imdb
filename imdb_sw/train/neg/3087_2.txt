A very dirty hoe group is harassed by some of the old buttons that some of the older people carry out a bag of nightclubs have placed a barrier in the film area for twenty years without any reason. Most people know this film just from the MST3K-on ribbing flick. But I have seen the real movie and I can safely say that it is the worst, in fact, the worst. From one of the worst cases of 'fighting' I have ever witnessed 'foreign visitors' that have lack of motion (I had My Pet Monster that was so bad) to the act of anger (I had My Monster Monster which was the most scandal) ) However, that being said the film "Vice Academy" of Rick Sloan is somehow, and believe I have an idea of ​​how worldly, worse. That's not suggesting that this film is anything but just, because it's not. Just throw it out there. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: there is no dirt in the appropriate movie, but there are two pairs of tits in DVD Introduction to films / <br /> My bridge: D-<br /> <br /> Publishing of Retromedia DVD: Introduction to Jim Wynorski; Gallery of yet; and Trailer for this film
