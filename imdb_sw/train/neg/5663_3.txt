This is Zatoichi movies like "Star Trek" movies should be "Star Trek" - except that in this case every one of nature was fun and more interesting than this great, emerging, and well-made, if the substance is important more than the surface. If I have never seen them, I would think this looks good but does not; since I was, I thought his style didn't fit and its content was not enough. The idea of ​​reviving behavior in mass production, should have been clearly seen, but there was no uncertainty in it, except the hope of making money; it is just a show, which in particular fails to capture the world of character's behavior and completely can not take the character wherever he was not ready (too, the actor had no better). I would have hoped to see this in the last stage of life, in a story that could have seen him out of beauty and implement a conclusion from his general experience; this only repeats bits and pieces from other films, organized by more sex and sfx violence. It's not quite the same experience.
