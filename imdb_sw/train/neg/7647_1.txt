Madison cut bridges is the best version of this story. I felt that the end of this film was not carefully done as they did in the original English movie. This movie is very indianised, if you are a very sensitive person who shares in the movie when the hero die at the end you love this movie, On the other hand if you are a fighter in life and imagine the cry is for wimps you can not like the end. But in general it is a very good shape being handled in India's situation. Tabu was as good as a wife and a caring mother. Everyone did well.
