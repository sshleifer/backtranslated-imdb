The Leap-age stars have heavy hitters in the film area and the television and regional area. And yet, they can't save this film. It has many things that are against it - on acting, overly melodramatic, poor script, the same dimension; and very few things going - a decent music, a good movie movies. This opinion is for anyone who gives us all local movies inside one basket after watching this movie and saying all local movies are bad. Please do not judge others according to this single film. This is a TV opera sample that builds as a favorite film. My hopes were high when I bought my ticket and my hopes were hit five minutes on the film.
