I tried as hard as I could sit all the way through this irritating mess, but I just can't do it. Brad Dourif fully watched as the leadership and cast all were just worse. Anything is not just, due to the bad FX's laughable practice for a stupid plot. <br /> <br /> To complete the desired time; don't bother. The root of cancer treatment will be more enjoyable. The roots of bamboo under the fingers will be the most beautiful. <br /> <br /> Watching the film Uwe Boll will only be worse than this. Get the idea?
