If the Festive Science Festival 3000 fan, I can withstand any image of motion that can insist, but there is no reason for this. It is tested for "Super Action" in the Blockbuster Video section and given no more than "Restriction Barrier" I think these are the only methods that the film manufacturer (HA!) Robert Napton can use to get at least 4.50 for one person who does not recognize. <br /> <br /> Shame you Robert Napton! Be proud of you by using these poor Mexican actors who you probably promised to make it great in American movies. You are shy! <br /> <br /> There is no time in this film that takes a little step. What? Have you used snot on these people? Oh, look, they get a ripe in the field! Like all 6 of them. And not the Asian man behind? Why is it always daytime? Why did it take 1/2 of the movie to show anything .. and most importantly why did we look at another 1/2? <br /> PS: You are offering me 4.50.
