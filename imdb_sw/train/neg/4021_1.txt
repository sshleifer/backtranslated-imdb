This probably the worst movie has made it just badly the name of Roger Corman is associated with it. I could understand in his early years when he had a low budget but now there are no reasons for this birth! I am a misleading "B" movie and from some people the view of all the flicks that I love are put aside by "ordinary viewers" but take my word to this club, Vampire makes up my list of the best. It's hard to think, vampires with no fangs, music marks are not out, sound effects are not enough and eventually Mr.Savage doesn't seem to know he is in the movie vampire when the witch is so bad because he had a "bad" job on all. Let me know if I am difficult for this one reason when I don't like the movie I like to forget about it's nice.
