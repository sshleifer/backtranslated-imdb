I might not have been a big fan of Blair Witch but I still appreciated the effort, so I expected to be transformed, especially after reading the strings of the IMD comments. "Unique", "mind", "future generation" and so on ... you have gotta wonder where people come with these things to describe such a bad effort. <br /> <br /> Because, alas, it was turned into a poor, weak movie that fails to participate in every respect. Deficiency is not funny. Fear is not that. And anything "imagine" poor colleagues felt in this film were due to severe deception because there really was nothing big or smart on this mess. Well, so we don't know anything outside. What? Is the least bear? Is it a good experience in any way? Unfortunately, no. At first, do a very bad job. It is not a stretch to say that many B movies are doing a good job. Poor? Decay and terrible. Conversation? Many amateurs perform better. <br /> <br /> It is really a trend in which puzzles. I did not expect great improvements on Blair's witch but at least a small step forward. Instead, our director seems to be worse at the time, not quite aware of previous experiences. <br /> <br /> If there are great keys in Halari, it's the main set. A large part of the plot takes place in the only place, where the main characters are locked but Sánchez has failed to give any human space. Considering that in Blair's witch, the forest has a great place and it is a character like (opponent, if you would like) as three students, you would think the director could recognize one thing needed here. But no ... this place has no personality because of the wrong direction and don't worry about the details. Nothing can be used here. The hard workers of "Blair Witch" are better to follow Daniel Myrick. Although the result is far from being a gold, it shows a better structure than Sánchez and other studies from the witch witch Blair is used (unfortunately, in a weak story but still).
