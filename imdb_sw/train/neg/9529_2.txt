This cult of worship of 1977 has two clever young people (Sandra Locke & Colleen Camp) who are seen at the home of the richest doctor of the community, George Manning (Seymour Cassel), with the hope of help to find shelter that they cannot see. But these two have other plans in mind, when they see that George's wife is out of town, they finish taking control of the house, connecting George, killing a baby boy while destroying the whole evening one. A wonderful and awesome movie, but the two find only the rewards in the same way as the movie ends. Many go uncomfortable or avoid this film of 30 minutes in it. Otherwise other ways even consider this classic cult. Larry Dodson
