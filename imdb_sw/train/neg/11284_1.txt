I often try to create positive views of movies, but I do not believe that this has passed the script stage. The talk is surprising, acting for a very dodgy, just a bad feeling, and a leadership and pacing is the best scrappy. I do not remember the last time I saw the film really bad. Joseph Fiennes, pretty like him, can only kill his work as soon as it started. Doctor Moreau was no worse than this garbage.
