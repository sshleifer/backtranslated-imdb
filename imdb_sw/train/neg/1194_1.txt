I have seen many movies in my life, but not many as bad as this. It is a film that laughs people of fat, doesn't have a real story, has bad actors, not funny and much more. Is this a movie that you would like to see? I don't think! I think that the creators of the films tried to be original and creative, but it looked like it was done by a 12-year-old child without the full knowledge of movies. The so-called funny part is like the faces of people, or breaking the wind. The tracking if this is the kind of humor you like, then this is your film! <br /> <br /> What! You lose your money on this film!
