The feature of "math" for this is just a gimmick just trying to put this TV show off with millions of other cop displays. just redeeming the feature for this show is Rob Morrow, although his work must be (in vain) after a North assault as registering for this Schlock. <br /> <br /> The limp-ness of "mathematics" feature for the show is divided into one part co-star Lou Diamond Phillips (which only proves that this show is the ultimate refuge of damned.) to get suspects, "mathematics" uses some theory about "bubbles". Therefore, he gives this explanation for a long time that, if we have seen a suspect in places A, B and C, then we can use the "bubble theory" to make calculations where it goes. He does all this on the board, or perhaps with a dirty stick (I cant remember). <br /> <br /> However, when looking at the finished product, he basically took three places, and took a step in the middle and said "Ok, mathematics, here is where we can find someone who has run away." Where the standard, one other character says "Oh, that action also happens to be a cabin where a guy used to live." What? Is that math? Its even merging-f-k ** k ** g-dots !!! This period reminds me of the major lessons I had to work with a bank that had a mathematical analysis that she could do to “support” points that everyone had agreed through through a limited analysis or common sense. <Br /> <br /> Continues to show - When you are a hammer, everything looks like nail. I can't wait for them to stick a NUMB3RS team on OSAMA… They'll have to use calculus, call airstrike in the middle of the mountains, and hit Osama and even scratch five children she uses as a shield ... cuz hey ... all about numbers. <br /> <br /> Interesting TV time.
