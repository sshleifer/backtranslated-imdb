We have reached the ceiling of the inability to this movie. In essence, Dinosaurs enter the ship that was hit by an old fart called Neweyes (which I needed after seeing this film). Apparently, Neweyes hears children's preferences anywhere and decides that she should give permission to children that Dinosaurs brought in modern times to be seen by everyone for abuse. Dinosaurs eat these things that make them smarter (Neither bad screens did not have). By the way, does it seem strange that from ALL of the children of the world, Neweyes gives the intention to bring Dinosaurs in modern times? Why not give the children's wishes to starve? Diseases? War? I mean coming! Does Neweyes have nothing better to do with all this power? Finally, when Dinosaurs arrive in modern times they begin to sing, play and destroy (usually a kind of thing you can see on a bad LSD trip, where you can see T-Rex playing golf and jumping on a spider-man balloon?). They live in the circus and Neweyes Brother Screweyes (???) makes children who have been in contact with dinosaurs sign a non-transparent contract. Why? Why do children sign a non-transparent contract? Screweyes says that if dinosaurs take some ... "Brain-Drain" That will let the kids go. Dinosaurs instead of eliminating the bad part of Screweyes from the link, giving and agreeing to its terms. What ?! This is stupid! They could only destroy him, they made him quit the contract, weeping and went away from the children. I think the film monitors tried to show that violence is bad, which is a moot action when finally dinosaurs escape and a gang of crocodiles cover Screweyes and it seems to eat it altogether. Oh, it's not quite violence! We're back in the wrong, not happy, it's goofy, it's stupid, it's badly written and has some big holes of the plot used for the film. Even for a child film ... this is BAD.
