The boy's journey is just that. I would like to say directly that I watched the 5mins before I could stand up again. As mentioned in other comments, this film does not come into all "very bad is the thing", it's just bad. Acting is bad, sfx is poor, and the story is bland and stupid. Even the excess of absorbing, "the package of the bag" and seem like to hold their weapons as a pistol. Don't worry about this film, the only thing is that, no matter how low your expectations are, you will still be disappointed.
