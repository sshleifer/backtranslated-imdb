Of course I can't understand why the standards of this film are good here, or why Bakshi himself thought it was his best film. I am a great fan of the original work of Bakshi - especially 'Heavy Traffic' and 'Wizards', but in fact 'Wizards' (1977) was the best final film he had made. After this, he turned to the district, starting with the "Lord of the Rings" of the diabolical and then moving with the sword and the heavy magic Frank Frazetta, to 'Fire and Ice'. What can I say? This story is appropriate, the animation is the quality of the TV - I insist that it is worse than its 70 - and when 'Witches' had real ideas, art, natural art, and underground, adults, 'Fire and Ice' is designed only for boys 14 years old, and has a group of mind Robinson Crusoe on Mars. Yes, if you liked Gor's books, you might like this. In my view though, this was just another blip in the slide in quality after the 'Wizards' which Bakshi never healed (though he has done some good TV decent stuff soon) <br /> <br /> 4.5 out of 10
