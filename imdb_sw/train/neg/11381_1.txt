Now, I like sci-fi cartoons. However, when "Robotboy" came to Canada at the end of 2006, I was looking for a premiere and I was awesome. Characters are normal and normal (Do they really need to make an African and American man wearing tiger-stripe dresses and talk about Jamacian's emphasis? WHY are all Asian characters with yellow and painter? he needs to have great thighs and chest and always complain?) to the point where items have unrealistic, predictable, largely and sometimes distracting. There are so many buttons, even stripes, on the Astro boy. I would like to describe (youth names for youth): Robotboy / Astro, Kamikaze / Tenma, Constantine / Shadow, Gus / Abercrombie, Tommy / Alejo, Lola / Zoran + Kennedy, Moshimo / O'Shay, and so on. Short abbreviations for "My Life As a Robot of Youth", "Star Wars", "Children's Watant Ninja Turtles", "Kamen Riders", "Sailor Moon" and cooperation. it's off. Do not mention any ethnic / gender discrimination. Do not even get me started on guilt. I'll just tell them they are hidden and it's completely dirty. But with weight. Don't even try to look at this. Especially if you like Astro Boy.
