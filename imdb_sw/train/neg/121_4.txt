Anyone who wrote the screenplay for this movie did not consult any books about Lucille Ball, especially its biography. I have never seen many mistakes in biopic, from his early years in Celoron and Jamestown for years later with Desi. I wrote a whole list of real errors, but it would continue with pages. For all, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of the uninformed people who cannot be shown by anyone except themselves. If I am Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would be angry with how many mistakes were made in this film. The film workers tried hard, but the movie looked very bad to me.
