Given the history of this film director, it is difficult to believe that this was a very bad movie to stay. I was in the European season last night and one of the Heads was there. He had not yet seen the movie and, the boy, was he in amazement. I have not read a book that has stopped, and I do not know if it was rated or appreciated, but I have read "Mandolin's Captain Correlli" and I was given how it was badly changed the screen and it was bad this movie was, I could just assume that something like that happened here. Acting was not bad though there were few raised by many from Farrell. In fact, I can't believe how little I care about any character in this movie. The situation appears on the screen in an empty sequence of anything. Part of Donald Sutherland includes a few scenes where he opens the door, says something and closing again. I kept watching at me when I didn't have cringing on the screen talk. I've never walked on the film but I was tempted to start this time. I paid this film '2' for reasons that seem to be so bad for me but these are the best things I can say about this movie. The first is that I enjoyed the earthquake, and the second was that Salma Hayek got naked and looked good. I can say a little positive little about this movie. Don't ask for any dust, it can't talk!
