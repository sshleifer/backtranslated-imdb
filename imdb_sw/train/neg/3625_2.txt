This is a 50-year-old film. It is very surprising that the American Film Institute has chosen this one for the best American movies of all time. I have seen practically all the movies on that list, and this is one of the most desperate ones. Number of music (and there are many, many of them) are more durable and boring, and have absolutely no relationship with the story. The end of the film has a long cycle of ballet, which usually has no true relationship with the story of the movie. It should be accepted, that it has been done well, music is the same, and play is done by a high level of professionalism - but there is no real reason why the sequence is inserted into the film. <br /> <br /> The main character of the movie is very young and uneven and progressive through unpolite. The age of intelligence is about 14. If you want to see a good music made on the "golden age" of music, go see "Singing In The Rain".
