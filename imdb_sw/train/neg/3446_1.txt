This film on the paper looks like it might be good, after looking though I realized that this film was very bad! The plan is useless, and I think I counted the most beautiful part of the 5000 scenes each one making more boring boring film and ignorance. I expected this night of no-night night to just add to his SCARINESS but the truth was the only thing I feared was music, which can be called shock music, they play opera i mean bad! This film covers all the wrongs about this type of film. Be really sick to say no longer but look for your own risk this film is just a full garbage, Enjoy!
