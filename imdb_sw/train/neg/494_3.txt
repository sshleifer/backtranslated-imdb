Directly directed, the comedy without ignorance that allegedly spoofs "classic" 50s "alien invasion" film, but really no better than them, except of course in the real technical department (harmful makeup makeup). And any spoof which is worse than its goal is penalty failure ("Casino Royale", "Our Flint Man" is worse than almost any movie James Bond). After two hours of hearing the voice of strangers, you will ask for some peace and quiet. (* 1/2)
