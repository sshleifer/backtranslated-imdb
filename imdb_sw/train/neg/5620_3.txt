Certainly there is no reason to explore this further because of the very small and interesting information. The perfect example is when the filmmaker claims "Saul" or Paul of Tarus (the author of the Book of Hebrews says) he does not know the idea of ​​Jesus or man, this concept is either false if he charges others to submit , or does not know what "Bible" says. examining its misleading claims about Hebrews 8.4; which he quotes "If Jesus was on earth, he did not want a priest", so here he puts an ignorant and untrained viewer to accept his false basis. He does what the so-called Bible believers are complaining about doing, right. That is to find objects out of the environment. <br /> <br /> One line of Hebrews 8 is; 1 "Now about the things that we have said this is the sum: We have a great high priest, who is sitting on the right side of the throne of the Kingdom in heaven" The above context is to say about Jesus who was on earth with ASCENDED heaven after his resurrection of claims. It does not relate to how a movie manufacturer needs a viewer to take a line of text. Here he gives the foundation, that "Paul was not aware of JESUS ​​CHILD, but only one" in heaven "<br /> <br /> follow? <br /> <br /> lets you see as a professional film manufacturer of Hebrews 7; 14 For it is evident that our Lord appeared in Judah, of which tribe Moses said nothing about the priesthood. " does not know "Man Jesus"? it is possible anyways Paul did not write Hebrews, but I can't go here, but the filmmaker says Paul did, and that's the basis of the action presented here. It's not like the creator of this film does not make good points in certain areas, he does, but he is involved in the same preference of the blind of the religion he does. Once embarked on these techniques, in my strong opinion, it loses credibility as a religion provides, and the film is no longer suitable for the document, but personal opinion, and the preference of the film manufacturer, nothing more, nothing less.
