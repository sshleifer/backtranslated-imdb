Once you ignore some implausibilities, this was actually legitimate respect / monster flick. So, I will give you some good things first: - The dragon was very persuasive, especially when he was going through the search for lunch (hint: he loves mankind). - The point was certainly to stop, and, after a weak start, I got quite a story. - sorry to say, I was a kind of root to the dragon - it might have been a persuasive and consistent attitude in the film. Now for unintended things ** maybe some of the vendors **: - if you were looking for a fire breath in 1100 AD, did you? would you pay into his cave with a gun barrel under your hand? Duh. - the female character of the entire American name, blonde hair and Slavic inspiration of the open, trying to pretend to be Spanish? Huh? - a leading scientist who Slavic encourages you to cut with a knife, and is thought to be born in Chicago, taught in the United States? - a military helicopter attempt that he does his own repairs, comes a large copter of transport with other workers, and is a expert on the score and fight with boot soldiers? OK. Uh hu. I will not even mention three different calls for 2 minutes when talking to its foundation. It is still better than some Japanese army comes from 60 years, but not to the extent. If we are lucky, we can't see the Dragon Fighter 2, although the ultimate nature left that unlikely. Or, perhaps, they will hire the real director next time. In spite of everything, I gave this 4 flick of 10. Add 2 more if they rewrite the plot, and Dean Cain gets to eat in the first ten minutes. <grin>
