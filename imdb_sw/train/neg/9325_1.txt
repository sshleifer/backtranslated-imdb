S.I.C.K. really stands for so wonderful Crappy myself injured. There was nothing to say. The best part of all production was the work of art on the lid of the box. The budget of this movie was enough. Interpretation was a small road. Production has been seen as an underground film for hits of people. Props used in this stolen movie from the clothing store. The end was predictable you should proceed quickly for the last 5 minutes and laugh. If there is a book out of this movie I am sure it's the best. I would like to avoid this at all costs. I enjoyed close events that made the whole movie worth it. just do it.
