Not to mention what was said above on this film, I would like to add that I was expecting to watch this film ... cast / location and work of good director Michael Winterbottom etc ... It had a clear shadow 'Don't See Now' about the original story. Stay in a different environment (Italy again) to reduce the heart loss ... or perhaps how I saw it? So, I sat there waiting for the story to open and put a spin on what we'd expect to happen to this family in a foreign country of Europe ... and I stayed there and stayed there .... and what did I think? nothing happens! and I don't mean! We are not even given the opportunity to get into the characters because they are 1 and sufficient. You are guided to believe from the speed of the film which something else happens to turn all the film on it ... Older girls who have met with village boys, had a maximum The biggest taking of film in another direction, a very young daughter's vision of her dead mother ended up to be fruitless and useless exercise, the father trying to lose them and one of her female students felt ignorant from her age. It felt as if the script had a final memory made where they decided for the last minute to put an end to any guts on the story and go to make it to a minimum without effect. When credits start start (unexpectedly) you can't help but feel stealing your time spent stay watching this bunch of trash.
