The summary showed 'sound effects' used to sleep. Very interesting version. I think I would sleep in a place where there was a risk or danger. I had heard that some people started shots for a show on various bullet bullets in Tarpon Springs, Florida. I would think Lloyd Bridges never was there. I just remember the show in reruns and though it was never a sharp-of-thrilling seat we could create our own underwater events in the lake at my grandmother's home ... imagine a sound voice and chat our adventures in our heads. I thought 'Flipper' had the most beautiful underwater stage. Of course, he had the advantage of being in his natural environment.
