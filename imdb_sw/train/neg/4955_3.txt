According to Batman's Brave and Bold's recent and good, it is now time to carry a terrible blow to the error in the life of Batman. Being a great fan since the first revival with Tim Burton 20 years ago, I have been able to accept different patterns in character, darkness or camping. This is not only reliable: many effects, bad brain and fewer questions. What is best about Batman is the difference of his skills and aspects of his personality: investigating, crime-criminals, a personal player, a personal partner, and Batman shows him only in his Karate days. And by the way, how does the penguin have the potential of such virtuosity when flying in the air regardless of the portal corpulence? And look at the Joker, a combination of Blanka in Fighter Address 2 and a powerful reggae person, what is a fan of Batman can accept that decision? It's not me however. Batman is much better without the article "of" before his name.
