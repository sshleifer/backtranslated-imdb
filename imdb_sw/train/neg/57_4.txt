What does "Executive Executive" do in the film. If I remember correctly it is someone who raised financial support to make a movie. You can see for a large number of films including Sean Connery that he is also an executive producer which means Connery himself raised money since he is a great player. Unfortunately it should also be shown that a large number of movies "star Sean Connery were made only because he was able to raise money since he is the main player of Hollywood, usually a sign that when credits read that executive executive and star of the movie is one and the same The movie itself is nothing more than a star car and a story / screenplay is not on the start <br /> <br /> PROTOCOL follows a saga of the same Sunny Davis kooky bimboesque cocktail waitress who saves the role of visiting and as a prize is available to be a top diplomat. If things continue, Ms Davis (who struggles to hold two sentences together) finds himself in many outdoor and impossible situations. If I say that PROTOCOL stars Goldie Hawn who is also the producer of the film producer understands what I'm talking about to start?
