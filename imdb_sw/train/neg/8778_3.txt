The "White Voice" was able to be one of the most talked about movies since "The Exorcist" I think. Seeing whether the EVP seems to really have a simple passage to be a fact of fear. Not many movies that come to be scared in people's minds. As I said this film may be, but it didn't. The movie separated itself from the low-class PG-13 movie. Nothing compared to "Pete" or "Sense of Six" in any way. Someone just needs to take charge in the movie industry of fear and just make a movie that not only makes us think, but it makes us run, whisper, everything terrible movie should do. I am a patient of a kind of fear of PG-13, for it is of its own kind. We need past days, blood and days of days, Freddy Kruger, Jason, Day Mike Myers. Small movies may be thinking about these ideas that are not awesome. So try to wipe it? Very good in this movie is not worth anything except one of the last stupidest in the film history without any resolution at all ... don't lose your money on this film.
