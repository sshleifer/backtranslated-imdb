Kalifornia is bothering. I believe there is no reason for this story to be told. It is neither entertainment nor social value. Technically, the movie makes it very good, the performances are high and the first class. The story comes in an exciting way that holds interest. But at the end this film grows and hits the skill. I recommend California to anyone.
