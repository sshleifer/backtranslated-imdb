Frightened fans (I am talking to more than 12 years, although less than 12 years old, I apologize for what you can see anger): In short, if you are happy to have your ideas confused with well-written text, verified and unpredictable, are well planted, and given through convincing exhibitions, then I can wholeheartedly suggest - TO WORK WORKERS - conducted by the directors who have been seen for a long time since their adoption of the date. It is not an accident that almost every part feels like it was in the 1980s. It is not to blame the shoulders on the shoulders of some of these former boys (or actually 80 years) because where we can be without some movies from Argento's loved ones, Carpenter, Landis, Dante and Barker (In fact Clive, WTF makes you happy! See Romero had a good feeling to give them a miss if I'm sure she was asked to share ...). More perhaps we should put a finger on the creator Mick Garris whose reputation includes the violation of the logic and simplicity of Stanley Kubrick's 'Brightness' television. It is probably a sign of the television situation today. Are we hungry for the good of TV that we congratulate any old schlock which networks interfere in our sets? Sadly, maybe so. I usually didn't see the point of adding comments that are not against the errors and characteristics of production, I would just like to measure them correctly. However, if this series is not in any of the attributes (and perhaps only the tune of the theme) I write this as a warning more than a review: Do not miss your time and money. If you disagree with me then it is more likely that you have not seen enough fear of respect. Perhaps the early films of some of these directors should be the best place to start, but if the 'Masters' of these Horror were tested only for these tasks, they could not be allowed to graduate with their degree degree. Exactly they were studying by degree from S ** t University.
