Arthur Askey's great skill as a comic was in the way he communicated with his public. The jokes of his young people, songs of deception and daft dances had declined because he was able to involve people and draw them into his world. Lack of life listeners had different disadvantages to him, and he was not quite easily in the film. He has his time in the Train of the Spirit, and his character, Tommy Gander, has enabled you to make his many talents, but therefore the rituals are required to be known. Askey's help in the film is not strong, it includes a typical co-star Richard Murdoch; Betty Jardine and Stuart Latham as a couple of dopey honeymoon; Linden Travers go up as 'mad lady'. Also on the board is Peter Murray-Hill, who did not have a screen to marry Phyllis Calvert, as the man who led the name, giving the reader to the same place, and led the woman Carol Lynne, who returns to the same performance. It is left for character actor Kathleen Harrison to fervently steal the film as a beloved female pastor who gets smash on brandy Dr Morland Graham.
