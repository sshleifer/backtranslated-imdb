I am surprised to see that the average of this movie is 5.2 / 10. First of all, the conspiracy is totally hopeless, and the acting is very serious. I think that any unknown actress would be better for a position than Susan Lucci; about Reyes Mr. Kamar Del, I think it would be the best option for him to remain in his "Valley of the Dolls". In general, it is a total waste of time (and I try to stay decent ...) to avoid at any cost. My estimation is 1 and I still think it's paid well, but since we can't give O ....
