Before commenting on this film I watched on YouTube, I must admit that the reason I was looking for was to re-see something that I had first seen on TV broadcast in 1980: Barbara Bach's cleavage. And since the movie received R, I expected to see him nude. Alas, no dice for him or another good actress who appeared here: Stacey Nelkin who deserves to be a boy but was actually 20 when he did this. See him in bra and panty and later in the belly belly belly was just like Mrs. Bach. They provide some scattered spells this movie offers. In fact, I did not accuse Ron Leibman for having his name removed from such loans since his role as a tight-fisted Licent is a good embarrassment though I like a "seduction" scene made by Ms Nelkin. This also happens to be the beginning of Ralph Macchio who is slow among misfits sent to school school. Some are a black baby who loves her grandmother's mother and Mrs. Bach, a Arab woman who worships car oil, and a politician who loves her Candy (very Nelkin) character, can walk in the middle of the night to see her in a girls' school . Among the cast, Tom Poston has a swhup character called Sisson who has found an exciting part. With screenplay with Tom Patchett and Jay Tarses and direction by Robert Downey Sr. (whose son Robert Downey Jr. has the previous events in the soccer field), Up Academy is not good for politics and politics but is not really angry with the scatological and sexual content, this is actually the bad comedy without being Mad Magazine Magazine and its logo The symbol of the boy-Alfred E. Newman-should not be embarrassed even though they once had a name and their behavior taken away from the image .. Another "misfits" was Harry Teinowitz who was born in my birth city of Chicago, Ill. Played Rodney Ververgaert. He also says one of my famous lines: "I'm trying to come."
