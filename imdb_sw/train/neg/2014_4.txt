I remember to love this show when I was a child. I thought the helicopter was the most interesting thing I saw. It was ultra-tech for a while. It can save the enemy's fire, making all kinds of acrobatics in the air, and take down next to anything that way. Now I go back and look at it today and I wonder how this discussion has shown the truth. Providing members is not difficult to compel, there is a lot of fun, and fighting events appear to be false. And almost every last has a similar helicopter to fight the crap and the apparent use of grainy low quality stock footage. Most publications are now available from the Vietnam War. <br /> <br /> Airwolf has essentially the same theme as Knight Rider, unless the fight against electoral crime is a helicopter instead of a car. After looking at a few moments, I found myself completely tired. I, however, love music themes.
