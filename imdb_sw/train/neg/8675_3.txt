The best thing you can say about this movie is that if you're a fan of Sonny Chiba, this film gives you lots of lots. Chiba speaks; Chiba is possible; Power of Chiba; Chiba glares on the camera; Chiba punches and sushi hostage from the whole group of bad guys; Chiba sits on the couch with chairs and seems to focus / delight; Chiba runs his car ... <br /> <br /> I love Chiba as an actress and a military artist ... but even for a fan of Chiba, this movie may have very little Sonny Chiba. It is definitely something of a worthless car. And no, I can put a "Street Fighter" in that group, because in "SF" plays the hero to fight the heroes, and shares the camera with friends and enemies who love. Here, he is in front and in the middle all the time, and tries to be Batman, Captain America and Bruce Lee gone one. Toshiro Mifune and Chow Yun Fat could not pull this to the length of all the film's feature, and Sonny only kind of wear to him. At least he could change his suit at once. <br /> <br /> The movie is inserted more by a series of appropriate and inappropriate introduction (visible to the front of the film for the American Edition) and the fun of goofy "(" Viva !! Chiba !! Viva !! Chiba !! ) which starts things on the wrong leg. There is a very strange and improper dubbing - Sonny (or its usual English size) could not have trouble making a voice for the American version, so they got a bad dope and sound and a completely different voice is an absolute jarring from our face we all know and love from "Street Fighter". <br /> <br /> Even with all the weaknesses and acute shortages, this can still be a little classic, but the function of the camera and the fight scenes are cheesy desires. I have agreed to believe that Karate actually works if a person who is astounded as Chiba's character should be so, but the director and cameras grabbed their bets by cutting and editing the anti-whacker weed scenes so you can't see what really going to be over time. Not all bad: there are shots and good characters, and there is at least one time memorable and nighttime when bad people seem in the client's bedroom through the true way of innovation. <br /> <br /> And about the real plot ... forget it. For "guardian", the character of Chiba is something of idiot. Screenplay depends on making errors and insights that often put him (and his "client") in a very bad situation can fight his way, and after 30 minutes, it causes even the most convincing sentence to think that this person should be any good . (Also, if his behavior was out of destroying the Japanese pharmaceutical business, he could take his client with his neck 10 minutes on the screens and trembled until his teeth circled as a castanet until he lost his small secrets ... and any death and conflict could be avoided .) <br /> <br /> However, this movie is generally a long way from the bottom of the barrel. It is still Sonny Chiba, and still enjoys watching. I paid the buck to remove the rack of the DVD from the local business, and I feel it is important to look at it immediately.
