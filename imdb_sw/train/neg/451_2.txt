I don't care how many chosen this junk got better with this, this stunk film. I didn't know whether to turn off the set, or open the case with the O.J prosecutor. for improper damage to my mental health. I rarely have been so tired; call these elephant entertainment is beaten to the face of every goer-movie in the world. The whole story was stupid, acting was not strong, 'celebration' was not feeling. I am thankful I did not have to pay for unhappy experiences.
