This movie still removes me thinking of bone. This movie was not just as bad as in a low budget, very helpful, etc. though it was indeed all things. The problem with this movie is that it seems to be deliberately trying to defeat the viewer, making it a great success. What I want to know is, this should be a terrible movie? I mean, it is obviously horrible, but it is not by way of terrible movies that should be. I could see the first part trying to be afraid and fail, but what hell is the second part? It's just annoying. The third part is like watching the film of art students, which surprisingly enough makes the smallest part of the pain. It is violent that this film is not subject to less than 100, so get your votes (1/10) for people !! I know other people gave these positive comments, but, well, they are lying in a sad attempt to deceive. Believe me, it is impossible to love this film. The only advantage of this film is amazing life: it feels like you have watched this film for years after only the first half of the pass.
