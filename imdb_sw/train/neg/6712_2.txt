I think you should give several points for the great boldness of writing music around the history of history but how about the respectable music? <br /> <br /> What! The acting cartoonist of Howard DeSilva meant to attract the interests of other non-jaded children? Is the modern style of William Daniels (in time) meant to reject the 1960s / 70s population? <br /> <br /> Do we need all "in-joke" about NY & NJ? (I can hear the blue blue guffawing audience on the cue.)
