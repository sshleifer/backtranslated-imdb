I like movies about characters of moral destruction, but this was very big. Acting was not good, but that was not a real problem. The question was the feeling of sinking in my abdomen in about 20 minutes on the film. These characters were holes. They had almost no depth, and what little they had were devoted to their cruelty they had easily exposed. Exploring the black sides of a set of characters can be interesting, but you give those characters real characters or they are just a card cutting card. These characters were very nasty and the pictures they had given were very bad.
