In a normal view, this is a very awesome movie. However, it scores the highest score on the comedy level of the comedy. I can think of a few players who make me laugh as hard as I watched this film. The spirit of Andy Griffith wearing a dance for Native American fabric takes me to hysterics every time. I can't lose gas or energy to drive in a video store to rent, but if it happens in bed at 3 am and comes to TV, see.
