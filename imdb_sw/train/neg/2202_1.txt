This movie makes me think others I have seen and Combs were accidentally. The plan had more holes than I think I have seen in a film that is pointing to something more than a movie "b". Acting was very interesting even the records of the victories of the old Combs camps were enough to save. Considering the script I must think that it didn't have enough money in the budget of things like promotional and original ideas. I am totally disappointed that I paid Blockbuster prices for this waste. The fact that it was made for television is something that will help me avoid this feeling and say the truth that this poor movie should be needed to warn you. Avoid this movie regardless of what.
