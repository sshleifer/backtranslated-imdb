so I've got this document to be wonderful and really useless. I know it is a prize and things, but I did not like you very much. there was no humor or drama to be interested, just a wierdos group and their work. some people in it are very different that is not a bad thing, not just a good feeling for me. I was so tired with this film, there was no mistake for my teacher writing creative. The theme of the circus in all the movie was kinda cool but I did not find, and the robotics and the lion recovery is definitely not my thing. the green animal was beautiful, I liked lots of colorful flowers, but how did these four work connect? it didn't mean much to me why someone would make a movie about it. But if you're in such things you can enjoy it. who am I standing in your way. I just tell you about the possible suffering.
