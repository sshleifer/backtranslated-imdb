This is the worst chapter of the old story that I have ever seen. They need modern modernization and certain points are just sick. <br /> <br /> Songs often go along with stories. They seem to be thrown randomly. The jumping area and Marley are of no value. It is not just one of the worst movies I have ever seen, but it's the worst music I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Maybe it seems just ordinary because "Carol Christmas" is a common story. Just because the original story was classic does not mean that some cheap adaption is.
