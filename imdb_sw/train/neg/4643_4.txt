I hit this movie on DVD. I knew that the film could not live according to what was promised behind the case, but once I realized that Leatherface (Gunnar Hansen) was in it, I had to hire. It starts off good, because the hot films are hit on the cable. However, the main character has nothing to do to disturb you for anything, and the end of the film leaves you hanging. There are many ways that are not answered. There was a huge area at the end that he invited me quite, but in general this is a small film, but I think it was worth $ 3.99 rental fee.
