Please! Don't waste any money on this movie. In fact it is not the most interesting thing of the German Blair Witch ripoff made by secondary school children. I could not finish watching, and usually I would like to watch all kinds of movies. Can the world get a distributor for it? !!! Funny however: See Wikipedia for "dark area". The boy who wrote the entry should be far from his mind. Maybe he got a lot of money from producers. Money that should be used for executives, cameras and editing. Yet it could not be helped, because there is no interesting idea behind this film. Unfortunately the "dark area" has already been very focused. Please, the director, producer and author of this film, STOP make such movies ... pretends to be yourself. The world will be the best place without this film.
