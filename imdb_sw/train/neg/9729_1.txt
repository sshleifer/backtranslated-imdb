Hardly, what is this? Hooper has made classic movies such as the Chainsaw massacre of Texas, then made this bad film of the film, happened? What? he entered into a very small crack? This film refers to Sam who is able to set fire, (Firestarter, anyone?) Acting was godawful, the plot was garbage, and special effects were so much waste, it seemed like something from 70 years. The worst film ever, and what was it and the end? began to burn a blue, turned into a blue blob of the blue, and burned the female female, and the film ended. WHAT IS? HUH? when the film ended I expected the DVD would have emerged to connect to save from my pain. <br /> <br /> Go away from this FIL. <br /> <br /> Don't think, OBEY, you'll thank you later.
