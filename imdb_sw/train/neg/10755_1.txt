I can't really reflect any attributes of this unfortunate offer in Asimov than the art of art. Forgetting the risk of product placements, improper performance from Will Smith and gargantuan plot. This is not just laughable and sad looking. Even that step was bad. The combination of MTV production values ​​and the worst dialogue targeting very young children. It is a shame that this bad sci-fi can still be made after having Bladerunner, a small report or a minimum Dark City (for the director). This is true in the list of less than 100. True.
