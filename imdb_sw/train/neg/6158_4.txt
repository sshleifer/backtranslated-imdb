Once in the mid-1990s I used to write to the fanners of DOCTOR WHO and all the fandom had breathed on the new American produced DOCTOR WHO TVM. As soon as it was announced that the enemy's enemy was playing with Eric Roberts everyone hit their heads and said "Who is Eric Roberts?". I must be sure this before IMDB came online all the time and make it kind in the name on this site on their resume, but one spirit and useful wrote in the book I wrote in describing that Eric Roberts was known for the role that made the stars opposite F Murray Abraham, The film was called SWORD and was about the fence school. In fact looking back now Roberts is known for POPE OF GREENWICH VILLAGE and Runaway Train but didn`t stop someone putting boot in both Roberts and BY THE RIGHT and his mind was made up that this American Master for his southern drawl was going to the debacle . It is amazing that many fans were angry about Roberts playing Master but after they saw DOCTOR WHO TVM big fan many (I am among them) thought Roberts performance was the best thing about American American emissions! 'm digressing but a PANGA is a film I wanted to see just because it was the first time I`d heard the name of Eric Roberts but I didn`t get the opportunity to see it until this weekend and I was just desirous with that. I don't know something about the fence (All the others on this page seem obliged to specify whether the fence or not. I don`t fence) so I don`t know how accurate it all, but as mentioned the film feels somewhat natronistic even if you see the thing given year 1991, the appearance of a few years has gone out and cast its young mixture to make a little dance that makes it wonder if it wouldn`t work much more like it`d was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer in the mid 1980s. You can say that this would mean a relationship between Max Suba and Alexander Villard have been far apart from many films but I was not sure about their love / hatred relationship with Abraham and Roberts have given them the most beautiful performances before and since SWORD.
