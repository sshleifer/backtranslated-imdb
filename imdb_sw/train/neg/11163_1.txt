We loved the Rock School and Jack Black. We couldn't wait to see this film. It was the only time in my life the movie was so bad I wanted to walk. My husband also hated it. Just a funny part was on the trailer. My husband and I wanted to stand out of the movie movies and tell people to save their money. Writing was bad. It had all the horrible kinds of Puerto Rico people who should be totally guilty. The movie was not long but it seemed to us forever. People in the theater were not worried and silent was like to look at the color dry. I made my husband go because I was sure there could be some parts of redemption, but he didn't. Save money and your time.
