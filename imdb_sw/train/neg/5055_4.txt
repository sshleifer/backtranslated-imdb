Two years ago in Sundance I loved Josh Kornbluth leading first-Haiku Tunnel. So I was waiting for his brother (and a regular partner) Jacob, the best thief in the world. This is a drama about a child who looks good in the New York area. The movie is not without its poignant time. But sometimes it's like Kornbluth works very hard to say plainly: Life can be very difficult for other people. And life is not right. More than the trick, and most importantly, is our understanding that with all of these cultural hatred and anti-social behaviors that can cause, these characters have no virtue of humanity and humanity. We can restore their language and their living environment, but we can't reduce their purpose. And, in fact, their efforts to keep the family under the crisis have some glory that most of us can appreciate. Kornbluth grew in this neighborhood, and his compassion for people looked everywhere. Having said all of this, a good thief in the world is experiencing many serious mistakes (including the head). The characters are not very reliable. The text did not match. And the line of conspiracy is invisible. And for many concerns it is that Kornbluth uses two young black boys trying to gangsta rap among events. For each of his own: But when I do not know the reality of this phenomenon, it hurts me to see children aged 5 years and talk about having sex with women's line. It is an unwanted shock and is a forced interest.
