You just saw this film and I must say that although there was an attempt to produce a good film, this was quite horrible - but not in a sense that was the intention I was sure. It was like a child leading this falsehood to the mind and belief that all would be - viewers like it or very hard for entertainment AU two .... Thank God for quick!

I can't say it again. If Harlequin Romance decided to scare horror movies, this will be a good effort. If you have found this film to be entertaining, then I show that you need some guidance for the purpose of the movie. There are more beautiful trips out there. Join the club, READ REVIEWS, but above all, try to crap like this.
