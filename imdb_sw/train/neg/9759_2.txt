It is rare that I feel the need to write a review on this site, but this film is very appropriate because of the damage it has created, and how its products have been. I felt the attempt of part of the filmmakers to show the Palestinian family as boorish and unreliable. We hear them discussing the depression they feel from oppression, but the film is beaten and organized in the way we feel that the oppressed and political people are the inhabitants of the Jewish nation. We do not have any evidence similar to the Palestinian boy's position. We just hear from other Palestinian prisoners. I understand the existing barriers, but the political nature of the sanctions is made to prevent peace. I came out of the idea of ​​the film that the mother of the victim was selfish in her cries and with the intent to be completely closed from her side of the fence, by saying. He remained unwilling to see the effects of bombing parents, and his angry and closed words caused the last meeting not to take control. It is more true, in my mind, to see Israel's view to be the root of the problem; ignoring requests for understanding and independence, ignoring requests to recognize the process that the Jews received. I have given these two because of this weakness of the mother's selfishness, which will normally be visible in the document, however because of lack of preference, it all seems to be effective. Also for poor change, lack of history in reality, and ultimately lack of proper representation of the Palestinian side. Finally, it is a bad document with poor film. I agree this is part of the political outcome, but I have to recognize mistakes in the direction regardless of heart and sadness.
