There was a similar feeling about the show of the game by Bill Shatner ... and especially according to Doing or No Working with 1 vs 100. . It's a disappointment! As Ben Stein so quiet and nasal says, "wooww". The only thing right on this show is the fact that you knew that eventually it will end. Sitting for a full hour as it was going to the dentist ... you find yourself looking at what you think is about 10 minutes, just knowing that just a minute has passed (but it looks like ever) since the last you looked at the clock. So, why didn't I just change the center? Well, probably for the same reason many people were not ... without great hope. I mean, nobody likes * to think that show and Bill Shatner could really be BAD SO. Personally, from the first 15 minutes, I've never thought this was a kind of car that would show the talent of William Shatner. My main complaint is that the set was black. Watching I felt sad. He wanted to get a little excitement, but there was no one to have. There was not enough light on the setting to feel power from the audience (who couldn't even see). Web Lovers: People don't watch the game displays to treat their sleep. .. The watch game shows you to be excited and have a good time. Please make us all grace and lose this in the vault.
