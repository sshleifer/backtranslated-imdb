I didn't like this film completely! First, I do not know why, but everyone here says, playing with the Poesy Clémence is the best, which in my opinion is completely wrong! She is not like Natasha: another appearance, another character ... What's worse, she is an inexperienced actor and that's why she was not able to play this role! He described the heroine completely! That was very hateful to see her play! With my mind, it would be better to give this opportunity to the Russian actress, because it would be easy for him to understand the Russian spirit for the Russian man. Unfortunately, Kutuzov appeared as a drunk man, who did not shave 2 weeks and defeat the war where he lost his eye ... (Thank God, in this film there are other actors, whose games were awesome! I think, Alessio Boni struggled I was so impressed and he is one of the few people who read the book, which is very important to play. Additionally, I loved our Russian actors, which was very strange to look at. The only thing I liked in this work was a comment. beautiful and amazing clothes! My advice is to read the book and understand the real meaning, the goal, which Leo Tolstoy wrote this masterpiece, and perhaps realize the whole idea of ​​the book ... 1 from 10
