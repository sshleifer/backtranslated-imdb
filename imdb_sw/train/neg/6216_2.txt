9, the film I was expecting for monthsâ€¦ was a little more then disappointed. I was very surprised by the lack of 9 stories and the development of strange behavior. All the amazing sequence of action in the world does not do with one unethical character. Wonderful, almost thrown into the magic system was not just out of place, they were fierce. The story is about robots and scientists ... why suddenly turns into a wannabe who is afraid of necronomicon and mystical symbols and green lines of magic instead of giving answers to what might be the most frightening material? What is, what, when, why .... questions that arise to ask only if you deserve and become less and less that you will be away from the theater. This video is worried because of the lack of detail .... I'd like to watch this film offered on crayon as the story was good. But film writers rely on the CGI magician and the name of Tim Burtons to draw on the crowd. Which ... what motivated it but could not get my respect. It can be amazing ... with more and more records from its designers.
