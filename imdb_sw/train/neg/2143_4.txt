I was looking at the original Disney Cinderella, and I liked it so much that the tape was worn. So, I was glad to see that Cinderella 2 was coming to the TV and I would be able to see it. <br /> <br /> I had to be more aware. <br /> <br /> This game includes a club sequels movie which should only be left alone. Holds absolutely NONE's original charm! It seems, to me, quite bad, and close to violence, from (does not like) Home-counseling for praise. When I remember the character describing the story through the song, the sound of this film was put up, and it didn't seem appropriate. Jaq's change in man is a great example: While walking around the apple and adding a few little quips here and there, he would have to play around and sing about how big that was great! And in football, there is a variety of music of the old warehouse. It is as if the writers forgot where and when this story was planned. Upbeat tips are certainly not helpful. <br /> <br /> Even animations and animations in Cinderella 2 are not on the start. Illustration in this film looks quite raw and non-detailed. And we see the skirt of Cinderella's hoop, which doesn't feel right. <br /> <br /> The movie itself may be its own story, I think it should be so. I can't say that I hate it, but I believe it was a serious shortage. It seems a decline in the important way from the original Cinderella loved one.
