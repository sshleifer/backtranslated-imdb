This turns out to be the worst movie I tried to look at. In the first 15 minutes, there was nothing to put my interest in this film. I was on vacation at that time, and I had a lot of time to volunteer on the movie-of-the-movie. Condoms we used to have had this film in stock - they must be from the $ 1 or something shop. If you like Adam Sandler, this is not like any film made. This started with a bad cluster and then became worse. There is nothing even away from funny. I have watched many movies, including some that I don't care about. But if you decide to waste your time on this film, don't say it.
