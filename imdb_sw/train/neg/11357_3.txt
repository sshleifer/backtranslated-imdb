1 good news. 3-D is done well, and it does not work for gotcha diseases. The film is based on the true story of human history, and even includes one of the real participants in the story: Buzz Aldrin. And now the meat of the issue: It's about FLIES, for krissakes! Birds with big eyes, the human googy, of course, but the roots however. Remember I likened the "Underworld" movies to mice against bugs? That was not intended as a title, and I have never dreamed that anyone could make it true. This gets a little understanding. Child's snippets? Ugh. In one of these amazing Hollywood groups, this flik was apparent on the drawing boards at the same time as "Space Chimps", also about voters in space. <br /> <br /> Go to lease "Apollo 13" and see the 9-movie movie for REAL (RIP) program.
