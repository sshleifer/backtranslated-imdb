I am so surprised by the good opinion because there were four of us who saw this for one inquiry and we all went out. We personally saw that it was very slow to look and could not sit through the entire movie. And we actually tried to hold it. In particular, those in the group who wanted to love it because of their personal experience and gender transfers during the school years shown did not like it or recognize it completely. He said, it is good to see that this film is very stored by many people here on board and reviewers.
