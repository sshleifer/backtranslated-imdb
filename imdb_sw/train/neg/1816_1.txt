This movie is very realistic. It comes by banning with the fastest speed that you can't even see a good understanding and a common experience for the people of the past. But it does not stop there! This film blows down the barrel diligently returns to the point of a wonderful comedy: see as the Koran of Beergutted Conan wannabe and over-the-hair of the neck neck blowing his stuff swinging his sword like no tomorrow (and the way he shouted, scared there * it was tomorrow for him, or at least, for his beer gut. Do not miss this movie, it's amazing failure through idiocy, and very intelligent blood! And once you have finished watching this, dry tears of joy (or tears of frustration in an unfamiliar attempt to write a story) from your eyes because some stupid f00l gave these people $ 5 to make a series!
