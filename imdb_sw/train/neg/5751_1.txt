The film should be beaten to the day, there are instances where you can see a camera reflection with its red pointer, even light green glowing with actors !!! The program and lines are very bad without even a little inspiration (at least as an exciting kind of film). Everything that is related to Poe in the film, has an unknown and children's approach. The film is full of fun and no exciting.
