It was disgusting and painful. What will lose the cast! I swear, (1/2 full) cut TWICE in 90 minutes. This is not a lie. Do not even lease. Zeta Jones was very important to be honest. <br /> <br /> Cusack was the same. Okay right. I felt sorry for him (actor) if people remembered this mess. <br /> <br /> Roberts was the same as he is always. Beauty and sweet, but without purpose. "Love" and John was not quite possible.
