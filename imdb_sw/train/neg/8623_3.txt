This film is about a soldier (Ching Wan Lau) trying to catch a sophisticated thief (Ekin Cheng) who hurts the insurance company headed by Kelly Lin. Basically, any plans that the thief is trying to know before. This film, covered by beautiful artists, a good actor and a beautiful camera of Hong Kong cameras, is not quite true. All is flash, and the flash becomes too fast too. I lost all three interests of the way to go to the film, and no quality of redemption after this, except for movies, which looks good. Just think to see this movie if you can do it for free. Also, stop watching 20-minute films on the film because it is the same as the last: BORING. 6/10
