Although there are Flying Guillotines as part of this film, it has no connection with the original Flying Guillotines (1975) and Flying Guillotines II II (1978). Two stagnation is masterpieces of the kung-fu movie and still looks like a classic. This is a low copy of the original, and even as an ordinary movie of kung-fu, it is below the average. <br /> <br /> First, this movie does not work much. It is a great struggle to lose after another, and the flying guillotine is not even suitable for them. The story is about other Shaolin followers who follow other criminals who have taken the holy book, and the evil prince who has part of this book is part of the plot. The evil prince has plans to attract local monks and use guillotines to fly over them. <br /> <br /> There are four movies and Flying Guillotine as part of his head. This in my opinion is of limited quality. The guillotine plan of flying in this film is different from the three that show that this film was produced by a separate tool from three others. <br /> <br /> Movie does not have a percentage of chemistry due to having no surprising funny due to poor production. <br /> <br /> Better to fly this and look at these two backgrounds.
