So this man named George is sitting at home alone when his two women show. George's wife is in the hospital caring for their baby so when the wife is away George gets into a bubble bath and makes love for both girls. It's not a big event because it doesn't show anything. After that the boy is born the next morning and the girls are still at home. They make him a good breakfast but George is not hungry. George is very unhappy and tries to disperse them but when he goes home the girls still live in his home. Girls have had enough with George of old and they no longer want to cook them. Both of them turn into a great psychopaths and use George in their little crazy game. I liked that girls did just wanted and destroyed the house of George. George was not very real to his two visitors. When George said he was a married woman, he didn't mean it. George appeared as Tom Tucker on Family Guy. I was two girls at all.
