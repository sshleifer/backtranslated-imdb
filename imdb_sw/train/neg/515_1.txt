Oh man is this bad movie. Passes by horrible. The story is about a car driver who has a love for himself, and then he needs to promote chicken food quickly and when he does, he doesn't like himself. He tries to overcome the contract and the horrors, for the unintended pain. Jim Nabors looks like he's asleep, not acting. If you miss the same Burt as Dom Deluise and Jerry Reed while watching this stinker. Loni Anderson's hair is awesome, showing that tons of hairspray did not come out of sixty years. Or maybe that was a pig. Speaking, Burt's pig was not bad in this film. "The day of wig" the worst was in "Smokey and Bandit 2". However, this movie is the worst movie of the Reynolds car, ever, ever, above and "Cannonball Run 2". The original "Smokey" and "Cannonball" (and "Hooper" which, thanks to, did not have a sequel) is a beautiful, beautiful film. This is not. Even Ned Beatty, who is a good actor, says. Wish for Jackie Gleason type of villain who is happy to hate him. And remember, this is not one of these fun movies. It's lousy, clean and easy. Even the final result was strong and interesting, and the worse, regardless. And at least I forget, "Stroker Ace" was one of the first heavy nails to strengthen the coffin Burt before some years of future revival in the "Boogie Nights", another film that, like "Deliverance" years earlier, shows that one can do quite good when he has a decent platform to do so.
