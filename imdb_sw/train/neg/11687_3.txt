From the growing desire for snails, within a person describes the story of the detective (Denzel Washington) who is under investigation due to its possibility of involvement in the lack of money. When the bank is confiscated and the hostage is being done against their will by the master thief (Clive Owen) and his team, the detective is given to force the thief? Its one shot to prove that he is innocent and worthy of his position. Enter a strong woman (Jodie Foster) and her own personal goals, sent her to return the item from the bank's security deposit box that is stored in the bank, and has a third problem. Unfortunately, you get it all in the film, and there is nothing to pay for it. Denzel Washington is in its amazing position in poor and ineffective performance. The only grace to save the film is his co-starring Jodie Foster and Clive Owen, who are better than the film itself. In fact, Jodie Foster provides an amazing and very high performance against forms such as non-brutal, ignorant. Clive Owen does not give much to do instead of generation and pray, but the depth of its existence and its ability to make more success than to create its development role. It is amazing that many talents are lost on this small-scale film or interest. You wonder what director Spike Lee was thinking while creating this film. The worst feature of the person, however, is the uncertainty which has received. For a film that has all the repairs of the blockbuster before the summer, this falls significantly flat.
