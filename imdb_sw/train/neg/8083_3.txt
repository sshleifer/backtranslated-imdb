Rejected by Richard C. Sarafian, the catastrophic decline in the Japanese exhibition before the coming of the States and quickly going to the video, where it was no longer seen until Turner networks need anything else than infomercials to fill them 3 am-6am slots time and found this tape under their bin. Smithe's name should be used when the label prohibits the movie so that the director does not want its name connected. But I'm afraid that Sarafian can't blame the studio completely on this one. The actors, most recent graduates of "Fighting 101", provides one line of cornball after another. This program is deleted. Special effects can not be interesting. The features that do not fail are only good. Script or book should be well - why else, Matheson, Boyle, or Heston agree to appear on this dud? But something that went so bad from the page to the screen. Summary: Avoid. It's not too bad to be bad - it's good.
