Saturday night **** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday morning ** Sunday Night * Morning Monday <br /> Marshall Lawson (Steven Seagal) has been given France on a reception message with three new teams The team attacked after disobeying orders directly from above. Yet the night before the strike, all of them are found to be destroyed by the killer and the power of humanity. With the French police around their own investigation, he is going to find those who are responsible for themselves, only to be known a group of destruction of military attacks in a new deadly weapon that changes the person's DNA and gives them a new awesome power. > <br /> Bad cover. Bad name. Bad monitoring after production. And trailer bad. Very bad movies. But, I have to say, I don't think the Power of Attack is so bad. I know this will make me uncomfortable with many of the other counselors here (maybe not Steveday!) But I think lots of lots have fallen due to all the bad news in front of the film instead of real quality. I must say there was a place near many dubbing or rope editions if I had caused it to believe. Dubbing was there (which made him like Martin Sheen and the problem of trouble!) It was very good and quite often but not used for a large part of the film as I thought. The conspiracy came out very well and considered all of the preliminaries of the previous film called Harvester. Also if another inspector noted, the film has to look good Gothic, a new touch to the Seagal film. The lowest way to kill, though, was a complete and general lack of any exciting action, and only a few that were not recommended for any photography. I need to be honest, however, I would like to look at this again than the Flight of Fury, Today Crack or External to Kill. **
