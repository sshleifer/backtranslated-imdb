"Angel Angel" is a young shepherd, and June Vincent as a woman trying to save her husband from an electric chair after she was found guilty of killing old friends. Dan Duryea (the husband of a murdered woman) decides to help Vincent find real guilt. Peter Lorre has one unresponsive role as a suspect. Black this film looks and has as an affordable software, never reaching anything special. It is good enough but then, at some point, it stops feeling and a secret solution causes one of the biggest ones to "give me rest". Accessing alone can wipe the film completely, but what follows next is not very good either. Vincent is a wimpy heroine and Duryea was not very good to play a good youth. I love the color of the film, but this was a real desire.
