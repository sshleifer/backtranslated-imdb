I have seen this movie on the movies many years ago, and one thing it accused me of was not able to redeem it in the movie: Dennis Quaid was thrown out as a policeman who never had a grin or grin, when his smile and grin were two of its symbols. Danny Glover was thrown as a bad man, but - again - the view of many viewers could not go too far as to trust him in that role. Also, Jared Leto was not trusted as a former medical student. The tension was not there, because the killer was very early. The end was, again, and there was no power: no one around me was concerned about what would happen. All we could expect was the end of the film. Anything, the evening of despair used in the movie.
