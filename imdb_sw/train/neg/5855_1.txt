The movie released at the beginning of 2000 along with MELA two disasters So sadness starts millennium and sluggish like this <br /> <br /> The film seems to be like 70 but it looks like unintentional comedy for 2000 <br /> <br /> Anywayz The most common from the film: Paresh Rawal I don't know to laugh at his role or crying because: He is going to find his mother in the worst village when he knows the secret of Anil puts hidden inside his stomach that becomes bigger and makes him look at pregnant I remember in my childhood my teacher told me the same Urrf joke !!!! if the baby was laughing at that time but here? The entire film is a joke that cannot explain that we have Anil in two roles (one younger and younger) and Rekha playing an old wife and Raveena young We also have rejected Harish while Shakti plays Aruna Irani's son who all fights on who has the worst wig The trend is not long The music is bad The worst is the most difficult and very small in the role of the past but the good effort Rekha is enough, Raveena is also The same Harish is bad Shakti Kapoor is an awesome Aruna Irani is usually Rajnikant is the same in the cameo
