This movie is a distinctive movie of the movie, placed in Japan about an unemployed family who lives with a strange visitor who sits back and watches 4 members of the family when they are worse. There is nothing holy in this film, and the drug and abuse that is set to the limit so I'm surprised to have back buttons. Overall, I think it will only be appealing to those who should not have a heart, rather than any needed message that we all take into account. The movie that emerges for the worst part of the community and is quite surprising gash ... despair from someone who made movies of Dead or Living and Inspection.
