Okay, I agree to watch this film on Mystery of Science 3000 (which I am a big fan of), but I am not one of those people who provide direct movie MST3K to 1/10 rating. Although I hate many movies they are playing, and some of the worst movies I have ever seen, I have been able to enjoy MST3K movies. What it said, this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. (Not surprising, in fact, that the MST3K writers themselves explained that this is one of the worst. They believe it? Check out their website.) The discussion is very bad, acting is worse, the movie is more interesting (when perhaps the best thing in this film) is bad. Walking is the worst part of this film. A few times in this film, the viewer waited a real moment for something to happen. When the minute can not be seen as too long, it can be in the film, especially in this. I am sure it meant to create feelings, but I was very tired. It seemed like ten minutes. If "suspension" means "almost sleeping during the movie", then this has a lot of it. But SKULLING SKULL is very awesome, there is no way that I could get even interested in anything going on in the film, and so "suspension of unbelief" really was not there. One of the worst films, and probably it's boring I've ever seen. </ 1/1 / / 1/10
