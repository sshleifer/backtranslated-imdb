This was one of the worst Wrestlemans I ever saw. It wasn't just exactly, really. A smart card, I thought it would be good, but every match seemed to have failed. Chris Benoit vs MVP One of the best matches. Benoit took. I just didn't think that MVP was good, but Benoit was saved this match. Kane vs Khali Wow, these two are not confused. Or maybe Kali and any other living person is not confused. Bad match. <br /> <br /> Melina vs Ashley doesn't have a feminine fight. The ECW Initiative on New Births I was happy about this match, until I found it. True, really sad. <br /> <br /> Attack against CM Punk vs King's Book vs. Jeff Hardy vs. Matt Hardy Vs. Mr. Kennedy vs Finlay vs Randy Orton Completely MITB bad match so far. The great thing to put it down, for many people in the ring at the same time. It didn't just live. Bobby Lashley vs Umaga O.K. not surprisingly, but not worse than night. Batista vs Undertaker This was perhaps the best match of the night. Very, very, very good to see something good for change. John Cena vs Michaels Shawn I feel like this match should be the end. People make a case for Batista vs. Undertaker, but this match was very good. I start to bite and see Cena win every match though. It's getting old. Now, I need to say, I feel this match is better than night, but I am a big fan of Shawn Michaels, so I am enjoying a little. Batista against 'Take it can be better, but I'm happy, so ... sorry. The last two of course are the best night's matches and everything else that came short.
