1914 was an amazing year for Charlie Chaplin. It was his first year in the film and appeared in more than 30 films! While most of these films were not very good, they gave him the opportunity to turn slowly to his persona screens. However, for this film, the behavior of "Little" was still going on. Sure Charlie looked at that part, but his behavior still had no beauty and skill which he later developed. Instead, Chaplin often tries to run, run or do other bad things for people because it doesn't seem to be quite visible. <br /> <br /> About this very small film, it's interesting to watch. While they do not know today, the Chaplin stars and Mabel Normand, Chester Conklin and Mack Swain - all the most popular stars and Keystone Movies. The problem with this film is that although it has a few nice screens, the plot seems unknown and is not well available. Chester and Mabel reached the race track (a very common theme in Keystone production - should be located next to the race track). Charlie and Mack are shown to log in. Mack is chased by the police to do so when Charlie is threatening Chester around and stealing his girlfriend. At the end, for no apparent reason, the fighters take Chester and Mack off - leaving Charlie and Mabel (who, oddly, didn't seem to extinguish with Charlie's brain behavior) or the film historian, this is a very forgotten film which is just important in Chaplin change. What he and other actors actually do in action, when it is not typical for Keystone film, not exactly when it appears today.
