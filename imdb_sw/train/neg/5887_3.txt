Jane Russell proved to be a very good music comedy in the name such as "Lords prefer Blondes"? but, sadly, this film hits that skill. There is a budget, with a beautiful picture of Paris, but the film doesn't work. Ms Russell seems to play Marilyn Monroe. That leaves anyone enough to play Jane Russell. Some of the other players are WAY out of their feature. <br /> <br /> There are several embarrassing events; most of all, scratched: there is a music number where African skeleton "cooks" marungi in a pot, after Alan Young singing a gorilla suit. <br /> <br /> This is interesting, sometimes embarrassing, losing resources. > Richard
