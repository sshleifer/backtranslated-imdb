Another good effort by the most popular American filmmaker. His understanding on the issue of racism is STAGGERING, and IMPRESES me for more than one level. The defendant that Lee is actually a little deceiver, a poisonous woman who uses the Affirmative Action Action system to make the low-quality movies is NONSENSE, just right propaganda. The theory that Lee would decide to misuse the current political legitimacy in the United States to produce anti-white movies that hate hate is just FALSE and bad. Some of the rebels of Lee even now as it suggests that GOTB honors American Americans, while placing it under another category: obviously, another FALSEHOOD distributed by people who continue to exist in different communities in the country America and elsewhere. <br /> <br /> My favorite part in the movie is a long term conversation between the rich black Republican and others in the bus. Comments submitted by this person are only WRONG - both on board. 100% UNTRUE. He ignores education, unlike young people who are trying to trap him. <br /> <br /> Exhibition of TERRIFIC, and the INTELLIGENT script makes an experience of watching who has ever been hit by any political movies generated. I also want to describe the incredible LIES that Million-Man Millions had only 80,000 people involved! <br /> <br /> (And now you should do it to take all the words displayed in a large letter ...) <br /> So Lee's message sends here? If a person disagrees with your political opinion, you only use violence and throw it away. I thought the movie said "ONA then" ...? It seems, Mr.Lee is for discrimination then after all, that is, unlike those of the KKK lunatics in front of it: then it's just for those blacks who are in line with the democratic line of Association of thinking. For a large amount of "opening slaves" ... <br /> <br /> Last copyright: "This movie was completely financial and black people." And distributed and sold by the great Hollywood studio operated by Jews and whites who Farrakhan despises them ...
