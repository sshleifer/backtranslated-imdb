The 60s (1999) D: Mark Piznarski. Josh Hamilton, Julia Stiles, Jerry O'Connell, Jeremy Sisto, Jordana Brewster, Leonard Roberts, Bill Smitrovich, Annie Corley, Charles S. Dutton. NBC mini-series (later released for video / DVD as a full film feature of the film) about the honest of the 1960s, as shown through the eyes of the white family and the black family. The first half of the film is run by Dutton's best performance as Pastor Willie Taylor and evenly spread the storyline among the family. However, Dutton's behavior is killed by half and the black family is completely forgotten in half, abnormal, and bad half. 2. RATING: 4 out of 10. Not counted (later tested PG-13 for video / DVD release ).
