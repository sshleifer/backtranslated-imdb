2 stars from 10 possible - and that's more generous. I thought for the cast of James Woods, Cathy Bates, Randy Quaid, Lou Gossett, Jr., and Henry Thomas - how they miss. I was wrong. I can only ask what Sam Shepard's drug was at the end of the week he drew a piece of dribble. I would like to accuse Sam S. of having nuts, this film, according to his play, confirms. <br /> <br /> This is a kind of very much b.s. The actors like to beat their teeth because it gives them the opportunity to disappear completely. However, for the viewer sitting through this non-nonsensical rubbish, there is absolutely no love about this film. You have not seen a non-working family until you see this group. Pa is mad, Ma is a fool, son is mad and daughter is, oh yes, mad. They also have lips on them that say the words that would blender amazing, especially the young daughter. In addition to the top, if that is not enough, the plot - and so so thin can read well - it has a hole in it the size of Alaska. Ma is a plot to sell their bones. If it turns so it's Pa. Now I do not claim to be a real estate expert, but the last time I have looked at, the property owned jointly has to sign the owners in order to be sold. If one of them owns the property, then another could not sell the law, so it would be useless for that person to do so. Pastor Mr. wants to ignore this basic truth, and therefore, his plot does not work. Not that anything else was working yet. The only reason possible anyone could have a look at this film is as if they like to see James Woods for a complete weakness, and I can't imagine why anyone would like.
