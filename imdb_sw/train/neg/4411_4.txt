Michael Rooker is a good actor, but does not have a leading business except in a small budget movie. In fact they do not have many charisma. Ryo Ishibashi has the highest presence of screens, and sadly he is not actually the main character. While most of the screens are going to Rooker's face-brick. Danielle Harris (from the 4th and 5th of Halloween movies) plays her daughter, and she is beautiful and entertaining but it is not as smart and one of her dumb errors finds one of the main characters killed . Fighters Fred Willard, Bobcat Goldthwait, and Stephen Furst are here in interesting roles. Just looking at what happens to these characters is very valuable. Vincent Schiavelli plays an Assistant to the God of the local Mafia, and it is difficult to tell him if he works as a movie if not comedy. Tim Thomerson is also in this film. It seems to be in every small budget direct video video. Thomerson is also in the lowest budget comedies. Seeing many comedians and comic actors in this film made you feel like a spoof. What is the parody of the movie Yakuza? It's hard to tell them at some point. There is indeed a little step of Yakuza. Thugs and Goons help is dangerous and well healed. Some of these types of movies have visible buttons that work on the Comic Book Store or as stocks on Piggly-Wiggly. In general this film is not recommended. In some points it looks like a comedy or parody. Then for other points it works as a good act of action. Then it blows the answers to the end. Without the donations of Danielle Harris and Ryo Ishibashi this movie could measure Zero for my humble opinion.
