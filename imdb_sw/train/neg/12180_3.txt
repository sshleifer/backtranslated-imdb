This film is very bad, but however, it can be a hilarious time, although this humor is not quite possible. The plan was infinite. I don't think even a 2-year-old would be believed by an amazing idiocy that filmmakers tried to hang together in the story. However, on the positive side, some of the most horrific acts of horror brings great humor. For example, "Wow, Lady Hogbottom has a big missile behind its back yard!" It gets worse (and even funnier), but I will block it. <br /> <br /> Acting is generally delicious. Many children's responsibilities are of a kind, but not very reliable. On the other hand, Annie is very good around-around. Adults do not have their responsibilities completely, but this is a good thing. If they tried to be trusted, the film would be worse. Which is difficult to think. When you have passed the total trick of the film, there is really a short time to stand around-not-crappiness. The place where Lady Lady Hogbottom has run away and the girl is very surprised, though it is a desperate despair when they are caught by the police. The character of the farmer, at the very least, is the sun's sun that is approaching, but never breaks in the dark. Looking at this film really causes me physical pain. However, there were several parts of the liberation that made it almost impossible to look at without starting bleeding inside. They were judged on its good parts alone, the movies would be about 5; Unfortunately, some of the movie are not sure 1. So, I offer 3. <br /> <br /> That is very good, I would say.
