Van Dien should be embarrassed in the memory of this very poor film, in fact everyone should be involved. Being honest I am more embarrassed to admit that I have looked at it from beginning to end. Production values ​​are somewhere between the original 'Crossroads' and 'Blocked Cell Block H' series. Many five years will be able to negotiate more realistic conversations and more conspiracy. For drama shows, if you can think of more garbage porns that you have ever seen - one of those where the action is given by a 'novel' story to describe how some of the former peroxide blonde boiler has found spit - caused by several blokes and mustache - you will have a certain idea to do in 'Maiden Voyage'. Still more, you can't even move forward to sex events, because it doesn't exist. Awesome horror movie.
