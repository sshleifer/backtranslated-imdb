Sorry everyone ,, I know this is supposed to be "art", film, but wow, they should be handed in the observation so that people can beat their minds out and not look. Although the location of the area and the direction of the image was excellent, this story is very painful to see. The absence of the song was cruel. Shots of loooonnnnng were very long. How long can you look at just two people sitting there and talking? Especially when conversations are two people complain. I had a hard time getting through this film. Exhibitions were good, but how much dark, dark, insensitive, what you could take? The only thing I liked was Maureen Stapleton and her red dress and play area. Otherwise this was the arrangement of Bergman. And I'm not a fan either of her. I think anyone who says they enjoyed 1 and 2 hours of this is well, lying.
