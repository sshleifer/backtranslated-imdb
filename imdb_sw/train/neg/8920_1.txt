... but this should be the worst Christmas Carol deal with all the time. And that takes some to do, what and likes of different life efforts. Don't make a mistake - I have nothing against Cicely Tyson. I am very happy in other roles (see Sipsey in Fried Green Tomatoes, for example). But the script does not give him an option but to chew the environment. And finding him does, and all the passion of Tiny Tim merge into a Christmas spoon. I give classics at any time: Alastair Sim, 1951. With the exception of Scrooged's discrimination, all the others are just an extraordinary effort to understand the old, current, or Christmas spirit.
