I didn't take too long here, I wanted to say that Darkman 3 is amazing. I have all 3 on DVD, I have added this to my collection of DVD sets. Darkman comes up with the best, like Indiana Jones, visitors, Star Wars, die hard, you get a point. There is no fearful, exciting, it puts out there. Many thanks to all the staff, and set to throw the Darkman trilogy. By the way you are wondering how I got this on DVD. I bought it online, however it is a 4th place, as you know most of the American DVD players are region 1. If you have Sony Playstation 2, you have the best DVD player because it is a player in the region. Just go to set up and select the region of magic you want (1-9).
