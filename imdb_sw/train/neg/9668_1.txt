1940. - Lodz's visit to Lodz in Poland made by Nazi, written by the German cameramen and the integration of the Jewish community, comprised of photographs of photographs, international news sites, and text-based films that reflect Jewish In the world as rebels and parasites. This 'book' means the life of the Jews from the traditional views of anti-Semitism and Nazi approval. A valid racial discrimination, shown by the movie. I personally find this scary and offensive film. One can only hope that such images will never come back to the screen.
