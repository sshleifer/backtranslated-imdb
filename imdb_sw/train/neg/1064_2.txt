show: this film describes many stories of love without any cooperation. The sole aim of this movie seems to be showing love in many different ways. <br /> <br /> Every story has only a few minutes, therefore no development of characters and almost no plot. Just a sketchy view of the plot. The author tried to create in converting points that have an amazing viewer view. However, that didn't work out because you didn't know the characters before or these "jokes" were just quiet. <br /> <br /> This is a film about love that cannot reach your heart. Several times. Or even more, I don't know and don't care.
