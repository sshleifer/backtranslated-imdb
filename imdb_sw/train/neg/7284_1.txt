Wow. I read on this film and it seemed so bad that I had to see it, and my master, I could cross it in St. Louis. Where do I start? The National Army tried to follow 5 years later on the success of the House of Animals, but they did not completely mark. I'll go for a while with these short flicks. <br /> <br /> Short Films # 1 <br /> <br /> Poor Peter Riegert (Boon from Animals House). It seems, he was not working back then, so boys in National Lampoons probably call and say "hey, we're doing c ** ppy movie, they want to be in it?" Peter was like "well, I haven't done these many days, why not?" He was a good character at the Animal House, but he could not carry this pole flop for 5 minutes. find yourself. It is also wonderful that they are really happy marriage. So he dismisses him, there he goes, and Cooper is the supervisor of children. This, of course, leads to him spontaneous house, losing several children, and sleeping with a fake of New York's song (including Diane Lane very limited). Then the wife comes back, wants children, and the film ends with a flip coin that will determine the fate of children. The idea was really clever, but the director sounded. All the characters seem like they are asleep, they needed to be doped up. Sorry Boon, your legacy was lost by this flop. <br /> <br /> Short Films # 2 <br /> <br /> RESTRICTIONS Beautiful girl, recently finished college, does not know what to do with her life. So she becomes a slut, begins to sleep around some of the rural people, takes their money at the time of death, and never stops until she gets the world's most powerful bed, Fred Willard (Ooops, meaning US president). Once again, it could be surprising, and though I was glad to be Corsaire (Ann Dusenberry in real life) she was not afraid to open it all, her job was bad. What a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Short video # 3 <br /> I can't believe I did it right now. Here's the Rookie Brent Falcone (Robby Benson) and veteran Stan Nagurski (Richard Widmark). Evil is small, naive, he thinks he can help people, though he is worried after a thousand times beaten. Nagurski, in fact, has just stopped caring. He looks at muggings, attack, you name it, and never interfere. He transforms the world is legitimate and he will probably be worthy if he does anything. Even Christopher Lloyd (at the end of a taxi run) gets into that stage, getting police to call him, committing crimes, but having his lawyer there to protect him. God bless America! Once again, it may be interesting, the performances were deliberate, but good, no power. Henry Jaglom and Bob Giraldi should be embarrassed to have their names on this schlock. I think the scriptures were not evil, the ideas were there, but the action was taken away from the attempt to evacuate the Iranian hostage crisis. If I were part of this film, I would like to have my name removed, it's awesome. Then again, that's why I looked. The only thing about this garbage is that Dr. John made a film (repeat "Go to Film" from time to time) and the film will not be "t longer than an hour and a half." Show this in the film and the title "what you should do once in the film making." This document should be left on the shelf because yep, it's bad.
