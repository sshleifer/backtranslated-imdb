ZOMBIE ZEXIE / / <br /> Ratio: 1.33: 1 (Nu-View 3-D) <br /> <br /> (real) village in the middle of anywhere, a little journalist (Emmy Smith) takes a grizzled hitchhiker (Joseph Haggerty) who says his two stories involving zombies to eat meat are known to haunt the area. Lost time lost, starting from the beginning and the performance of Haggerty very effectively in the important role. Worse, the two stories that include the time of flight include altogether, have been exacerbated by different displays and trends with Brad Sykes, who was responsible for the love of CAMP BLOOD (1999). This is not a 'fun' movie because Ed Wood's movie is 'fun' (he, at least, believed what he did and was honest in his efforts, despite the lack of talent); Sykes' home movies, in fact, multiply, boring and almost completely free of any redemption, and many viewers will feel angry and led by an unexpected, unwanted junk. The 3-D form is completely destroyed here.
