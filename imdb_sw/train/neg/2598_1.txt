Even in the worst films, there is usually a feature of redemption, something that you can say yes was bad, but there was a similar performance, or that part of the script, or a special effect, this was just awesome. Acting was delightful, a terrible script, full with the Food of the mouth that could not be used in Tiffany's references, and even the special effects were more destiny. This was a very bad film and even Drew Barrymore wanted to be deleted from history. Look at it if you want: a) Allow human pain to be severe. b) See how the film can be bad. This is one film where I can use clich√© "there is ninety minutes of my life I will never come back" indeed!
