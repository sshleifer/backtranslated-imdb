Evil and capital "A". This should be one of, if not, the unfunniest show on TV right now. I am close to fighting the bush as it receives, but this show does not even chuckle out of me. What you think about Bush as president does not really do and if you like this piece of display. "Jokes" is not quite funny. For example, in the area where the bush has its clothes on its head: "Welcome to the al-qa-eeda camp!". There is nothing interesting about it. Should it be joke? The ads that were displayed in the weeks leading up to the show, made it, were funnier than showing itself, and that's just sad. We expect this is not considered for the second season. It shouldn't even have a first.
