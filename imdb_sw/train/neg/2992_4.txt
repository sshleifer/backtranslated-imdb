Almost the slasher films of the 1970s and 80s, those associated with the dead walking were probably the second most well known. Although slasher films had 'Black Christmas' and 'Halloween' to get something around, zombie flicks had 'Dead' films of George Romero. And of course after the first two successes in the series, other directors wanted to earn a lot of money. Many Italian directors were very impressed, such as Lucio Fulci who brought us' Zombie 'year after' Dawn of the Dead 'of Romero', known as' Zombi 'in Italy and other countries, and it was there that Fulci film was known as 'Zombi 2'. In addition to the walking dead are not connected to Romero's film, but it's a good film in its own right. It was a great success in Europe and 9 years later a born member. Continued: Much of a good, beautiful environment. Wonderful score. Acting is not very good, but cast is a game and they seem to enjoy the experience. After a slow start, the speed continues along with that of the flick action. Huge cheese and hilarity inappropriate for lovers of bad films. Good work on the effects of doing. Lots of blood and a certain good name. <br /> <br /> Cons: Welcome to plot plot. Nothing has ever been seen before. Unfortunately breaks some items from the first couple of 'Living Living' movies. Kadibodi characters. Is not too old for the bad rock music of the 1980s (not that I say all the rock music of that period is bad), clothes, and feel for the whole film. The last thought: First and foremost, this is not the end of Fulci's worship service. In fact, I don't know if it would mean to sink where the film is over. For those who do not know, Fulci was ill during production and ended departure and replaced by Bruno Mattei. Mattei film is very good, but as this film is very good campy fun. And that's all the true film, it's just something to look for fun. <br /> <br /> My rating: 3.5 / 5 (So-bad-is a good rating) 2/5 (great rating)
