The Influence of Crime 2 is included in the new Black / Satan Wedding of the Satanic Satanism, and it is also a good thing, because when I see the movie and know there is good (especially something that is as unknown as this) I'm always curious. Now I have had my curiosity satisfied and never will look again. Most of CI2 is nothing but "change" to CI, and pictures of Ethel asleep, recalling good memories, I think. Thanks to the 13th Authentication she has been given from Napa State (strange as she got to see The Cramps play when she was there) and sent home half run with a good old woman that Ethel quickly took to call "granny". All of these have been made by the video camera so the picture and sound are pathetic, and even it's complete with a few "lines". Of course Ethel does his thing, which is to take anyone with him and food, especially a young man who witnessed one of his actions and spreading his dessert. Also, you are eligible for any half-house for the killers with a large spot with sharp knives in the kitchen and the poison of the mouse under the kitchen hole. I think that's a question of "wrong". If you liked or disliked Crime, any way there is no good reason to look at this except for curiosity. Someone is wondering why the creators of this even failed. 2 out of 10.
