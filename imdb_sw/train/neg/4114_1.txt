There are some great philosophical questions. What is the purpose of life? What happens when we die? And why do they make this argument? Cluster is amazing. Theme works are automatically. Special effects have decreased. And the movie is a single attack attack gun among some of the most popular Hollywood shots produced. But then, if they were good shots, everyone would have died in the first five minutes and there would be no movie. Worse did not happen that way. When you tried to delete it several times, I took it and saw how bad it could be. I am glad I did it because (SPOILER?) The last line is the ignorance of the entire dopey crown, the worst situation. It is not even appropriate for the second feature of the feature to the third-party car during the season. In addition to the typical nature of the film, I am very concerned about its impact on a small audience. Americans come out like this and then wonder why events like Columbine happen. This is a banal cinema at Brobdingnagian level!
