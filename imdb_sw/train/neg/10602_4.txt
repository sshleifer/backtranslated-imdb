This film is more than stuck and the only reason for this movie is worth viewing is because the stars of Jean-Claud Vam Damme in this movie. There are other effective pictures in this film and the best in the end of the film. <Br /> <br /> Acting in this film is very bad and it is the worst job I've ever seen with administrators 2 Bill Goldberg and Michael Jai White can't do it with ALL. With this movie far away it should be one of Jean-Claud Vam Dammes the worst movies he has done and if you are looking at one of his main movies you should look at the Blood games, KickBoxer or the Death Death. <br /> <br /> Most of this movie is crap / OK and my rating is 4 out of 10.
