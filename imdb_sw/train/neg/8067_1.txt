First let me say that this should be on my list of boring movies. No, and I don't mean anything in this movie is even exciting off. Most of them are very mixed and if you continue to want only you would end! Some people want a movie that makes them "think" through the whole thing, which I say ... "The most powerful to you" !! I on the other hand just want to accept. That brings me back to this stinker, the entertainment is not. This movie is stupid and full of time. It seems that many here also agree. Many of these did not make any sense, and at the time you think you have one place that has happened that another blind place comes with .... well I think you see where this goes. Avoid, this finds .... bad!
