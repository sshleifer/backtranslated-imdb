This movie seems to have many people say it's one of the most brutal of all time. After just looking, I can say it does not live according to those claims. <br /> <br /> The concept of the movie is really closed. But in general, implementation was not quite effective. Even the last place (eyeball eye) is not very real. I expected something wrong, instead it had a much lower quality than the year that appeared on the film as a minimum under military budget Sh. T. Anyone who wants to see a real movie will be ignored, because there are no stories (although most people know this). Gore workers will lose heart since, contrary to faith, blood and guts here are few and middle. Not to mention the actress actress can be one of the worst history. It doesn't matter what people say, this movie is not surprising, it looks quite clear. Avoid.
