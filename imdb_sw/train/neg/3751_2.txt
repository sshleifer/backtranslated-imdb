I am a big fan of David Lynch. This film, however, was quite a desperate experience. In addition to natural music? which actually puts the mood of the film? you don't have all the features that I've come to share with Lynch work. Visible is preferable, and say the least, and the conversation is clear and unknown to have any interest. It feels more like awkward film students trying to make movie dogma arma than the work of an experienced director. I have seen many amateur movies and the best works of the best camera, landscape, voice and script. This film does not have almost any artistic attributes. I feel like looking at Davids' home videos, produced during weekend trips with other friends.
