For a few years of watching semi-decent films for my children, I have had a sixth sense to recognize real, direct and video efforts that are very painful to stay (for anyone more than eight years old). I hit the ball on this one and the children spent half of the movie asking me "what did he say?" and "why did it?" and my eyes were so bad from talking every minute or if the characters did a very bad job of starting a random plot change. And sometimes a person decides that having a full knowledge of the sword is "bringing authenticity" to the film, please call it with a color-colored knife. "Prehysteria!" was the head and shoulders on this. Arrgh.
