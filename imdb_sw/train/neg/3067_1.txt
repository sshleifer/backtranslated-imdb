This is just bad. Sometimes remake, even if it disappears from nature, it's good alone. They can bring another perspective and achieve a certain definition that makes them unique and enjoyable. This was like bad ideas and done as it could. This was not good even to stand on its own. Viggo Mortenson is a top actor, but some of his choice of roles and projects leave something of want. The previous "Destruction of Point" was an exciting, psychological adventure; this is not an adventure at all, and is not recommended or enjoy anything. This was given through the number of filming numbers, interfering with the points of the conspiracy that someone who believes Hollywood will enjoy what they see as today's film viewers. Basically, they see us as a group of unwise people. It insults that a person will put this as a feature film, and even try to fix this tribal ethnic group. Architectural devices, elements of "make-out-so-do-not-fail", ignorance conversations, non-viewable characters, amateur orientation ... This is obviously evil ....
