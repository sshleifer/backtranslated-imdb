There is no place near the original. It is the most accurate copy of the story. But the lead is very poor. Basinger is weak - without leading well. Baldwin is only the second league compared to McQueen. I just watched it from curiosity, being a great fan of Peckinpah's masterpiece, and I got what I thought. Welcome to the B's second-choice film and lead. I was not sad yet, I don't know they just tried to do. This remake does not attempt to play with original material, not taxes and actually does not have a very good actor of its time. <br /> <br /> Reminds me a bad picture of a beautiful picture. </> <br /> This is a perfect waste of your time. Save 2 hours or see nature (again))
