I probably always go to see the movie Woody Alleb, if someone does not ever know when he can just return real to his previous greatness. Only one or two times or lines can do it well. for sadly however this film does do'nt do it on any color. Saying the truth makes you sad and even a little guilty. I'm sure my opinion is like many other Woody fans, but what can anyone say? It may be time to consider its Clarinett, which in my opinion, she is very good. Saying all of this, I'm still going to any new Woody film can come and later. There is always hope and I will continue to love and respect WOODY !!
