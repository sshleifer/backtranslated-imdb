Based on the film film, 3 young women lose their car and end up with a creepy family. YAWN. Look at the 36-minute introduction of the OJ car track and the white sedan instead of bronco. YAWN. Older woman with a cold and cold problem control her daughter ... YAWN <br /> <br /> 23 hours of watching actors eating - YAWN Trying to find out what heck they eat ... Then there may be a drinking game here ... neither - YAWN <br /> <br /> Swimming bath show ... I really got my interest for several seconds. <br /> <br /> Absolute random and uninspired murder ... YAWN <br /> <br /> Last ... dude! that psychology has stopped - why the entire film could not be like the last 5 minutes ... unfortunately that's - my advice - very soon for the last five minutes and look and then put something good in the player - for me to come back to sleep .
