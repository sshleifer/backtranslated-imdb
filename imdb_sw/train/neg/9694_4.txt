Otto Preminger directs this light as a story of fur. Bohemian Jean Seberg and his widow of Bohemian widow David Niven holiday in Southern France and nutty Mylène Demongeot. Things are well until the friend of the family Deborah Kerr shows. Nivens, a damaged womanizer, gets the victory of Kerr very difficult to resist. That's good for Seberg, as long as Niven loves him and leaves him (as he did with all the women in his past days ... including Demongeot). Although it looks like he is the second banana in the life of Niven, Seberg revenge on Kerr. Preminger tells the story by accelerating from Seberg's perspective and by cleverly combining black and white with sunshine events. The movie Georges Périnal is amazing. The film has some of the slight dimensions of Preminger heavy, although it rarely allows almost any, which makes it difficult to do what participants are feeling really. Arthur Laurents wrote a script and is full of acidic conversations and funny scenes (especially involving bird-brained Demongeot). Seberg joins well, but Niven is very interested ... and does not show chemistry including Seberg or Kerr. Preminger actually mis-action and that casting. It is a visible task made by someone near Charles Boyer. And Geoffrey Horne as the defendant of Seberg and Pastor of Martita as his daffy mother. Juliette Gréco, playing himself, sings a headline in Paris's nightclub. The main names are for Preminger regularly Saul Bass.
