I can't call it bad, but there is nothing shining on this film, and it is associated with logical development of a fantastic foundation. It comes out well, but once the main hit has been done, it is done in a small part of a little girl who is not compelling, and some of the action events that are a wonderful non-fiction. For example there is a long shot at the airport where the lights are stroboscopic. No description of it. Is it reliable that the storage area of ​​the airport will have lighting lights and extinguish with frustration, and just enough to allow the Snipes to make its rough escape escape? This is one of the few cases of actions that have been used to set up systems that are not appropriate to draw one in strengthening faith. In addition, the entire premise appears that the US CIA team could shoot there but remove and say "national security" for Brits. This gimmick depends on the model which is far from the truth and be satisfied. There are many effective movies out there. Best organized, best implemented. This is sometimes fun but there is not enough meat on the bone and over time it becomes boring bad - something that should never happen in a good movie action.
