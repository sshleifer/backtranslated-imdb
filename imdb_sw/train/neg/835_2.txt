After seeing all the King Lion and the Lion King II have enjoyed all well. I thought Lion King 1.5 could be worth looking. It's a disappointment! Disney must be desperate for income. <br /> <br /> Especially now that they lost the program and pixar. Usually, they just took pieces of photos that were left on the floor editor (or trash can) and collected them together to make the luck of the <br /> <br /> quick. Unlike LK I & II, all that had powerful lines of story. <br /> <br /> This movie is not suitable for the story. When characters and animation are happy to enjoy, there is not enough material here for the film. Some bits can be good to fill 2 discs on the original offering. <br /> <br /> Disney - Sorry about you by putting this garbage to make buck quickly! take time and effort and keep our job permanent.
