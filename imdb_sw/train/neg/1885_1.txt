If you are looking for a film that shows an absurd presence and the misery of middle life is found in a non-communications network with false values, then this is your film. If you are also what the film is sharing and keeping your interests, then you should look elsewhere. There are many films that do better. For example, try some black films and Bergman. Filmmaker saw that in order to show the spiritual poverty of the middle class he should give the observer a difficult and vacuum view after another until finally the film comes to its end of anxiety and delight. If you value your time there are better ways to spend two hours, such as cleaning your home, for example.
