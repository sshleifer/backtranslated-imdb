This movie does not show anything original. Each idea or (action) scene can be found in many of the previously released movies. Nick Fabulous is quite clear here. Even Patton will be calm and evil and not good. Mr. Duvall is the same, but he has a very small part. Also Angelina, so how can we identify its new proven skills? In general, there are many characters, so that no one has something so well known. This makes the film easy to forget. Not bad, don't you think?
