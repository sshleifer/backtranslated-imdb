After reading a good review about this film I thought it was time to go and see it. I don't know why I was having trouble. Basically this family has been sent by a leading tip to the great gold treasure, hidden by the Knights Templar during the Independence War. It seems it must be kept out of UK hands at all costs. First, why said Knights to transfer treasures from Europe to America? How did Nic Cage's behavior noted that 'Charlotte' was actually a ship? Do they define all the symptoms and riddles for a minute? And how could two people be robbers and steal what is the best paper in the world? These are just some of the holes of the conspiracy at this small point of the Hollywood gone. Cage has been in many practical movies - 'Face-Off' and 'The Rock' - why has he put himself under this? Does he grow old? His character is very angry - somehow this 'casual' guys steal the Independancd Declaration, out of thieves and guns, running from the FBI and generally appears invincible. The whole film is not quite good and all in it was completely disappointed.
