It has Christopher Lee, it has a great 1970s computer bankers that make Teletype voices like the screens on the screen, has radiation isotopes that are not just glowing in the dark but they are sounding, it has a volcano! The evil aliens have hid themselves as sirs! waves of waves! The earthquake! hitting cars! hitting coffee machines! and as a peak, the whole planet is difficult. What? How has this film been so amazing, facing mind? Answer, my friend is because 90% of this film is designed to set up shots, many of them include long songs, pan, or zoom in a mix, or consistently all three, they have nothing but to give the staff something to do. There are endless shots of our characters to drive, get in and out of cars, drive again, walk around things, get into cars and drive ... I sat there looking at the end of the fortress of anything in an amazement "Say something , please someone, say something ... DO something ... nothing ... "<br /> <br /> Talk, when it comes, it's awesome. "Maybe their minutes are measured at a different rate than ours." The script comes in the destruction of the world with stock images, right in this speech from Lee as a great guest: is corrupted! "<br /> <br /> This is writing a Neanderthal SF script. This is the kind of inspiration that is found in the Japanese Japanese movie of the 1950s aimed at children aged 7. It is, and I am collecting such things, the most frightening line of God from the English SF language since Buster Crabbe . It asks you that this film was released the same year as Star Wars and Contact Welcome. Lee, who beat me regularly as an intelligent actress, useful and sure of his boundaries, gives his line. if he went to kill his agent by taking him to this pile of drek. I will not blame him.
