After seeing the fire of Eliza Dushku in Beautiful Beauty, I decided to take this one instead of the Living Dead, of all movies. It has not seen it yet, but, considering it is one of the most tragic movies, while safely saying I have made the wrong choice. There is nothing to recommend this movie, and I'm talking about refusing to kill more. There was no sexual appeal for young people largely for poor movies if I knew what you did Summer Summer or Valentine or Urban Legend. It did not make sense, it was not excited, it had very little acting or writing text. The release date was often seen during the year, and the reason is obvious. The whole movie comes as a bunch of trivial events that are thrown down correctly, with a negative effect. Get worse, if you want to see Dushku. I would like to see movies with him and Elizabeth Harnois very hot - but I don't think that would make this film appear. Casey Affleck, and so promising in Good Advice, is bad here - it seems that they don't mind with guts. That's enough on this.
