The non-transfer orientation leaves a beautiful beat for good but for bland, which the dialogue seems to be considered rather than a heart, and the appearance of the money beaten by ghosts lacks any feeling of fear or magic; Edward Woodward, like the Christmas Spirit Now, circles on stilts and seems to be making sense of Bernard's Cribbins. As Scrooge, George C. Scott is also wry, and never seems to believe the truth, which stimulates its performance of its effects. The events that have been shown to his past have a huge impact as if he was half-flicking through his family album. No one else seems to put any effort, except Frank Finlay, who is more vulnerable.
