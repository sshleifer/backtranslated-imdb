Life is very short for movies like this. I knew that it would not be good when I realized what I was to be accused of - that David Schwimmer would be playing the real-person of the person playing in 'Friends'. Let's say, or a boy can't play anything but nerd or is not available any other place. I feel it is a combination of both. And it must say that it is very difficult to love a movie that completely destroys Gwyneth Paltrow's talent, Barbara Hershey, Toni Collette and Carol Kane!
