I rarely write a negative review of this site, but this time they felt. The Night listener is undoubtedly one of the dullest films I have seen. Nothing happened in this film that ever happened - I was not worried about the characters, he did not buy for a whole plot of mystery, he was not worried how it was .... nothing. <br /> <br /> No comedy, no action, no thrills, no suspense, no. Important factors include (no demolition - nothing to destroy): a man riding through a window, a dog runs out of the hotel room, a car goes to a harsh and horny horn. I really enjoyed the "One-hour" picture and I was hoping for a role similar to Williams, but the trouble was very low. What more desire is that I am sure there is a good film there somewhere - the idea was interesting and I would be kind to the characters, but it didn't work for me. I might even have given 1/10 but the logo has been saved for modifications for Manufacturers
