It seems like the brilliant Shonda Rhimes team has made a record of this somewhere on the beach, perhaps for MediocreLand? "PP" reminds me of any of the most boasting, promising the first time but predictable within 1 season David Kelly flicks (Picket Fences, Ally McBeal, and now Boston Legal). The incidents of evil they find are foreign, they cause pity or sadness. And it really makes good medical dramas - the worst state you are afraid of, "This may be me" feeling. Nor is it funny. <br /> <br /> The executives are very good, but the plot lines are dead and cannot be restored. I am a professional, and let me tell you - Amy Brennan has an unskilled, unskilled, unskilled professional. Anyone who writes the things of them has moral values ​​and relocation / transfer courses in Stanford. One should give them a Code of Ethics to read (part with the wife's nose and the professional involvement). No retired is bad. Women expecting men who have migrated - have died, we have graduated "Sex and City". Addison in her boyhood abuse towards a young man she loves - an improper age, seems to be unusual for a woman over 40 years, and this talented actors do not have her own faith and does not give very well. The only successful successes are Addison struggling with his decision to move to LA, and "Voodoo Doctor" and to cope with the widowhood. <br /> <br /> This concept can work with the entire writing team.
