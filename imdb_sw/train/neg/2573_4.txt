If you have more time to lose ... it's okay. It goes at a good speed but to pull this film will need a little time and a little more history on the safe. <br /> <br /> Acting is the same. Mariana Klaveno as a sitter works best and is more confident. William R. Moses played a good role as husband. Gail O'Grady, as a wife, had a weak part and the reasons for returning to work were not developed. <br /> <br /> The end is a silly type. Like most of the sitter movies ... there are some interesting places ... but it generally leaves you wondering why you have spent time.
