I took this film for $ 5 dollars on a discount book shop, Adam Sandler is an amazing actor and I thought it would be a good movie, well, it wasn't. There was no line of story at all, a bad joke, and another player said "F-Word" every other word he said, the curse was often not disturbed but this was over. And worse than the lack of the story line was partly when Sandler started just talking on the camera in half the movie in the movie, reminding me of explorer Dora when they turn around and look at the screen and ask you questions. And at the end of all it is when they randomly put Bikini shots of regular girls in the movie. In my opinion, Do not give this film, it's a waste of money
