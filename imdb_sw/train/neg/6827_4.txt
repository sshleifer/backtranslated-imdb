Dogs are as dumb, in this very black comedy, allegedly black comedy. Basically what happens as Chris Klein is trying to maintain a low standard, he finally deals with the "Three Three Amigos" version, without laughing. To the black comedy to work, it must be bad, which "Play Dead" is not. In order for the black comedy to work, it cannot be a spirited meaning, which "Play Dead" is. What the "Play Dead" really is, a city lining the nut. Fred Dunst does so by imitating the good character of Billy Bob Thornton from the "Simple Plan", while Jake Busey plays very good, well, Jake Busey. - MERK
