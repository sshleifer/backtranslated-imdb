Great. I just closed my first Demonicus view and failed words. I remember when I saw Charles Band's name on the film and my heart was running. He was never Wes Craven or John Carpenter. He was the foundation of hope for a small person. The boy whose films came to the video store instead of multiplex, but it was still more difficult than many developing junk we needed to endure. And now ... this. California emergency emergencies seen by the "Alps" and the abandoned train pit is actually a "old cave". I mean, they didn't even try to wear it with moss or film in a way that might suggest that it's anything more than an old train tunnel! Ugh! Instead of the shadow of the shadow of the shadow, such as the cover means, we are treated with the latest dude in Wal-Mart's dress. There are good fun bodies, who often comes to life and fingers your fingers, but they won't learn to stand up to the last five minutes. Why couldn't he be a man? Instead, we've had a boy boy Joe with a sword sword. Ouch. Charles Band ... you should be ashamed that your name is connected to that tripe. I like movies that are so bad, they are good. Hell, I constantly enjoy the flick that very bad, it's just bad. This, however, is unknown. A perfect example of making a goat, rather than making a better film.
