Vodka Lemon is an interesting, yet non-Arminian film that will enjoy some and think of others. Although it is well suited, the film does not exist in the actual "zing", depending on the many events that will appear common to the viewer of the gallery. The film has only a short time of the beauty of the movie, unfortunately, they deserve the film that deserves their skills. Very dark that the dark comedy and light have a great drum, Vodka Lemon leave a lot of disoriented views and ultimately depressed. You may laugh, but this time you will be a few and the distance between the snow-covered snow-filled sea filled with a visible end of the bus. Good efforts, eventually made for lack of co-story.
