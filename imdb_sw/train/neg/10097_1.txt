I stopped with BB and picked 4 zombie flicks to look at the weekend. Now, I understand that the effect will be cheesy, acting will be small-par, and the set will be suspect. So I didn't expect much. But you must at least have a story. Stories do not exceed anything except when ..... definitely, they did not have any time either. The “Zombie Nation” had 5 zombies that appeared near the end of the film that all looked like a new wave. A zombie photo on the front cover is not available on the film. It was very sad to look and had nothing to give the genre. It is only about 81 minutes but it looked like 2 hours. According to my wife (who could only hear the movie since she was on the computer in another room), it seemed like a porn zombie .... which you think, looks kinda gross ..... but it wasn't even good. The only thing you see is that the author probably tried to do many things and end up with an extraordinary mess. It was a free rental and I still feel purchased. I evaluated 1 out of 10 because IMDb will not use me to misuse.
