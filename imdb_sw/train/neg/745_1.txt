I don't know how to start even describe how this movie is bad. I love bad films, since they are often more entertaining. I like bad bad effects, bad acting, bad music, and inappropriate patterns. With the exception of music (which was better than I expected), this film had all the features. Special effects were terrible surprises. The worst I have seen since my Nintendo 64. Some of the scenarios of watching include Wonders, a woman loaded with a foot of mechanical, the Big Ben area, the collapse of the train ... Wow, there are too many effects! Together, though, some of the incidents of guest visitors have been made. Acting was as bad as possible, after focusing on the book of H.G. Wells. With a good source of equipment, it is almost like the executives tried to be on-top to make it funny. And then there is a mustache ... one piece of distortion of the hair I have seen for a long time. Of course, only half of the movie has acting. Others are the characters walking around and badly release the release shots. To say that Timothy Hines is a non-executive director for non-executive directors. For the use of different color filters between shots for some reason, the use of bad backgrounds rendered to even within scenes, bad green observations, it is amazing to me how this person has received the permission of the leading movie. I can't think it would be possible to turn the brilliant book into this bad film. Bravo, Mr. Hines. Bravo. My advice to anyone who has a plan to see this film is to do what I did: have other friends who enjoy bad movies on, drink, play poker while watching, keep drinking, and maybe you can do all the way. It makes for the best movie, so enjoy and laugh yourself with no stress.
