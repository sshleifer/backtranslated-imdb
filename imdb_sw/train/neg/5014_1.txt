The movie has a long term, many tortured and agonized to end any movie I have seen for a long time. Unfortunately begins right after the opening credit. January Jones offers this timber performance, I was surprised that he did not have a fire when he approached candles in the film. I did not remember him from other films he has made (the blessings I believe. I have never judged the performance of the actors because in the film there are many things that can affect but in this case, it is really bad to stand out of the ATROCIOUS document. Meryl Streep would have trouble with but I swear when shes read from the cue card off the set. In other times I thought I might be really learning disabled or slow in some way for REAL! Poor, dialog and pacing is as bad as you will see but they still have no excuse for This performance is not done by the director to allow it to do. I feel for other actors. The small Indian / breakfast club were triggered in rotting burrito and regurgitated by the author-school authors.
