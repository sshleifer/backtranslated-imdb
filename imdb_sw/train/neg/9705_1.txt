I saw the movie as a child when it was released in the theater and it was so bad that it became a riot of the family joke. If the title was zero, this movie would get it. Dinosaurs were bad. The story of the story was ridiculous. Acting really not recommended to be called. Just because I even remember the name of a good movie is because my family still speaks of how BAD was actually.
