(Indeed, Barbra, I know you are the one who tricks those "NO" on my opinion 22 times. How many people should you teach to help you here? Do you have nothing better to do, if you look at yourself all the glass?) Steven Spielberg told Barbra that this was "the best film I have seen since" Citizen Kane ". That's so good it says - and serves as a good warning! <br /> <br /> What! What are the links to the film's point of view, and one that will hate you, never letting you forget the tears of all laughter and pain? Ingredients: Barbra Streisand's face, music, feminine female, Barbra Streisand Voice, Barbra Streisand leading, and ultra-corny / idiotic sounds. <br /> <br /> The game is full of common examples, this is a lot we know. In fact, almost everyone ?? by definition ?? It should be a typical example in Hollywood. Why does anyone want to act? For "art" ?! Well, if you are dumb enough to believe what they tell you in their careful interview? And Streisand has a great ego of all! This is quite successful. To be surrounded by cretins of narcissistic, and still manage on them all? incredible. <br /> <br /> Movie, like all of the "solo" effort, is a trip to ego directly out of hell. Each Streisand area has been automatically damaged. They were born yet. But if that was not enough, he sings a whole bunch of Streisandy songs? you know, the kind that enabled Mariah Careys, Dions of Celine, and Whitney Hustons of this world destroy our precious air waves for decades now. Because he is never eligible but the 100 events of South Park mock him. <br /> <br /> Cluster, Streisand wear as someone learn to be rabbi, looks like zany zaz comedy. In addition to being a problem, the obvious problem is that Streisand doesn't seem like a woman does not look like a man? I really don't know he is a man. The way he looks at this film, well? cannot be explained in words. E.T. it looks like a high school jock for comparison. He appears more visitor than Michael Jackson in 2015. He appears HORRIBLE. <br /> <br /> Songs. They made me fly away. Especially "Papa Do You Feel The Squeel Like Walrus Wife's Dement In Heat?" and "Tomorrow Night I will prepare a Pastor, YENTL 2: BITCH EXPERIENCE". Do you know that Streisand thought he had an early nose in his career, but changed his mind when they told him his voice could change? Can you believe it? He should do it! To kill two roots and one swipe, so would it. If you are interested in reading my Barbra Streisand text and other Hollywood scholars, contact me by email. DO YOU WANT TO GO FROM THE INSTITUTION?
