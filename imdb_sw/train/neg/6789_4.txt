The movie's program depends on one important thing: that the killer was also a caring, loving, caring father. Not that father and murderer is impossible. But this person is shown to kill a little girl without stirring or because and without feeling. This girl was a man's daughter. I don't think the father who cared so much for his own daughter could have a severe blood for another man's daughter. Or, in other ways, it may be very severe and still care for and care for his own daughter. And the idea of ​​being a murdered murderer would surely ask his parents' parents to take care of his daughter he didn't believe. <br /> <br /> That said, the characters were carried out faithfully and executives. I thought changing the color of Scott Bakula's eye made him more cold and more dangerous than usual. You can't see in his eyes.
