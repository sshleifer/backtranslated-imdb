DEATHSTALKER is perfect for B-fantasy film fans; this 80-minute exercise of the text of the film deals with everyone who can apply - an out-of-date, acting evil (except at least the old woman voice), scripting laughable and editing of the schlock, and the style style bargain-basement settings. No characters agree to attract or attract (especially, leadership has nothing to do with it), and participants gathered to do anything to increase on F-grade equipment. If it is not enough, then what about the lack of compelling plot (which this film does not have anything) to make DEATHSTALKER qualify as a great turkey? I was also angry that women in this movie do not use any other purpose than 1) to be high and / or covering; 2) getting rape; 3) to have sex with the hero; 4) all above. In addition, the back music is hideous; A wonderful mess of electronic noise, bursts of cheesy, and a cacophony blaring of orchestra. The combination of eye and eye reduces everything that is full of nary to one mind, DEATHSTALKER may be more suitable for people who want something to laugh (and believe, there's a lot of here). Otherwise, I do not recommend this CONAN of 100-grade want to be anyone at least.
