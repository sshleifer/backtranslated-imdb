I know, I know, "Sort 9 out of space" is the worst movie, or maybe "Manos, Hands of Fate." But I can't find work on these soccer-monkey movies. The * of course * they are bad. How can it be good? But if you are talking about movies and production values ​​and respect, the value of T.'s turkeys should always be "Yentl." All the horrible influences, all humanity that separates, cleans everything Barbra Streisand has done since 1964, reaches its peak in this film. From his special meeting of the worst, "Yentl" looks again "The star is born" and forward "Mirror has Two Visions." Nothing like that. What a feeling of emotion that motivated Streisand out to make this film I would like not to reflect, and what the audience would have played with I can not imagine, although I will have a nine-tenth chance you are not a member. The Nobel Prize winner and the bookkeeper Isaac Bashevis Singer was very angry with what Streisand had done to his story that he had insulted the public for him. It is a tax for Streisand's fraud that did not find himself that he did not kill himself, but made many bad movies.
