This movie seems to be on the job training for the Coppola family. It doesn't seem to know if it's "A" or "B" in the west. I mean, the hero is called Hopalong Cassidy for God. William Boyd must be around his grave. All western "B" posts have come. The guns of a two-gun-red guns in a white and honest helmet ("C'mon Thunder"), a black-black man, a heroine in trouble, a refugee of trouble, a fearful sheriff, on top bad etc. etc.. Acting, with a few exceptions, is the opposite of Yakima Canutt School of Doing. Chris Lybbert (Who?) As a hero and Louis Schweibert (who?) As humans seem like they could be home more in Poor Row's quickie. 30. Besides former players Martin Sheen, Robert Carradine, Clu Gulager and Will Hutchins helps little , but do not get enough to do this salvage. Martin Sheen / Robert Carradine to create a system? Should we believe that the character of Sheen was spirit? What? What is the purpose of the black gants? It was useless. <br /> <br /> Become a great western partner from all sorts, I struggled to find other features of redemption in this film. The movie was very good and looks realistic. In addition to the hero and the main villain, other characters seemed to be right. <br /> <br /> As the manufacturers revive the attitude of Hopalong Cassidy, they would consider showing him as an original written - grizzled race-mouthed running hand with a chip on his shoulder, a kind of part Lee Marvin would be too much in. <br /> <br /> What else can I say but .. Sounds, on a big fellow.
