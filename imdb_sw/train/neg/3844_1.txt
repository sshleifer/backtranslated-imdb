First, I would like to tell everyone who saw this film, that the actress who played "Transvestite" Will! It is one of my friends, whose name is Robert Dugdale, he is a strict actor, though he doesn't say much about his film, he has been in several games and music. He currently lives in Terrace B.C. when I came from, he comes to my house every Saturday * laughs * OK, now about the movie, I can't allow anyone who didn't see, since it's not a suitable movie to watch, The main reason I found that the bad movie is never available, continues to repeat the middle of time , so kinda hard to follow for some points, and secondly, very interesting * to laugh * Although acting is good, the movie is not just comparing.
