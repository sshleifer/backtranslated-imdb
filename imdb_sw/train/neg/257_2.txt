I love Jamie Foxx. I enjoy 99% movies I see. I came out of this. Now, I admit, I may have something to do with two middle-aged women in white back in the back field who laughed everything little ("No, Jamie moving on the door! HEE! "), But .. .. this was just very amazing. He could not have a supervised camera, and no cameras from the normal angle ... everything was your face, big, and irritating. <br /> <br /> Bad man tried to be soft and Malkovich-like, but for now, it's just old and tired. He did not bring something new or interesting. From all the characters, many of the verses you have seen come, many of you have heard before, and many "stiff" ... In fact, very much help is only sent. <br /> <br /> I love Jamie Foxx, and I think she is really funny, and I thought she was funny in this movie ... but not nearly funny enough for me to endure everything else. <br /> <br /> This game is required under shot-em-up, shots under offensive cameras, feeling more, more emotion, and more Jamie Foxx. I paid 2.
