When my wife and I decided to watch this film we thought it couldn't fail. I love Billy Crystal, my wife loves Julia Roberts and everyone we talked about and loved it. <br /> <br /> We were corrupted, in spades. To my side, I felt Billy's Crystal character was very straightforward and it did very little for the film. Indeed, he broke a good joke, but if the character did nothing but take place. <br /> <br /> And poor Julia Roberts. In the past he shows that he plays well as a powerful, decisive woman. In this flick, he seems to be completely overturned and had a very small fire. This is not Julia Roberts which my wife likes to watch. Well, if I could get one good thing, it would be Christopher Walken. Now it's entertainment. But, like Billy Crystal, there is nothing displayed by his character. If you are looking for a night of mindless worth of redemption, go see it. But if you are looking for a romantic, romantic comedy, this is not your film. Not above.
