I have never decided if this will replace Anaconda as "the worst movie I have seen". Even if you ignore dodgy voices, low-production standards and the awesome cameras film this film has nothing to go for. I just went to see if I had read the book and I wanted to see how they could work hard on a 2 hour film. Characters appear without any comment about who they are and then continue to play no important part in the details. Even the main characters do without cause so that during the movie to reach its peak it cares about what happens to any of them. I can admit that periodically the books need to be rewritten and that it is probably the right to judge this film against the book. But after my friends and I came out of the movie I had to spend more than home trips explaining what had to be happened. Even changing the real meaning of the book "Rancid Aluminum" by standing on another piece of meaningless sound only in order to allow the film to have a nice head. <br /> <br /> The real hunger of the film from beginning to end.
