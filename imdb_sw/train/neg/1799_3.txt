Skippy from "Family Relationship" plays Eddie, nussy 'steel' nerd who takes. When his wussy 'steel' singer, Sammi Curr, dies, gives us his fit to break all the advertising on his bedroom wall. But later it gets an incorrect record that has the spirit of its 'metal' image. He gets first in mind of retaliation, but they don't want to do it as Sammi does. Which is not too far from its main victims seem to go to the hospital. This film is quite laughable and has a lot of to do with real metal like to say, "Rock Star". Okay, maybe more tad of this piece, but you get my point. And how a person can strengthen someone who plays with Skippy from "Family Relations" has no clue. The comeo and Gene Simmons are the same, and Ozzy Osbourne reaches a partnership, I praise him for it, but otherwise you beat this. <br /> <br /> My Bridge: D <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Elise Richards gets topless, extra bonus at pool party
