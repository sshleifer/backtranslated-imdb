It's a burden of garbage. I can't even describe how this film was bad. The rating here is very difficult to believe. Avoid ... especially if you've enjoyed the first ginger. The first was well-written, well-written, well-presented. The second thing was' alrite'-honor as an independent film, but not clear to the first level ... The third is insulting for the series, period. I am increasing the film: 10, 6, 1. It's very bad. O, and yes, it has been installed in the past, the sister is still called Ginger and B Fitzgerald ... all that went in and half of the concept of American mythology. Sisters do not have real stories, or developments, or even open relationships ... They only try to live and 'be forever together'. That's about deep as it receives. <br /> <br /> Strikes that girls agreed to be in this bunch, after reading the script. <br /> <br /> Oh and something else, the staging of action was awesome - people seen from anywhere from time to time, as the girls turn around and there set up the lights of the lantern of the lighting woman and the American woman sitting there, almost go to the speech. Things were terrible, they could not escape from the fact that they were all based on a set, which did not help. Also, there was snow outside the camp, but it was not inside (for setting). <br /> <br /> Arrghh ,,, bad! In fact I was hoping it would be at least as good as the second.
