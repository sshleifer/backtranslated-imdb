I grew up reading Modesty Blaise, comics and books, and really is my heroine. Although I was not a great fan of Quentin Tarantino I have been interested in hearing a few years that he was thinking about making his film: Will he finally give the best treatment of the screens deserved? I heard about 'My name is Upole' a few months ago and examined the stars given here, and it was not surprising to know that the marks were not very much, since loved ones often have a hard time freezing fans' heart if they are not quite right. So I decided to read any reviews and see the film instead, and well, I have finished checking, and bothering, and sad, and yes, I was very angry, too. An outrage and outrage of giving over an hour of my time to see a very strange thing as the forgetful character of Blaise's behavior changed to a film that has nothing to give the viewer or fan. It seems that almost everything about this film is small and non-profitable, although it must be to see other actors in other early movies where they were so good so I can't blame them. But the screenplay and redirect ... my god, why not even make this kind of crap and the production code a little bigger than your regular TV film but done worse? I do not know the history of this film and I really did not want to know, but I can not only help to ask yourself how on earth could Tarantino to face directly say that it loves humility and then put its name on this? She lost a lot of respect in my eyes. The director was not a good person for this job and I can thank him for being honest for destroying my night. <br /> <br /> I give this film 3 stars and these stars go to the executives and technical quality that they could have been worse. The other seven stars are missing this film was not good. Oh well, for some time there will be a great modern Movie Modern Movie that has other goals than stealing money from the fans of Good. Although people like Tarantino make decisions I do not have my breath.
