And how it made me productive. The main character is an awesome display that is not too small. I can't stand up completely. He is a dumb ass without something to show. <br /> <br /> This is the worst cartoon in the last 10 years, no joke. The line of all stories is written incorrectly and implemented. Jokes are as bad as those on the life of Disney's Sweet Zack and Cody. I couldn't love this show more, it's awesome and should be deleted. Even the theme of the theme is bad. Head, even more. It seems that this show is written by the age of 15 years who depend on their own behavior and think it is a hot affair when they're really just a proud and creative lack of humor and humor. Johnny's quiz, go away and quickly!
