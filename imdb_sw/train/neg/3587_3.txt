How can they get from Joe Don Baker (like Pusser Bufford in the first sequel) to Bo Svenson (like Bufford Pusser in the second sequel). Because Bo Svenon looks more like Bufford Pusser still should 'nt's change because the first sequel was Joe Don Baker as Pusser Bufford and that one thing I wanted to see in a good second. <br /> <br /> I would like to give this movie out 7 out of 10 and I'd like to give 1 out of 10 if the did'nt story is not related to Bufford Pusser's life but it did and why I've given this film 3 out 10. > I strongly recommend that anyone planning to make this cheese I show is not and look at the first sequel instead.
