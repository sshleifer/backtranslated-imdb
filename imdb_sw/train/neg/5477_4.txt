Take SciFi Original Movie and combine in alternative history / little revisionist, and get "Rex Aztec." It seems Hernand Cortes, before winning the Aztec kingdom, had first won the Rex of Tyrannosaurus and his partner. That's the reason for this film. Due to this plot it could be implemented; The fact that only a kind of sucked is the tip of the cap for the authors. There are few problems. At the beginning, Cortes is played by Ian Ziering. Even with black pastors, Ziering as Cortes are on the lobby as Axl Rose to play Gandhi. And though Cortes defeats the indigenous peoples of Mexico, the Aztec here seem to have played with all the Hawaii associations. From side to side, T-Rex (es) seems to be good, although every one of them is shot with a CGI. And it dies very easily; I think if T-Rex were almost in real life perhaps could be destroyed or at least injured by some rudimentary weapons, 16th century. But it takes something away from the film. There are also some pictures of T-rex-swallowing-human, which are surprising, but in this case I thought they did the same work. There is a lot of actions, and the entire angle of colonization has spread everywhere but does not manage the angle of the dinosaur, unlike the latest of SciFi Original movie of dinosaur "Warbirds." In general, it is common (but dignified with the film SciFi Original standards) which has a minimum of 4.
