The famous actress who is still the player (Morgan Freeman) has not given birth for four years. When he is invited to participate in a new project, he asks the cousin's director of the director to take him to a poor Latin neighborhood in Carlson to find a supermarket manager. He sees a modern cashier of Casher Scarlet (Paz Vega) and is attracted to his ability. His driver never returns to him and Scarlet gives a trip to the actress. But first she has a job interview for the role of the secretary in the construction company and the actor helps her be prepared; then they spend the day together with a good time. <br /> <br /> I am a big fan of Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega. However, unnecessary items "10 or Low" are quite disappointing. This low-budget movie does not seem to have a story, and it is supported by the chemistry and bias of Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega and in fact nothing is happening for 82. minutes The clear conclusion is just ridiculous, and Morgan Freeman's attitude to return to his spoon of money on earth and tell a simple worker that they will never see. Was he afraid of having a relationship of love with him and destroying his perfect world with his family? Or was it a clash of classes, and knows that his neighbor's concept is not enough for a simple employee from lower classes? My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Um Astro em Minha Vida" ("Star in My Life")
