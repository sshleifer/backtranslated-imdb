"False" tells about a thing between a 18-year-old female student and a 38-year-old woman with a use of protests about half of the screens when having sex with hopping and half other way of ignorance storyline which seems a bit more excuse for sexual events. For the low value of production including clear hygienic organs and sexually phony sex in a story which is a bad mix of comedy and drama, "Lie" becomes quick to have advertising. For about 2 hours run, subtitles, and little substances, "False" is not just proposed. (C-)
