I was attracted to this film when I looked at the list, but after watching it I must admit that I felt desperate. The main problem of this movie is that artists cannot hold this film behind them. Why? Because of the bad script. Although Dillon, Lane and Jones are struggling to take this movie to another level, there is no writing of new stories and patterns are very common. So for Matt Dillon's fans this film appears, as well as Diane Lane is good. Tommy Lee Jones's story is always good but this is not a movie for it; far below its level. So, if you're faced with this great view but doesn't expect something big or wonderful. The only thing you will remember on this flick is Diane Lane; The rest is very forgetful.
