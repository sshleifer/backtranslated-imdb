And it falls fully into the "awesomely bad group" - ie students of the movie will be able to hire to get a kick. I was in a sci sci movie festival and all I remember is a wave after a wave of hysterical laughter as this movie was planned. Other parameters will best describe this film, and I felt very bad for a poor person from a production company who has turned out, clearly testing the responses of the audience. The finder was the sci scientist, and after the "big" movie of the anime, I think it was "blue sky", the audience was in a sombre state, and then this film was opened and within every seconds everyone in the room was around. on the islands. I will add to the worst part of the problem; Script: The funniest section, and the worst of this film, connects the road with a predictable and predictable road and frequent. Mabuzi, but usually loses. <br /> <br /> Animation: Poorly done, and put together, if you can put a little natural and dress gradually to the heroine (I know I can!), then look at the montage where he “trasforms” from the Swedish farmer girl in LADY DEATH !!! Characteristics: So one-dimensional its heap, there is a short backstory (with side-splitting lines of conversation) and dull light on the real push behind some of the main characters. So, in short, if you have a relocated audience with a few nearby drinks (try and be sure to 're-drink to relieve pain), then enter this film on the DVD and enter the "3000 show of science exhibition". There is no other pressure to watch this film except to laugh, and not to be a comedy. NOT SEE MOVIE HILI. It could be worse than watching a solo than "New World" by Colin Farrell if you can't be laughing with ignorance with a friend or two.
