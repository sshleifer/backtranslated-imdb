This is the last time I rent a video without entering the IMDB review. Limey is directed by Steven Soderbergh who also wrote the worst nightwatch with Ewan Macgregor and redirecting the trash as Out of Sight and talented Jennifer Lopez. Terence Stamp is a good actor and is a shy person involved in such a bad film. There is a lot of confusion that seems to be the last minute decision to create a lack of story, publishing and transparency. This film makes everything wrong. What were they thinking about?
