Surprised why the Muslims of the Pacific seem to feel a sense of sense of American American humor? regardless of their ethnic background? Well this film will not give any answers to this question that is often thought - but it will provide a better case study. <br /> <br /> From the beginning of this film makes like the "Old School" of Pacific Island New Zealanders, which immediately raises the question exactly what the action is. What? What does it mean to maintain the excitement of Pacific Island New Zealanders? or are they interested in using this potential market? The story is weak, humorless joke, and the end is expected. This film has not done anything for New Zealand movies, as it is only a romantic comedy of no romance.
