I had no previous knowledge of this film before it was purchased, but it seemed to be cool and I wanted to see the Viking movie of the moment for a little while now ... woe, this film was not what I searched for. I had a much better hope, but instead, it was given a Nordic opera opera which was very long in spite of its 84. minutes of the film is amazing: It is on Viking fighter who mocks her God Odin is so angry that he cursed the son of war, called Barek, death and rebirth as Berserker. This barek guy is forced to live in anger, insane, and violent life after life. The film has been efficiently performed, along with the best performing movies and good performers performances, but again, I found myself interrogated when this dribble will end. The film workers had the opportunity to do something rather than entertainment and a half but a ball. It would probably be improved by the inexpensive exploitation techniques such as free weaknesses and lots of votes ... I mean, we're talking about "Berserkers" here, aren't we? Vikings were supposed to be enough BAD, what to be raped with all the damage, so do not Berserkers think that worse? All in all, unless you are a fan of Youth and Non-Travel (etc ...) or, yourself, in fact, stupid Berserker who loves human suffering, I'd like to be exposed to this piece of cells.
