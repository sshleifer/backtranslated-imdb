I can't believe, IMDb actually has every show of television known to man! I haven't seen this show for more than 20 years. I just remember two events, and I remember those difficult. I remember that Tony may have never been in the beginning, because one of the events I remembered is that everyone tries to help Tony join, but he rejects them, but usually at the end of the show he will be a member of the House of Power, and everyone is happy. Another thing I remember is one where Lolo for some reason pretends to be dead, (full with funerals and rescuers). I don't remember why he plays dead, or how the show is approaching. That is one of these shows that I was convinced that I must have dreamed since no one has ever heard.
