Despite his values, almost 'no name' was blown by a clear budget I thought this film was the same; better than I expected. I was worried for the first time - the idea of ​​a computer virus that could infect people has seemed to be a very insignificant thing to me. But at the end, I thought the film had taken a good idea (even if some of the events were a little clichéd). I couldn't imagine, however, that Janine Turner is a bit of looking like Geena Davis. Maybe it's just her face or hair, hair and clothes she has in this film but it just emphasized only my thoughts at all. <br /> <br /> When not 'you must see' or a good film at any rate, 'bad error' is a flick of entertainment that will continue to look at the end.
