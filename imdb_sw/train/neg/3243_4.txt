For a long time, the most important needs for any next film walkers are that they must, from time to time, be able to pull one on us, with their unmarked symbols, fighters, groups and (indeed) each. But this film is not suitable for this. Each scandal may appear to come to the kilometers (especially biggen!) And not very interesting, wonderful or modern. Perhaps Mammet expected to compensate for this for good discussions and good psychological relationships. If so, he failed. The line is good, but it is provided in such an unusual, unusual way, which is thought to be some clues of cunning were made about all of us doing all the time ... but it was not. For psychological controversy, the main character has been beaten and makes the freudian compulsory for his father thinking he is a prostitute, but gets on it. I loved street photos though. It looked like the Edward Hopper color.
