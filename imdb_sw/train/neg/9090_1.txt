The propaganda film for the "cause" of Palestine. If you are expecting a non-discriminatory document on the wars of Israel and Palestine, you need to look elsewhere. If you are an anti-Semite (or just anti-Sionist â€” there is nothing wrong with defending the demolition of the country, right?) Or with support in supporting Palestinian goals (for example, massacre, destruction of Israel) , this is a document for you. It should do an entertaining evening at the college museum around the UK and the United States. However, anyone with knowledge and intelligence can be angry about a large number of lies presented in this video. I hope those who do not know the situation are not corrupted by this anti-Semitic.
