I just found this DVD home. We love the West, so my husband gave it. He began to apologize to me half way. Lips, clothing, accents - everything was finished. The area that bothered me was that the man did not hit the "collector" with his bow and arrow while taking the spirit of oil. His only forgiveness was "only 2 arrows left." We looked at it all, and, like someone else said ... so many bad things because one of the reasons for sucking. I mean, the fact that the boy happened to cut the bad stone from the collector in the same month and that day was found, what is the point of that? And why was there a tomb where everyone died on April 25 but the people whose souls were taken by the collector were still around? If you want a fun film after a few beers, this may be your film. However, if you want Western real, you will love this movie.
