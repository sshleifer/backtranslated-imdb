Marilyn Miller made only three films before his incomplete death - SALLY's amazing (1929), partner of HER MAJESTY LOVE (1931) and this SNGNY (1930). It is quite poor as talkie early and as a music attempt - although he has four numbers of dance, he just sings two songs (WHO and one person). Some of the symbols including the head tune head are beaten, even though we can hear the end on the back mark. Miller appears on the weight and amateurish here - there is no quality of the stars even. Even his play is cloutish. The film is very written, full of jokes and fun and stupid. If you are attracted to Miller as an executive, by all means, check out, but for general entertainment, go away.
