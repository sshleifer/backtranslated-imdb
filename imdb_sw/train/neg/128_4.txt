This film, once sensitive to its front politics and the free expression of free love and gender liberation, has been temporarily reduced to curiosity. It seems strange now that this very small film was banned and taken by the government in many countries. Given how Sweden's socialism finally reached, 'radicalism' of its politics, once controversial, it seems to be concerned and around four decades later. With its sexual events, at the same time the question of experimental sensitivity, looks good tame in the modern state. However, the documentation of the film and adjacent to its most controversial details and gravity remains largely as a preliminary reference to the 60 youth rebels. One part of the film that is still going on: its personal knowledge in honor of the 'fourth wall'. Each time, the film artists make a film. This satiric play still knocks.
