I have seen this film being completely deleted. Talent is available to the director - especially Stanley Tucci, Chris Walken, Hank Azaria and Alan Arkin (not even the four main headlines) - have been completely lost in a useless story, which cannot handle it once it was created by the characters, of stereo-typed characters. Julia Roberts is weak, Zeta-Jones is just angry (seemingly overturning her role due to high honesty, not moisture), Crystal plays only the old work of her, hyper, annoying alter-ego and Cusack spinning only through its parts, apparently exhausting the entire project. <br /> <br /> Why should it be 'romantic comedy', there is no absolute romance among the middle characters, forgot chemistry, and as for comedy- (possibly SPOILERS) well, just a moment of sharp humor came behind The role of Cusack in Grosse Pointe and its relationship with Alan Arkin - the author of the document can not win any of any nature. (Spoilers) Azaria was amusing as easily as a Mexican partner and Walken did a pleasant return as an example of a kind of arthouse-maverick-dogme director - but these parts were a very short time and instead (Spoilers) were treated to Billy Crystal at the same time. and her vegetables were beaten by dogs. Brilliant fresh. For a great fan of John Cusack's great work, not to mention the incredible break, I was completely reduced to a lot of good-looking film, and at the same time he doesn't want to explore or clarify any of them , instead of implementing old photographs of such kind and even descending into the deepest sense of the "boy-boy" sometimes. Very poor 4/10.
