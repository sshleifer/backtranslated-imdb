When the people in the Kino video gathered in their best collection of "Slapstick Encyclopedia", the selection of many silent voices, someone decided to remove the first barrier for ONE TOO MANY (1916), a shade that was open in Florida very little Oliver Hardy. Interestingly if you put it on all, this decision was unfortunate, for ONE MANU MANU is a very bad film which almost encourages the viewer from looking more. As any kind of common, this involves deception led by greed, fear when plans go awry, and problems are increasing because of ignorance, but unlike good, ONE TOO MANI is odd, unwanted, and sad. It is difficult to tell him at this time that the ambitious frustration is the result of lost or non-film images, but whatever the reason, for half the point even the wise observer does not know what the behavior of the behavior is happening, and ultimately the person does not care anymore . The only point here is to see "Babe" Hardy, 24, who seems to be more heavier than he could be ten years after collaborating with Stan Laurel, but who was full of youthful vigor. In the opening area, wake up and hangover, Babe makes the player player player walking on the bed. Believe me, that's interesting as this movie gets. If you read this before you see the first "Slapstick Encyclopedia" region of Kino I encourage them to move forward and jump into good things.
