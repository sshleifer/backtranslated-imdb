Zu Warriors definitely must have been animated series because if the movie is like watching the old anime on the acid.The movie just start out no and just people will fly around with the wings of iron and other stupid weapons until this princess sacrifice himself for his girlfriend on a cloud or something. Although this princess is a god or angel is more than me but soon enough this cool wind guy comes and kills him when a guy with wings wings fights battle some other mysterious God / Demon / Wizard something The plot line may not be or is too difficult to follow you need to be The ignorant mind to get this film. The recent family follows the death of the Chinese which is called this god to fight against evil, the princess to kill the evil man and soon we have Uwe Boll who has been badly beaten if the battlefield is full of horrible military art on the mountain or nothing. However, these pictures seem to be strange and colorful but I'm going to say it is a blurry and a journey of acids like (that's the word!) I looked at all that was called and had headlines and both were right and hard to understandâ€¦ who I give birth I didn't understand yet. he was looking at the 30th part of the 1980 1980s and he missed exactly how the story began or if I started reading the comic 5 series for number 4 because I didn't know how this started when it went or how it would have been lost when it was all over. this was one of the worst experiences of the film whenever it was like to look at the Inu-Yasha in the 134 drink section ... which is certainly you don't know what hell is going on. Don't lose your brain trying to think this out.
