I think this reason the movie did very well in the box office is actually Eddie Murphy. I think this was his first movie since "Beverly Hills Cop" when he was hot. Considering that one made over two hundred million and it was R and this was about 80 million and it was pg says not all popular. I've never been a big fan of Eddie Murphy, so it's probably another reason I didn't care too much. This has Eddie as a student of lost children. He should get a golden child or the world is in danger. The program is very serious, but as bad as it does not compare with special effects. I saw good things done in the 70's than other things that give this, Ray Harryhausen did a good thing. Still the main reason you see a movie like this is because of Eddie, unfortunately he is not very funny in this one quite and it seems just foolish to put him in "Raiders of Lot's Trip" type. I think they were hoping to fish out of the water effect, but to me it has not worked.
