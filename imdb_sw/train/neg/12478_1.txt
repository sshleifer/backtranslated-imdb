I had to give this film 1 because it is bad, but don't do it to think that I didn't enjoy watching, because I laughed and laughed, and even had a few questions. So half of the time I was laughing, half the time I was saying "what in hell continues?" or "why would anyone do this?" with this. I really enjoyed the worst results of the mist, the 80 nude style / war / talk / nude area, and the way that the fighting of the fighter hits the wind while riding their horses. And there are the effects of a wonderful example (these are not supposed to be real trees, do they?) And yet I don't know this person who gets into the cave, what is in hell? My friend told me about these movies and I thought I would give you an experiment, and I liked the film as people like Ed Wood movies, I am not really happy with a film that meant that I would look for it in my hilarious way. So don't let this stop you if you think this is a movie of action, it's, I just liked it for other reasons. It is worse than evil Evil, so it can make you think if you lose your life by watching it (which came into my mind a few times). I think the best thing for many people to have a few drinks, have some close friends, and laugh at this film. Maybe this is a little hard, but I don't think so, lease and you will see. Yo.
