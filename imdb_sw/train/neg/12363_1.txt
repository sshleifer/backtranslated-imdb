This is one of those movies that seem to be trying to ride a horse of military art. Kind as Billy Jack I think. However, when Billy Jack had a mark of martial arts known does not exist in this one unless you think some gentlemanly agree with roughhousing as well. We are told of a star who has been taught to learn Judo in the water. I was in the sea and when they were well organized in boxing, I don't remember any emphasis on Judo. As a result the opponent, James Macarthur, tells Judo when he apologizes for what he, the government wrestler champion was easy to fail. Lame.
