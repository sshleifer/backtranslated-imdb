This is not a good movie. It also preaches in part and the story line was small. 3D was the same, but not very good. I almost slept in this movie. The story is about 3 small rivers that need to be adventure and follow it on. The characters are not there, I don't care about these characters and feel that there was nothing to keep the adult. This pixar is not. <br /> <br /> I'd like to see more 3D effects. I also wanted to see more fibers than a mother saying "Lord of the flies".
