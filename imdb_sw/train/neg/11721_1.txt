This film was awesome. The script is a complete non-fiction but written in the real world, the effects of editing and lights are worse than the first projects in the school of film. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this film to anyone who: A) knows any information about the world of police operation or access. B) knows any details about making a film or appreciation. <br /> <br /> I recommend this film on an average or less average of mind, I think it would be fun if I was dumber. If you have to look at this film with a full mind, I recommend very kind of destruction <br /> <br /> It is a total waste of a small value of production that has.
