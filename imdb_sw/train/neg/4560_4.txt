Men In Black 2 was a real desire to me. When the actors did a very good job, especially Smith, there's just not a cure for the poor script once in production. The movie was a "kind" of feeling, playing the events of the first film. The story was, by word ... bad, for the better. It was not thought well, and it seemed to be very happy and not always available. <br /> <br /> In the first flick, the MIB Corporation had a kind of "elite" power to feel. You had a few of the special agents, and you had a "pride" kind of feel. On the other hand, MIB Agency has JROTC Summer Camp vibe. <br /> <br /> The movie wasn't awesome or nothing. It didn't have "cool" (for missing the best words) the first movie. Most of the old humor was restored from first to second, and it did not add any reality to the MIB of the Universe. The full comparison will be the first part of the first 3 films. Was it honorable? Yes. What? Should it take the title? Not true.
