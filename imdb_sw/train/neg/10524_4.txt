I intend to see this film in the theater. It was actually sold out. In fact I went to see Solaris instead, which was actually the worst movies released in 2002. Victor Rosa (John Leguizamo), a tough, street street 'specialist', emerges when he sees a child being shot, so he decides to go clean. invest all his money with Jack (Peter Sarsgaard). Things seem to be very good until Jack jumps the city with his lover Trish (Denise Richards). This happened at the end of the movie, so if they did not reveal this in the preview, it might be interesting. But they did, that's not so. In fact, there is no one interesting thing about this movie; everything is given out in the preview. If you have seen one preview, you have seen the whole movie, so you can just want to think too hard to fill the gaps. Go to the site, download the preview, set $ 3.99. There is no surprise or loss on the entire film, except how awesome sounds. I hope that anyone involved and writing the sound of the voice was dismissed. Twice. In addition, what kind of music would you be like the special songs allowed to be released were Ricky Martin and Gloria Estefan the older, and (I could lose the long-term fancy fabric and concepts if considering the mind like this) they both had a small talent and music capability . <br /> <br /> Acting is the best poor, the script is the best crime against humanity, and Denise Richards is the best 67% styrofoam and 33% ziploc bag. You know things are bad when John Leguizamo (was in Pest!) Upstages some of the cast and his ability to act.
