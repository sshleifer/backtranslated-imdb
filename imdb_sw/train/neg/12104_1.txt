Bill Maher's minister is not attacking organized religion. It is a Christian attack and Islam. In addition to ignoring the group of Rabbi making machine-driven machines to go around the rules of the Sabbath, he does not know the Jewish attack and seems to be angry when the Teacher actually causes the existence of the State of Israel. If Bill Maher followed his ideas for his logical conclusion, he could realize that the creation of Israel in the Palestinian territories is based on what is called the 'sacred books' of the organized religion. This is evidence of its complete and sufficient lack of focus on the creation of this film. I find it very difficult to believe that a person does not believe in God or even all intelligent people. Anyone can go to a religious person and laugh at them and call them ignorant for their beliefs but what should you give them to return? There is no place where he tells them why he thinks they are stupid. What makes him “wise” inside the room? In this way it shows how he is not true and in the process is about to look like such a stupid person. If you want to look at a good film / document about the real evil of religion and how religion can be harmful to human civilization, see Richard Dawkins' The Root of All Evil? '. It is a preliminary diagnostic document, explaining what to expect and how. Bill Maher's expert is not funny, does not provide interesting questions and does not give any insight on the issue. It seems that rantings and ravings of an old man was broken by his Catholic birth. I almost feel sympathy.
