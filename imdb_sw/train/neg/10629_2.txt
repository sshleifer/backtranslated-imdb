The only reason I didn't have this mark is that Sibrel shows that he has a reputation in the technical aspects of making a film. It is an improper film technology. It has been said, this is a false-based film that is totally unacceptable. Most of the documentation is used to use propaganda techniques to move the plan of space, rather than actually real. With "undefined proof" of Sibrel that the transfer of land was easily struck if you know anything about orbital plants. I do not recommend this photo, but if you do, look at the google video for free. Do not let Bart Sibrel get benefits from your curiosity.
