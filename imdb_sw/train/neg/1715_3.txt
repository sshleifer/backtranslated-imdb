Although it has very little information, it is not really true. They took great freedom in rearrangeing events, without having people, and using the sets that did not match the reality of their lives in 30 years. There was more than just Bonnie, Clyde, and W.D. in the group at different times, and those people had a lot to do with the truth if those included. Buck and Blanche went to persuade Clyde to go straight ahead more than one letter, and in fact he had returned again to crime. Some of the events displayed during the day occurred at night. Bonnie's wound was very severe and was not quite well. It was so bad that they had to carry around with a man until he was healed, and yet it stood still and went so hard. Clyde also walked with the dock because when he was in prison he shot a big finger. I know, I choose, and it's a TV movie, but even without these true errors in this "TRUE" story, the film goes very quickly from the event to the event and comes more like different models of their lives, rather than the story of their life. merge compatible. I'd like to recommend reading a book or seeing a document if you want to get closer to the truth.
