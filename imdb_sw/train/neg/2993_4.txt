I thought that the Body Body Eaters 2 was quite good filming When the terrorist body, infected and stolen chemicals, available to the US army, the corpses then burned, casting the virus into the sky on a small island. Recently the infected locals turn hungry hungry zombies, and a group of soldiers during departure should be included with a group of tourists and their own board at the abandoned hotel if they are trying to fight a powerful life. I did not find this film to be as good as the original film, Zombie Flesh Eaters. But it was still a horrible film with a positive and positive action. I didn't think it was one of the best in the series. 4/10
