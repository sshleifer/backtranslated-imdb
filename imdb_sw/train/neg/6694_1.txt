I really had the hope of this film since I saw Kari in a few other things and I think she has some talent. Alas, this dud is a case study in what you do not do in the screenplay. Absolutely not defined without striking enough, and no plot. What is the road / friend / comedy / thriller / romance / drama? Film artists have no clue, nor we.
