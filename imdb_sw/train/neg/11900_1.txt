It's very strange. However, other movies about America and someone who has visited here maybe ten times a day, a piece piece, and he believes to be a "expert" in the country. Sheesh. I should take a trip to Germany for a week and then come back and make a film about Germany as "Nazi countries" or some of it. Wim IL, you should participate with Lars von Trier and make an ULTIMATE film about Americans. Of course we all know it takes self-left "we are the world" Europe to make a "real" movie about America. On the continent which has not started one but World War II, Europe has a lot of views on the "foreign policy" of America. <br /> <br /> P.S. Don't worry, Wim IL boy, there are many Americans of UC-Berkeley who just love your movie. Of course, these are the same people who think George W. Bush is worse than Hitler, and that the painting of the pot of soup is "very wise" !!
