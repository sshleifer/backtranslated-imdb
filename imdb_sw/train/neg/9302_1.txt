This movie is just awesome. It is boring, it is the lowest, the participants are just the worst actors who I have ever seen and the situation is so bad that it's hilarious. The main “actor” should be a hot person who gets all the girls, but it's bad, thick on and looks like he's the beginning of the 90s. away for the end of the week to get together among friends, but no one is friends! Couples have never seen a "big" guy over 5 years and even back they were not true friends. The "date" of the protagonist knows only from work and than there is a girl taking it on the bar. Now tell me that you would lose your job using the weekend on your cabin and people who don't have your real friends. Because that's what he does at the beginning of the film! Don't lose one minute of your time on this lemon. I've made home movies worse than this! <br /> <br />
