Brokedown Palace is not a kind of movie I would like to see. I also did not like the movie when one of Aussie's drug users in Thailand and accused Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale of drug fraud. I can't go to that country regardless of what you see this film. In fact this film is sinking. I would like to visit Germany to meet beautiful women. Germany is the country I endure. I would also like to join the United States instead. After seeing some movies in the theater including false fraud charges, I left the theater and made my money because I can't bear this film. If you are going to Thailand to meet someone there who can be a drug addict, forget this!
