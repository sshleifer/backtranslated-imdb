This movie was going. The title is perhaps the greatest idea I heard. I thought it was an independent film on the outbreak of a zombie and their efforts to take the United States and a group of survivors alone, band together, and plan a plan to take zombies. WOMAN! It is up to the psychological soldiers and the weaknesses of her killings the woman gets what comes when the women's packet of zombie comes from their graves to get the wrong retaliation. As you can see nothing on the nation or the respective wards. Where to begin this severity of the film is caused by our nation. First, the women of zombie seem like the mysterious models of Victoria and the black eyeliner and the face of the color. What are the zombies, but they do not mind, who can be trusted, who can kill machines that eat as a result of their basic needs? These zombie women walk like street models and runway models, talking like children on a poor film film and don't work like real zombies. Surely eating and killing is there, but where is the lack of intelligence and horrible impairment? Although it is a very interesting concept and maybe a great satire on a kind of zombie, it enjoys that kind and asks the question, "why not the zombies be good to kill the machine?" I would like to say that this film would be considered to be a bad indie movie produced and made with garage junkies. I can't recommend this movie to anyone who loves the music of a very zombie, is insulting and like scary ?? even.
