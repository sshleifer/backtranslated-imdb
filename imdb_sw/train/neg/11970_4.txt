... for Lt who chose this. First, the film was not terrible, it was just Hollywood. Worse more I-need-this-happen-or-us-no-movie situation: if Willis' goal is to save the doctor, but he was interested that his "people" do out of the missionary, he would have put him in this first chopper and to migrate to the refugees without him. He could not affect his fund for refugees. That's not working. But, as I said, this is Hollywood, we have to have a game. That is why we do movies, because the truth is not too hard. However, I thought that Willis and a good doctor had a strong chemistry. That said, there are also other things that have war in the film. It is not waste of time, "The Tears of the Sun" is the value of the DVD rental fee. Look at the rainy day and you deserve it.
