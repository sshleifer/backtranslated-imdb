This lesson is compulsory: a group of people like to play one more gaming game by creating a modern false world that fights militants, kings, chiefs and castles. Wargaming is a fascinating phenomenon arising from our collective need to "avoid" due to reality and sometimes the weakness of our existence - something that almost everyone can involve. The characters are a mixture of Lord of Rings and Star Trek attractions. That's enough to find many people looking. However, very quickly the film turns into a view of wargaming views and the closure of the nose to the audience who "do not get". The authors of the film seem to take the lesson of wargaming, and this one, waaaaay with much weight than once to recognize the humor and fun in making a film about adults hitting a race in the medieval gear and hitting each other with a foam sword. It is very difficult for anyone who does not sit on his computer for 7-10 hours a day to play games or run a recent destructive star to understand what characters are talking about and why we should even care. However, filmmakers themselves seem to not take care to focus only on the subject of the game itself rather than to build a strong story with a clear story that anyone can understand. Additionally, the characters themselves are not forcing you and you are fast-tracked by them: big no-no when you try to keep people's attention for 90 minutes.
