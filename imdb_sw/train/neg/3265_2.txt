I have no idea that the director of viewers George Schlatter expects to sell comedy-of-ills. With Redd Foxx in the central role and adequate pimpy clothing and polyester to consolidate all the 1970s, "Norman" plays as a picture of reflection as well as any number of silly sitcom events involving comic misunderstandings, not to mention a call. Waylon Flowers! According to Sam Bobrick and Ron Clark, this story of a divorced couple (Foxx and Pearl Bailey) learned in a difficult way that their child is a gay gay - and living with mincing, playing white white - has enough blind jokes for any embarrassing part of the "Third Party". Bailey keeps his glory, and the frustration of Foxx is good for a couple of years, but some of the artists are embarrassed. * from ****
