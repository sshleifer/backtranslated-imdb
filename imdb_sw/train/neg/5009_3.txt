This was the worst movie I saw. The plan was not full and acting was bad. I am a great fan of Amber Benson, I think she is a wonderful actress, I can't imagine why she decided to make this film. His character, Piper, is drunk almost the entire film, except the opening area. On the joint side, there were several points in the film where acting was very bad, I really laughed loudly. But despite that, I will not recommend this film to anyone. It's only 80 minutes long, but that's 80 minutes of your life that you will be completely destroyed.
