If this depends on the true relationship, as required, between Mrs. Curtin and Mr. Levinson, I am glad I don't know them personally. This is very slow, and all the characters take a completely stupid medicine in the movie while the theme song gets play. Stupid incidents and stupid people do not do with comedy.
