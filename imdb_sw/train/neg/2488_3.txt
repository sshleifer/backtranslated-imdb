What an incredible mess of the movie. Something about a fighter who takes a shot from him after being shot and put them in a glass bottle in his bathroom (and from the size of the jar he was shot fifty times at the moment) with a top secret tank stored by five or six potential soldiers who for some reason run Mexico. If they were sent out deliberately or simply lost in fact they have never been made clear. And you will never hear another feature of the word "horn" or either. Gary Busey tries to play Mel Gibson from "Lethal Weapons" and while Busey is an actor who can serve the screenplay that prevents the entire movie freely. William Smith turns again as a Russian soldier, the same character he played in "Dawn Red" a few years ago. After playing heaviest bicycles for many of the 70 years it was nice to see him expand its level of playing heavily communist. Unfortunately, he will probably be remembered every time as a boy Clint Eastwood bound "Every Way You Can."
