Salvage is the worst called the horror film I ever saw. There is nothing serious about it. It should not be in the very best kind. First of all I don't see how many people can think of this piece of this beautiful movie. If I wrote something like an exciting and proud thing like this I would laugh and also be ashamed to share it with others. Second: acting is awesome and the leading actor is very serious. Third: the story takes, used before, and excuses that its cheap movie is not excuse. Read briefly on the back of the case, reveals the whole story. I am not happy that you watch this film unless you have 80 minutes to lose on something that will leave you grateful that you watched it. I feel very bad for those crooks and the evil of their name. All say Anthony Perkins !!!!!!!!!
