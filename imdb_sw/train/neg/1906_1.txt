They played this on the 4th marathon of the Twilight Zone and this is, hands down, the Twilight worst part that I've ever seen. It can't totally sync with the series of series in its voice. Although the Twilight area is a fairly ineffective event and many events end up being predictable, this was not quite real. Compare this with the events of the story as "Stop at Willoughby" or "Midnight Sun", and you realize no comparison. Buster Keaton did what he could with very bad material, and in fact it is amazing to me that a member of his historic pride team will stand up to this level. Although he seemed to be struggling, he needs to have money ... no other details.
