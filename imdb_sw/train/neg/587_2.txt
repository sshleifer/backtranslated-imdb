This film identifies itself from the "extraordinary body of the human body" boldly, if it is strange, deciding offensive to the viewer. In one area, the camera closes in the big 50 feet as the boy pushes the pus and its water out. On the other hand, the camera is completed by half of the rain and the acid stomach as part of the pasta salad from the spoon and into the goo. In the final tour of the power, the camera takes the viewer on a hard journey through the forest ... young teen's hair. Unfortunately, I haven't done anything about it. Look at this film if necessary, but: make your breast bag, and do not have a pasta salad before.
