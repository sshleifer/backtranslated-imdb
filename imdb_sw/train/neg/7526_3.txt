This is a high grade cheese b of kung fu gun. Bruce "wannabe" Lee plays with Bruce Li ... I think. Of course, let us show the quickest parts of Bruce and let the eyes of his eyes and leave the right angle at some point during the winter, it's kind of looks like Bruce. You will be surprised how the published film is not very good, but some deleted screens from the dragon are thrown into the mix. According to the film, Bruce Lee was killed by dart hanging helicopter. Of course, they think this may accuse Bruce Li for trying to be Bruce although his behavior is supposed to be a Bruce brother (who for some reason still reflects the sign of Bruce and style fight - very POORLY). See Bruce going straight to the fearful lion. The Department of props stands with Kay-Bee, you see. Bruce also gets anything wrong and beating a person with a severe disability. To reach the end, the director decided "let us throw a flashback" to the scene just shown 3 minutes ago !! They should think that only one-celled organism with a deficiency disorder can fully understand this film. <br /> <br />
