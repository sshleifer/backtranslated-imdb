I am a Shakespeare fan, and I can understand what Ken Branagh has done to bring Shakespeare to a new generation of audience. However, this film is not appropriate to present the general purpose of playing and surveillance of stupid music. Add it to Alicia Silverstone's restriction on discussion (recall to Keanu Reeves in Much Ado About No) and other lucrative roles, all matched with good watchfulness.
