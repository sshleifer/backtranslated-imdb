My mother worked with Dennis L. Raider for eleven years, without mentioning to share the office with him. When he was announced that he was BTK, he was shocked. The whole day was just his story about how he never would see him as Wichita Killer. I have heard again tell them many times. I asked him about many things, and I went to all the interviews he was asked to go. I have read the whole book written about Raider, Wichita is my city and I was surprised that such a thing would happen in Kansas. There was another BTK movie on TV not too long, and I thought this would be better to show the Dennis massacre, maybe even having a mental touch with his mind. <br /> <br /> I'll have a lot of transparency and error in this film. This depends on my mother's picture, all my lessons on it, and video clips I have seen speaking. <br /> First, the camera alarms were bad. It seemed like a shot of a home video camera. Acting was bad and I couldn't even carry a watch. <br /> <br /> Dennis Raider never had long hair. Dennis Raider was "very young man" and was "following a book of administration" of a kind of guy. He was not as good as the movie saw him, he had respect and sudden, business like. Same goes to his murder, as we all know. If you have witnessed his confession, you can already guess. <br /> <br /> And with quarrels and the house of slaughter? No. I have never read or Dennis Raider has acknowledged the problem with the cruelty of animals or people going to bugs. In fact, they made cats and dogs for hitting. However by way out all the movie was keeping the animals in his victim's face and acting as he worried about their well-being. Dennis Raider never killed people that he knew, admitted this, but in the film in his first murder he tells the woman he knows too. I don't even need to go to this film, and I already missed it. This is not what you want to check if you are interested in actual BTK events. This is not a wish to check if you want a good movie of fear. If you want to shoot half of the porno with certain slaughter scenes with the side, then this is your kind of movie.
