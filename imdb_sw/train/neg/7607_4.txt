- When the local sheriff is killed, his wife takes up to the border and has decided to clean up the city. Not everyone in the city, however, enjoys what he is doing. When the sheriff ordered the city clock, the owner of the local saloon (also the woman) employs the killer to keep the sheriff. No way the owner of the saloon can know that the sheriff and the killer will fall in love. Gunslinger is a typical example of what happens when you have an interesting idea and mixing with poor performance. There is a good movie here somewhere trying to leave. With more hands-on abilities or with a large budget, Gunslinger could be looking for entertainment for women's role in Old West. As is the case, Gunslinger is a bad mess of the movie. There are many things wrong with the movie: used to be used without the ability to act, talk and casual dialogue, and set that set as a set. But the greatest offender is editing. I wondered how often the event will begin with the actors (and horses for it) indeed waiting for the right Corman "Action". The best is the area of ​​two horse riders standing beside the building. Suddenly, they leave and come running around the corner if they had been driving hard for several miles. Or, make an example of people who can be seen to transport in the city. We see someone coming into the building and second after coming out of town to lift his horse. It's not like Corman didn't have a few actors to work with. While none of the big stars, Beverly Garland, John Ireland, and Allison Hayes were all able to turn into good performance. But, in Gunslinger, they are not given much to work with. <br /> <br /> - Now I have seen MST3K and non-MST3K versions of the movie. I would like to strongly recommend the way to MST3K.
