As long as you can suffer! If you would like to watch people rise, rise, dressed, shave, prepare dinner, watch, having sex in the dark, then go back to sleep to sleep ... if you like to flat, small rooms and kitchens, long silence minutes. .. if you would like to get bored for two hours, you feel the excitement of "real art", then you will love it. But if you don't, just try to see a good movie, there are thousands. "If you are here", but we want to stay? This German movie received the award for the Torino gay film: Italian journalists do not understand why the jury took a very bad decision, as the festival presented a lot of talented movies. Maybe be good with Germany, if they don't often get a prize? Well, "The Life of Others" did ... but this is better but not gay. So it's a question of fashion. The Germans are "in" again? What does it matter? Or maybe it's just a view of other actors?
