When I called Robotboy first, I saw it clean and interesting, but I saw, for each part of this show trying to teach you how to self-reliance, what's good / bad. The sessions were predictable. And the main characters are not interesting. Again we see a smart boy, beaten by his big brother, parents who do not understand their child, and his friends: a girl and a fat boy. This show also makes no sense. A modern modern robot works on two AA batteries, and can use many weapons. But the biggest problem is the difference between improved and more powerful modes. We see two different robots, and decreases the main idea of ​​the show: "Robot must learn how to independently in human society"
