As I watched this film I was thinking, Well it would be good at any time ... I was wrong. The best part of this film was time passed. The whole substance is 92 minutes. All the crime apart the most beautiful part is when Wendigo finally showed which was the end and you could not even see him good. And the end of the tail was dumb type too. There were many places in the film where you thought something else would happen but it had fallen. The worst part was the discussion of Wendigo then there was Wendigo. For the worst creature, it certainly cannot tell it to this movie.
