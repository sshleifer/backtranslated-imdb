A secret secret secret spy for conspiracy to predict World War II. The secret is like Jane Graystone (Nancy Coleman) or an amnesia. Good work has been done by Raymond Massey as Dr Ingersoll, a good doctor turned out bad. He is the head of the spy ring trying to get information from Jane amnesiac, information caused by related activities. Will he say? What? Can he remember? Moroni Olson (as Mr. Goodwin) persuades as Massey's assistant. John Garfield's role (like Dr. Lewis) is not a disaster. He seems to be so bad that cast should be placed as one of the worst history of the film. It is unfortunate that a very talented actor has been put into the role that is not worth his talent. The movie has a look at one look, despite being half of the spy and semi-gangster film, and despite being strangled. It is easy to forget this, amnesia is not necessary.
