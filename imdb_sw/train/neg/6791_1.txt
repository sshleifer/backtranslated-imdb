This is a film about animal cruelty. Under the marathon race, we see the exhibition of animal abuse, including horse racing. The boy who did so has his spiritual conscience cleansed by fire from the funeral / burning of the horse, which in fact continues to die, after being tortured to death. This is one of the worst movies, which I have been angry with. As Gene Hackman and James Coburn close to the finish line on their DYING animals, we should love their spirit to finish the race. I would like to put producers and director in the marathon race; I will decide when they are finished, maybe 20 minutes after stopping breathing.
