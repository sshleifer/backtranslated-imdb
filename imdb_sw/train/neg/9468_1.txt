The only thing about this unwanted dreck is that I didn't have to pay. I saw it for free at the university. And if a college student cannot find humor in something that was free, there will be no hope. The stale jokes and poor mosques cannot be closed with a beautiful, stunning structure. to the Volkswagon Mende market. I don't know what Michaels Myers was doing in this film, but I've never seen anything worse. This is not just another attempt to strengthen the initial success of Grinch (which has its opponents, but I really enjoyed it). It is difficult not to sit for this failure and ask yourself the best projects adopted on funding. <br /> <br /> Want to change Seuss funny? Go with Grinch.
