I am a great fan of fear / splatter, I will not enjoy the awesome films that people think they are stupid. I also like a year. More forgiveness for as long as it has a point. After reading other people's reviews on the site I was sure that this film will be a little gem. But much of my despair was one of the most unimportant films I have ever seen. The role was bad, the conversation was stupid, the plot was meaningless, special effects had no meaning and editing might have been done by someone who died for the last 2 years. Usually I see that all these features makes a great movie of b horror. But not in this case. > EUR ili Unless you enjoy a really worthless (for example, "violent sh * t" videos) they avoid at any cost!
