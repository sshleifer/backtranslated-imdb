**** Do not read these reviews if you want an amazing conclusion of the "Monster of the Crater Lake" to be a total surprise **** <br /> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br / > <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> Pumbaosaur's soil rises from the depths of the Lake Crater to destroy the local record group, without mentioning your fast button. To do "Monster of the Crater Lake" amateurish is overstate obvious. If you are not a fan of the lowest car car models, you may not have looked at this first place. <br /> <br /> The problem with the movie is that when there is no point of monster going on, it really takes and goes anywhere. The script is Ed Wood-ish very, since it has emerged in a manner that puts the order of the main step. There is no great thing for "Island of Crater Lake". It defines its dinosaur by declining the meteor in the Crater Island, 'passing' the water to the point where it incorporates the dinosaur egg which appears to continue to rest under the lake to millenia. Even if we could agree that the egg would have been sleeping there for a long time and remained unclothed and appropriate, would it “pass” the water at high temperatures causing many lake migrations? Other than the fist of the finger on one or two screens, we don't see the evidence of water being hot, except a few lines in the script. <br /> <br /> Script is installed automatically instead of a few series, and it will do anything to get the characters around the lake so they can be dangerous to the dino. Couples are experiencing a problem with an experienced car and when their cars are used, they decide to hire a boat and go out on Lake Lake. Hmmmm ... do you think these visitors in the story can be there so they can run on our hereditary heritage? In the most mysterious sequence, a drunker takes a liquor store and decides to kill a cashier and position instead of paying four dollars for a bottle of oil. The car chases, and does not want to know ... they are completed by the lake. Snack during Cratey! Well, it's not hard to think, and you're very ahead of the script that you are angry when it takes ten minutes for these events to be opened. <br /> <br /> The lack of all is love, and I want to love "Monster Crater Lake". I just can't do that. It is not enough here to continue, and this is more than a film to keep during the party, because you can talk about it and regardless. The film has a small list of things going to them, most importantly being a dinosaur itself, which appears in three types: the puppet of the shadow, the head of the image which is made of wood through the water. , and the full importation of the soil that has been very good. There is also a pair of beautiful lids in it, and carries many of deliberate humor in the movie. The end of the end leaves us to mourn the death of all monster and one of our loved ones, so everything good about this film has died to its end. Why was I so affected by this conclusion? Was a sad song played on closed loans? Or was I just crying for a moment when I refused to watch a movie like this?
