well, the writing was unhappy, leadership was sloppier, and editing made it worse (at least I hope it is editing). Acting was not bad, but not good. pretty much no characters were delightful. at least 45 minutes of the movie lost time and at another time or so it was not used anywhere near its potential. It was a great idea, but yet another loss of good idea continues. it could have ended three different places but it just went on to a predictable hollywood. and what could not be predicted was so bad that it didn't care. The end was not worth looking at all. Sandra cow was out of her element and should stay away from these types of movies. The movie seemed to run too. The movie just didn't value to see, and I had to pay for it so I would very much. Maybe I had been more disappointed because I expected a very good movie and I've got bad. The movie on all was not so bad, but I would not accept it. I gave 2 out of 10 b / c I liked the idea very much and I did it as a single character (I just believe, super smart one). and also had very cheap ways to cover the holes of the plot. it was like trying to cover the volcano with taxi cheaper masking, it was not good. however, if you see it, try a $ 1.50 video show or video, unless you like the many movies you see, then I think you'll love this.
