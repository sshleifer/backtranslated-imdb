I don't know what about the acting style of Donald Sutherland, or the sound style, but always seems to be working behind the great wad of Kleenex soggy. He just ... I don't know, HERE? What? On meds? Weird. It said, I saw again the flick for the first time since its initial release, and in fact, I don't remember to hold anything like that. The worst, too, because nothing is closed. What about the deceased husband? The child who was angry (and was a child called?)? Yard of Scotland and military supporters? I would like something to lock things and give some of their closure to everything, not just a great panoramic pull-away. And what woman is sleeping with someone she knows is killing her husband? Even if he was trying to overcome the suspicion of injection to protect his child, he could have a headache constantly. The last meeting makes me feel very comfortable and worried ...
