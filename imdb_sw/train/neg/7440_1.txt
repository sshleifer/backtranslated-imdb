I will go to the record as a second person who, after years of using IMD to watch movies, has been encouraged by Nacho's film, is left to create an account and publish comments. This was the hands down the worst movie that I have ever seen in all my life. The plan was about to disappear, and no "pieces of the puzzle" were added in any way. Acting was laughable and text was embarrassing. How this film is supported and it was more than me. The only grace to save that I could find was false and repeat use of the word Anastasia Hille. (with good sound design) If I had the option to see this film again or have wild guns I would be on a difficult decision. I am disappointed that I can't give 0 stars.
