Even the first 10 minutes of this film were bad. It is hard to believe that anyone except John Cusack would put money into this. For the string of anti-military / anti-war movies have already been destroyed on the box office, it is almost impossible that the label of any kind would like itself to be associated with this script. At first, it may have been seen as a certain type of political stimulus of Grosse Point Blank and Akroyd and Cusack (s) again. But for just 90 seconds on the film, it becomes clear that this is an attempt to ridicule in DR STRANGELOVE. I liked many Cusacks movies that I thought I would like to see this DVD. I tell you that I don't know if Cusack is exactly right for me even to look at another thing looking at him again unless someone else can approve it. Cusack seems to have been devastated by his hatred for George Bush and the Iraq war which he already committed suicide. Tom Cruise has never been around to be off this. Not near.
