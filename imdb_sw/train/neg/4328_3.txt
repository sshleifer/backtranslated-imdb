Anything with "National Lampoon" in the head will surely die the death of London, England, Paris, France, Rome, Italy, and anywhere in Germany. It can be an American but unknown European for many viewers. "The European Lampoon Holiday" is not possible to fix the situation. The awesome Griswalds are just - awesome. Of course Mr Chevy Chase thinks he is funny, after all Miss B.di Angelo laughs a lot in his joke, but he's getting paid for it and didn't have a tok out £ 2.50 for a privilege. The section set in the UK is normal. Former old television traders, Muslims Idle, Smith, Coltrane, Miss M. Lippman come out of the same old anti-inflammatory clichés, Chase disappears in the hot zone .... yawn, yawn, yawn. Ham Palace, Big Ben ...... I feel disappointed that we never see bobbies on two-by-two bicycles ......... rosie red cheeks on a little chil - sister, I need to go? English is buffoons, vicious French - they said Yank-rivals. German dignitaries have boasted, (not to mention war, Clark), and Italian lecherous down-pinchers.Have I forgotten anything? Any possible situation of "comic" is done to death, Mr Chase gurns very, Miss di Angelo sweet dimples, children are shy embarrassing. The fact that this franchise ran as long as he made should bring comfort to those who provide that never lose money to underestimating the public taste.
