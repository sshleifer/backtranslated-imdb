Want to know the secret of making a smaller film on the work of the fitness center? Filter the film out with the most beautiful women in the most powerful work clothes and give them early and grind the floor as they are on the gentleman club. That is what made this film very interesting and so that a little gimmick has made me look up to the end of bitterness. This is the worst film I've ever seen, but every time I was ready to change the station, they could add another area to the girls who worked and I'd like to put it. As a slasher film, Killer Workout fails in every category I can think of. If you show to the beautiful girls working, it is a success. The best recommendations for avoiding, except half the film's ideas have a great review of T&A to show you.
