I bought this DVD for Â£ 1 and now I see what. Acting was very bad I had seen for a long time. Lighting and sound is the best shoddy. The program does not even know when it is wise (Mark: I do not advise to watch this movie at the wrong time.) This movie feels like you are looking at someone who doesn't have much. In fact it is a shame that a lot of money earned on this project has gone to that waste, I would like to see if any of those who were sent are still working, except eva longoria who is the only "star" of this film which was apparently inappropriate and bad stick. Sorry that no opposition seems to build but I will say one thing to James Cahill, don't try again. In the words of the boy "His very in the good department".
