The strong relationship between this film and the first Grease has been set up right at the beginning of the film when Didi Conn, one of the four members listed on their roles, communicates with Maxwell Caulfield youth who is a British exchange student. Although in the previous film Olivia Newton St. John's foreign speech narrative, the descriptions here in Caulfield are her cousin. What Conn still does at school, I think she just loves hanging around Rydell High though now she's a beautician. <br /> <br /> Caulfield is a smart child, so of course the hood of the move led by Adrian Zmed has identified him as a nerd. And that's bad when a friend of Zmed girl decides she likes Caulfield. But being just nerd not going to cut. <br /> <br /> That's when Caulfield decides to keep modern day act Zorro. He gets a junk bike and puts it together and engages himself. He gets himself a dress of a leather biker with a set of strokes to hide his face. If you find Michelle Pheiffer not on the card, Caulfield will not have any trouble making friends on any male leather bar as he is bound. Grease 2 introduced Michelle Pheiffer and Maxwell Caulfield and started all the effectiveness of all the work. If you have seen the first Grease film, the best film, than you really have an opinion on how this film will turn. <br /> <br /> In addition to Conn, Eve Arden, Sid Caesar, and Dody Goodman, all Faculty members from the original grease return to their roles. Music mark is not as far as natural pop-ups. Not that Grease 2 is bad, not just very good.
