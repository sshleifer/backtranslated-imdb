There are some very strong ideas in this violent film which, if it is clear, could lift it from Spaghetti-western destruction to something special. Unfortunately, HELL CALLED HELL is one of the most transformed movies! Exhibitions begin and end suddenly, characters leave for a long time, performances (and accents) of artists are the same variable, etc.. Robert Shaw is a Mexican ruler (!) Who, after taking part in wiping the village, sits on the priest (!) ... ten years later the village is run by "mayor" Telly Salavas. Stella Stevens comes looking for a man who killed her husband. Colonel Martin Landau comes looking for Shaw. They all say to each other LOT and all shoot LOT. Fernando Rey is in it too (as a blind person). Exhibitions were not bad, but they were not very effective. Savalas has a feeling sometimes like Landau (who is a real contribution here). Shaw and Rey prove that they can not bother themselves with Stevens watching a good foxy (if it is a little out of place between sweaty dirt).
