What can I say? I am a fan of 'high' and awesome films. Especially when it comes to a lot of humor and feeling, but I'm not a fan of Snake on the Bird. There are three skills you draw on this film: ?? Comedy of the situation; ?? Fear; and ?? The invention of hundreds of snakes to fly. First, this film has not been written as a fear of language-or-cheek or comedy, and there are only 1 or 2 points in a film where you will tell us. If you want to get a feel for the film, the trailer really represents the movie, the fear. Secondly, if you expect a full and frightening film, you can't despair. It has not stopped on other movies, but always keeps your attention. Third, Though the Birds' novel fails, but you will leave the movie to think "what was challenging about". <br /> <br /> I know this film has a high level, but it doesn't add. A) Most reviews that were written before the film were released and, B) The breach of user standards is slightly different than the average of 77% of the 10/10 movie, and only 7% of the people give 9/10 - Why a great so much?
