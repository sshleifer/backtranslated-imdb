This must be one of the worst films I saw of course. The only thing that is interesting in this film is the exhibition from many other directors and King himself. The film has a beautiful Cluster, but it falls off 15 minutes in the story. I did as Madchen Amick in this film and I think I might have a very good job in the film.
