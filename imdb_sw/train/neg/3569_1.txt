Wow! It is the only filthy film that can encourage "Exhibition". Where do I mean to start? Inappropriate theme song? Also Zadora non-words in movies? The fact that in addition to being placed in Los Angeles, "the bed of the cast" Every single person (and woman!) Locks them all to sleep and also Zadora, in any appropriate way? Or what about the fact that everyone in the movie can not fail because they are ignorant of intelligence (Also) or is clear enough of the female ball (everyone)? And since this flick is written by "journalists" (real), it shows a terrible lack of awareness of the film's decision-making industry (which Hell would like to kiss and kiss until the end of the world?) (without pretending) funny as hell though the "demolition zone" alone will be complicated, and after seeing the weather "I'm not the only one I had **** way to go" area "Awards" (all done at the normal level of work and underground we expect from those of the quality of the quality as well), I believe in fact that our loved one also used these words when he “won” the Golden Globe. make my day. <br /> <br /> However, if you're a fan of bad camp, tashy, do this another tacky movie attempt.
