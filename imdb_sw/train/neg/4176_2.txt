Maybe I missed a meeting when the "B-movie" was explained, but what I saw was ridiculous. You need a good synopsis of this movie? Take visitors, replace the space for the space, then remove everything that was good about it, and that's very good. 5 minutes on the film, "V-SAN squad" (that's the dumbest sign I have ever heard) explores the "foundation" that have been killed by vampires and then climbs (DOWN? What?) with an open current train for the past. When should this be done? 2210. Well ... (hold, I will return to that) <br /> <br /> Yes. characters. Wow, well there is a clue of the tribal dog of Asia, redneck the wannabe cowboy, captain weathered, goth vampire / Hot Topic part of time, and the second wussy second in command. They are all beaten by their lack of desire. It was about to get me to see Micheal Ironside in this flick. Don't get enough money to be the sound of Sam Fisher at the Splinter Cell? Soon the only thing about the battle of Vampire is about how it works. Look at this after the birth of the film, the only amusement I found was enough to put in time. Since when do you play PCI computers on the wall of the wall if the room is already on the starhip? Money needed to make this film would have been installed for better use.
