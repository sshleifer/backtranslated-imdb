This is a well-filled story about someone who is married to avoid the hangman, then puts on his "fun" grandmother. It can be sex with a racist at the same time. We do not know, for example, why a woman who won the honor of the Indian hero can not really fight against her husband of that time. Or why his team members are interested in getting a "real man" in bed when he seems to care only for good things. This was wise in fifty years of Hollywood. There is a stupid area where he hits a horse and can catch a whip - the second time - then he leaves his horse. Never think that the first time it might have lost the eye, which would make it difficult to catch the whip! Then, he can fight with Indian animal fighters where they use the first two parts of the ass. That's the second wind. Later, he speaks successfully with other Indians of the blood (if they all reject him now) is his "squaw". Never think that he has diplomatic skills and he has been talking to them for years. And the way he keeps refusing his attempts to deceive him only to make him want to stop him - yes, right. If women are only giving their way under the way. Finally, there are no guidelines that influence them in their roles. Madison is a jerk who gets undoubtedly without luck. Fleming climbs her hair and hits a lot, but she can't think of as a hot tomboy. The only reason you would have roots for it is because you want to see Madison tied to a running horse and a curse on the rock before the end of the film. The ways that Madison uses Fleming are predictable and has few restrictions that will convince you if you see women as anything but blow blows. Even if you see them as dolls, the general lack of doubt will grow. <br /> <br /> Total waste time. Even the prestigious kinda is not available. Give this a great miss.
