This type of film has become an old hat now, isn't it? Anything is a powerful nostalgia that turns over itself in some kind of a loop of views. It really looks like a good idea: cast together great, gags good, and another humanitarian game about what could / could be. Unfortunately, there is no major event that unites them all together, as it was in the "Big Chill", one of the seminal films producing a copycat film like this. You are about to see more than one or two people rather than having a short time for everyone. This explanation builds not only anger, it is harmful. Script below the average does not support.
