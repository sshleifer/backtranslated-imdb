The main feature of Superstar movies in its future stages is rotation, rock between one and next movie. Being a solid star of the south Indian cinema, the goals that he had received before Father was good. Since Nattukku Oru Nallavan (1991), the number of films he performed in Tamil as a bulk hero in 11 years was only 11 mainly for 1 year per year. All this was a great hit. He had a picture that many thought he could not easily overcome. But after Padayappa (1999), he entered into Hibernation mode. His fans all over the world, especially in South India, were ready to see any kind of film and their star works. Thus, the Tamil film industry decided to come with the Father. The filmmakers thought that fans would take whatever they show with Superstar in it. But this clearly did not work in this film. As always, the smell from the media and expectations from fans was a non-stop way. The image of Rajinikanth was completely destroyed. Fans went to nuts. The film collection did not meet the expected level. The reputation of most people decreased. The only positive aspect about this movie is the A.R.Rehman songs. Rehman is known to have created a good music for the worst movies like Tajmahal, Kadal Virus, Alli Arjuna, Paarthale Paravasam, Star, En Swasa Katre, Vandicholai Chinnarasu etc. Well, I don't think this film would support the league. > <br /> You feel so much depression is not because the movie was bad, it's because of the image of the star will drop. It took him five years to come back with two films Chandramukhi and Sivaji and give the fans what they really look at in the star film.
