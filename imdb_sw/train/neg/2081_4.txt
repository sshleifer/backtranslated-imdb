This film is often displayed on the cable soon, so .. <br /> <br /> There is no excuse for two attractive women to fight on Luke Wilson or vidan 'equal' in this movie. Female employees are very good, and that's the only reason to watch this film. I think it's 'funny' that Luke's friend even worse / dorkier / stupider is close, but well, that's what we got. It does not have any female orientation, EVER will talk to any of the men in this film for more than 5 minutes. @ @ $ #
