This should be one of the worst films I have ever seen. The DVD was released for free and the instructions I put on the internet for other connected DVD devices. Not surprisingly they were given, certainly no one can share with the money on this drivel. How other travelers can say they deserve to ask for faith, a person who includes five worst films has ever seen. <br /> How around the world a talented actor like Philip Seymour Hoffman can participate in this trash is amazing. Many delays the toilet and are badly treated. Anyone wishing to get angry should be avoided at all costs.
