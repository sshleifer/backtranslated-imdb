I began to watch this film and low expectations, as a matter of fact I just saw because it was a change of S.K. novel (novel I have never read) I / I enjoy my prospects because the movie wasn't something close, but it can keep you interested. What really draws this story down is the work done by the director and administrators. The movie is overlong, has no "good" shots and no scares, dialogs are dumb and special effects are crap. The only good things are that, as I said, puts you interested (I think the book should be good) without using a few of the triggers. <br /> <br /> My Vote 4/10.
