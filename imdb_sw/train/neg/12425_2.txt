I don't know what you are entering, but please worry. This movie was full of trash. <br /> <br /> Macaulay Culkin like Kevin McCallister was loved, nice, sweet, love, and very happy to see. He was guilty of it but at the same time, he was also strong. <br /> <br /> this new baby, Alex? Wonder if all hell! Just a sharp shock in trying to resemble Culkin's charm and grace, a sad disappointment for it. <br /> <br /> Careful, complete crap. Harry and Marv, were such entertainments on the screen team. They were older, they were delightful, and just made you want to root for more Culkin, which is what a good villain thinks to do. These Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern, PERFECT completely for these roles. On the other hand, in 3, we have four 4 hints with briter and again, try to expand on the charm of the charisma and duo of the first criminals. Not to say they were awesome, but they were not memorable or even really being entertaining. More on the true corny side. We've got real movies. Part 1 and 2, classic. Don't remember. It is perfect to look closer to Christmas and brings a good mood to Christmas and brings many emotions. It makes you love the story, and look at the characters. Just, memorable and almost become masterpieces. Part 3? Head of decoration. It says. <br /> <br /> All and all, I don't know why people like this. I think people don't know what a good movie again. His skeptic player and the most tricky traps and a new foolish fool who I think swindlers will be at least beat at home. <br /> <br /> Run, run away from this trash. And don't let even start with Part 4!
