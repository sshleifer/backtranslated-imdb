It is a pretext to get out of the house when the paint is blown - left the film after the return hour and watch the dry color. I never remember walking on the movie before, but I really tried to stay. Script was not on the cast and just continues "go and go" wrong - come! Uma Thurman do these things? Specific side effects of lame. These were former characters and actors doing something about 20-something that lives - just kind of sad and unpleasant feelings. This is the only basis for the first hour - it may get better. I had to go home and see if the painting blasted the dark shadow than when it continued.
