You already know how the pain of watching this film is. But I wonder why one of the worst movies should involve one of the most beautiful cars. Why cars should not only be victims of violations, but also real actors and artists in it. So how on earth Porsche, Lamborghini or anything that can enable these people to communicate with your cars and destroy the reputation that gives millions. It is painful for those who love cars. It is painful for those who love movies. <br /> <br /> I want my money back!
