It is amazing to me that anyone can comment that this film is not used. It is not just preaching for animation, but it has no courage, it moves, very quickly, and the pain of pain. Looking at it, one feels like a 8-year-old child being punished for writing "I can't be a fascist" on board a hundred times. Now I understand that it was done at WW2 length, and it was intended that the Hitler hero's punishment and the terrible suffering he brought , (which anyone could praise him wholeheartedly) and I am sure it has taken the situation of the day. But it has been presented in such a way, the above-apparent, of the sledgehammer, fails as easily as art works. The only beautiful present here comes from Paul Lukas, who brings loyalty and power to his role as a fighter anti-fascist warrior; and Lucile Watson as an evil woman who has had a slow diagnosis of how the world has become dangerous. Although their non-root farming has given them problems of every kind, children are shown ridiculously as little snips of good behavior. They do not even have as far as real people. And Bette Davis, a good actress, here's so a beautiful female I was beaten every time she was on the screen. His every word, each sign means to approve how to strengthen and recognize he belongs to her husband's SACRIFICES he should do with the main reason he is fighting, that he must be wired to receive an electric shock to hurt if he has tried to allow any sensation or shadow to spread in its exhibition. Yes, this is a very important film, not very good.
