Let's make a film about the talk show that already exists and basically has everything that happens on the show! Well if that idea doesn't hate you, that shouldn't, go away from the voice administrator. I was angry to see this in the theater and actually be able to sit through this mess of the movie. I think jerry springer does not play himself as shown from the cheap resources of his show (yes it looks even cheaper than the real show of jerry springer) and is known as the jerry in the film. The plan (if you can beat it) is on the daughter when she lives with her mother decides to start sleeping with the mother to live in a partner. So the good idea of ​​the mother is to call him a jerry springer show as well as make it with his girlfriend's girlfriend. (Is it unfortunate living on the trailer reserve). At the same time elsewhere in the United States the woman finds her husband of cheatin and her friend in bed together. So of course call professional america Jerry springer! I would like to talk about all the film but even think about the film now give me a head. Jamie Pressly who plays the girl seems completely impossible in the movie. And remember Michael Dudikoff kicking master karate from a series of American ninja? Let's look at him now as white garbage. This is actually seen too scary and out of shape to call it "contact with its player". But if your interesting idea is to see Jerry Springer singing a country song on his own show or guys hooking up with transvestites ... well ... JUST WATCH SHOW INSTEAD! ... at least Steve was smart enough to stay out of this flick.
