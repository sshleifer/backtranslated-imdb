I don't remember walking from the movie movies but this once. Not only, but I had 7 friends, and we all wanted to go. Unsupported plot, the characters of the soil, violence without sure. I didn't care when the good boys died; I didn't care when bad people got it. Dreams and sorcery were put on thick as pudding of liver and there was no cooperation. In short, good entertainment if you spend eternity in hell.
