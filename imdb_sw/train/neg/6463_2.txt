I looked at the money last night and it was more than 90+ years of my life. For such a cast, I thought in fact that I was in treatment - especially since I am a fan of Brando. WRONG! It is losing a talent. It is amazing to watch from time to time (such as animal farming), and there were many opportunities to lose exciting things (why they did not show Charlie Sheen's behavior back to Brando's car?) Ugh. I try to be a slapstick comedy, but I just don't buy it in it. Skip this one. It's for Brando fans who have died. <br /> <br /> I gave him 2 out of 10 because I still think the worst movie was done was Skidoo.
