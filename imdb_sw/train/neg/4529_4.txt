I can't tell the story, if that's done elsewhere. We are fans of Clive Owen, and when our Netflix recommended movie, we were surprised. It is not surprising that we have never heard this "movie", because it was BBC Television movie back in 1992. Therefore, the poor production standards, the grainy picture, the function of the jerky camera and the inferior sound. But, you don't mind the mechanics, because the story itself will make you sleepy. It is an interesting human story, but not all compulsory, and no problem. You do not care for the characters if their lives are interesting if your life looks at this stirring film. Save two hours and do something to do the best time.
