Normally, I am a good striker, but in the case of this film I must say it was very bad. I am wondering how good views are shown. There were some nice shots, but it's very bad they lost on this film sinkhole. It may have worked if "Daggers" was just an interesting and not romance action, but unfortunately the film has been built around the empty triangle of love. There is no chemistry among either a couple, anything that exists between May and her men seems more desperate than love, and for the most part the discussion is just quiet. This can be just a problem by translating, but the constant use of "flirt" particularly reminded me of the 8th class, not the top heads, together for eternity, to die for love; I also felt that we were beaten on the head and the image of the wind. The audience is given very little about the characters dealing with the truth, and thus very little emotional investment in the movie as a whole. I wanted the remote control to continue quickly, I was thrown into my seat ready to shout, but more I have been blowing very hard. <br /> <br /> ******* The ***** <br /> <br /> Now, icing on the cake. Or suppose, and add insult to injury. The end was one of the worst, disgusting things I have ever seen. The boys are fighting and shouting and shouting to each other. O, and then begins snow. Normally. O, and then May (dagger entered into the heart) suddenly comes out of the weeds. Then he gives us a pig that seems to take about 5 minutes to reach his destination, even slowing down the middle screen to hit a little finger of blood. Wow, cool. Well, then May die eventually I think because he hit a pig put in his chest and killed. Jin sings, becomes, holds his body close, the screen goes empty. I, and the people around me, are beaten. It's not a good sign. It looks amazing, but it's finally failed.
