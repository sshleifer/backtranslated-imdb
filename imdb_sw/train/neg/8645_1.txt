I have come again from this free inquiry, and this "Osama Wizard Project" is the worst film of the hands that I saw this year, worse than even "Catwoman" - which had the least skill of passing it yourself as fiction. In "Tapes in September," "filmmakers" of "journalists" lead to Afghanistan - despite being unprepared for the trip, conditions and, oh, psychological and stupid feelings their film leader revenge the death of his wife on September 11 - track Osama bin Laden. They've made "eight tapes" on their trips, which now "writes" their trips and, of course, they are trying to kill a terrorist leader. (Eight areas, thanks, all ended on key points in the details, which are easy for "document.") <br /> <br /> Psychological protagonist, who is given long talks, which maybe learn to check "MacGyver" he does not care for his own life or the lives of his innocent workers when he brings them more and more in danger through a series of worries. I don't know why he didn't just wear a sign behind him that said "My shot." The translator's staff, claiming that their sensible voice, is not much more effective and blows the hero as the hero of the fighters leads them to the penalty. You want to bring me along with someone on their journey to call all calls. <br /> <br /> Welcome to "Tape 4," I started rooting for terrorists to throw film staff.
