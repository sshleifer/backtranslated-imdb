Istanbul is one of these outdoor films that Errol Flynn was doing in the last ten years of his life trying to support his family and leaving the problem with IRS. It is the remake of the film Fred MacMurray - Ava Gardner Singapore since the last decade. <br /> <br /> Unlike the brand label, Istanbul has the advantage of the cinema of the beautiful area in front of the Golden Horn. But Errol Flynn, who was putting aging in front of the camera in every film, was a very old way to play these types of action / adventure again. His exhibition and Cornell Borchers actually have no guilt. <br /> <br /> For Cornell, she has an old Errol player who through the rescue from fire now has amnesia. He did not remember Errol and now married to Torin Thatcher. But Errol has been surrounded by evil people led by Martin Benson and Werner Klemperer who are after some diamonds that have entered. You need to deal with them too. <br /> <br /> Good reason to see Istanbul is to hear Nat King Cole singing and playing piano. Many people today do not realize that Cole was pregnant with a jazz, who just thinks as a singer. In fact he was the first pianist, the singing was back. <br /> <br /> Istanbul is a typical action / adventure film for those who are fans of the same kind of movie.
