The movie was TERRIBLE !!! Easily the worst films I saw in the last few years. One of those movies will be able to tell people for the next three years that it's a very bad movie I can do. Thank you for giving me the answer to the question "What's the worst movie you saw?" Answer: Celestine Prophecy. Believe me ... I read the book, I enjoyed the message and I was glad to see the movie, but then, they treated the audience as we cared. There are no stories and stories where there is a disability and a lot of magic and misfortune. It is too bad to mention nine prophecies and they can not only open it in a story that is entertaining to follow. They did not use any time on the development of character and it was easy to maintain if any character was dead. It was embarrassing to be one of the few who held close to the end of this very interesting movie. The book is very interesting but I enjoyed the comparison that can be seen in everyday life as you read the book. The movie does not get the same opportunity and I would recommend not to see if you want to keep the words of the book next to your heart. Do not see this MOVIE. Believe me.
