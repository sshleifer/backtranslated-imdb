What A Wonderful Cluster: Modern Airlift's Berlin. It should have it all. Tragedy. Doubt. Compatibility. Opponents. Berliner strikers and American fighters. Love and Tears. What we have, is a non-high film. Heino Ferch tries to impersonate John Wayne or so, but fails to disappoint. He does so wood, that whenever he should be lost. She tries to play a tough guy, instead of being a tough guy! Why is the behavior of Bettina Zimmermann likes with him? Because they were throwing stones at the lake? Because he brings his coal bricks? SFX is very good, made well. However much. Hundreds or so birds on Berlin, it looks like a squadron attack-fighter rather than a planned flight? as it really was. Surprisingly, the White House, the Kremlin, and the Office of the Lucius D. Clays seem to be one and keep the same dark and dust. See also, hang down windows, like a shield shield against nuclear collapse. Why is almost every area that is dark and dusty? By the way, GENERAL LUCIUS D. CLAY, comes as a little time, Assistant, Chief Messenger, who believes in his human theory of flight. He was very opposed. So connect the combination of each individual and the result is a film and it builds up to no enthusiasm, no emphasis and no historical accuracy. Sadly, it started so promising?
