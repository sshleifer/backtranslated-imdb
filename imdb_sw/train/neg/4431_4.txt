This sad comedy community received amazing surprises on its release in 1979. I remember opening the LA Times film and looking at page 2 for "Second Chapter" full of good words like: "Better than" Good Girl! "And" Neil Simon does it again! " What does Neil Simon do? He takes the geographical situation (remarrying soon after the death of his beloved partner) and makes it bad, unhappy and - worse - without unfunny. James Caan has Neil - er .. is George - a writer who can not appear to come back to life after losing his wife; The entry of power Marsha Mason (real life Mrs. Simon Simon ... soon became Mrs. Simon) who tries to love George despite her condition and generally melancholy. Mason is very interested here and can save that day not because of Caan's apathy (not mentioning a small plot on pain-thin, Valerie Harper that brings the case to extremism). I liked the sudden of the last Mason ("I'm wonderful! I am NUTS about me!"), But I did not see the end of happiness for these two people ... and when it showed that it was the same. ** from ****
