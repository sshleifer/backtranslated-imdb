Every movie from the thirties is dated, but if you were watching only movies Ford Ford would seem more looks like if you look at others. that is, the Grand Hotel is a modern melodrama. With Ford, there is always a difficulty-selling of respect of man (Abe, The Joads). Always focus on some of the seriousness of some heavy. Always inappropriate, unsolicited documents. This is not different. It's just a device designed to have feelings. And the feeling is all this goes for it. What does Ford do that does not do to thank you for Lincoln, makes me wonder how the nations have ever lived and the number of full owners shown here. Ford continued to make decent films. This is also dated to be anything but bad. It feels totally false. Henry Fonda and the fake nose are wonderful. And no one from Illinois could mention 'S,' or say "Shonuff!"
