I can sit through this movie at once, but I'm sure I could do it for the second time. Enjoy especially for the physical presence of Lindsay Lohan. The joy of Matt Dillon (Think About Mary), and the worst of the worst acting Micheal Keaton. This is not a fun pleasure The Bug Bug was but it seems. One of my main obstacles from the cinema was the fact that Herbie had changed in R2D2 antics for a large part. I was stimulated by the effect of the head of the head over the next 30 or so used and moving forward causing the same response from me. Continue to see this with your children, ie, "little children" and don't expect too much from this film. <br /> <br /> _X
