This movie was two hours with a successful quarter. Someone please tell me what is the point? <br /> I mean, I understand the historical context. It should be on the ragtag group of Merchant Traders (terrorists?) In the Missouri-Kansas area, to take revenge on all the northern and rebel sympathizers during the UN war. But apart from unprecedented violence there was little point in this film. Maybe it was a political statement? Is this war nothing more than liberty? If that was so well done, but I don't think it was something. I think the producers thought they were making a valuable film here, but even when I was worried there was a complete lack of any plot. It seemed like I was looking at the novels of the revolutionary life, and the participants look at what you can see in the novels. <br /> <br /> This movie should be burned along with some of these cities group trembling!
