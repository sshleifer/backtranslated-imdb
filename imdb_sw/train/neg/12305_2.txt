I look at this film now at WTN because that's the center that the TV turned to when I was opening it. It is not the most reliable and sad story about the wife of the minister (Alexandra Paul) with a passion for a young student / drifter (with abs washboard) played by Corey Sevier. There may be or should not be a plot. Corey strikes his coat away from Alexandra swoons. I feel the feeling should not be good, and that's why she feels with the skinny Paulery Paul. It is not very important because as I said she takes her shirt too far and I have found an analogy event. There are many sax on sound, which is just painful.
