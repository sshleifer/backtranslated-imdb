This movie was a piece of folly. Still everything. Why is it that we who love western movies are nine times out of ten at the time of western rental. It seems that if you don't see names like Robert Duval, Kevin Kostner, or Tom Selleck backed up with a lid, it is not appropriate to mix. Shilo Falls's main milestone was held in 1892, but the supporters used it were 1860 models. just two. I had to wipe it after 15 minutes of this deficit. Perhaps those who participated in this film could take some lessons at the Sunset Carson's Acting School.
