I have read several positive reviews that have defended and reflect on the various aspects of this film. One thing I see, constantly, is angry with Megan, a true political scientist, trying to change the world. I liked his behavior. Perhaps, because I am a 23-year-old student of political science and I think I will change the world too, so I relate to Megan. Besides, he is good. He is not a good example, but more than a beautiful girl nearby. Well, so cried and screamed. It is very big, and it seems to be destroyed, but does not match its character? He goes to the show with a view to offering his life to prove the point. He thinks people who enjoy the show are sick. I think he made his move very well. Of course, as a young girl, she is very scared of what she is coming to. I think he does precisely shows the little girl demonstrating the moral courage despite his great fear. Additionally, I think he continued to have some respect in the film despite the bad conditions he had. As for the movie as a whole, except Megan, it was how much I expected. It had the best annual events, with small budget levels. The plan probably took quick thought, very difficult to reflect. It is basically just a dark film of an unnecessary humorist, which the name means. I love the doctor's stress. He kept stuck to Megan's shirt, not only because of the sleaze (though so much so), but also torture him, before killing him. Chainsaw sand was hilarious. For film lovers, she was perhaps the best character. I have this 4 movie out of 10. It had a beautiful environment, almost no plot, and a mix of good and terrible acting. I would recommend to cheerful cheaper, but hard diamond in hard which is a small fear of budget.
