I think today this film is important because it was the first film of Sofia Loren. She was 19 years old when the film was held in 1953. <br /> <br /> I watched this film because I wanted to see some of the first work of Sofia Loren. I was surprised when he came to the camera with his skin on a colored colored colored color-colored painting colored pigment paint. . Indeed, today, this would seem like a slur and avoided in making the film. In fact it became angry to look at Mrs. Loren in the color of the color paint in all the film. Yes, this film would be best done if the real opera singers had made this film. Then, singing and real signals of the real artists would be clear. I minimize the opinion of others about whether the opera singers are really big and heavy. <br /> <br /> As beautiful as Mrs. Loren was 19 years old and still today, the film would have received more as though it was taking place at the stage. After all, we don't see young people on stage and "old opera singers" sing back behind the scenes! Do not minimize the use of opera singers. One of the alone is worth mentioning for a television-designed television company for J. G. Wentworth and opera musicians in the sample singing so that the products of the company's products. This is one of the best and most popular TV shows produced so far. The quality of film films also makes this production of low quality. The color of the paint has fallen very low and cannot be helped. <br /> <br /> To improve this film on DVD production company should add English language titles so that we, non-Italian, can know what words they say. It could help the story and teach it more than 30 minutes of the introduction of events. See this movie not because of Aida's story or the fact that this is an opera. In addition to Mrs Sofia Loren no one of her well-known colleagues is remembered by this author. Instead, watch this film as a fan of Mrs. Loren and want to see her at the age of 19 - regardless of what production is. <br /> <br /> Larry from Illinois
