The box "To Die For" hates me - a man with a shirt without a shirt and some promise to laugh and sex. There was a lot of Thomas Arklie (Simon), who is simple in the eyes, but no laugh and little sex. Couples, Mark and Simon, have said they have been together for a few years, but no characteristic that attracts enough to take care of them, so it's hard to imagine they care about each other. The error appears noticeable in the script, not displays; All pastors are doing their best and what they have been given. <br /> <br /> The last is sappy and don't try it (well, not completely affecting; I felt sorry that you were up). If you are looking for films about gay and AIDS relationships that are funny, "Voting" is much better.
