This movie is most likely of the worst movies I saw in all my life! The program is ridiculous and all "Adult" crap is just stupid. The whole movie is unrealistic and dumb. Let's say, It's just a “Good Player”. This is a terrible piece that should not be done on the movie. Jokes are not funny and acting is awesome. Please, I beg you to save your money than to see this piece of vanity. I had to endure to go through a little Man for an hour and a half who wanted my eyes would have blood. I am disappointed that something like this will not be considered! Who writes this trick? What artists do not have any more, how do these people get into Hollywood? They make money out of this!
