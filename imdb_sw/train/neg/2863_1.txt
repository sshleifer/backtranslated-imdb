I was happy to see this film free of charge while working in the hotel industry and this movie came soon to our film library. There is nothing against the small budget movies, but this film has a bad and leading act. What? How can movies be like this? The director should have a list of discrimination, and for all poor actors, certainly not a board to fly on the job. Please make sure you do not watch this film, acting is blind, camera and lead bad. There are just a few movies out there that should be called "LOW 10". Another example will be "Dracula 3000". People who make money with this movie should give them love, so at least they serve for good reasons. <br /> <br /> In this case I would like to look at another 10 (or at least once).
