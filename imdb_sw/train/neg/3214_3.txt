First of all, I would like to tell you that I am getting into a category, anime, animation and things like that. It is true that everyone has their own desires, but you can trust me on this film. I will have a goal. Start with the story - it's okay. It searches the story line of comic books until I know them. But the animation ... Well, it's not really awesome, but it's obviously cheap and can not. It would be much better if they did not try to imitate the anime style and cling to the original comic style drawings. If we do not see the unpleasant side effects of the fire as lights and lights you can tell them that the film is done 10 years ago and even more. It seems a bit like the original Vampire Hunter D from 1985. See Heavy Metal FAKK 2000 for example - 4 years ago they made a film that looks more spiritual! In addition to the sound of the sound is not worth anything wonderful, music is not special. So for all - you have no status. I looked at it, but I can't say that I was very happy. Not just catch you. There's a lot of blood and abuse, but that's not good for me. It may be surprising to someone who has never seen many mature images and see the blood of animation for the first time (there is anyone around?), But I don't think this is the audience of this film. So they could add a little dirt and ingredients. Chicks near Lucifer were quite tasty, and hell, we have a Mother's Death! There are a few sexy, but that's not enough. Instead of Bill Brown's music I think it would look better on a hard rock / loud metal sound. For all - the movies are not bad, but if you want something better to take the original Metal heavy, Heavy Metal FAKK 2000, Moto Ralph Bakshi and Ice or Wizards perhaps. And of course - Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust
