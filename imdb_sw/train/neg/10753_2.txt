Del - "You are a wise person whom I have met." Calvin- "Well, I had a brain, but they lost in rewriting." I think that what I see the worst about this damage to Asimov's work is how Susan Calvin's behavior was displayed. In the books, he was one of the first strong female characters, he could think of his way through the problem. Here she is just a girl in trouble, waiting to be saved by Wil Smith. <br /> <br /> There are reference to Asimov's Robotics rules, but it is after considering CGI and action events. It looks good, like in many of its films, but honestly, the story is not good. Oou think long before these characters of wisdom do.
