I am sure that this is the worst movie made. If you can't make a 13-year-old boy laugh at the bad humor you should stop the comedy forever. Unfortunately, Rian Rivers chose the difference. The movie is full of predictable gags (some of these are racist) and very unfunny jokes. Especially memorable is the area where the doctor explains the behavior of the rabbit is dead and she is pregnant (if I am writing this, I do not believe that this was actually the film area). One runs to a dead rabbit at the doctor's desk and tries to give him a mouth mouth. ROTFLMAO! Not! The punch line that you can tell you how bad things in this film are "I knew I should be on top." when no ........
