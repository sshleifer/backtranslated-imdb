I agree, after coming age in the hippie-dippy age, I am a sucker for these types of movies. I can enjoy some schlock of hippie type more than many "normal" people. However, this film is very bad in every way considered. Every hippie emergence view is presented as the gospel, cops kill long hair while climbing in peace in peace. This film is so awesome that it is not even worth watching as a blow on an extra drone of hippie. It's like the left wing of Dragnet, except without professional actors. The only reason I gave two stars is because there are some periods of interest in the sound of the voice, instead of, I couldn't get a selection of negative stars. There are no executives, almost no plot, sheeze, hardly even the script ... you have found, the movie "art" .... All of this has been done with the delays of digging the roots of the roots, playing every irrelevant area to fill the time. In an extraordinary life of an artistic life, the "incomparable" movie of a movie that is connected to the city in real life and stole a bank in Boston, one of his murdered robber was murdered and was sent to prison where he was killed in The weight of humiliation "crash" ..... and just think, he had to leave behind this as an inheritance .... Oy vey.
