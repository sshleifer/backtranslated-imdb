I don't find this. The movie has a clear budget. It has a very good picture. It has good layout, good editing and good leadership as well. Then WHY did they not employ someone to make the last document to write again so it was not so much with WHY OH WHY employed a few non-executive actors who could not do their way out of the paper bag? This movie can be beautiful. They often look good and feel good but at the end, you realize that the film was not quite good. So I would say it is a good production but a bad movie. Not too bad. <br /> <br /> And it goes? Come one, really!
