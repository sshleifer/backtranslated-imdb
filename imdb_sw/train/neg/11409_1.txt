The truth began in the 80s of the most disgusting violence that you do as "terrible film". I was a target audience of this piece of waste and I was disappointed then as now. Oh, we start where. Let's see, set up: You can bring people to live if they have died a cruel death. Therefore, the weakening of weak weaknesses is the exemption of pastoralists in the wrong way, because, well, they need to raise them! This would have worked if it's on top of the black-fashioned Re-Animator or something. But no, it is played directly. There is a whole family fearful in a car that is defended below, one of the few events at least where their damage has been disabled. However, almost everything else on the screen. In fact there is a place where a little girl is going to be beaten and killed by the people of the zombie towns, which all hide and beat several cameras. Then, there is a close face like the film makers with love - and when it is used - reveals when photographs lose when their beaten face is covered under the skull and re-checked again "normal" again. This has made, of course, for Jack Albertson who was pastors all over. He likes to drive around ambulances / meetings to play the old tunes of Tommy Dorcey, I think that should be good. At the end, of course, even the Sheriff is undead and the doctor provides kindly to adjust his hands to decay. It is not clear why Sheriff's outdoors and other townsmen kill glee children and stretch their faces, connecting the needle into the eyes of burning, etc.. I wonder, of course, what people see to show geek like this to give any kind of rating at all times. It's not terrible, the twist is laughable, and is generally a kind of sick. It is not even enough to "see with dare" or enjoy at the level you can watch the bad movie of HG Lewis. It is only a garbage of God, made for people who leave this kind of useless, and made by people to decrease in payment. Unfortunately, Albertson had been linked even.
