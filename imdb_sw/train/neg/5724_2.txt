I agree with the last reviewer that this film had a bad act. Yes, there was a lot of gore and some dirt. But it was a shadow and a plot to move forward, meaningless and dumb. Where this was supposed to be photographed any: Chinatown Canada or Hong Kong? Hostel was the most beautiful movie and I would recommend to see it instead. The great hatred I have with the DVD is that if you block Spanish titles, they return after a few events and then return to the main menu and remove them. Also, don't waste your time on deleted events because there is no voice and it looks like photos of tourists.
