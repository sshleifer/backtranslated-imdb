I don't understand why making remake has been a trend. Every remake I saw was bad, and this is not different. If any of you has seen a quote from Ben Jones, that is a "rubbish" of garbage, he is exactly the same. Why would they take an extraordinary television show, which I liked, I never missed a place, and the season 1-4 on DVD, and destroy it, I never know it. The television version was a family show, and though Daisy has a body, it had refused, or even addressed in the show, except the dress. Family shows have been changed to dirt waste, and I won't recommend anyone to see it. Another thing I liked was that John Schneider and Tom Wopat are the best actors (along with all others made), and also very cute. Bo new and Luke don't even have a bit. That was one of the show attractions. Compose is awesome. They can get at least a brunette for Daisy. I don't think Burt Reynolds is a Boss Hogg with a reputation, either. Every other role he played has been very different from this role. The only role that they gave a good half is Willie Nelson as Uncle Jesse, but still not compare. Denver Pyle is his own actor, and that made him perfect for the role. I think to give it a bad, the story is bad, and all in a devastating show show and turned into a dirty, bad movie. I won't recommend anyone to see it. I only saw the curiosity, and there was a free ticket on the 4th season of DVD. I've never been paid to see this film, but it was free. Don't see this MOVIE.
