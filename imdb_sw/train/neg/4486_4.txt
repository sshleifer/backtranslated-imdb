What was hell? I saw The Matrix and surprised. It was a very interesting movie made. What had the Wachowski brothers do this film is more than me. <br /> <br /> There is no plot, you can't say it. Basically all this film was a burden to talk, and don't get bad, I don't have a problem with talking movies, but every talking on the Matrix Reloaded was an inexhaustible burden. Then there will be a series of struggles that have continued WAY very long, then causing unnecessary things, then another battlefield that continues long and builds up to a high peak of anti-peak. A small beard that talks about a cow's unreasonable load for 20 minutes. Also, Keanu Reeves gives its worst performance yet. I knew that he was not a good actor but this was more than a joke. If you look at his films in the way he was in them he would seem to be slower when they continued. God knows His performance is like in Gotta's Giving! Keanu Reeves: The only wood that had been an actor. After the glory of this first film came as a power cancellation. If you haven't seen the first film I tell you to look at it, but don't waste your time with this turd. <br /> <br />
