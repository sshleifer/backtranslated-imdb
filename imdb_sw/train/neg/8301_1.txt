Very bad. Why someone thinks this is a good film to allow funny is a real secret. I love comedi like someone else and I love "Christmas stories." The fact that you have the same director and was based on the author's record I have worked hard for why this film is a failure of each level. Charles Grodin is a horrible shock like a father to begin with. To another it does not seem to have the same speed - it does not interfere well. Everything seems tired and forced. Happy life that is full of the first film does not exist here - you just want the movie to end. I can't even recommend this film to curiosity seekers who enjoyed "Christmas stories." It's bad. 1/10.
