This movie should not be done. In fact, I must admit that before I saw I was in great doubt. The director is not a good actor, though he made many movies in Holland, and a young woman who took the main part is TV-personality and a regular smile on the face and not a lot of resistance. The actor who played another great place I saw right now in Mrs. Bird and though the film is better, he did not hurt me than. Starting with the story, I have not read a novel, but a script that emphasizes the film is something that can be done with the minds of children with a birthday on a Sunday rain, not a person of the same age as a director who likes to watch a good film. The main thing that was mixed was the previous discussion, it was often to say loudly. My opinion is going to the camera, at least he tried to do something out of it. It is a pity that the film has been edited, if not, some of the events were more realistic.
