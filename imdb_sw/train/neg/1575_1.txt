This movie is very bad hurt. Car making 30 mph when it should go 100 ... lever shift which is stuck (in Park!), Nurse runs for about 2 hours with a mobile phone on the shoulder ... can not any of the 2 morons take this damn phone? Nothing can be trusted in this trick. I would be embarrassed to appear on the film like this!
