This fascinating fusion of the new New Age genre of New Age is not able to "open you", borrow one of the most popular films, but it can leave your jaw jaw and stomach from laughter or retching. According to the best selling book by James Redfield, the first (self-published) in 1993, this kitsch stroke raises the spiritual awakening of the American teacher (Matthew Settle) who, when traveling to Peru, more than dark, more of evil and wiping the air or something illegal. For what he sees is the shade of Shangri La that lays up with the invasive zombies that can be nuts or think so much, perhaps because they often follow up with a pot of growing and often from the choir of heaven. Although there is a lot of discussion about "energy," this quality does not diminish from the pitcher of the motley whose number includes Thomas Kretschmann, Annabeth Gish, Hector Elizondo and Jurgen Prochnow, all who have now supported in the camp camp. For those concerned, the plot involves the military, terrorists and the Roman Catholic Church; Armand Mastroianni gave improper direction when Mr. Redfield, Barnet Bain and Dan Gordon wrote a hoot of the script. In short, the worst films can be found in 40+ years of watching movies.
