For the movie made for "movie" movie started off very interesting. I was very surprised by the story and the secret of the film. But the end was completely corrupted. The movie was going along with the speed of speed and was building up, it seemed like that, to the very end of the weather. But I think what no end. The movie is over and after one and a half hours around the audience just left wondering what happened. Why all the questions that are not answered in the film have not left answers. There was no definite comment on any key mark in the plot. This film is like watching the mystery of murder and then never finding out who did it. It is very broken. This film looks like the producers lost money and have not filled the film. BOMBI real!
