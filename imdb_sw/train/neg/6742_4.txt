For romantic comedies, I often judge the quality of the film according to the lack of my eyes at the end of the experience. Unfortunately for "Wedding Day," I can only measure the film with 4 tears out of 10 possible. I pray for forgiveness for fans of Debra Messing and Dermot Mulroney, but I didn't have many chemistry among them two characters. The cluster of the film is "A beautiful woman," and Dermot with Nick's nick, a very valuable male man employed by Debra Kat's character to take him to England for his sister's wedding. Sexual relationships may continue between the administrator and the client. But the conversation seemed to be forced and fake. And he had no romantic sparks that exist in Nick and Kat's relationship. In the role of helping, Amy Adams was positioned as a sister of Kat. Whenever Amy was screwed, she worked as a plug for a spark and a catalyst for film energy. Maybe if Amy Adams has been hit in Kat's position, the film can be more powerful. But as it changed, instead of reaching Kleenex, I was looking for Visine for an attempt at least to pretend that this film had a real sense and romance.
