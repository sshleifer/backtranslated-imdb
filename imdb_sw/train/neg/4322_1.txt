Read and consider - you can save 88 minutes of your life (it was all!)! If it fails .... completely and completely failed. I have tried to think of one good thing about it and can't. I would like to mention some of the most important things ... Angels are really old cowboys who stay in the trees. Santa can bring people from the dead (if you send a good letter). And the plot .. I will not destroy you but there must be light in the film if it is different from dark but no. Even the picture is light - the snow displayed at the end of freezing, everywhere looking cold, dirty and sad. <br /> <br /> If you think, the film has fun (schmaltzy). It's forgiveness!
