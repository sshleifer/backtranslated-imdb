No film with Madeleine Carroll in its cast can be unknown. He said, we must add that this British film is approaching. The story takes place on the 'SS Atlantic' board and it is freely based on the 'Titanic' journey. The 'incomplete' word is said, the liner blows ice, and we hear the choir of heaven singing 'close to my God for You.' Lost passengers eventually take a song, for the gentle work of the cunning. But the release of the film (1929) means that the modern viewer should take the extraordinary voice of sound and many acting acting films and action. These are not problems. Great film of film is pacing, and pacing was well developed in silents. However, if negotiations were given at a speedy pace, the time of the movie would be cut by half. The expected effect was the act of play (and transparency in the new center), but surprising results are tiresome now. The design of this film is historic and useless. Paradoxically, I've got some details of the modern editing technique: fine, sudden cuts from one part of the ship to another, sometimes even with sound effects. Although we are in the 'Atlantic' from the first shot, we had four minutes on the movie before discovering the truth. There are a lot of long, musical instruments and music. (Entertainment, simple voice.) Personal stories are presented in a non-verbal and non-verbal manner. Do not even think of the festival. Berg is a little thing and the external damage that makes the helmet is a small jacket. However, passenger incidents enter the motor boats - quite clear in the real liner, perhaps tied to the dock - it gives great excitement. Other than Miss Carroll's glory, this process is the only points of quality film. If the film and the ship close to their end, the screen goes black often when the electric generators begin to fail. The end of the end, the end of the end is the end of the film, and the sun / sun, the effect of the wonderful model. 'Atlantic' is a cinema curiosity. For the best. <br /> <br />
