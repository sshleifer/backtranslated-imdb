I'm afraid that I don't like this film very much. In addition to a few save features, it's not something to write at home about. J-horror has increased over the past five and six years but the films themselves have more than one account have been replicated copies of the previous successful carbon. This is one of them. This is basically a conventional movie. Origin is promising and interesting events from morgue where the dead girl has made her eyes precisely, but after opening it. However, after this, it grows faster with this flick. It will be of grace to start with the things I like about "Branch". On the other side, the pictures are gaudy and the movie looks good for that kind. For those who love their horror movies there are few who have done well (they are not interested in killing). We also get a good cycle of suspicions / pieces. However, there are many obstacles too ... <br /> <br /> First and foremost, with my great complaint about this movie, is that the plot jumps and jumps forward and back in time and rate awesome. Usually that's not a problem for me, but here, where students seem to be the same regardless of age, I was confused more than one event. <br /> <br /> Exhibitions are the same as I think (a little hard to tell when you don't know the language), but it seems to be a little harder. And for the terrible movie, I don't think it was scary enough. For a while I was very tired. <br /> <br /> Become a fan of giallo movies, I expected very much from "Night", but unfortunately I was desperate.
