Rachel, Jo, Hannah, Tina, Bradley and John are all on the form here. They deserve a selection of oscar for their exhibitions. I am a great fan of showwell tv. Their music reefs and all are very talented! I am also a great professional of SARCASM !!!!!! <br /> If you are the least of the shadow do not learn !!!!! Exercise is very weak, conversation is terrible and joke is not well done (I feel sorry for the director). The joke is very bad for 8, the small fans of the Club Club did not laugh. They thought they could do it well. And they did. They conquered the world. They were S Club Juniors. Paul, "the fat, the evil one who started the mosh group" must have thanked his fortune stars he left when he did. One of the worst movies made. SEE MOVIE HILI! Don't go and see it! NO! YOU CAN! 0/10 RJT
