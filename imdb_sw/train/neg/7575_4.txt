The retired diplomat, well played by Michael York, goes to Russia to take revenge on the Russian gangster who was killed by a police diplomat son. There the diplomat meets with a strong and respectful Russian soldier who helps bring the Russian army to justice. <br /> <br /> I recalled the former years of operation of the 1980s that always shows the Russians as badly wrong to destroy the US government right. It is worth seeing this Russian boy as a hero. It's not a big flick, it's usually a "B" point flick. Michael York gives a lesson to this unusual movie. Alexander Nevsky, who plays the Russian army is a "blah" but surprisingly has some chemistry by Michael York. To deal with it, Michael York is a very good actor that he could have chemistry and anyone who makes the area and. Failure, the best Adrian Paul is killed within the first 15 minutes of the movie. Now, if Adrian Paul was in this film again, it would be on the top stage "B" point flick. All I can say about Adrian Paul is that he is good looking for the first minute of the movie. The striker, played by Richard Tyson, is a very good man. She is very blonde and very involved in this film. <br /> <br /> Use this flick if there is nothing else on the TV. Its okay. It doesn't matter very bad. The secret of the action is good. Acting can be better, the plot would have moved faster, but hey, you can see what Russia looks like today!
