This is a sad film released to depressed people. I was sitting on a cinema that broke my hair, wanting to break the seats in front of me as a movie released out of one screens after another. And there were people shouting back to me, which helped me wonder what kind of film these people should look for actually enjoy this horse-s ** t. <br /> <br /> Nikkhil Advani has six stories without a plot and no interesting characters. Screenplay is lighter, probably was drunk when writing this film. There is no hold on any of this story. There is nothing new, there is nothing to hold the audience and filled with conversations that you would miss a million times before. One of the stories is about these couples can not have sex because the series of disasters happens every time they want to do it. I mean a lot is this story needed? Not funny, not creative but it proves that Advani has no sense of comedy. One of the stories (which is probably the only story I was attracted to) depends on the trust of the person and that also ends in the old sati-savitri rope-parmeshwar. I do not know what Salmaan-Priyanka was near. There was no question in the plot that plot. Can not take a film of Karan Johar because she marries Salmaan ?? Why can't she marry him and still take a film? or Is Advani and Priyanaka just wanting to prove the world that it is true that female actors cannot succeed if they are married or that they should not work in the film once married? With six actors in the film, Advani can't produce the film alone. It therefore uses active donors as a group of Times, to struggle to develop their Filmfare magazines. And also the brand of jewelery in which women in the film seems to adore! I'm coming to IMD so that I get the worst score and I am surprised to see the movie publications. It comes only to show the sad state of bollywood and how the stars beat the fans. For fans like this, movies like Salaam E Ishq will continue to be made and worse to be a blow.
