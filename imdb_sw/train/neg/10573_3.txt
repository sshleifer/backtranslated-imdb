I was under this movie for a class of relationships in my school. As it proved it was not interesting and nothing new. Although it tries to be original based on the boy's father rather than the mother to show the problems that the father could use. It had a fascinating part but it does not only live by its origin due to any other fact in this movie was original. We have the main character in which the older sister who likes in every other movie like this has something against her, we have to stay at home a mother who expects so much and when she swears more she feels angry and cleans her in the dust, then we have a father who has always gone. Then girls have parents who want everything and expect to be perfect in everything he does. Continue on the story as I said it was interesting but lack of good acting from the whole cast and lack of any good text or story. Everything about this came under the shadow of a young disciplinary child at school and begins to study with a girl, they do together, they have sex and then we have a young child. Perhaps it would have been better to have made the text better and to have been acting better. I have had a lot more impression of Leatherface and its chainsaw than I made out of any actor in this film and that is very bad as the Leatherface movies climb and implemented. Until now the only interesting movie of teen pregnancy I saw is Juno. Up to now the spectacular side of this worst situation has shown more entertainment while still giving the message. As I said the idea was the most original of these films based on the young mother but this did not choose instead it focuses on the dad's game but again nature does not save this film from free. I believe that a person decides to re-create this film and cast the best with the best author or just make another similar film for this reason has lost the ability.
