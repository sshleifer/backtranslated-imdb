The mum's tomb begins with the re-alignment of Mummy Hands and then causes the story to go forward for several years and the sea to the United States where where the current priest and Kharis mummy lost and retaliated those who broke the grave in the past. When I really liked the "mummy" by Boris Karloff as the mummy Imhotep, and loved the very "Hand of the Mummy" by Tom Tyler as Kharis (which is prequel directly to this film), I didn't like to be taken by "Mummy's Mummy". It is done in the same style as the previous film and has another similar design in the new environment. Lon Chaney Jr is similar to Kharis, but it is not quite suitable. And I think that's my main opposition to this movie â€” that nothing has stopped completely. There is nothing horrible here, but there is nothing true of the truth, so the viewer is left with the mummy story of bland.
