I've been going to the AFI's top 100 list of comedies, and I must say that this is one of the worst. Not only 90 movies on the list I saw, but of any movie I saw. Drunks are funny sometimes, Dudley is not. Liza almost made it useful, but alas ... just go to Watch Watch Arrested Progress if you want to see him in something good. Hardly, Dudley laughing and drinking should be funny? I would like to recommend very close to each other movie on 100 games of AFI to laugh more than this. If you want to see funnier "drunk", try a good man. Funnier movies in general, any Marx movies will kill (especially if they are named as Arthur).
