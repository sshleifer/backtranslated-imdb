Witch Hildegard Knef traps a group of people in a special hotel and takes one by one of the most corrupt, disgusting ways. I thought I would like to see all of it until one lucky person is being crucified and then he has his head burned. Hildy is a very prankster too: it takes a harpy blowing and closing his mouth ... then hang aside to him only in the chimney at the time of fire! "Pastor" made me sick. It made my eyes hurt. I was ready to write as the worst movie ever - ever ever made by otherwise capable people ... to the end. I accept that I loved the last. It involves the boy and his bed of the toy ducked by Linda Blair looking at the fantastically given. The event goes on for just a minute and the movie is approaching, but you know that formerly saying: "If you have a great end, people will forgive you for anything!"
