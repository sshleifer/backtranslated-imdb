"The fallen" falls under the destruction of life (WOL) society. I am sad that I have now been an old two hours. Other family members also watched this film and gave us a negative view of the screen and has been recognized by the mother. I felt sorry for the actors (Wagner). I have read some negative reviews and cannot add anything else to this film unless it can be reduced to 25 minutes so it can take a 30-minute slot on TV without losing a plot. It reminds me of a dish that has several good ingredients but when it is used it is bland with any odor. In my opinion of humility, the Mummy of the Foot 42 should be at the foot of 8-10 to improve the plot by taking a scholar and selecting him and a number of people who want to confirm the truth and want DNA samples for a bad reason. The heroes are cut off and thrown in there with their ears and colleges. Then everything was coming from evil people. Heroes could save the day and prove everyone wrong.
