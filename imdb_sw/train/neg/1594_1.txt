Wow. This film gave the pants when I saw it. Bland, useless and unmoving. <br /> <br /> It looks, Ash and cooperation. they can travel for a while with the help of the "Forest of the Forest" ("Mononoke 'too much?). There, they meet a dorky child named Sam, and" plot "begins. Tom (Ash) and Huck (Sam) gets up with nature, being hippies and trying to free Celebi ("Spirit") from a certain boy of weirdo. I don't even know something else went on. It all went to the genius. The friends of Ash were not in it, and all the events of the fight had distracted. When you save the day, Ash and his proud friends, you must come back to them, while watching Sam leaving with Celebi (the area was just enough; OO;) Then, after their return time, Ash learns that his new friend is actually the grandfather of his opponent. And I think that's it. Pretty delayed is not so? If you love your children, you can't hide them for this. (1 out of 10)
