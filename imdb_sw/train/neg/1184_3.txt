This movie had a good plot of sounding, but the set was very slow ... very slow. even if someone thinks this is a classic ritual, I think that there is a better film from that time to watch. <br /> <br /> The movies are not the best, but not the worst. The sound is the same. OK OK. I can not recommend this to anyone than perhaps a film student. <br /> <br /> The movie does not have a pregnancy, and horseback horses don't do it one good either. and the woman blowing the bride on the edge of the bed was stupid. <br /> <br /> no winnings here, skip this trouble. I have found it worse to believe me, but this is just a waste of time, and I have never received a good idea here. especially high level ...
