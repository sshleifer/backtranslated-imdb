The British / Spanish co-production of the stars is good, what you can see. I have three versions, two VHS, one DVD, and all of them very broken, so bad that it looks like buildings have a conversation with them. Short films are struggling as badly from the pot and considered as this, as director Robert Parrish seems to be very happy with the widescreen process which he wanted to use both sides of the screen at once, leaving the middle. Another user comments that we see all the population of the church killed at the beginning; not in any copy I have. There are some of the sudden cuts of farmers who cancel their guns, a Mexican official is shot, Shaw and Landau celebrating, and so it is. We do not know why Shaw has been a priest (if it is true), we do not know what is happening to Don Carlos (Savalas) although I suspect was called home to a star in Kojak, since his departure seems to be legitimate. And there is a wonderful sequence where Michael Craig (Wonderful Island) plays around a bowl of bowls and a bad suit in traditional English music music up to 1960 BATTLE OF NEW ORLEANS, which was not played by Johnny Horton here but for some lyrics I've never heard before. On the other hand, the area is large, the old stronghold destroyed by the Escher-style level that leads everywhere, some good chewing and Robert Shaw, and good performances by Stevens, Landau, Lettieri, and Telly Savalas as Telly Savalas . I didn't like this film, but I didn't see it at all. I will look for a regular version and make my decision then.
