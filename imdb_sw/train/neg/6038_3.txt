I did not have any other expectations except to be happy for 90 minutes, and that's how I was. <br /> <br /> Of course it is camping, of course some conversations were not perfect, of course "special effects" were hokey little. That's why I enjoyed the film. It is the perfect shape of this kind of classic Horror of 70. <br /> <br /> Talent needs to start where, where it goes to administrators and employees, and is the best piece of material to strengthen your skills over this. <br /> <br /> I have a direct look at another film from these manufacturers and directors.
