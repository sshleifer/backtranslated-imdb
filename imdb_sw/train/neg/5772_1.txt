I must add, if anyone really reads this and has never found that point. This other audience did not dance, this is really the worst movies you can see. When the film began I could not believe anything like this that was done to make the world see. They don't just say when they say it looks like a home movie. It's true. If the "director" took a hi8 family camcorder (before the DV cameras and the editing of a non-line computer), no other devices (lights, gear sounds, etc.), they found some of the most respectable students, and they went to the movie . No script, just making it on he went on. I looked at it, it was on my mono TV, so I just have a voice center (left of the right speaker). At first I thought I would do it wrong. The movie was silent until someone spoke a few minutes inside. I woke up and switched to another way and suddenly I could hear music and sound but didn't hear the dialog. They wrote sounds in different ways of blood! I mean, there are movies that can be funny look, bad they are good, kind of thing. I don't know this is one of them. I mean, I will agree to be a bit of the film writer. And seeing bad movies makes you want to go out and keep doing better, you know. But this just look makes me feel sorry for anyone who did it. <br /> <br /> As bad as they were, artists are the only thing about this. I thought that the child was warm and desperate in the shortness of his shower. A bit of T and A from him would have raised a mark from anything maybe 3 or 4. But alas, no. If you want to make a film but it is to turn out, give us some wrong weakness. He worked for Roger Corman.
