Right now, lets you see. What was interesting for the first movie? I know, people with funny accents, people fall into the water, a boat boat attack and funny comments between two teams. In this film have emphasized the legitimate section for max, no good. Many people fall into the water for non-sure reasons, no good. Of course, look. Interesting views between the two teams, they tried but failed. Also, there are also features that follow in this film. This film should be on what happens on the water, not on the ground. Sorry to say that there is a lot of distance between funny places and filmmakers are used for max. No good. All in all, I offer four out of ten since it has some funny part.
