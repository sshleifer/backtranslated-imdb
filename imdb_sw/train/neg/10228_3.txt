Being honest I had heard this was bad before I decided to look at it, but I did not let others influence my opinion, in fact I am more likely to look something out of opposition! Bullwhip had one thing that was going to me before I watched, the fact that Rhonda Fleming and those beautiful eyes were in me I had a direct intention. The picture is not very good, and indeed it is so amazing, all the characters are corrupt and shifty in one way or form, all motivated by greed or personal conquest, all this is good and good if the rotating film can do justice to a group of despicable people and create an interesting picture of the image. Unfortunately it is not appropriate, and if finale fills your eyes with sugar you can't help shouting out that you have been engraved in watching bad films, no one has been healed from any loan, and someone to lead Guy Madison with tough wood. Even the lovely Rhonda can make me recommend this to anyone, 3/10
