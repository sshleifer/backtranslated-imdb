Vipul Shah has done a really amazing job as a film manufacturer in the past. 'Waqt - Race against Time' and 'Namaste London' were entertaining and interesting look. 'Singh Is Kinng' was happy, which he produced. His recent departure as "London Dreams" comes as his work declines further. The London 'dream has a short story, it is about how efficiently converts friendships to hate. Accepted, has the ability but when you look at 'London' dream you wonder what happens? This film has perhaps the most advanced in recent times. Vipul Shah reporter puts Vipul Shah director down. The first hour is boring, the second hour is better; but again the peak is sad. Anyone who can forgive someone who has decided to destroy? I don't want. Ajay Devgn suddenly decides to go to India and apologize to his diaper friend, thanks to his uncle Om Puri. When he comes to India, instead of giving him or using Salman Salman he agrees with the band of baja and says he was the reason for the whole fiasco? Was the intention of Vipul Shah to show the character of Salman as GOD? If yes, than you have failed completely. The only question I wanted to ask Vipul Shah is that, do you accept someone who destroyed you with the most acceptance? Write down what you feel, do not neglect [audience], we are wise enough to understand well or not. <br /> <br /> This is music but music by Shankar-Eshaan-Loy is awesome. There is no single song in your mind. Salman is better yet. He carries the film on his shoulders and makes the truth, very well in emotional events. But again his character is shown as a GOD, which makes him look like losing the end. Ajay is also good, but Salman has completely hacked him. Asin has been lost, and what good talent does Om Puri do in this film? Rannvijay hams, though Aditya Roy Kapoor adds. Brinda Parekh is the same as the vamp. <br /> <br /> Overall, this dream is still a dream!
