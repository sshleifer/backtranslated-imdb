O dear. This movie may have a low name "When authors fight!" It stinker does. I was very optimistic about this, after reading the IMDb test, which makes me wonder about the IMD rating system, but that's a different thing. I loved Steve Carrell in Anchorman, Bruce General, Office, etc. so I expected good things. Saying I was desperate is reduced to a year. There are many things wrong with this film, but I will do it by (a) the failure of every family to do if these people do (Workout aerobics workout? What is the planet's real life?), Script clunky (love killer? , and the fact that the character of Dan is unknown, you find yourself wondering what the girl has seen in him make him fall in love with him? This film was filled with filling for group talks, the creaking direction, keeping the ridiculous performances and was slow, slow, slow. We could walk after half an hour if we didn't like to have my parents, who don't get too much and do not like to lose money. Unlike the filmmakers of this film, who would be the best to lose all the money spent to make this movie be on fire - that would be more fun. If you like movies, avoid this as a blow.
