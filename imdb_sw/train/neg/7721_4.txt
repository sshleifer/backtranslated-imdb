Scenes fight and play as slow motion Jackie Chan and the wit effort is pathetic (the worst pun and away: "What do I think? This time I heard you come"). Star is an improper pair: Brandon Lee, in spite of the horrible lines he says, actually shows the effect of charisma and screenshots - things that Dolph Lundgren don't have at all (at least in this film). Remember for the director: in the future, please avoid any of the love events, especially when your main actor does not do any dirt and is very dependent on the body twice. (* 1/2)
