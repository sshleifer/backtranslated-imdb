Poor Robert Englund makes another and the cost of Tobe Hooper who usually performs awesome movies but has failed so much in this. Englund is well known to Marque De Sade who in the 17th century was imprisoned for his pain and joy to bring pain on himself and also to watch others also be pain. The story is confused and flip flop from one century to another and I became a mixture of what was going on and what was the purpose of this movie. I saw a young woman who was confronted by a wonderful girl who is trying to put herself and the young woman was attracted to this Arab with a huge amount of money and knows she is out to kill and then Englund comes from one century to another claiming to be the parents of the deade and he is trying to kill him because he reminded Madam Momoselle (written not right) or anyone who was in the picture above the Deades wall. The movie was awesome, I was surprised Hooper for englund hiring in this film and special effects were so fake and laughable, especially about the eyes. Englund tries to return from his argument once to hit "Nightmare on Elm St." using these pull and out the injection to keep the eyes of people. Horrible, quite awesome.
