I was using the name of Wesley Snipes as a clue to going ahead and looking at a new film, which was not covered. So now, for the first time, the Snipes-Way way to the movie's suggestions failed. Exactly. I must first come here to see these comments. <br /> <br /> Snipes should be embarrassed to allow his other hard efforts to get lost in the "Contractor". The worst fears of flick has come to the pain crop. I was afraid that shaky, blurry, pseudo-documentary, "was not considered" to lead and edit the style (first brought to my mind by Paul Greengrass-directed "Bloody Sunday") could spread to other films. The Greengass epidemic was taken to the height of half in the last half of the Bourne trilogy film. My fear had happened. In my opinion, these films are made very badly by these infectious diseases, which are wrongly crossing through "strengthening action". But the "Bourne Franchise," as Greengrass likes so much for his cows, seems to convince others in Hollywood to be supporters in a quick effort, a big money. Read my lips, you kind of Hollywood. The action needs to be explicitly photographed and presented, not only shown by the slim, films of the movie. The "Contractor" goes to the "Ultimatum of Bourne" by an unusual sounding, with the hope of their young viewers (tested) cannot see it. For example, if I hear a police radio trembling "Yankee-Romeo" sometimes more, I'll just sleep. Chances are good I will no longer hear: I will never ever "Contractor" again. <br /> <br /> I recommend to those who still see the "Contractor": simply have content and stability this lack involves your life. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10; I'm tempted to decrease 1.
