I have seen this film several times in the festive films of the film and always causes the feeling that I have seen the trailer of the film! <br /> <br /> For the school's school is produced well and directed, but the story ... well needed something else to be a great and interesting film. The behavior of Tim Watcher is required a certain approach. This is something that did not exist with a short Portuguese film - the script is always high. But stillâ€¦ I loved this film ... <br /> <br /> Parabens! (congratulations!)
