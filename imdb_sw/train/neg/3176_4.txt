Eva Longoria Parker good playing Kate, who dies after the ice angel beat before "I do" by Henry Henry (Paul Rudd). After two years Henry has not continued with his sister Chloe (Lindsay Sloane). Chloe plans for Henry to talk to an attractive Ashley (Lake Bell). Ashley communicates with the spirit of Kate with the hope of helping Henry continue his life. When the psychic starts to attract to Henry, Kate's soul seems to lose romance in the bud. There are some funny situations; but if you have seen a trailer you have seen a film. Also in cast: Stephen Root, Jason Biggs, William Morgan Sheppard and Wendi McLendon-Covey. I myself thought that Bell stole a show from Parker. And Biggs as usual pain in the butt. This film was still closed more.
