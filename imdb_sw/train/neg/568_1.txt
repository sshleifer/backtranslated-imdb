This "previous" today at SciFi station and all I can say is "I have no words" I put it today so I can look at it tonight after work. I was very optimistic, now I have broken the riders who want the length of the string so that I can keep myself. It is possible the worst films I saw. I wish I could say something good like "It was fun to enjoy this film" but this movie doesn't like anything to work with. I know you didn't have to keep vendors here with an external warning but I will go however "this movie comes" there I said! They should show this flick for film students to show them what you don't have to do! My nine-year-old can make the best film. The only respect for this film is the voice and / or sound of the voice. OH! I have found a strong C-clamp in an old tool box. I will put you on my left hand and strengthen until the pain causes memory of what my eyes have seen. I could only draw on this VHS but I think I will burn it in a fire hole instead. I could clean up soap but I'm afraid I won't be clean again. Christmas is coming. Buy this movie and give it to people you hate. -Mike
