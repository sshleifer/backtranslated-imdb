I am a fan of Matthew Modine, but this film - which I have stumbled on the cable - is quite untrue. I see that the author of the photo and director were the same as that, so there was no one around to talk about its worst nature. No surprise, no previous lines, and no original characters. Thefishfish was essentially a tender attitude. It is the loss of all this talent to act. Given how expensive a film is in New York these days, I wonder how this was done in the first place. And if you're wondering why I looked at it, it came after a film that I like on the cable and I left it when I worked on the computer. It's not a much needed image!
