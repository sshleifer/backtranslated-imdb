Why did I spend 1.5 hours of my life watching this? Why was this film done? Why did I even comment on this film? One expert said this film took the patience to watch and was not for everyone. I can't find out who this movie is. maybe after stopping the acid, SOMEBODY, Others can look at this and make a sense. It does not matter, not experiments, is a clear and easy garbage. The film does not follow any line of plot, just when you think you have something, well ..... you don't. I think the end brought the end to the film (no planned pun), the viewer gets an explanation of what might be happening. I don't think I put a spoiler in here, not that it's right. This film is another must miss in the world of filmdom.
