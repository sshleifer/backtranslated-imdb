I saw "Shiner" on DVD. As I watched it, I thought, "This is a very bad picture of childbirth without porn." I also thought, "Whoever wrote this has real things." Then I saw the director / author Carlson describing his process as a special feature. Yes, it was really special. The focus of the film is placed on two alcoholics who face to get. They are very attractive. There are weaknesses in front and complete. These reasons are probably related to the film being seen at all times. The most pressing feature of the film is the bashing of gay and sexist supporters of the victim who tries to take revenge on his attackers, those two lost. It is not just a matter of concern and sadness from a technical perspective, but acting is very serious. <br /> <br /> Then there is a box-stalker theme. This is true, not just wonderful. This hunky striker has somehow been disturbed by the continuing attentions of the mother of the meat mother who works in his parking lot. This is in LA, committed. The striker is very disappointed that he returns to the stalker house, blows in front of him and cheers in the process. Well, all that I can say is why the striker who is a heart specialist performer gets disappointed with the attention of stalker? It's just useless. And, I'm afraid, some psychological-power makes sense, if you take time to read about them. However, bad literature has no meaning at all. <br /> <br /> The director / author seems to have imagined that this film represents a few minority within the gay community. Well, he might be right, I think. We can never know, since a few of them would not be able to work enough to never get out of an open film or store DVD, only two areas that could get this Turkey. Thank you for that good.
