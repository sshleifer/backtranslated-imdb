Mary Pickford becomes the leader of the Scottish clan after her father's death, and then has a romance. As a fellow spokesman Snow Leopard said, the film is rather a chaotic start. Some of these are exciting, such as Pickford to beat his brothers in the church, while some of them are just there. For all, the story is weak, especially modified, planned a plot of romance and its peak. Transfers are dark to understand the environment, but even accounting for it, this does not seem to be the best director of Maurice Tourneur. Pickford and Tourneur reunited once more in the 'Little Child,' as a symbol of Pickford as a child.
