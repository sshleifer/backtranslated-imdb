The movie was a great disappointment. Especially since it was told by Priyadarshan, it was sad to see the rates so bad. The bad screenplay (almost nonexistent) with song tracks and bad songs every minute and when the most commonly killed any movie humor can give. some of the events were surprising, but only about 5% of all time. The order was sad. Damaged! in general the movie broke down if the lack of story was very obvious. In fact only a few people stayed in the second half of the movie over time. One cannot miss anything even if you don't watch the film. It is not appropriate to use the ticket money on this film. wait until it appears on TV ...
