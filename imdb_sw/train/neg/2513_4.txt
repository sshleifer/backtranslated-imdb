When I saw this film first, I thought it should be from the children's part - It's very fun and sometimes humorous, and it's really a good story, but it's very difficult "romantic chemistry" that executives like Meg Ryan and Tim Robbins are able to provide. I must remember that Walter Matthau is perfect for Albert Einstein's part, and his performance is amazing, but that's all. This movie seems to have been compelled, the lead did not diminish the substance, and the ... music is ridiculously bad, it did not put me in a very good condition. But if you do not expect a modern text model, good, then this could be entertainment, as I said ... must be in the children's section. Einstein and her friends are a good aid from Tim Robbins' boring, close to the efforts to steal the heart of Meg Ryan. A very resistant film, but as long as it is not taken for this weight it can be a fun film.
