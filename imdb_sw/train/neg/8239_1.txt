This is the most horrible movie I saw. I don't know just how anyone has the courage to put this on release. <br /> <br /> Production rates are violent. There is no deception here in movies. The function of the camera, scripting, acting and sound is crass unreliable. I think there is a plot, but it could be done for 10 minutes to give us time to look at it. Non-neurotic girls in the middle of this piece have no confidence. I would like to encourage anyone to avoid using any time or money on this Title. It's really angry. JDD - December 14, 2008
