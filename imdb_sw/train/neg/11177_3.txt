In what seemed like the longest 1hour I have had to endure for a long time, Al Pacino offers a proper performace to be sure. It's not unusual size, which was good. But his behavior was just sad. One gray man is losing around the selection if we know that the social life of Hollywood has sparked the power of his life. But in this film we need someone to love. And for some reason, each character in the picture says "I don't know why I love you, Eli" for the chacacter of Al Pacino and I couldn't even approach him. Other participants played their usual styles. Tea Leoni, Richard Schiff, and Bill Nunn did nothing to change their man who was created on TV or in the original films. And Kim Basinger was not even in the film long enough to provide any kind of performance. <br /> <br /> The story of the film was not fast. Many exhibitions have never run the story before, but instead of collecting factoids about the characters who later entered into the end of an unlimited fight. It had the capacity except for their desire to build on the story. <br /> <br /> What's the point of film? Daniel Algrant and Jon Robin Baitz will believe "Once the Hand is with you, you can't leave." It's true! And that's why many people are expelled from Hollywood.
