This movie is crippled and not quite funny. The plan cannot be meaningful. Some scientist who works in the science fence opens the door for another dimension (perhaps hell ???) and his daughter gets sucked through it or something, then one day without obvious reason she comes back and now she has a big breast and tend to outfit skimpy (I think the demons in another direction make it for him?) The main character is a boy who wants to marry his girlfriend but he is gay so it's obvious he is more interested in his new partner, and they stumble on this spell book witch (they want be witches or something ???) and the evil spell ends up getting read again which is how bad demon the question of land that just bikini top girl and boy contempt in love you can stop looking. There are topless scenes because with someone in me who my partner says is a special wrestler but part of it is absolutely necessary, obviously they do something just to put him in because then maybe wrestling fans really watch this movie useless. I assure you girls who are not harmed do not hurt there too. The additional features in the DVD and even more controversial than the rest of the film, I thought it could help explain what was going on but actually only made things more confusing. Who are these people and what are they doing? Basically this is a go-camp-to-make-out bus-war-monster movie but there is a bunch of things (like other trends and book seller) than doing so confusing. I didn't like the movie but it was just like five bucks a great deal. I recommend watching it though it was just too stupid, I can imagine any part of the movie that was good.
