Who are the people talking about here? I had to see a different film than you men. I was very tired because I came out of the theater. What it is with these things. I laughed once and even not difficult. Anyone who plays this film must give out the street and be beaten. I often find something I like on the film, but this is amazing. "Slackers" makes "Not Another Modern Movie" looks like classic. It comes up with such trash as "Body Shots", "Con Air", and "conspiracy theory" as one of the worst times. AVOID IN ALL EVERYTHING! I thought the label would give money to people when they left the hall as a sign of their apology, but to my dismay that didn't happen. It looks like I won't see them again or two hours.
