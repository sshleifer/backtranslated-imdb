It is rare that I get this very bad film, this is despicable and this is irritating. It is undoubtedly one of the worst films I've ever seen. The plan, while not a mixture of confusion and uncertainty about flashy editing, is amazing. Why did Domino become a bad bitch bad ass? Because his gold fish died when he was a child and this "amazing" event was emotional, and hated everyone. While the discussion cannot be clich√©d or banal, it is filled with interesting lines such as: "There are three types of people here on earth: rich ... poor ... and everyone else". At one time the bounty hunters have a certain boy bound behind their bus which has a number of combinations of tattoo on his hand. Because of the telephone call of confusion, instead of hitting his sleeve on and just read the numbers, they beat his hand and shoot. Sometimes, a bounty hunter takes a bomb at a meeting organized by the mafia and threatens to put a bomb unless the mafia leaves them! Obviously not going to a meeting would be very easy. Keira Knightley is bragging and trembling for dreadly. Mickey Rourke can save some trust from this mess. I have enjoyed some of the original Tony Scott movies, True Romance being one, but all that I could think of when you had this problem was that it must be done by a complete idiot.
