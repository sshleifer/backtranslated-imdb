The plan is not original. If someone saw "L'ultimo Bacio" there is nothing new. The wealthy families in Rome live a day of life that is both pleasant and false, and everyone asks others to think about them. Really angry after half an hour because it's easy to understand where the story is finished. This is because it is easy to see the economic perspective of Muccino in this film, so even the hard part is common. In summary the first 2 minutes of the movie will be enough and the focus of the movie has already been said. The family saw from the age of 30, I do not like to see a film that seeks to show the reality but by focusing on its ideas has pushed beyond the normal circumstances. The truth is how Muccino keeps the camera to move to gatherings and is the only reason that gives me not to sleep in the movie though always in the movie is growing since the start. Perhaps it would be nice to see the family how true and not to blame something. Morante was bright and magnificent as usual but unfortunately on the bad movie!
