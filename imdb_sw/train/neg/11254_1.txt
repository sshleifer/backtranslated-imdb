"The Captain of the Sky and the Earth of the Future" (an amazing amazing head) is just a bad movie; has no heart, no deep thought, nothing special about it. Yes, the history of CGI seems attractive, but the result is that everything is being hit on a desperate goal. Additionally, movies use music in the same way as, say, "The Island of Gilligan" or Scooby-Doo cartoons - NOTHING. Surprisingly, just awesome. There are no new ideas, either, just buttons and strokes and etc. etc., of the bits taken from the film and past papers. No doorkeeper here, the movie just appears to exist because it can. Save your money and your time. Not even entertainment.
