Who is Bettie? Surely I didn't find time to watch this movie. From what I collected from other sources, Mrs. Page had a need in the second post-world war as the queen of "bad pictures" and that's exactly what this film shows. I've never known Bettie, a woman, though. His youth in Tennessee was a mixture of Christian evangelical doctrines and a good home life that is well known. The film says about his personal life and gets less than the purpose of the film, "naughty" pictures. The characters are brought and abandoned within a few frames but there is a shape after the frame of Bettie in her slow brashes, Bettie in her belt and holes, Bettie in bondage ... etc. Slides of films from black and white with every color Ms. Page visit Miami Beach. Then back to its shadows of gray life in New York we're going. Gretchen Mol shows Bettie as one of many young women who can meet. Bettie came to her friend that she had been mistaken for her High School for A-instead of a person who could only assume that there were only two pupils in her senior class. The most interesting part of this film is how the pictures of "Girl" of the "Miss" page are seen in 2007. It is really sad that seeing a woman going up like a pig on spit saliva couldn't get hit on My Space or You Tube. I do not know if this film is well written or if the proposed editor has cut something for whipping. I would just like to recommend as a source of people who learn the history of unusual clothing clothes.
