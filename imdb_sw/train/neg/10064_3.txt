Pokemon movie was a bad film. unlike the first, this is not the best film. The graphics were beautiful but the story was flat and no real drama was built in it. for the first time partnerships between the characters were polite. left to brock with the addition of tracey was bad. tracey really don't have much to say or do, and differently offers offers no comic aid. The only good points are to get to see the misty really get jelous on the ashes, and the early talking about called her boyfriend was entertainment. generally this film is not suitable to rent with a short movie before it does anything to me or my wife. and we imagine us pokemon fans.oh well, maybe the next will be better.cant ge t worse
