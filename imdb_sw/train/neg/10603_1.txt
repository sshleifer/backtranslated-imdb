I tried to watch this film twice and twice I couldn't do it with the last document. At first I was able to sit through the first series of fighting then lose interest. Twice I was able to insist on digging over hours worth shade, blind SFX and very good direction. Pales in comparison with the original. Anyone has ever heard about an old ETari 2600 fiasco? For those who did not allow me to fill you. It is 1982 ... ET is one of the largest box office boxes at all times ... Atari decides to leave the filming game on their home console 2600. declined a great time and led thousands upon thousands of Atari 2600 ET games neglected in cancellation because they could not even give them away from selling. Is the Universal Army: Return related to this story? Check out 3.2 and make yourself. <br /> <br /> bad movie ... IMDb forces me to give 1 out of 10 because their rating systems don't go down as 0 allow alone in the wrong.
