The fight against sex leads to a life of deception: one as a "happy" married man of ten years, another as sex. Most of the documentary films follow him for five consecutive days and is told by flashback with Nastassja Kinski as a psychological psychologist, listening to his story and tempting him with intelligence. The role of Nastassja is very restrictive and he is the only person who has the character of an adult who does not remove his clothes. If he had, I would like to weigh this great oil film "F." As it is, it reduces F +, meaning that it is still a failure unless a person likes to be bored. It is probably the most interesting to spend ninety minutes to clean out the garage. The "Diary of Addict Sex" comes into a group of films that once he saw, one wants to be one did not.
