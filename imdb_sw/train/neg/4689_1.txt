Very bad video made by professional cinema-turned-director Ted Tetzlaff. Good to watch enough film but for a time bomb of a time without any tension. Ford, like someone who puts here, sleeps sleep though this and his smirk behavior. There are other details that are reconfigured by the Canadian or RAF army, the bombs of war, his wife leaves him - but none of these back-up stories add up. Bomber himself is the perfect secret. Why is he trying to hit these mines? For that, when are we talking here? WWII or after the war? I thought the end that makes the cause of the striker even more. In general, though, just a terrible film. There's a lot of good time bomb to jump this jump. See any part of the "UXB Class" for the most exciting time, about the same time driving.
