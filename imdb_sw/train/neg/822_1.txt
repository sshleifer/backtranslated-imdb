There are two parts of this film. First there is a laughable prologue for a film that is hysterical and a cornball that will almost feel the correct that 'The Simpsons' Troy McClure should be speaking. Then all the film begins (starting with the title of the title that is not quite good with all the films) which, when actually it's the same, is killed by an incomprehensible, incompatible and not just uninterested, but the characters they don't mind. This is especially for the Spiventa of Mickey Rooney, who had gone on a plot with a part of 'organization' at all but what happened had hackman made a seemingly arbitrary decision to take him when breaking out? In that case he would have been absolutely unnecessary and unnecessary behaviors, which will end up yet. The overall problem of the film is that it does not want to put any information on who or what is behind this plot. It is as if the artists did not have the courage to point out that some part of the community would be able to create an organization and instead stay in hope that the lack of clarity would be enough and the audience would have their own conclusions. br /> <br /> Easily, the film fails at all levels.
