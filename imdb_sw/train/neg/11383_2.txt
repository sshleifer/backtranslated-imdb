This is a real "B" movie. They are stupid and often ashamed. The program, based on "doing business" regularly, is virtually nonexistent. In fact, the film is just a reason to push the war effort and show some of the popular musical groups of 1942, including Mills Brothers, Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Bob Crosby, and Freddy Slack. Each group gets on a three-minute level, except that Mills Brothers, for some reason ensured two numbers. Ann Miller cannot play until the last two minutes of the film, and she has little to do but to beat her in the middle of propaganda of the country. The most interesting time in the film, in my opinion, occurred in the section of Duke Ellington. The band seems to play on the train, standing in an unusual position. (South then, the band was divided into rail cars while traveling.) Johnny Hodges appears close to Duke, and Harry Carney can also be identified. At the end of the film, the trumpet / violinist Ray Nance walks under the aisle for the camera and he does "Uncle Tom," buying eyes and rub his head like Willy Best did in many films. For modern viewers, especially the jazz fans, this worship for discrimination is really sad. Some movies may not be visible.
