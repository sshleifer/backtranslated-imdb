I thought all the movies of the cinema would be to see a white white man acting like Chris Rock, and then look at Chris Rock responding to the impact of people. Instead you see Chris Rock himself and people don't know. There are probably 2 scenes in the entire movie where they use their gimmick. This should be much better.
