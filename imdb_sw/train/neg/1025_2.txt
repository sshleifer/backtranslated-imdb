That's the only question that I left. Why was this film very late when it was very healed? Why was writing so bad, leaving the audience totally unrelated to the characters? Why didn't you make any sense? Why the studio to pick up the perfect columns with "Hollywood" hell out all the time needed was good, story story of smart? Why? I have never understood why movies that start good are on a bunch of decoration at the time of release. I hope for Freeman Spacey, who is Oscar WINNERS, that this never is provided with great screens in America. If a person has a Bachelors Grade in Journalism, the whole story is simply laughable. I just ... I think the script was capable, but the action turned out to be a bit, and the worst thing. Just. No.
