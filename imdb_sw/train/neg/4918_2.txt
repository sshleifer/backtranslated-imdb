Harvard's rich dude falls to the poor of Radcliffe very much for his rough father (Ray Milland). <br /> <br /> Documents, sugar, and above all, the news of the war on the 'classrooms' war when the wealthy child Ryan O'Neal brings home a teacher's library to his parents' snobbish. Ali MacGraw is a socially cohesive mouth when John Marley has a Catholic father, but no one in the movie hears more than O'Neal himself with his feelings as Harvard's champion yuppie. Followed 8 years (!) Later with 'Oliver's Story'.
