This film comes out of time to isolate yourself for the time of self-care, promising to continue to be something that deserves to be executed. But it is not recommended. It's flat, independent, without thinking and interesting. <br /> <br /> A series of photos set back and forth do not get the film, makes a calendar. This type of humanitarian celebration of the most famous humanity (“It is really what happened”) not only fails to please, fails to influence, so it does not work even though social history. Clichés mixed with bad acting make this film very difficult to finish, the cause of the blush is fast. The characters are one direction, never going to the extent that the person feels. The director of the director is the most important character in this film.
