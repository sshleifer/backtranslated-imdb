This is a full Hoax ... <br /> <br /> The vivid movie hit northwest India's state of Rajasthan. Check the location of the track - cars are Indian; writing everywhere is Indian language - used in India. Driving in that way is on Jaipur's usual roads. Also the house is located in Amer - 10 kilometers from Jaipur, Rajasthan. Their filmmakers (about the film) in the Bonus DVD seem to make it sound that they risked their lives at Kabul and around. Almost all their operations centers are in India. The area where they see a group of singing around the fire is fake that they did not think about changing to the song of Afgan people. They just wrote the song of the people of Rajasthani. How I know because I have gone to the area in large quantities. They are just on the band car to do something great on the issue. I object to film artists refuse.
