I didn't know how to measure this movie, since it was so bad it was so amazing. I'm not a fan of Gackt in any way, though he is talented, despite the wonderful pseudonym which looks like a cat facing the hair. I always thought Hyde had talent though, Faith is an interesting album. <br /> <br /> But on the people of the topic here. This movie is ridiculous. It is up to the top and odd are almost as part of the usual practical films. <br /> <br /> The movie is not worth the plot here, except about vampires and gangster friends. Somehow, this film was about to remind me of the Spider-Man 3, and how it had so many ideas, which led to the wrong time of one of them. The actions of the actions were interesting. Changed quickly, almost impossible to understand, and choreography which is so laughably bad. Although Hyde appeared very beautiful during practical events, but that's just the film's compensation. I am a good actor of action, but the action was done with horror. Although the last shot was similar to the appearance of this movie that caused otherwise. It continues to fly between music, not a good thing. It wants to be a dance, or do a step, or a panic, or a partner ... what hell. If these reviews grow you, why? Is it because Gackt and Hyde are your love? Do not feel yourself, this MOVIE IS BAD.
