This movie is interesting and bitter at the same time. "Cinemagic" almost gave me trouble. With what they say, "Cinemagic" is not a technical design process. It was "developed" as a result of the accident, and they used it because it hid the fact that their "monsters" had been stupid. Also think it is unfortunate that the author is Sid "Pink". This game is good for laughing, if you are really looking for a film made in 9 days for $ 200,000. It's entertainment; at least I can say so about it. Mice / mouse / spider is a point.
