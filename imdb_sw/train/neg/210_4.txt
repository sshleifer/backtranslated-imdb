Maybe it should not compare, but the Animals' s Style and Style Battle is the original Hip Hop. Beat Street has many of the original Hip Hop artists, but they have been clear that this could be their great break, in fact some was and that's good. But if you see this as the original Hip Hop culture is missing. It has grown more and has a Hollywood sauce. Instead of watching the first two movies I explained. They show grittiness come with life in ghetto. Yes, the rate of this film is low, but reviews are more positive or even raving. This is because although stories, acting, discussions and patterns are all awesome, music and play are people who love about it. I, I like to play but then I thought that electro was the death of Hip Hop (I was very happy when '86 a new generation of Hip Hop artists now seem, such as Krs One, Public Enemy, Ultramagnetic Mc, Jungle Brothers, Bizmarkie a few), and I still do not like most of the beats in this movie and that's why it doesn't work for me. I mean, the Animal Movies does not get a story but music is great and true. Of course the taste differs from that. But if I'm worried, this movie is garbage except for playing and breaking music and so I can't measure it more than 4 out of ten.
