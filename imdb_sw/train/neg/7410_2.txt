I like horrible movies that bring the exact amount of mysteries as saying "silent hill" (which I have seen very good, but still, missing something) and movies that make you think, this I thought was one of those movies. For the first time the movie begins and insists really good and builds a good starting point for the awesome scene, but after it goes down the hill and from there it just grows fast and faster. I mentioned a silent hill because because I can see a lot of "stolen" themes from the movie here. All in all I would like to say, look at the silent hill instead of this, better, more awesome, it has to insist more and also the last is better more .. And better, you can't feel the burst as I did with this. This just seems to be one of those "I like the movie so I'm gonna re-do it in my own bad version" kinda movie .. Oh and something else. .. Lordi .. in the horror movie ... that's like trying to frighten the child and carry the service who "embraces me and I will love you forever" written on his stomach.
