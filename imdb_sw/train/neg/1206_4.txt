Think of this long lost Flick comes available on the web. So I bought a copy. Indeed, of course acting is awesome and the line of the story is a child but it does not have its time. I think people who have sought this also know its backstory. It was made by the owner of the grindhouse cinema for a very low budget. But for me he certainly did not destroy the money on props but on the creation. The forming is for that kind of flick made well. The zombies are wanted and the gore is intact. The only problem with this kind of movie is the quality of pelicule. It's horrible, unfortunately there is no sound on the sound but sometimes it's a very dark way. So you should look openly to see the year. In an amazing way tried to sell this one really not to squeamish. The top voice describes the beginning of the film to look for a sign with a man with a green lighting, which tells you there is a cloud on the way. Of course it does not work, it has made me think of the Cannibal Girls, I had an angry bell when red things started. They had an original idea, the girls of Cannibal took place last year. Don't go for the story, go to the zombies and look at the persistent mistakes. When a girl and a boy love the first love takes a bra, then it makes love with her suddenly underwear ... try to do it, or get a little out of the web, ... eat you dead of evil
