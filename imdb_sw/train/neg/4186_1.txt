My opinion is not connected to the political feelings found in the film. In fact, they are quite mixed with mine. What I find is the fact that in the case of the film, it is stupid and without any story of the story, intention or talk. Perhaps someone should tell Neal that changing music tracks that did not encourage anyone outside the audience to decrease is not the same as creating characters who are encouraged to talk because of events created by the author or director. Fraud profiles remain as well as despite the neal Young exhibition. The baby's place is one where the devil plays on the bar of the bar, tones the brave hero, who then finds his way to the dance floor with mouth words for a little song for the heroine, who doesn't know what was done. In some cases these two dreams plan a plan where they will go on the West Coast to search for search? Sorry Neal, stick to music and leave the film to make Steven Stills.
