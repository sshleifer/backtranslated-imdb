The film trailers were better than the movie. What kind of talent and money? I would wait this movie to come to DVD because at least I was out $ 9. The movie completely misses the mark. What could be a GREAT movie for all actors, turned it to B time movies. Movie moved very quickly and fairly when I thought it was going somewhere, almost did it but then it didn't. On this day and age, we need non-predictable twists and closed in the film, and this film was not released. The whole thing about how anyone who is a suspect is good, however, does not know whether it was directed, lighting, delivery of lines, writing or what, but nothing happened. Most of the smell for nothing. I was disappointed in this film, and I tell everyone not to see it. The sound of the cheesy saxophone in the world made the film worse. And finally it had nothing to do with all the film. What a desire.
