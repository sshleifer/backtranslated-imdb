I saw this film in its observation of the High Falls Film Festival of New York and also I must say that I've got full and bad birth. Although it was strange in some places, only real laughter is that there seems to be a real plot to talk and work in certain areas was terrible and timber, especially "Lady Lovely" and the author's voice (whom I had never heard) had A lot of want. J.C.Mac was, I heard, the aspect of the liberation of this film, the real step with the grit and (out of the cast) made just the truth. I am sure of another administration and a strict rule on the lead, this can be a semi-honorable film. Just hope that it is not sent to general release, or if you want a copy, look at the bargain master in Lidl.
