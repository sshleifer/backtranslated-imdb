I do not recommend this movie, because it is accurate and misleading, this story was supposed to be in the Berber area of ​​Algeria, this was shot in the southern Tunisia desert, (a completely different culture, I know I am from Tunisia and Algeria), another feature of amazingly it was the behavior of her aunt, speaking in the French and professional academic, a professional academic French when her behavior should never be a concern of the mountain, so live like Bedouin and that kind of education that the situation is impossible, the area the most embarrassing and embarrassing to the people of the region is "women repudiee" part of which is a fresh discoveries from the author / director, such things will never happen to the Alliance of Algeria ever!
