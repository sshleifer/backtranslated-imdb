Others can say something like "Children of Genius" and its great children of robot or "Dumbo" and its series of psychedelic dreams of addictive drugs will win a prize for the most confused movie that has been made for children. You can say it too, but you would be wrong. Look and see, for I am bringing to you: Santa Claus, the most unpopular film of the family since ... well, forever. From the opening events to show children from different parts of the world singing their concrete songs (by weight, this part is about 20 minutes long and is not associated with the plot!) With an exciting conclusion that Merlin emerges from outside and saving the day (not to mention , he is from Barcelona), this is a problem of childhood for the most favorable conditions. And no matter how hard I try, no matter where the professionals I visit, I just ... I can't ... get ... those ... ocean ... ocean ... out of. .. my head ... head! Avoid this piece of denial if you could escape the whale's sexual hunger during consideration. However, if the hot marital storms and the worst cases of spreading are something to you, I think you should give. But in fact, this film is not suitable for your time and mental health.
