The rebellion of the zombies is BAD. There is nothing great about entertainment. It is lightweight, can't, does not work, and is inappropriate. I've often complained that the original Dracula is slower to my taste, and this movie makes Dracula seem like a fast run flight. During the 65-minute race it looked like 165 minutes. Myth: Safari is sent to Cambodia to find the secret control of mind via "Zombification". One person finds a secret and uses it to make a woman who wants to marry him. Once this happens, it provides zombies under its control for the bad result. That's right. That's the whole story. Over many films, I wanted to know where I saw male leadership. He seemed like he knows. I had a lot of time to think about this. Nothing happened in the film. Before the "zombies rebelled", beat me. It was Dean Jagger. I saw him soon as Great in Christmas White. This is how I am "giving birth" in many films. I am very happy I haven't bought you a DVD of this movie. The King of Zombies is on the other side and is the cornerstone of film making compared to this film. Why it is important, I will give you 2/10. (I can't go to 1/10 because, I believe or not, I see more.)
