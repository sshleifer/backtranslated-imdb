The famous writer Mark Redfield (like Edgar Allen Poe) tries to conquer old penalties and start a new life with him, as a publisher of the Baltimore newspaper, Maryland. However, losing, completing, and refusing to threaten to destroy his efforts. He would also like to restore romance with a former partner, a very high expectations, as things turn out. Mr. Redfield also described this drama of Edgar Allen Poe's last days. Redfield employs a lot of black and white colors, colors, and tricks to create feelings. Kevin G. Shinnick (as Dr. John Moran) does well, to say. Not enough.
