That is, of course, one of the worst films I have seen ... <br /> <br /> The program is full of holes, the story is like a bad remake of the worst films and sound actors if they were reading directly from text for the first time. Worse is Steve Guttenberg. He is concerned with his behavior as he was in the "Police Academy" - the ignorant fools - and that is not good for someone who leads in what is interesting. It is very difficult to believe that Hanson will make "HIS" ten years later ... <br /> <br /> Avoid this as a blow ...
