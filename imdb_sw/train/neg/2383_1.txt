This is a candidate for one of the films of my film. The famous name, a good director (noticed "Die For" and "Drugstore Drug" before this), and he - Uma Thurman in the cast. How can you go wrong? Indeed, that's a question that was hit in my temples for hours after watching this Turkey. They have come up with an indifference to an attempt to be guilty, this is the dying area of ​​the movie that should be avoided at all costs. His key Lambasting was worthy. You have here one of the films that have not been one quality of redemption. Zero out of ****.
