Well, this film started funny but quickly dropped. I thought it would be more than 'adult play' according to the first few moments but then the movie turned into a bad Disney Channel type, especially the run kart that was very long. Alana De La Garza is good but has a Italian fake feeling. The movie appeared and looked very independent with the low budget. There was a very good moment that I would just call the refugee area but this was generally a yawner. Laughter is very few and in the middle. The last surprise for "Mr. Adjusting" is foolishness that has let me become mad than anything else. It may be worth checking if you can use it for free or TV but don't lose your money to buy or rent this movie.
