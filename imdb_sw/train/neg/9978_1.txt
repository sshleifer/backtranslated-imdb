My partner and I were surprised and how this film was bad. After 15 minutes we would call it quits unless we had a desire to see if the film could free itself. It doesn't. I can't understand the features presented for this film. The writing was very bad and was given by some of the worst work I have ever seen. One thing that was especially upset about this film is often when people were talking there was an odd pause between the lines. I understand using a pause to feel enough feelings (like in happiness). This was not a kind of pause - it was only just a bad lead. This film can be better with lower heads, and perhaps the overseas market is better for this film, because then the innane talk and evil acting will not be taken seriously. I usually like these types of small films (The Real Blonde, Walking and Talking, Fascinating and Attractive), but this has failed many levels that I see is one of the worst films I've lived in the last few years .
