I gave the perfect Timecop 10, I have given this <br /> <br /> The story is very exciting, and it has just a bit to do with the original Timecop. Many items from Timecop were beaten, and they put new things in place instead. This story takes place in 2060 (if I remember correctly), but for some reason during the risk is more dangerous: confusion: <br /> <br /> And action events are not something to be happy about, and many of them are not ... just the first is good ... and there are no many incidents of action at all, and all are very short <br /> <br /> One time in the story, the main character travels for 5 times within a few minutes ... no waiting, double double ... <br /> <br /> Briefly: Don't waste time watching this movie, it's not worth it
