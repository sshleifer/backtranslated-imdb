When I was under this freedom of television, I wondered why? Why Dianne Keaton agreed with this garbage? Movie uses the rhythmic lines, which are designed to provide trash for thousands of homes. The movie takes a political agenda for a new level. The movie was useless, and all creditable lost for extra discrimination. It was clear that Keaton had tried to make this valuable film, but eventually it needs to remember the old adage age that you can't call turd. I hope that you have not lost your New Year's Day to look another meaningless for TV shows. Now I know why networks started calling on Sunday night, to get rid of garbage!
