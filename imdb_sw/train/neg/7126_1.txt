I mean, I thought I heard this conversation on the movie, but it was very bad and not a place where I couldn't believe the truth. I was laughing hard for what I had to be badly written and working in human history, I was so worried that I might have a heart attack and die there just in the playground. The area I am talking about, the "hero" just looked at his brother's brothers and brothers exploded out there just feet away from him (the hero). "Hero" was giving "positive" expectations by seeing the sad thing and people were trying to keep him from running the fire. In the middle of his epilepsy and his uncontrolled rage / feeling break says "I am sad" - he said that right? What? I am mad?
