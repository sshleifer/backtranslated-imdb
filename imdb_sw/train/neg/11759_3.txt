For those who want a series of good South Africa's 1980s, this is not the case. That's a historical game. Instead, it is a little fantasy of a dreary that is not associated with historical history, but uses only its name to give a story to the story of the idiotic Sinclair about the African superhero which is a mixture of Jesus, Lincoln, Superman, and Nelson Mandela. there is a very short time to laugh, as when Shaka breaks the cross where he is bound in chains and throws a large slot of slaver. You know, if Jesus could do if he wasn't like a wimp. True, I saw only 98-minute version, but I can't imagine that twice this trick would be better. <br /> What kind of name is Mungo?
