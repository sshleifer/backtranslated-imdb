In fact I went to see this film on the theater, but it's a perfect waste for time and money! The worst job, I have the poor to say, did not help you enjoy this sticky screenplay. Some friends told me to go and see this film, since James Redfield, author of the book, was very involved in the screen. They were very happy with this book, so the movie had to be perfect. Maybe I was so optimistic, but I really hated this movie! It was predictable, too sweet for the fact that I actually left I was vomiting and worse than there would be good! What? Let the world be gracious and leave this ban on disgust.
