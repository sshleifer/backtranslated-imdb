I watched this film because I saw it had Kari Wuhrer in cast. For a long time I have had a theory on it, that she is a talented actress, but never seems to get to prove that, because she is always in this kind of movie under B budget. He is still good, and still tries to act on unfortunate equipment I always see him. This is not different. Movies are often bad and troublesome, but that's not good to be good. George Wendt played opposite to the kind, and so it was so jarring that he gets to recognize for his role. Other details about Mrs Wuhrer. Her breast seems to have been very low since I saw her last. Probably deficiency surgery, or (more) likely to eliminate implants. This is not a bad thing. It still looks good. I would like to see him in the best film.
