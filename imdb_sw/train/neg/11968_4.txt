This is an example of Bruce Willis, schiti movie action. Look for popcorn and your friends. Use it, to save money. It doesn't matter yet. The war is not true. The soldiers are not true. The victims are not true. And why did Tom Skerritt's behavior speak to Willis from DECK's CARRIER? What is it with that? Can't do it from inside the ship? <br /> <br /> Of course, Bruce W. gets a wound injury. There is a common explosion group. If this movie represents exactly the Navy of the Navy, then don't wait for Africa to expect to come and save you! A beautiful attack on the village is very scary. "The front seats for ethnic cleansing" ... as Bruce is looking at the killings happening in the city. So what does he do? He goes into the city on his stomach. Yep. How many died when they were around? Oh well ... the body count was supposed to, I think. And if that African man was very important, why didn't he have a chopper with the elderly and children? Can he say "Duh?" <br /> <br /> Finally, the film was very dark. It's not just a conspiracy, but it's many that happens at night it was hard to do what was going on. <br /> <br /> Buy it.
