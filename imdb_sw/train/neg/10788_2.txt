And the light of light. This film has four big stars, about three and a half jokes and no more than that. <br /> <br /> There is really not much to say about this stinker, except that it has a couple of real bits, most of them are not very funny. It doesn't really work as a romance. Is it like a romantic comedy? It's not in your life. Many conversations are also a way of flat being modern, even very small. This film can be more, especially with a recent view on some of the brain techniques that are promoted, full and quotes from critics. This film reveals an unplanned area for the media junket - all these costs were paid to journalists who almost always write good reviews. But instead of exploring what should be a generation of jokes, it provides every three minutes to this district and goes into the romance tracking of the shadow. <br /> <br /> It is similar to Catherine Zeta-Jones' character - whinny, self-star movie. Zeta-Jones is doing a good job with what he is given, but he is offered without anything. It is a whole homogenized junk which looks very pale in comparison with some of the things we have heard about stars over the years. At the end, it is difficult to understand what made Zeta-Jones, Julia Roberts, John Cusack and a Billy Crystal sign into this damaged ship, which sinks like the "Boat Boat". In fact, if the old joke is going, they should be forgotten script and make it a deal. It is possible to make a better story. So, go ahead and tell us, the filmmakers, what do you have about these stars that enabled them to appear here?
