I remember watching ATTACK when it came out first and got it again soon. Sci fi channel has run worse, but not to the extent. Rpoff's embarrassment of Jurassic Park, ATTACK converts cat sabertoot to dinosaurs. And they are free, eat more as much as possible. CGI is very bad, and beads of head beans say. We get a year, which helps a little. Wait until you see how a mad scientist started all this mess he finds. Other than Robert Carradine, who has very little to do, cast unknown. This seems to have been shot in Fiji. Good work if you can find it. He reminds me of all low-STV styles that were known in the 80s and 90s.
