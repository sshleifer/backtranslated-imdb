Up to this point, a gentle rain was the movie I had a bad history. Imported by this 'blockbuster' from Asia. It has one "star" and is John Rhys Davies. He is a way of varying that swashbuckling, magical jump baddie he is thrown here. Some of these people could not make their way out of the high school high school. No clich√©s were lost in the discussion, and special effects were made to the phone as often as possible. It is easy to see that someone in Asia had some bucks and need to build a car for certain actors who wanted to lose money. Or perhaps he was a director or author who needed a loan. I think it is that any work with this film in praise of reputation <br /> <br /> Is you a great permit and don't see this film. Thanksgivings of one hundred can not use this turkey. <br /> <br /> One part of the funny was not optional. The King's brother appears in the area. King? Good, old, short Asian player. (Bad player.) Brother? Europe's six feet. (Also bad practices.) There is no excuse for this. They just expected us not to see that the poor brother of Jet Li was wannabe Pierce Brosnan in the cheap dimestore "Injun" wig out of the old western movie from forty years.
