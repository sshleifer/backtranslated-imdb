I saw this film when it first occurred in 1978, when I was sophomore in high school. I got a date to see it. I couldn't "get anything," without saying, because the film was so bad! Joan Rivers's work has never been as bad as it deserved after doing this bad, unpleasant thing. In fact, unfunny is not long enough: this film is ANTI-FUNNY! You are feeling like any laughter that might have happened before you could happen. This is not worth checking out of curiosity, or without any meaning being "bad-well." Even the MST3K group could make it worth looking! The fact that Billy Crystal's work survived this suicide attempt is amazing.
