Quote: Pastor: Any person with I.Q. more than 50 would see this film, a host of mind made a good prequel for a modern contemporary modern, yes it doesn't have a blockbuster thrown or a big budget but it's still very good and had me walk for a full time ... IQ more than 50 you say. which means more you have IQ under 50 .. his name is the way of CARLITOS: increased power !!! because it is worth having the first thing to do .. <br /> <br /> all with all of its same movie as .. CLEANING TITLE AND NO CHARACTERS NAMED CARLITO BRIGANTE! Do not explain the film if you don't know anything about movies. but I think I.Q. less than 50, you can't know what hell is crying out on ... <br /> <br /> The Way of Peace!
