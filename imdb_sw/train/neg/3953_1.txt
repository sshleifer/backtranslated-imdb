I can't believe this film was allowed to be made. These people should have drugs and beat them with improper items. They should be persecuted. This film is disgusting. It's nothing but a photo from the first film. Any natural is freaky and does not mean any. It's like a kind of drug. Why, there is placed on a mirror of honey treatment. Also, anything connected with this turd did not have trouble watching the first film, because they continued to call Suzanna Love Natalie's character, during Lacey. I felt like screaming that on the screen, "IT'S LACEY, IT'S LACEY !!!!". I am 50-among 10. MY GOD !!!!
