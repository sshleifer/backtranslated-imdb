There are a few comments here that describe the quantity of this clich√©s for flick - and I totally agree, both related to characters and dialogue. I would like to read about Elizabeth Berkly bad performance in "Children's" Children, "which I have never seen - and its performance here, at a difficult time, can not meet the standards of the worst life of Lifetime. but it may not have to be. If so, it would have made the film out of balance, since there was no deep feeling or charisma - not a mark - in any character, executive, or show. The preliminary care of Liz's original complaints after his tutee kissing in the hall was impressive. the mind, and hell, had an intellectual challenge.) <br /> <br /> (forgiveness of redundancy) The father of a false disciple actually did something worthy of praise in his performance: he was both laughable and quite annoying at the same time , no at meaning. His lawyer was more than a nerd nerve, also unknown in the profession. Finally (and in fact, I was delighted in this part), the police were a collection of non-emotional wafs, that you would rather rely on Barney Fife, without Andy, addressing all the enforcement of law and inquiry in your community. I know that the actual cops such as a slight decrease, the courage and level of the level shown by many characters in the "Laws and Procedures" series, and if - but this level of the level seems to be the top of "Life." <br /> <br /> Finally, I found a kind of "story into the story" of the beautiful and concoction of Josh being "victim" of his teacher. This script's performance in the story was much worse than its overall performance in the main story. This was a success, like going from "F" to "F-minus." This whole scourge would have been resolved - in real life - in 15 minutes, following a true meeting between teacher and school authorities, as well as the man involved. But then that would prevent the next game, and left an empty film in the camera. <br /> <br /> But the author (s) here, found to their end, can do worse. When the situation was finally "resolved" and "right," this was completed every 45 seconds, without any indication of the actions that would be coming in any "real world" situation for criminals and his parents, or if it could be able to find A certain way towards redemption. <br /> <br /> This is a 2 * presentation; The second "*" because it has a "fascination" severe.
