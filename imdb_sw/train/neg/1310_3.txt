The plan is directly an old man who lives on a highway in the boat day of a Witness who kills a child in the forest. Stimulating In order to dig up follows an old man's attempts to try to convince the police that what he saw is not thinking. However, there is a problem every time an adult leads the police to the place where the death does not provide the corpse can be found. Stimulating Drawing has a decreasing conversation that shows most of the film events, an old man living alone in the house. During the film I saw that I was scared twice when a child killed suddenly appeared in front of an old man. All parts of the movie I accept are not shared; I have seen a tempo of very little film. The little talk was not a problem. However, the development of the story and its conclusion, after watching the film, it took too long. I feel more can be done in a relationship, spiritually meet, with a child and an old man. Them in the forest at night without sure of your own ideas can cause certain situations, children are always afraid as ghosts, see the Darkness of Darkness.
