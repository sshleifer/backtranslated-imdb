Great hair, big boobs, bad music and a great pin of security ... these are words to describe the best movie this bad. I love horrible movies and I have seen hundreds ... but this had to be on the worst. The program is a thin paper and concern, acting is disgusting, the script is quite laughable (the best is the ultimate end and cop and how he worked that the killer is just so damn very written), the clothes are swallowing and exciting for the same action, hair big, lots of boobs, men wear cutting clothes that show their stomach (swallowing that men dressed! !!) and music is a waste of synthesizer playing and again ... around any place there is a trashy music, boobs and helpers physically lifting bodies .... and practice is still not recommended to die !! All dancing around this is a very bad film which only charm is looking back on a tragedy that was 80 and having a good old laugh how bad everything was back then.
