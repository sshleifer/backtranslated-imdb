I read a review review here on IMD and I think I will give you this film to watch. Errors. On the other side they lead the husband is beautiful, and other beautiful pictures but generally this movie fails to influence. It seems to be full of its own importance of self-esteem in trying to try something right but it falls short of time and all in the whole picture is an aggressive mess. It is one of the films that have been filmed as a person who can be described as follows: It is a story here: 3 lost are experiencing their collective problems that include mental illness, alcoholism, laziness, loan and together they are involved in kidnapping and destroying. It would be a better movie if the story was more locked in the trophy rather than the failure of the behavior of providers. I thought the female leadership was out of her depth and emerged as an amateur actress. It was a good time, when I had heard I had lost my time. <br /> <br /> 4/10.
