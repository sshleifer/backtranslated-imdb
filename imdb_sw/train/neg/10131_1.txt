Well, I can never finish this question: 'What's the worst movie made ... forever?' It's Flight of Fury, star and written by Steven Seagal. Surely there are lots of bad films, but this takes a cake for it takes it seriously. <br /> <br /> It is a Romanian film made that speaks of how far Romania goes to catch up with Sounds. It also talks about how completely without mind and talent Steven Seagal has been. This film is so bad that you feel a bit of a crash after you look at it and you need to get into the shower and right corner, knowing that nothing makes you feel again. It just opened on the video (I can't think why) and I think the employees who made the DVD had to wear a protective gear and get regular advice.
