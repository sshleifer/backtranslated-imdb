When I was a child back in the 1970s the local field had Children's Topics every Saturday and Sunday afternoon (anyone remembers those?). They showed this one year around Christmas time. Some friends and I went to see. I expected a beautiful movie of Santa Claus. Nilichopata is very dubbed (you can describe) with a wonderful movie. Something about Santa Claus and Merlin Wizard (don't ask what the two are doing in the same film) Satan (a particular joker in demonic clothing is full of horn! These photos were with me to fit my seat. I always met Santa's basket to start with so that didn't help. The boy in Satan's suit was not helpful. But what was misleading I was the plunder of wood that took sled to Santa. When he hurt them with an interesting voice they made with the movement - I remember having dreams about those things! Years later I remember walking out of that reminder more than a little confused with what I saw. My friends were very scared of that too. I just saw the ad for it on TV and ALL those pain came to mourn back. This is an exciting, disturbing Christmas film that might be shaking pants for any young child she sees. Avoid this - unless you want to punish your children. This gets 1.
