"Envy" is bad for several reasons. Yes, there are good improper. That's not a problem. It is that they cannot match and we do not care at all. "The Roses War" was improper but because of the precise introduction we were at least getting interested in their fate, but in the "envy" introduction is narrow, the characters have never been reliable, and the plot makes things worse Ben Stiller is very serious in the role and I am a fan of his work often. Stiller announced that this was released directly to the video and now I can see what. The movie recommends that he is "best friends" with Jack Black, but from the first five minutes we are given a footage which seems to indicate Stiller hates Black. I thought this would have the same kind of relationship (the "Cable Guy") but it has never been, instead still insists that "his best friend" and I felt confused as it appeared to treat Black as, well, "poo." The film program is ignorant but it does not matter, because it should be a story of widespread moral values. Unfortunately the message is lost in the mess. Walken offers good performance but Black is a far-off and irritating link (and I find it very funny). No, it's not a bad film but I still do not believe Barry Levinson ("Rain Man," "Sleeps") is responsible for this - not one of the worst films at all but it can be better. I like Va-Poo-Rize exist - so we can make this film disappear forever ....
