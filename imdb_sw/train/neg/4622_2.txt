It is not surprising this film has never seen the light of the day. The time was open was bad. The Gong show was already "jumped the shark" when the movie came out, so who could pay the money just to see a few censored parts from the original operating show? And the show clips are just a bit of this sincere, 90 minutes of whine and Chuck Barris about how hard his life was as a host of show. What? Did he really expect us to feel compassion for him and his millions of destructive lives? Did he really think we even wanted to know about his life? (Obviously, since then he wrote his amazing details about his work as CIA Assistant.) He thought that the gag of having everyone, everywhere he feels for him will stay clean for 90 minutes? Or the network administrator leads him every time? This can be worked as a plot for a 30-minute period of sitcom, but not like a long film. However, it was good to see Rip Taylor, Gene Gene, and Comic Unknown again (though, to make the movie "spicy," they just included its just worse routines). And if someone else said, this is the first part of the movie Phil Hartman (though it takes only a minute). Remember his name is written in HARTMANN in credit, which is the name he was born to. You can't miss her voice and face words, though she is very thin and younger than SNL days. Ed Molinaro (Hill Street Blues) also has a small section; The first one after leaving the world soap.
