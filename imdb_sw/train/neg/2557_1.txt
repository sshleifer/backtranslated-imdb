I really like the stock movies. I've been the habit of seeing as many as possible. Even the hurdles have been cold as EXORCISM AND IN KILLER WANTS. This is quite clear. I can not believe that the same people who did THEY DON'T WITH DRACULA'S CURSE really did this film too! It doesn't matter as bad as JOLLY ROGER or ALIEN ABDUCTION (which, by the way is very bad). This is just BAD! I mean, I can understand and / or forgive bad or harmful effects on the reserve movie, but this film takes itself very seriously. I hope that SNAKES ON TRAIN is the best. Now that's a movie I can't wait to see.
