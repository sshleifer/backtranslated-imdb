I can't reject the film. There's not much to talk about. It has a good event of an animal that was probably surprising then. Clyde Beatty is not exactly the image of the basin. She is a little bit and not very good. But that's okay. He is the man in that stronghold of the lion. We know that when he cannot take time away from his lion so he can act with his partner, he will come to the island with him and save that day. Someone said earlier that it was a subject of history. Events in the circus are of another day, especially children who depend. I did not realize that even in the thirty years, they went to three skilled students. It seemed like something out of 1860. I think that's a picture of the stock they have. It is not surprising that this has been destroyed. They always say about binding. There are even spells. It tells us a little about the male sexual relationship at the time, the kind of giggly silliness. But if you don't take it seriously, you can enjoy watching.
