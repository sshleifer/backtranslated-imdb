First I would be honest. I didn't watch all this film. I looked at the first five minutes and when I realized I had fallen almost to sleep, I decided that I could be very quick to see if it was more interesting laterâ€¦ It wasn't. This film is a collection of a lost attempt to make a story that has not been appealing and explained in something that will never be: a good movie of fear. Because I feel it is important to say that even a special film will not be good if it is well done. This film is not just and will only keep you awake as you try to look at it. Finally I feel it is important to say that I think this movie is in publicdomain so if you feel you have to look at it more than a web-based adviser will certainly show where you don't need to pay to look at this spoon of cinema.
