1 watched 6/18/2009 ?? 2 out of 10 (Dir-Pete Riski): a fantastic psychological movie about a girl with autism who is tested in a hospital, the power of flickers, and then hell breaks. I am sure I do not know what the goals of the artists were on this. What we get for about 1 and a half hours (at least not long) was an exciting fear / a twilight / zombiefest / movie spirit that ended the impossibility even to the end. Initially, after power from, everyone in the hospital except for a small group of misfits including a girl and her father. There is a common traumatic character, an old man of power, and a tough boy like a lot of shock and, of course, a little girl's main character attracts. Common things begin to happen at different times as ghosts and visible organisms, hitting at that time, and dead as this group trying to escape whatever they have. Of course, the autistic girl is in the middle of everything in some way and I really hate the way they used the girl's problem and said that she was the reason and put it in the hospital where people are given very lame. Can't find the answer to what is going on? Which is very strange, so please try this dog. Unless you want to be creeped out and confused for an hour and a half this is not for you or any moviegoer. What a waste of time really !!
