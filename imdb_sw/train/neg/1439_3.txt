I only give 3 stars for beautiful African pictures. Others were ... very well. For almost 50min we have a subject of conspiracy ... In World Wars, the introductory section continued, oh, about 10min? Then it was a real step! This is like: "Let's take a savanna and get on a good sun!". And maybe deliver a message, like "Do not kill the elephant!". Very environmentally. I would like to expect this from the "new film" of Steven Segal, not from this ... Leading guides makes me reflect on the fake sun, hair covered with a very good foundation! And I haven't seen one place where her hair is broken, or she is wearing it, or her clothes are dusty. She can't look like a 19th-century woman! And in the bar, where they are looking for our hero, Swayze comments on the commander that looks like Dracula. Hmmm, Bram Stoker wrote his book and published in 1896, and became popular in the years to come. Livingstone and other observers went to the center of Africa from 1840 to 1880. So unless the action will take place between 1896 and 1900. Houston, we have trouble. :) Swayze makes a good impression .. as short - hard out, but soft and cuddly inside. Not that I would like to spray with a nut, but you get a point. In fact he may have to look for the puppy who was beaten on his face several times. The movie stank. The longest way is getting worse. don't look at it! Don't give it! It's losing your money!
