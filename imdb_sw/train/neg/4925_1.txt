Please don't waste your time. This movie emphasizes the worst Dracula of Bram Stoker (Van Helsing), Vampire Lestat's Anne Rice (rock music and silent Bible references), and Blade (high-tech toys). I love the vampire and novel movies, and there are many out there who are very good. But not this stinker. No sound sounds help, especially because cinematic stations lose magical music instead of "ass iron" some information. I rarely heard any metal; especially was tortured for violins. Avoid as onions and ban.
