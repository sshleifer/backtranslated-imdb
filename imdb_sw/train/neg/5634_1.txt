The post that called this "Plotless and useless" literally took the words I would have used in my subject line. The only thing I could add is "not interested." With a film made by a couple of real life and in partnership with many sexually-sex films this will be able to do what is best to be one more cold winter. David and Colagrande look at the time of sex, and the viewer can also take Valium and do with him. Also, please, women in the audience have seen many WAY who used tampons for their time, and anyone who turns to see Willem Dafoe taking the blood transfusions from his wife's wife needs to get treatment. I think the key of the film (if there is one) is the area of ​​the restaurant where the host explains describing David who fell asleep what the "jambalaya was built" is. (All links of the dish are still different rather than confused together.) This movie is "exciting exciting". All components are there: spooky, a special house, a dead wife, a wonderful violin on the logo, weirdo caretaker who comes and goes as he liked, auto accident and death deaths, hidden characters. Basically every exciting nausea you can think of, but NOTHING comes together. Everything stays there and never includes in a plan of consideration or even an emotional piece of art. In the restaurant, Dafoe passes the "built-in". The expected traders of this mess would do well to leave this exciting upgrade on the video store shelf.
