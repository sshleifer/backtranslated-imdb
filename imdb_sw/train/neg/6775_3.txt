I was very happy to find this movie in the local video library - Cary Grant in the comedy set in service, director Stanley Donen, so far what not to love? It's a kind of film that I am trying to do two things - all the time involved (including some known names) are aware that they had Turkey in their hands, and what is the worst thing about a number of competitions? Still thinking first, but my vote for the last goes to the meandering storyline, before the wordy sometimes celebrates the script, the uncertain voice, lack of consistent and well-developed behavior, and lack of connection between the characters. You need to add an uncomfortable situation but it is understandable that executives were struggling with these issues and in addition they seem to have not been addressed. Often they can't get enough line quickly. Cary Grant tries to show his normal character of beauty and urbane but sometimes it seems to be concerned with the position in its delivery. I tell you however I had been opened when the original recommendations of his character would be paired by Jayne Mansfield indifferent vulgar to go away with the image of Suzy Parker. What would you like about the film? - for me especially the beauty of Parker who also works with the prevention and respect of Kelly Kelly. Usually the film is good looking. Marine characters are very skilled in their uniforms - however you have to ask yourself in the yellow monkeys of the sudden Manchu yellow that offers in their prestigious luxury hotels. Even Grant can't look elegant in it. Returning to the credit side, Ray Walston is doing a pleasant job with his character and I was eager to hear Heroes before Hogan's Werner Klemperer said without a German concept!
