I had no doubt that the movie would be bad. I am a fan of Duke from behind. Have three years of TV series on DVD. Well I was right. You took the family to see it. I longed to see the General jump again and some flying jumps were good. But considering, the film was the lowest version of the TV show. Jessica Simpson was bitter. While I can honestly say the original Daisy clothing was revealing, Jessica Simpson's commentary of Daisy was very bad. Sorrel Booke and Denver Pyle should be still moving into their graves. Don't lose your money. If you are an old pilot and true fan if I and my three children will be very disappointed.
