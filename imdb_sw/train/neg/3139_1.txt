First, as a long-term Titanic disaster and a member of several Titanic clubs, I feel the right to comment on the film. I don't care how many awards and show that the film has won, but I'm still a very bad movie. Cameron had the resources to make 'accurate' movie film disaster disaster but unfortunately chose to turn that po-faced with mushroom will. The fact that many people all over the world had fallen so only shows, in my mind, the sad state of taste and common sense that the critics of the film and audience have these days. Anyone said that all movies should have a hero and heroine falling in love? In fact many real events are nothing but romantic and the Titanic disaster was certainly not one. I feel that it is needed the best script and director of semi-memory and as a small artistic license possible. I lost in the last sequence where 'dead' lovers meet among other lost passengers and workers who shout. What? Is this an intelligent film? Ask yourself.
