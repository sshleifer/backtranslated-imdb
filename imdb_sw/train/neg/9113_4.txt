They had the same ability of this film and they fall completely. In the first Investment constraints, we are left to wonder what motivated the leading people to be the way they have and act as they do. There is virtually no development of any character in this prequel. It is really a sad story but this film did nothing for you. It was as if they left a good writing instead of non-f f. And the latter makes absolutely no meaning and does not explain anything. Writing was very bad. Another thing that misled me was that they used it in 3 renting of the same lines that were original. Such as "under the boy", or the kissing area, and a few others that I can't remember. I was not impressed with Robin's acting, but Amy did a good job. That is about the only thing that matched this film.
