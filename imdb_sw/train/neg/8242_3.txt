After just checking FIVE ACROSS clock, I gotta be honest ... I just didn't like it. I had read a very good review on this film, but I just didn't get where these comments came, I have had a lot of time for new arrivals to films, and I am sure the directors will do well for themselves but the budget they had was a major problem, there were two cameras used on the entire film (which was the same) but it seemed like a cheap camera. Another problem was a voice, you get all these girls screaming and shouting all at once, all talking about each other - it's impossible to hear what they are saying. It had a good idea to go, in short, to fasten a car that has been reinforced then leave, shortly after they are driven by a car, which is led by a mad lady, who wants to kill them, and has many opportunities to do so! ... and on the other hand girls have many opportunities to avoid, but not! <br /> <br /> Very excitingâ€¦ I'm just hitting through this one!
