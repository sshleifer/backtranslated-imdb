This film has successfully demonstrated what we all know already, basketball players exploit everything rather than playing basketball. Especially cut and act. I can't even begin to describe how this movie is so bad. First of all, is it just me, or is it the youngest child ever seen? I mean, his teeth can be used as an opener. Secondly, why does a professional want to work in the music industry while, even though he has magical powers, he tries to make music? Third, I have read the Bible. In any way or form did not say that Jesus worked. Fourth, what is involved with special crappy effects? I assure you that any young person with a nerne and computer accessory can do better than that. Fifth, why did the end explode? And what is hell? And finally, anyone who has created a dream known as Kazaamu needs to be thrown away from the plane and enter the Eiffel tower, because this movie takes the word "suck" to a completely new level.
