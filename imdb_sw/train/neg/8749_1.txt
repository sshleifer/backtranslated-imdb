The bad movie as everyone has said. What made me laugh is seen coming with Scott McNealy, giving a prize for one of the programmers killers in front of the SUN wall logos. McNealy is the CEO of SUN Microsystem, a company that identifies itself to Microsoft's hate. They have been useful in deleting antitrust complaints against Microsoft. So, they were foolish to think this bad movie would add fuel to the fire? <br /> No public record I see the SUN participation, but clearly the creators of this film know Scott McNealy. Secret interesting.
