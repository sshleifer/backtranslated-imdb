He was persuading the world that he was not ... This is a possible line of memory by many people. It is from ordinary victims in fact related to Kaiser Gold. I mean Sose .. <br /> <br /> I have had another such as: - the worst trick director emerged was trying to convince viewers he really had storyline- <br> /> <br /> This movie is one of the most sad and sad pieces of films I have seen for a long time. It starts very well, with the most amazing movies, good acting and very good premise. But alas, the only way this film is dominated is in the course of destruction. And it does, not just one blow but with a little hand. <br /> <br /> Listen to this comment here that is wondering because it found a way to describe this donut. And booze enough in my brain I would be able to describe the existence of mankind at a very sufficient rate. I have seen and read about twelve different ways quite the people described the story. And it differs from a well-designed story, playing chess and soul, through the trick of criminals to beat his enemies in a similar way to gaming chess. And all of these are screaming. But at the same time it is a pain that there is something very wrong with this story. And apart from this, it is by no means the failure of far away from the cinema and books such as "Fighting, Kill Without, Casino, Responsible Suspects, Toddlers, Magnolia and Shachnovelle." And we can't deal with a good borrowing situation here, it's anonymous theft. <br /> <br /> What eventually goes wrong here on this film is that the storyline spinning like a drunk bumper for speed.If this movie was a flight run, you would like to fall into a nearby and short drive after leaving. This film that will not be solved, that if it were dinner, you would need to supply the life of buckets of nausea after drinking. There is nothing to be told and when you get to know the direction you think you are going, you get pulled again. I think this story did not go anywhere on the paper and Ritchy should have thought that it was amazing to make it a movie, for David Lynch or something else. f / w 1/10 f or violate one's own work (Ritchy: search for professional help). What could be a gem easily rather than a piece of art, organized pseudo food to negotiate in the debate clubs. Spare your soul and stomach, avoid at all costs!
