When I saw the first film on the movie 11 years ago, I liked it. I still think leading and movies are best, as well as music. But it's actually a script that has more than when it started to bother me more and more. I see the writing of Emma Thompson infiltrating and lacking faith in the original book; she has reduced Marianne's behavior on the side, the second fiddle to her very old age, Elinor very sharp - she in the movie is given many kinds of "time to consider", and often seems to be there just to show Thompson herself. I understand to reject several characters from the book, but to stop one place that Willoughby in this book has been redeemed? For the red person who loved the book before the film, these things are always hard to dig. <br /> <br /> For characters, I would like Kate Winslet as Marianne. He is not given the best script in the world to work with but still pulls you gently, without many emotions. Alan Rickman is a good, little, perhaps, but plays a role in beauty. With Elizabeth Spriggs, she is quite amazing as always.
