I'm not usually walking out of the film, but half I did. This movie promised something different, but I kept thinking I didn't see it before? Attention to Spoiler! After 1, a spaceship attack on the earth, well, many years later, with an adult grown on the board even a little, this thing can still burn and fall! What, this advanced civilization can not be seen to develop gear landing? For the industry which is very independent, we get to see another movie of Woody Allen, no black please! Superman runs around to save people, making sure that he serves Europe and America, do not enter the darkie sites please. Maybe I could have this stomach about 30 years ago, but now.
