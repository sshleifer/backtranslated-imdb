HERA Priyadarshan of HERA PHERI was a good comedy for this film however it is not good story but it's absolutely fantastic but it is not well worth it. has 2 interesting scenes such as Akshay and John welcome Neha for lunch and another while Paresh enters <br /> <br /> The first half gets boring slowly but the second half is funnier though it's not a script. /> Jokes are funny though someone is wondering how they are not listening to everyone's voice from inside the rooms? <br /> <br /> The peak mix is ​​treated as a game but it is quite funny But the film ends suddenly <br /> <br /> Trends is the same Music is good. <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar adds more to His part which has now become his second skin, but this is his perfect film and encompasses everyone! and Nargis, Daisy and Neetu (Ne alone alone appears now) is a good place but also very often Manoj Joshi is the same
