I am a big fan of Jenna Jameson, but this film is awesome. At the time Jenna Jameson was married to Brad Armstrong and was the director of this film by Jenna was a star of flaming fire. So, of course, Brad tried to make as much money as he could make him to make this big film film. Now I know why they no longer have great movies of the cinema budget. In the fantasy world, sex stars can act, but this is a real world and they cannot act. That is why there are sex stars, if women are as good as Jenna can do, then she would try to get into the movie instead of porn. Just because your good didn't make a movie star. A good example of this is Traci Lords, when he was a boy and 20 years old was one of the most beautiful women, world women. He made him move to low-budget films and could not act. Where now? I paid 2 instead of rating 1 just because Jenna is very hot, but there are excellent movies that have done then "Dream Efforts". Come Jenna, we don't want to hear you say, like we want to see you having sex. Also, you Jenna, would like to have more fans and more money in your bank account if you would like to make a loop on the film.
