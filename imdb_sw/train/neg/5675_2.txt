Setting in 70 stations, "seeds" have a number of casual murders Max Seed (Will Sanderson), who was killed by 666 people in 6 years. Detective Matt Bishop (Michael Par√©) and other officers hide this secret by sealing the live Seed. The seed leaves and follows the people who have put him in his coffin. Controlled by the worst director of the world (Uwe Boll), "seeds" is nothing more than a hot film on trying to put a decent community envelope and be defeated in any aspect of the story. And he said this depends on real events because if a person who lives in a lightning seat after three seizures, they will be free. This is the story of cities, and it will never happen. Similarly the other disgusting boll ("alone in the dark" for one), "Seed" is just quite awesome.
