I longed to see this film because I knew it was Christian. The director had a good idea / intention to make this film but it would be better. I can understand why a person could have a sense of who believes it is the greatest love of their lives. However, I did not understand why the director made his friends worthless, meaningless and concerned. The main character continued to apologize to his friends when they were what it meant. They had no knowledge and they used God as a reason to explain their behavior. The main character, nor did anyone know if the old girl was divorced, she was still married but they were against her to solve the old feelings that needed to be addressed. His friends thought they were Christians and they should be shown that they supported if they agreed with his decision or not. We often do things in life where we do not apologize to those we hurt in the past and when he tried to do so were all against him. Partly amazing was his new girlfriend who accused him of having a widespread trend of looking at an old friend, when he did something extraordinary to get his name, address and phone number ... appeared to be a player !. he was not found as a friend at all but he was just looking for himself. God is love ... and I think God wants people to be with someone who was meant to be with Him and I feel that the film made a rough injustice by making it seem like God does not care about real love ... just sitting with someone who made a bad choice and. We all make mistakes ... it's all about the action you take to correct. As I said the movie was capable but I was exhausted with one-sided view that constantly have to jump down to the throat audience with his friends ... who think well. This movie was not true for the Christian faith of love but I give C for its efforts.
