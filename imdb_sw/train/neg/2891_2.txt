I am starting to write these reviews during break when I watch the movies. It is the first time I have tried to do that, but I have trouble getting through this without regular rest. That's not because it's sharp but because it's bad. It is almost too painful and impossible, especially when an ex-Brother Ryan (Colm Feore) former ex-boyfriend had been in the shade with passion and pain, self-reliance and self-reliance. This would be the best film if they just left the character out of the story. She does not add anything but mawkish, maudlin, very popular melodrama. Maybe someone decided that if they couldn't make Ryan believe they would just have to worry. The problem with this is: Who cares if the wound is damaged, stretch, immortal death? Not me. The only thing this character is going to is is the fact that he dies, and sorry, but not enough. Eat does not make anyone special. We all die, sooner or later. It does not give anyone the right to expect mercy while doing as a jerk. Two other actors, and actors playing with them (David Cubitt as Theo and Chandra West as Sarah), are much more interesting, and their stories, without distortions to private Ryan, would have made an excellent film more. But it's not yet, and it's time to hit PLAY again. Maybe the big thing is done before the end ... <br /> <br /> Nope. Sorry. This leaked turkey comes back tonight!
