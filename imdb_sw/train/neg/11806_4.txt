It was hard to watch this film and be absolutely right and target since I am a great fan of the original movie of 1944. That, to me and many others, is one of the biggest films made of the film. Recognizing this is just a reduced film released for the film and that many people were involved, I didn't expect too much, but you can't help but compare this with '44 film. The view after the incident, I saw myself comparing what I looked at, and remember how you played with Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwyck, Edward G. Robinson and others. Now I could see these famous actors who perform their famous works instead of Richard Crenna, Samantha Eggar and Lee J. Cobb. After all, I saw it was not as bad as I expected but not a 194 original match. The two main parts of this TV-video were not good (1) the electricity between the two guidelines was lost and (2) that only 90 minutes, they fled the story for a long time to develop a conspiracy, the perpetrators of chemistry among them leads. Crenna and eggs were flat, and not just the match of MacMurray and Stanwyck as "Walter Neff" and "Phyllis Dietrichson," respectively. <br /> <br /> Where this renewal became itself was in other characters, such as "Barton Keyes" and "Edward Norton." Cobb was as strong as Keyes and Robert Webber as Norton, head of insurance company. It was also interesting to see when time had changed, so houses, cars, phones, ordered machines, etc., were all '70s earlier than 40' years. Otherwise, the storyline was very similar, fled. However, looking at one was enough and I would be happy to come back to the original version with all my views of this story and this film.
