The UK 'film film' industry cannot control. There is nothing wrong with writing old novels, but why should they be shown by non-power nobodies? This film drives out of Orwell's hard novel, making it a comedy, innocent. 'Aspidistra' can be a better job for Orwell, but no one can read it and forget its good performances. Orwell insists not only cold and hungry, but the shame of being poor. In the novel, London is a whole, gray, cool, heartless city, and Comstock begging for him to be blast away from a bombing force. But this film shows anything that can distract, and instead builds a 1930 luxury trip to London, which everything is struck by the sun's shafts of gold, and even the Lambeth slums are beautiful and filled with good quality urchins and happy prostitutes. Comstock's poems about strong winds spread across sandy roads are quite visible outside the chocolate box. Anything more is an unpleasant ceremony of the script, the old joke, and the clunking conversation. It is very excited because Richard E. Grant is a perfect man playing Gordon Comstock, and the film is closed by many actors. But it's all for free. This movie made me angry! History of British Writing is something to be proud of its wealth, complexity and power. And what do we do with that? We use the bododies for bland to make it a soft paper, used by people who want to feel that they 'get culture' when they drink their Horlicks and keep quiet.
