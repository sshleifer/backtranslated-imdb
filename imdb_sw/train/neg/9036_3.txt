I can't believe I waste my time looking at this garbage! I did it because Leonard Maltin gave a "AA" mark, and for television movies this is usually a reliable indicator of some quality entertainment. Work was the same, but anyone who wrote it should have refused access to any means of communication. The plan is incredible, the motivation of "bad people" completely do not have, and the cooperation of different family members is infinite. For example, the father preaches that the sense of cruelty to cruelty is BAD, but it turns out to be a "good man" NOT because of "ignoring philosophy", but because he is good and his fists ... <br /> <br /> The only message I could collect from this pap is that the nuclear family is good and living arrangements are bad. Oh, and bad people happen to good people.
