This movie is just bad. It's not so bad that I can't bear to use anything except just a few words. Avoid this movie at all costs, it's awesome. <br /> <br /> No criminal information is made correctly. Locate a lot of slaughterhouse. Reduced weaknesses and editing. No promotional plot. Acting is quite amateur I have seen. <br /> <br /> This movie bomb was clearly made money without regard to the accuracy of the contents. The camera function has never been consistent and constantly decomposes. Looks like it was hit on the video. Really, for now that Dennis Rader and life in prison, I want them to put boys who made this movie in prison too. Overall, do not think about this view. I would like to give a bad star if I could.
