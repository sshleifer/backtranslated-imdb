I am a great fan of the original book with this adaption is just bad. First, it was difficult to determine whether it was a little finger or an adult, which led to a wonderful mix of adult stories and some pretty violent scenes with a little silly duck that continues to give "funny" when at first. But that's not important, the film is boring, unmoving and not true for the original story. It just fails to transfer all the pictures Orwell points he tried to do in his book. O O O O O O !! Don't know they haven't learned anything? Who will be Napoleon next then? Benjamin? !!
