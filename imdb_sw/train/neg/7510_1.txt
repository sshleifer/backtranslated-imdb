Film is a collection of cliche on everything out there. It has no purpose, no goals, no real message. Symbolism is pushing up and stereotyping is a lot and outrageous. This movie cannot resist the temptation to make drama where it does not exist. Each small exchange of words changes once in a long, non-formal conversation that is typical of the classroom practice. Where there is no guarantee of this exchange, executives (no matter how good they are usually) can not help but pay a lot of impressions, aka "add pieces". On the act, put it easily. Redirect no support here. Nothing can save this non-story. It is compulsory, facing a stretch with tears. Inaccuracies in the portaray rock punk with Who, piercings and flashy clothing 90. Anime walk without responsibility, description and reason. Places are arbitrary. This is the Boogie Nights Cum The Good Fellas cum Saturday Night Fever, and meaning and art disconnected. <br /> <br /> Good DP. I will give them. <br /> <br /> Some movies have an error. This film is a mistake of Lee. He sold out, like all others. It was useless. He has no interest to say again. I don't need to see anything again from this (who I will stop joining the name from now).
