I saw the trailer of the film several times in the theater and I was thrilled. It was seen as a typical style of the same as that made in 1990. It also remembered Fugitive movies, cats and mice expelling between Douglas and Sutherland. However, Sentinel is the most fun of the act at all. As I can see, many people say that this is like a TV film. Not exactly. First, there are the best TV movies in this type. Secondly, television movies can be very good at times, but this film is the opposite of having a good time. Not always beautiful and most importantly, the sound of the movie is not good. This is not a step-by-step movie, there are two stages of action that includes tracking and solidarity. It is also not the major events, but the worst is that these incidents are not very much done by the entire film. The things of love between Douglas and Bassinger were unnecessary. Besides, the assassination plot of the president is a story of clich√© in this kind either, but they insist on that. And this is not a cat and a mouse as it should be. Although, Douglas is now very old, he still has the ability to do exciting work. In the film, Michael Douglas can't be like Tommy Lee Jones, for example. Sutherland is the right choice either, because you feel like you look at Jack Bauer and somehow, his character is one of the reasons why the movie as a TV movie, Eva Longoria Parker is a wonderful choice, of course he is also a passive or straight in This film, because he is an opera actress. The movie wasn't fun even one second to me, so I can't get over for a while.
