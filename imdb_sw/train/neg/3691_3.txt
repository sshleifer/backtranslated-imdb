I'm not a big fan of Rajnikant first, but Dad was a great disappointment. In the midst of the horrible story, actions and songs were unique. The story of the story becomes a great gospel. Instead of running to an office like NTR or MGR, Rajni almost appeared to be running as Tamil Nadu of the Guru Guru next. My wife tells me that since this film came out, Rajni vowed to make any more film! We had the first chance that we bought Babu (oldie and Sivajiganeshan) online for an accident when trying to buy this .... that was a great film, which was for buying this dud ... except makes Dad appear worse by comparison!
