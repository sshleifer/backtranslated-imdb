Bizarre take a story Cinderella. Very bad script, but Kathleen Turner returns to the good performance of the mother's evil action. It looks amazing in a certain place, but that's about it. Long-time clothing starts with Elizabethan's time until the 1990s. Quickly to see something interesting and self-sustaining 90 minutes of drivel. If you have a sense of Cinderella's story - I recommend "Ever After: Cinderella's Story" or "Slipper of Glass".
