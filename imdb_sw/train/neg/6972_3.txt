When I first saw the cover of this movie (a huge bug chasing a few nurses) And the name "Blue Monkey", I knew I wasn't in any great Hollywood movie. I was very surprised to see Steve Railsback in this flick of cheese, who always does a good job in any role he doesâ€¦ .... FX is pretty corny, they don't have many conspiracy, and I'm still not sure why this film is called Blue Monkey, for The reason there is nothing in this film to do with a monkey. But coming on people, what do you expect? It is not as bad as it seems .... If you like to enjoy the old 50 black and white movie attack bug, this is basically a new version, without special FX updates.
