This film is the best mediocre. Angie Harmon is funny as a hammer bag. His gentleness of "Law and Procedure" carries in an attempt to defeat the comedy. Charlie Sheen is the only one who will come out no matter in this anti-awesome comedy. The only positive thing to happen in this mess is Charlie and Denise's marriage. Hope that the effort produces good results.
