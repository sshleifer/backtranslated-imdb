The Torture Emergency of Dr Tarr is about a journalist who travels in insane reserves to write about a new approach that he uses with their patients. However, the journalist recently sees that things are not visible, and the reserve is driven by patients, and your doctors in pools. First of all, some of the parts of the film are very interesting and just want to sleep, and interesting places are interesting for all the wrong reasons (Boy who thinks he is chicken, for example). I agree that the story is very good, but the film itself bombs. The music of this film is unusual and like something you hear in another comedy, and yes, there is a place that involves playing chicken people, which has largely made me close the screen. Watch this film for your own risk! <br /> <br /> Rated: R for abuse and dirt.
