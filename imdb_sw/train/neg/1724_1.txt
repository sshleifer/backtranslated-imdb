... and it's this film. I think if there is a truth after living, the souls that have been destroyed are locked up in a bed of worries and are forced to watch this film on the loop going on forever. Well, maybe it's not bad, but maybe it's the worst movie I saw around "Manos, the hands of fate" ... and I saw many bad movies, I don't believe. It is a Bumby movie, a bad decision of the film when it is better (or worse) Something that I didn't have very much about this film is a moronic duo they gave us to a comedy aid. Now, a little relief of comedy is good, but many films focus on the adventures of these two, rather than the "heroes" of this film, who are actually in it for a little time than they are! <br /> <br /> Be fair, Crown International has destroyed the movie by adding bad music and making a bad job editing. But honestly, this could be a bad movie starting, so the Crown could not do so much hurt. <br /> <br /> This is required to be in the list below 100. I don't want this one for my worst enemy. True, it's my kind of B's ​​movie B. It was bad, but I still liked it, despite my rating of one star.
