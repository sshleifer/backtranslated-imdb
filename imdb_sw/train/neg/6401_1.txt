Can I do this until I get glasses? at the very least confirms that anyone can make a film. Talent is not considering. People who opened this horrible bunch of breasts in the world, do not have any talent, taste or intelligence. The target audience should include new staff, and newborns who play with their stool. Anyone else could be very intelligent in the world even getting a snicker out of this film. Includes a series of sophmoric screens which the punchline does not even extend to the obvious. Approaching an interesting time. The joke told it is the kind of joke that primary school children say (usually potty or sexually related) where they don't know what the words they use. You know, like one about the father and mother of the garage. Asking for any form of resistance to resistance may be useless, since the usual acting standards, writing, direction and that have never been heard by creative "ideas". behind this mess. Not to have judgment, but anyone who enjoyed this film should think carefully about their purpose on this world. <br /> <br />
