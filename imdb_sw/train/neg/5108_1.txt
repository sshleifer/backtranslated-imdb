I can't help but laugh people who thank this show as heart and tear-jerking heart. For one thing, it is absolutely true that these people will have a full life after their new home. How can these families maintain these new houses? And what about their poor neighbors? Property tax should be increased after this happens. Further, the noise could despise me. Secondly, how much can there be a real TV show to be? It's practically the same as the junk week after week. We have established a family of suffering, they improve at home, then amazing family and everyone breaks the Kleenex boxes. Do not let you know how the repair component is. The only fascinating part of the show is to see what the house looks like, but even that part has been destroyed by people who are dealing with lies and crying frequently. "Extreme adjustment: Home version" is a show that pretends to have a heart heart but falls flat. Skip this one. If you like a true television, "Survivor" is very good and migrates.
