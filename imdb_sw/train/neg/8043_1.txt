Usually I had no problem walking away from bad films, however this was a special case. This film was so bad that I was sitting next to the whole thing about praying would have one minute of good film to justify the hour and half lost. Needless to say that I had lost the brutality. Putting in a beach house where a group of friends of the university celebrates holidays, this movie faces many problems that are not worth seeing. First, there are holes of conspiracy. Secondly, very few of the C list (I have not called them B) executives can do a valuable job, so all things that can fail wrong. Third, the film's rate is very choppy and a few to see a lot of time to make the construction of doubts is very difficult, causing very few surprises to the audience. Fourth and most importantly, the end is quite anti-weather because the last (put / who the killer turns out to be) and partly because the dialog is just angry. For film loans, it's the only movie that I will ever say is the worst movie I ever gave birth, and I have seen a lot. So, if a bad joke would have been much happier to hear it, sometimes someone who would ask you if you wanted to know the secret it does, it doesn't do as you go against it.
