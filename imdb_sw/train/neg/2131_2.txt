I wanted to see a comedy action with a satirical twist (if this film was found) but this one failed me wrong. For me, the plot was too hard to follow and I lost interest quickly. I feel very close to John Cusack, Joan Cusack, Ben Kingsley, Marisa Tomei and Hillary Duff in conjunction with this film. I will remain a fan of all but just the moment you can heal my feelings on this. One thing I can say well about the film is that Hillary played the character of Yonica very well and I did not even know Hillary; it took me a few scenes to realize that she was. Luckily I spent $ 1 through the Red Box; I paid to see it on the big screen, I would love it very much!
