This is a well-known film in the PBS Frontline vein. The problem is, Frontline has already made this piece and has managed to bring L. Paul Bremer into telling his side of the story. More disturbing is the fact that the director of the film, Charles Ferguson - who had been thinking about the tank wonk, was a warrior until the work went south. What did he think would happen? The Polish invasion went very well until it was corrupted by Nazi guardians. And that is what this film looks like - apologizing for work rather than the creation of the war itself. Ferguson seems to show that the war can be operated well - as if any war could be better.
