The Broadway of Ira Levin's Broadway comes on the screen without any meat on its bones, a secret plot and only tricks and twists but nobody's worth caring about. The frustrated writer Michael Caine builds up the work of a skilled young man and makes it as his own; His false plan can involve killing a talented baby, which has a Caine wife of a warring bird. The first act that everyone is brought to the best is dead, and Caine doing everything the actor can develop. Dyan Cannon is used as his wife (she is slick and cunning she herself can be adopted as a finger) and Christopher Reeve (the middle part of the film) seems to be very worried in the position of the best writer. These three characters, and neighboring Irene Worth's bothersome, are not known that it happens after the set-up even notebooks until after the second act has begun. Sidney Lumet's direction is surprising and unsatisfactory, the laid-out structure cannot eliminate evil, and the latter is a general catastrophe. Characters are struggling to provide some script substances, but for such a thin material we all see their efforts to service. * 1/2 from ****
