It makes executives at Hollyoaks look like a Royal Shakespeare company. This film is a joke that gives us a terrible way. Turning a DVD player was not enough. I want to get people involved with this disaster and beat them on the face. I won't find that time back. Never. What? How is it possible to create a very popular, boring and common film? I did not think of the action to do that will help reduce. Writing the ten lines is very difficult for the film's sham. What do you say more than repeating how you really act acting. Please avoid.
