This film seemed attractive; I would like to read the book a few years ago and told me that the feature followed the summary of the plot very well. It started to look at and almost from the beginning it could not live up to expectations. In fact, I was not worried to look at anything ... bad operation - the worst exhibition, bad and unpleasant characters once - that was the film's point, I think. <br /> <br /> Watching this film left a bad taste in the mouth and opening me down to the remainder of my weekend. <br /> <br /> Don't worry about this feature.
