This piece of dirt is difficult to follow. The sound is the image of the picture of the picture coming from the good to good again. Things happen to the characters there is no visible cause and disappearance. Is the director suffering from severe brain damage during its production? <br /> <br /> The bad movie to do aside, the story is just bad disease sh * t If you want rape, murder and self-injury are your right to farm. And if the incidents of massacre are not enough you can enjoy the parts of real people who are required. I looked all around but I had to turn off after seeing some of the brains of the outside. I have never seen a film that has left me a shy and dirty feeling.
