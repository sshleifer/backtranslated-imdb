This film was stable, unstable and released. It was typical of the most powerful women. I hired because it was listed as a comedy (that's stretch), and because the newspaper says Andie McDowell was doing a storm in it. He did not. I am gal, I watched this film with two young people, and we spent time in the hour we talk about how bad it was. <br /> Color: TRAINING PLOT BELOW! COMPANY WORKERS! The movie begins with a hackneyed plot about an old woman who is taken by a young man, with a strong refusal to two girlfriends of envy. They want him to marry a teenager who is a kind of love with him. But she is very excited about her transported puppy that she stole them to strengthen, and in fact, she decides to marry the man. But his harpy boyfriend, supported by a loved-washy man, puts a plot to deceive our heroine by thinking that the boy is guiding her. It works. He fights with him, runs out of the house and is broken by a truck (Remember the film title?) So now he is dead, two-thirds of the way through the film. And although our heroine is the head of the school who spends his time looking at the girls, she apparently forgot to use birth control and has been pregnant. He has broken relationships with his friends, because they did not accept. Personally and sad, she decides to marry an attractive boy. Did I mention him as an interesting boy he loves is a minister? He asked her to marry him (good, huh?), But now she tells him he would marry her, and apparently she has no barriers to being beaten around this way. But her girlfriends save her at the altar and take her home, where she is not completely-acknowledging that they were the most responsible for her love of life to get smushed. He has a child. In the last place, they leave it in the pot in her house when they go into the drinking room, smoke and worry. I'm not a child, it's bad. I left that part about the cancerous celebration and the lesbian time of the harpy ignorance.
