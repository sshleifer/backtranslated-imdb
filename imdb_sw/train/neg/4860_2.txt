Fear, fear of the awesome show! Why the Interesting Community decided to repeat past events of this app is more than me. Very helpful! I, in fact, talk about the season after the first two. The first two times were gold, and if I was just talking about that season, this show would have got eight out of ten. No one of the comedians appear after the first first seasons who were not the original part cast are any good. They were, and it's, bad. Comedy is not quite funny. AT ALL !!! The original Casting was filled with highly talented comedians, like Artie Lange, Phil LaMarr, and Mary Schorr (or any other name), who all should get better deals after leaving the TV TV. This show is very large, and is not recommended under your time to open a facility than Saturday Night Live, another awesome show. Go on Saturday night and have fun, and leave the MAD's TV to stay and die, as appropriate.
