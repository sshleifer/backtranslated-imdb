This is a very bad film, and the worst acting and the boring speed of Lorenzo Lamas is actually however! All actors are sad (except Lamas), and no one stops or cares! The film gives us 3 criminals who were required to get dangerous and disturbing when actually there was a boring, laughable and just a bunch of morons that I wanted to be closed!, With it seems to be very cheap and amateurish !. Lorenzo Lamas has a lot of charisma but can not save this piece, and believe it or not the opening was too cold, as it was the last, however in the middle it is very excited, and it makes me eager to push the front button, as well as an interesting discussion very much! There is a cool bar area that I liked very much, but once Lamas climbed into a dock all falls off, with a place where criminals are hurting the family of Jennifer, and they kill them if they are really scared! This is a very bad film, and a bad acting and very bad speed, Lorenzo Lamas is actually however, however insufficient, does not recommend. The trend is very bad. George Erschbamer is doing a very bad job here, and the work of a short-term camera, a bland area, and filing the film at a delightful pace. Work is very bad (except for Lamas). Lorenzo Lamas is wonderful here, and when it does not need to act, he is very happy to see, and has a very good character, and has a lot of charisma, however he can not save this, and he had no chemistry and cast! (Lamas rules!). Josie Bell is awesome here, and while looking well, he can not be very persuasive and did not have chemistry and Lamas. Cheryl Jeans is hot, but they don't have much to do but cried and scared, did well at it. President Scott is as amazingly as a great woman, and he had no risk, he had a language as he was 2. Some of the cast are bad. Avoid in general! Avoid, even if you do like Lamas (like me). * between 5
