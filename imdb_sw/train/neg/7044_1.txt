It is sad to see the beautiful and talented Tina Louise cuts to make this excuse excuse for the film. Tina still seems suitable and interesting, but for some reason it seems to be scared. I can understand her fears; fearing that this third level of stinker will be opened to the public in some way. Also, I am a fan of Adam West. Again, like Tina, Adam looks good and looks good to someone of his age. His work here is taken, but the script is very bad, for it is difficult to even hear the discussion. <br /> <br /> The movie is a deficit of the Classic idea of ​​Brando biker, Wild Wilds; A bicycle group out of the law is out of control in a small village town. The bike here looks like a motley group and I'm sure I don't want them to get my sister sister. Acting is hard and timber, and the story of the story is like old sand. Hell is hell to watch!
