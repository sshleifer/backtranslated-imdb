It is not that I am bothered with the eyes of seeing the blood of truth, but when I put the DVD in anticipation of blood, and what I get is one of the blood shaped (eyeball) in the end of the artificial asinine fake tail, and spinning in the desk chair, I end think "well that's 43 minutes of my life gone forever." I can't focus on this or the Flower of Meat and Blood "movies" as much as the exercise of love; see if you can stay them. Meat and Blood flowers had fewer spots to watch. Satan's temptations did not. It was better, ignorant, and worse ... well ... it's really stupid. Perhaps my expectations were too high. I put a DVD to think "oh man, this is gonna be ill." After looking at the fake girl a thousand times, I was going to look at it quickly. Two types of people will enjoy this film. 1) People who are looking for films that are only available to see how they really were, or 2) horrible completed. I wanted this and other films of Guinea pigs for the last reason, but even if I had fallen into an old group, this film cannot float my boat. As a matter of fact, I would think this film adds a human desire to the person ... such as "Would you like to kill B * TCH ALREADY !!" So in conclusion, the only reason to possess this film is for collecting. If you want a murder that the traditional fear does not provide, Get the Articles of Death. Of course, that also takes, but at least you will get blood and you expect. The only reason I can see for anyone who loves this trick is because they feel they should. There is no artistic attribute that I can understand, there is no reason to be bad, nothing. Just an attempt to get lost is amazing.
