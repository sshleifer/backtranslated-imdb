I was thrilled to see the sitcom which would represent Indian Indians but I have found this to be very interesting. Producers and cast are probably happy to get bad and bad feed back because as they are concerned they get talking! I had been excited and had no problem because the values ​​existed because they are usually true. But he certainly did not have anything surprising about these uninformed characters. Father "pure father", who does not know his daughter. An Islamic Muslim woman (who is a horrible actress), and a modern Indian man tries to run his mosque as accurate as he can (he is a good actor, I just see him getting better). <Br /> <br /> has been given too much and the conversation doesn't go well. there was a great possibility of something like this but sadly I think it failed, and I don't care to look at other parts. I enjoyed seeing the Canadian actor Sheila McCarthy again, she is always treating and naturally in everything she does, the worst of her daughter in the show does not have the same ability to act!
