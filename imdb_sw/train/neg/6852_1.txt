This film is not quite possible. I have seen many cheap movies, especially 'Full-Month', but 'Dollman' is very hard. Much comes along: interesting stories, actors always on the edge of supply and special effects! How long I could talk about them! It's a very bad movie, but it is also one of the funniest. If you are a fan of bad movie movies, you should see it. And don't miss 'Dollman against Demonic Toys'. It's really funnier and worse.
