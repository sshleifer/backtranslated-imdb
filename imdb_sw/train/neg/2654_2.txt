Although the production of this film was interesting, especially Dianne Keaton and Tom Everett Scott, the quality of the text was so difficult that it was impossible for any actor or director to make this film look. My wife and I decided that the reason we watched the whole film was that it was like the fall of the train, and it was impossible to stop. It is possible that we were "hopeful" that the message will eventually reveal itself, and that we will collect the meaning from this effort. Unfortunately, this did not happen. Of course the listeners would be able to “have a sense” of this destructive story, credit for human brain skills to have a wonderful sense. The authors, however, were not able to enable these common needs we seem to have meant to find meaning. It was obvious that those involved were simply through their crafts, and that any inner passion for characters or stories was either secondary or nonexistent. Unfortunately, movies made for TV have been seen over the years. Although contact with the audience may have the primary interest of the authors of the past, modern writers and producers seem to be subjective to their audience, considering primarily providing us with "keeping" through non-standard advertisements that seem to be the only reason for movies such as surrender, Dorothy is made.
