This is one of the hate and cruel movies I have seen for a long time. Unfortunately I was treated with it, because the presence of Donald Sutherland was false to them. [That is the last time that will happen.] <br /> <br /> The character of Lesley Ann Warren was white and white as they come. There were more sensible characters than those killed in the film. That's just one of the many things in this film that made me ask, "Where is Peace?" Why / night / night / night / night / night? Many of these films seem to have a problem with women, and they seem to think of them being scared and killed. This film can be everything as a celebration without being ill and continues in the process. All is about to do is to turn the abdomen of the viewer and his disease, and insult the viewer of the viewer. <br /> <br /> Sent is good for misleading. I think it was that they started Sutherland first, and served to attract others like lemmings into this. <br /> <br /> I'm running for a waste of time, and giving this space to the garbage space.
