I often read reviews before watching the film. I think what, I did not do so before watching TLB, and tell me I was so surprised to see the highest level on IMD. I saw that the lack of a complete story. You are reduced in it (and, sadly, not by saving Private Ryan has left us on the film), and it also has a sudden end, which was very sad. I have to admit, the wounded soldiers seemed to be real to me, especially for a small budget in mind. But prepare to have fun ... Some boys are beaten by air after the explosion as that is an Olympic practice. The mid or air player during WW I am a little bit to me, especially when it has been done many times during the film ... But the pieces that were so laughing almost have been so close to the events. The sound of the shouting and the German shouting ... no strange funny. It seems to be spoken by one of the actors / sounds, because they all have the same sound, and it looks just like the 'German' sound. <br /> <br /> I would strongly recommend this movie to anyone, except for people who just want to have some laugh because of the sad and corny quality.
