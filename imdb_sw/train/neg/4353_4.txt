Risk is a series of comedy that shows a group of boys aged 27 years. I like the idea of ​​the show. That is why it is sad that Risk is not funny, although it has a clear ability. Not enough corky, just dorky. (Haha.) This is due to the tempo's decline and lack of hilarious punch lines. Also some actors have trouble and time. Most registered characters are Kat and Lina twins (Lizzy Caplan and Heather Goldenhersh) but even seem to be just too big for a good show. On the other hand, the characters that I like to be unattractive are the main character Ethan and Duncan and Nicole are using-to-couples. What is troubling me and the series is that only the character of Latino Aaron is adapted to its emphasis (although with a non-respectable attitude, but nevertheless).
