The young and attractive Japanese people have a negative side of the curse again, this time involves mobile phones. Various people die until the broken spirit behind it is all revealed, so basically if you have seen more than 2 recent Japanese fear films you can plan this program in the dark and your hands closed. <br /> <br /> The attraction here is the fact that Takashi Miike is behind the camera. So far I am so impressed with its low key as the Lost City of the Lost Heart, however, as the Missing Way was standing together I craved its envelope known by the pushing of the Dead or Living Pseudo or Cronenberg. Although most of his films have been empty, at least they have such attributes, or at least something to put your thoughts like Tadanobu Asano suggesting for shiny suits of Johnny Depp. Nothing in His Hangout Lost; there is only a bit of credit: acting is bland and moderate, there is very little (no, for all honesty) through horrible or insistent, and in places it is just boring boring. However, there is a time when Miike's mirror as a sense of humor passes through a commercial way; especially for the example of the TV show of imitating the destruction of one of the accredited subjects, and the TV set is more focused on its testing than girls' life. But apart from this nothing to suggest is Miike behind the camera; especially usually its visual flair has disappeared without tracking (and that includes its most popular year), although it probably did not have any interest in the project, and I can understand why. Missed phone is not too bad. It's just an exciting. <br /> <br /> Miike seems to like to lead. With its huge annual output is obvious he can not be 100% concerned about all his projects. But even with this in mind, Call One Missed felt like he was just paying bills.
