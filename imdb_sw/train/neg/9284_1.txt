Man, even the Plan 9 Out of space is better than this movie. This flick is not enough plot for half an hour, but it has been able to extend to ever more than an hour. Jet Li and Corey Yuen are very good, especially in those pictures of fighting, but things like The Legend of Fong Sai Yuk are much better than this thing of a pole that would have better left unmade.
