Weekend Nightmare is a positive witness that some people are very curious to be 'on movies' who are willing to do almost nothing. I have not talked about many women who seem to be quite happy to say they say in this horrible piece (after all, the female form of naked is something good and nothing to be embarrassed). No ... I am talking about those who are more willing to cooperate with a supportive arm called George. Now that's a shame !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The interface to the advanced computer system that makes the revolutionary device (currency currency about the size of the golf ball) that, when inserted, you can change the behavior problems. The quality of Edward's behavior change has been successful in animal laboratories, but a cautious scientist refuses to carry out tests on human subjects, fearing that there may be consequences. His evil assistant Julie (Debbie Laster), however, has no reputation, and uses three beautiful women like pigs. Unfortunately, they all turn to the destruction of destruction. For the underground effects, it completely lost talent, and a plot that is impossible to follow (I have written notes when I watched the film, and yet I do not really believe that my words are correct), Weekend Nightmare is complete with A great tragedy that not even several soft scenes of sex based and touch the gore can save them. it also includes many angry characters that I have seen in a horrible movie: Tony (Bruce Morton), Walkman who is wearing idiot who drives off 80 music in a way that makes me look like Justin Timberlake in comparison.
