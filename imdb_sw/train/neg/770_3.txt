Jack guest (Matthew Lillard) comes to the music player's antiques Max (Vincent D'Onofrio) and tells his friend who is a professional and expert in Jamie poisons (Valeria Golino) that is a brother of Jack. Jamie does not tell his story, he dominates Jack and has locked him up. When Max comes, Jack suggests US $ 100,000.00 to each other to protect him in the antiques of the "Spanish judges" and the rich collector and danger. Max welcomes his stupid friends Piece (Mark Boone Junior), who comes with his lost girl who believes she is from Mars, forming a safe team. However, Jack crosses a double collector and then loves Jack, Jamie and Piece. The bottom budget "Spanish judges" is a suitable screen with a great conclusion that gives us a good idea. Valeria Golino is very good but with a good actor Vincent D'Onofrio, they can't save a stupid story. Additionally, events that are supposed to be funny unfortunate does not work, and in fact they are silly and not funny. My vote is three. Title (Brazil): "Tudo Por Dinheiro" ("All For Money")
