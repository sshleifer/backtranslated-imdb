Uwe Boll has done an impossible thing: to create a game of the game that remains at least true for the game; has turned the game full of non-social content and offensive to a full-featured and offensive content. So, as a comparison, it is a success. Unfortunately, you still have Boll we are dealing here, so don't expect the movie to be really good. when it doesn't have it at the time, "Post" takes too fast to be very welcome and becomes a pain of staying. <br /> <br /> On its foundation, Postal is a satire of the United States, as it was done with twelve-year-old child. Boll seems to think that the breach is the same as the comedic value: the most offensive, funnier, and more funnier spread. This creates a film that sets new levels of no damage when it is done too much and missing. Yes, some husks work but it seems to be lucky. The top pole includes a self-employed director, and people hit a lot of trucks and other cars. Lower Pole includes ... everything else. <br /> <br /> After the first surprise surprise, Post becomes just bearing. Yes there is a good shock every ten minutes, but everything includes horrible characters and fighting everywhere for what seems to be forever. This would probably have worked as a short film, but it's not enough content for something going on over 90 minutes (though it feels twice long). There are good ideas and good experiments, but they lose without endless and trivial events and content that just says for it 4/10
