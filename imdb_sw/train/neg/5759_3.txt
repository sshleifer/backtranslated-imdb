These are the three characters of horror movies and the last hope. This spoof time is mainly on Ring, Sign and Mile 8 for some amazing reason. In my opinion this movie was useless and unnecessary and not funny. I laughed maybe three times and that's not enough for comedy. I enjoyed the first two but this was just dumb. If your joke connects deadly stripes and people always throw things to each other then this movie is for you. In my opinion, if your smart enough to stay at home and save your money and please stop doing this kind of movies, they keep going bad 3/10.
