Eddie Murphy for the best actor? It is a shame for Alan Arkin and Djimon Hounsou. Jamie Foxx (who can act) walks through this film as a zombie. Beyonce ??? That was acting? <br /> <br /> This movie matches the CHICAGO or about any recent music. If not for the singing and great performance of Jennifer Hudson I would have given this ZERO. And no one has ever seen a parallel game so I don't usually Broadway vs. Hollywood Rap.
