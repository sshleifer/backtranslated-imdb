This movie was bad. This movie was awesome. Acting was bad. The order was uncertain. The story was incredible: The comet which appears once in eons installed to appear one night. Most of the population of the world decided to look at this comet. Then, every morning but a few of the people are selected as dust from the comet radiation. People's clothes are still not over, there are plants that are still alive, but people turned into dust. No bones, no. That's ridiculous. Can radiation influence people but leave their clothes and other biological material improper? Even better, the comet touched some people in the meat of the meat beef. Their shapes could not even seem frightening the baby born. Under Clown Posse scares me more ... and they are supposed to be stupid. <br /> <br /> Then there were victims. People who were surrounded by metal when the comet passed were rescued from zombie-dom and death. What? How can wealth prevent comet radiation which is supposed to influence people in their songs? It is also a mockery of the 60-bit music that plays back through the movie parts, or the 80-to-hair hair that doesn't work in the film and makes you want to blow your TV. <br /> <br /> The stupidest part of the movie, however, is the centered characters: two Valley Girls and Chakotay from Star Trek: Voyager. These three characters were not quite sure. Who will take the day after the apocalypse and the mutants of the animal running everywhere? There were four instances of fear of minutes in the entire movie, and many of them were dreaming. In the center of these pictures are non-modern conversation that makes South Park seemingly intellectual. The silence between the basic conversation was painful. I could make the best film with four monkeys and Cheetos bag. Don't see this film, forever.
