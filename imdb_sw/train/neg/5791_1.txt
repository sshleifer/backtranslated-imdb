As a natural filmmaker, I can say freely that this is one of the worst films and natural content that I have ever seen. I would like to find a source of roots rather than watching this film again. The use of humor, non-conversion experiments in the use of traditional coyote stories and the poor performance of the cameras had become worse and the glib of non-fiction stories and bad script. The author and director have shown the worst areas of colonial approaches that depict natural and social people. If this person is a Native, they need to go home and apologize to everyone who knows that they are apologized with local discrimination and a bad sense of humor they have built. If this person is not a natural person, they need to re-evaluate their white rights and ask whether they show discriminatory discrimination, or feel that they are ignorant. My only hope is that Native actors in this film had a good time and at least were paid for their efforts. If you want to see the best American movies then look at: Christmas in the clouds, Dance out, Drug River, PowWow Highway, Smoke Signs ... just by name.
