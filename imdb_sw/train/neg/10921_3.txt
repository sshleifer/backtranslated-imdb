I am making sure to watch the bad films on a regular basis, and the latest sci-fi movies seem to be one of the best sources of these movies you can find. So, I'm sure you can think of my disappointment when I saw Sands of trouble. The act was unusual, contrary to the sci-fi performances which usually saves us. There are fewer watches made by people who could identify more, although you may not know their names by heart. Specific effects of CGI are small, and as such, one of the most comedy sources in the sci-fi feature is missing. Indeed, there are some moments of delightful as when a boy is given a head with a bulldozer, or when the main character leaves his friend to die to save a girl known for several days, but in general, it just ends without you around the floor and laughter, I think that a great disappointment. If I was measuring a 10-star rating that was done specifically to judge-by television movies, I would like to give it 4, maybe even 5. a real embarrassment that I must wait 'until the second sci-fi movie first get a laugh good, and I really hope that this movie is not part of the overall quality in the original sci-sci.
