This is the second UK English film to change Sommerset Maugham stories for the film. All the stories but one from 'Quartet' is not good at watching; and the speech of the executives has decided to "buy", as just English characters before the 1950s could be. In a trio's 'trio' seems to be more severe and more films than the first to deal with the film. One of these problems two films cannot win is that their source material was written 25-30 years before the film. Therefore, for the 1950s Maughm's (pre-war) popularist "minorities" hadithiteling seemed rather, if not fair.
