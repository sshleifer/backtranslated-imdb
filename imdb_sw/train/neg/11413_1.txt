Hardly - avoid this film at any cost. I just saw in the "preview of" sneak "forever" and even though I paid for non-refundable money for it, I came out of the cinema after just 15 minutes. That already includes 2 minutes of debate among my friends if they don't want it. The first EVER came out of the movie and I lived through some of the most beautiful ones. It is one of these films that are known (and so badly) though they are shown in their native language. and more convenient in the book. On the army ("What do we do once we arrive at the battlefield?" - "You come out of the car and die"; in fact, it is very funnier reading here in the form presented in the film), on the drug abuse (a boy eats some "space cookies", he feels very sad and loses his wedding or he has to live a high - all written and acting), for women in the army ("Why do we get a trumpet?" that's it, n the same thing will be ") .... Well, you may find this really interesting, but in that case you are very scared of me. Additionally, I have found it best to make a variety of fine films you can find on European night nights. So there was a joke of the cripples (badly taken), the low-acting acting, had no speed, it was called and edited? Didn't work. At least not at any rate being used as a film test. I would be very confident to say that this flick proves that there are people who can be the most German Zan Zee. And that says something if you like exhibitions. (Which I'm not, it's good to play them, however. Just like someone thinks I'm not enough PC.) <br /> <br /> Instead of seeing this film, do something important. Try to teach crocheting to prawn, paint your color color to influence, tighten your bike, change light bulbs, try to understand the theories of Einstein, change different religions and back - in fact, go and listen to the "final Christmas" and Wham! repeat again. Anything, but don't look at this flick flick.
