This film is a good example of how even some jokes say so much you can go wrong. I expected at least something from this film after seeing the supplement which was as beautiful as hell but the cinema was not a good half. <br /> <br /> The wonderful part is that the joke is really funny, spoofs to ban smoking, Jo Bole ... etc. is really a good joke but I don't know who is playing this movie going on. Principal candidates may be: - 1) Hammer (executives) and hammer (executives) and even kind of funny 2) Director 3) Boy who gave us executives and / or director however if you are really bored and i mean actually see the movie, or else you get a copy of each ad or teaser of this movie and laugh your butt because those will be funnier away than the film. <br /> <br /> ps just save the grace of this film is mahesh manjrekar and funny chappu bhai
