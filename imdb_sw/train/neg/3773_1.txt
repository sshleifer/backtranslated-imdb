People ask you what the worst movie I've ever seen this. It is not close to the MST3k level player, or the midnight appearance on the playground, or even as the Disney center nightclub. The only time I ever wanted to fly on a trip on Disney World (or Disney / MGM Studios in this case) was to grab a Dick Tracey jacket away from the manyoquin, to draw it by coloring, and forbid the clan leaders saying "Eat this! of darkness! " I have never been very mad in movies, even "Professor II: Klumps" or "Flash Gordon". Want to beautiful colors and movies? Not here the baby. The audience continues to say "oh, but it also looks like a comic book", well, to me, its color of Gordito after a few weeks of sun. About as pleasurable as well. Beatty walks around this area walking around and talking to her, herself, and regularly to other actors, hoping someone will tell her when the player will start shooting. To be just, I saw this film just once, but my pain of pain is man, not God.
