"So there is a bride, you see, and she is beaten to death by this statue falling on her wedding day. Then, to get this, a year later, her old boyfriend loves for good love of mind? And then, that psychic A good gets haunted with the spirit of a broken grandmother who wants to stop him from stealing his girlfriend? he will be hilarious! That, I would like to imagine, is how Jeff Lowell, a dreamer who dreamed of "His dead body," presented his concepts to a studio running there in New Line Cinema. The biggest secret is how those bigwigs of the same company can turn the same light to the project, allowing Lowell's leading film and also writing screenplay. If you think that no movie can ever be possible as bad as this natural nature is seen, then you clearly think another coming. The only way that would have worked was if the author had just gone with things and turned into a satirical angle. Instead, wanting to make sure that he was delighted with ease, non-enjoyable and interesting, Lowell makes a half-step move every step, and forbids weaknesses for corporate. Indeed, "On His Body Body" does not really know and it is difficult to know where Lowell really thought he was going with it. Almost every set-up, joke and see gag in the film is flat-footed and badly executed, and even the actors themselves seem to be aware of their trouble. Is it more than describing the exhibition of Paul Rudd's hearts, Eva Langoria Parker, Lake Bell and Jason Biggs in their various roles? I will choose to blame the executives, some of whom have shown their talent in the best cars in the past (which is mainly the case with Rudd). But Lowell and the studio make it sure to have some 'splainin' to do.
