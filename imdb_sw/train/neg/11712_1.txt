The only reason I remember this film is because it was (and still is) a great waste of time and money spent. I was 17 years old and my friend was 18 years old. We were age when action movies were more enjoyable (ok 2 more). We went out emotionally so that we could not see it, we wanted our money back, but when it could never be found. <br /> <br /> The editor is what killed this film. If the truck gets attacked by more and more cars and the rockets of the participating rocket are totally offensive to the audience by having these poorly affected VW 4,000 VW bugs in the truck. Please, missiles in a truck known to have taken plutonium? What's the worst is these VW manages to get 15-18 shots off of 4 rocket launcher. You would like to see the VW and the 4 rockets fire 2 of them, cutting around the truck and the last end, the second coming back with two missiles, fire another fire, then go ahead of the truck and now it's back to full set of four rocket. We just touched the hope of a great finish that has never happened. It looks like they just lost money and stopped. <br /> <br /> Just stupid.
