The King has long died King! The Triad of Caddy Shack Two, Family under Stairs, and Troop Beverly Hills were tied to the worst movies for a long time that seemed to the icons themselves. But there is a new king ..... yep ..... all successful new king .... "Under the World". But other things, like Tiny Tim for example, are very bad is good. Some day this may take a "Rock Web Store" as useless as a religious film. So go see this .... this .... just take my word for it. Go see it. All bless the new king!
