I thought it was proud, especially when I watched great movies and tears. But it is not for this (which is surprising!) And it is also wonderful for me to see how many people liked this very arrogant. There are several horrible facts in movies: 1. Despite guilt The real goal of Ben's 7 life-saving goal to redeem the past, I find it amazing that the film appears to encourage this kind of suicide action. Some people can see this is the action of the hero and others think he is doing evil, this eventually was a matter of concern to me. The video line line is shown more, but logic is much easier. Treatment, a blood type match is required to be a provider of the instrument. Near the end of the film we learned that Emily had a blood type of back that reduced the chance of getting a helper within a short time. However, it seemed that Ben had a normal blood type, similar to hers which allowed him to be his assistant and easily, despite the shortage of Ben's blood, was able to contribute not only his heart, but also his kidney. , his string and his bone mat that at all does not require just matching the blood type but also the antigen of the tissue. Why do doctors allow Ben's fingers in spite of the jellyfish poisoning? I might be more to analyze the whole story as after all this is just a movie. However, some of the shocks mentioned above will hopefully help you focus on your plan to watch this film. If you are going to type an opera sample, go to it. But you are going to search for mental entertainment, do this ipose!
