I love Brad Pitt very much. He is an intelligent actor and witches, without mentioning the face, pectorals and all others. Since I have seen him in the "Thelma and Louise" thoughts have been oppressing me, who reminds me? "Troy" did it to me. He is a new Brigitte Bardot. The difference is definitely true. Male, America etc. but Brigitte Bardot comes to mind yet. He is very good because he is very good when he fights with him. "Kalifornia" "Dogs 12" "Fighting the Club" "Striking" His self-denial reduces humor to make him human, almost found. Fortunately "Troy" will soon forget. The only pictures still with Pitt, half naked in the disgusting place of the sprint will decorate the walls of the fans of the fans to fight. Incredibly, "Das Boot" is one of the best films of the second half of the 20th century. Wolfgang Petersen who is leading this? Well, I think it would be very hard to say no to the opportunity to work with a new Brigitte Bardot.
