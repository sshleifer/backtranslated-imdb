honestly, if anyone has a brain, there is nothing positive about something about this film. <br /> <br /> I lost my $ 1 lease. I would like to laugh at Will Smith saying "If you have a dream, you should protect it". <br /> <br /> All artists should've been bored or had no popularity at that time. even Matthew Mc Conahay * however you say * was better then all actors in this movie, while playing psychologically in the Chainsaw of Texas 4. If you see this film, and have anything to say, you IQ, you must be very low, such a bad taste on movies, hurts. Thank you ... and the truth, he said! <br /> <br /> Keep yourself from trouble. Get the Devil's Rejection, now that's classic.
