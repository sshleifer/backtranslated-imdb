Cedric Kahn films have been characteristic, rather than relying on the point (I think L'Ennui and Feux rouges) so it's jarring to see this series of real car expert expulsion interspersed by some plodding experiments to give the character to Succo. I don't see Stefano Cassetti being an interesting actress; reminds me of the athletes who have missed the movie, like Bret Favre. Empty looking looks like a strong ass found in the head of the head. The real actor would force us to think more about the personality of Succo, instead of accepting his skills in capture. The small task comes mainly from Isild Besco as a school school poor Succo takes a storm. The interview at the police office is amazing of the difficulty of the bland and a little fear of the future connected. Le Besco away, there is little to recommend this film.
