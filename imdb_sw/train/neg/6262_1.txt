I agree with the comments I have read here, and I do not come up with definitions of Turkey like this, but in spite of everything, I can still find the reason for the movie like this. Do you remember those happy days that the video was a successful business, and many movies were made solely for the sake of filling the shelves of a video store? This movie comes out of that time and I can think that that's the only reason that was released and that happened with many, many, many stinkers. Do you remember the "Rambo" example and many pieces of Z class? five, just to get the most wonderful place that the boy was shooting against the heads that exploded because, as you can see, it was made out of plastic. I was not following an unsuspecting plot at all. ‚ÄùBut the boy, the Video age was older than this movie.
