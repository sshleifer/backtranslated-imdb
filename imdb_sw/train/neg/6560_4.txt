"Shadrach" was not my kind of very popular film. I found it very interesting and acting it under par. Harvey Keitel and Andie MacDowell were good but some of the other actors were not completely trusted. I also did not believe that Paul's parents would go and remove Dabney's family, especially when they had a landlord. Their social studies were far away from this reliable view. It seemed that Dabney's life was so widespread. There was a scene at the beginning of the film showing Andie MacDowell from outside the car after having sex with someone. Who is it? Your son? What was the situation that we should show? Why was the area included? It had nothing to do with the remaining film and it has never been mentioned again. It seemed to be free and unsuitable in the story at all. There was a lot of difference in my film. The story of Shadrach was good but I was not sure that Dabneys would be kind and generous as they were shown.
