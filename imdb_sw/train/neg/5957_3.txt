The worst and low fears (haha!) 80 of fear as there are thirteen in a dozen, but it can be considered to be amusing if you look at a good mental state. The only side effects they use, do the bad job and the screenplay seems missing a few important lines! "Brain" takes place in the usual state of the tranquil city of America, where every young man works in the same dinner and where a good child in high school drives cherry bombs under the toilet. It is here that the television program called Dr Blake and its beautiful pet-brain begins their efforts to dominate national minds. Under the "independent listeners" label, the great brain sends waves through television sets and the power of innocent viewers to kill! What is cold? Now, it's up to the young Meadowvale to save the world! The funniest thing about the plot is that it does not explain where Dr. Blake and his beautiful brain comes out. There are definitely records of external life but that's about it. Meh, who needs a background in the film like this, really? This is not a lot of blood unfortunately and the brain "bad" looks like a puppet of the highest size. The most special or lowest feature of the scary dreadful look at the staff and staff who made this film. Ed Hun's director and author Barry Pearson are the same men who performed "Bloody Birth" (pleasurable guilt of mine) and "Crisis". They are all the best movies and wisely decided to resign from the film industry. Of course, the well-known face in the forest is David Gale, who fears the fans will worship him forever for his role in Re-Animator. A girl named Christine Kossak offers a reason for magic and she is open a great talent? He has 3 movies in his repertoire which is "his masterpiece". At its beginning, he was known as "the run of the run" and "3 people and the child", his character known as 'one of Jack' girls. I wonder how she feels about her work as an actress?
