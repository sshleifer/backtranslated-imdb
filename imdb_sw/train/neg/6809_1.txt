Stinko one of the movie has a plan to shop with, be of grace, act under the caliber of Oscar. But for me, one of the worst is the total destruction of aircraft aircraft, and in particular 747. Some of the big blows: <br /> <br /> 1. No Engineer (or even the engine engine run). Identify F-16 links like F-15 (no restriction) 3. Uploading passengers into the "freight freight car" which appears to be available from the cabin - Even if the device was present, put the maximum weight you will make the flight impossible 4. The fragments of the true "do not destroy the birds." 5. The whole landing system was very bad I wanted to blow. SR-71 (all the aircraft) and the pressure of pressure pressure 7. Open the door of the cabin out - into the wind - in the plane !! <br /> Ah nuts, it was a real-lousy movie. The list of less than 10 of the year.
