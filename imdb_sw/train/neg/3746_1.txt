As hard as I believe, and all the bad facts that show out there for the last few years, this should take the highest place for the worst yet. I'm still wondering if this was actually a spoof made by the SCTV group. As Andy Kaufmann was still alive I'd be sure that he was behind this. What? Rock band may drop less than the INXS do something shy like this? Cluster is simple and ethical. A karaoke review group refuses to become a new INXS singer, replacing Michael Hutchence (who committed suicide in 1997). Eight years and no future hits, the band performs the ultimate action by engaging and examining a group of talented wannabes to be a new band of band which is 20 years ago. So they beat all these terrible singers (I thought that the American Idol had its part of the doozies) which makes the show of almost every rock (and predictable) song that can be considered. And then they reject members of the INXS Parliament who speak with respect to the characteristics of each of these candidates. You can see better (and more natural) rock singers near any night club in any city in the world. It has all the most common birthplace features that reflect the reality. Participants of the true participants, the evil interviews, the paralyzed / clever army, "critique" of the exhibition, and the destruction of one participant at the end of each show. What? Do these find more predictable? It is clear the stunt of broadcasting for the band part; The end of hope to strengthen their lost courage before finally buried in trouble. Michael Hutchence, if he had any shred of respect when he was alive, should be spread in his grave. It was not that the INXS had been a big fake, but I did not know that they were worried. If the INXS is a representative of what rock and rock has been, this display will be the last proof that rock and roll are once and for all, have died.
