I finished watching "El Otro". I have been taking my hat off the Julio Chavez show, for he is a good actor, but this film is facing a decline. I think it would have been bad even if it wasn't for Julio. Anyways, this is definitely a film that you will never understand if you come from Argentina, and even if you are, I would like to advise you not to lose this movie so you have a good time with your partner, partner, family or friends ... it's really sad and slowing down, and The plot does not make much of the mind do not. Perhaps the director wanted to show the weakness of the human life, but what he is doing is to impress and impress the audience and events that are shocking. It gives you something to reflect, but not in a good way. In general, I certainly did not have this film.
