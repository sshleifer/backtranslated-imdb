I can be ignorant and say without a doubt that in all my 51 years on this planet is the worst (films of inappropriate children) I have seen in my life. I took my three main children to see and even were struggling to raise a smile during all the 90th chaos. They have to pay you to look for them. In fact it is very bad, there is no other way to explain it. People who made this film should be brought to work by taking money under false lies. Try wrong for my spelling mistakes but I miss so much that ruined my time with my grandchildren Regards, Stephen
