This movie gets a 6/10 rating from me, with 9/10. Here's why: Like the most horrible movie of the most frightening people, where action and gore and events are taken into consideration, this film will bear. Basically it is a family festival similar to what you will be able to see at the Lifetime center, but put in a world of fear. Myths and forms are old, has taken hundreds of times. If you are looking for any authenticity in a plot or small dispute, you will be disappointed. Take the zombies and you will have something like a figure like Mind, walking on cheese. This is 6/10. <br /> <br /> However, the basic synopsis and the idea are good original and on-top. It's really something you and your friends will laugh at when you're a drunkard. . . but the joke was released for exhibitions. The idea gets 9/10 from me. The only reason is not perfect because they could make it even more, but they didn't. <br /> <br /> The combination of both is mixed. I thought it was interesting, but as with many comedies, it was not funny. I had my sister's mother and a little look with me and the joke we made on her were funnier than the scripted joke. There was a time of great courage, but there was also a time of real weight. I really hope that some movies take this kind of high risk and original ideas. I can only say it is perfect, or even close, because of the lack of natural plot. <br /> <br /> A GREAT movie family. A great look for a group of boys (or girls). A great look for anyone. . . but if you look at it alone, it will be a little awesome. Other people always make this kind of funnier of the film and rich. <br /> <br /> 4/10
