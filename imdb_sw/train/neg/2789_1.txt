Savage Island (2003) is a filthy movie. It is more like a home picture of home with very small lights and an interesting acting. It's not just that storyline and script were bad. I don't know why this film was made. I have seen a lot of flicks in my time and those that I hate most are movies that make me angry. This made my blood boil. These conditions were much better. If I made a film like this would be short. True because those of "backjack" have never been in the picture. <br /> <br /> Searches and covering on D.V.D. I am a fierce hunter of bad movies. But this film is not quite suitable. I don't know the movies are being played on D.V. but if you do this make a movie relaxing, it is no longer tired of awesome films (without Wrong Turn). I don't need to recommend this disk waste. If you meet this at a rental shop you go through. <br /> <br /> Movies that make your anger really get one 1.
