The 'Blue Desert' may be able to have half of the most amazing and most exciting way to have the main character, Lisa Roberts (Courtney Cox) was not very foolish. While he is a victim of another attack on New York Road, comic Roberts artist goes to a small Western town. In his first days there, he meets quietly Randall Atkins (Craig Sheffer, playing this part well) who will eventually leave. Fearing his security after being in a state already twice before, he hits friendship and relationship with the village offender concerned, Steve Smith (DB Sweeny, whose behavior does not seem to influence, leaving a lack of trust among the viewers who should be trusted and dirty red-punched by authors). Smith needs Roberts's cooperation because, as he tells him, Atkins is an old man and is guilty of sexual assault. But, the fighters have never been a witness to throw him out. <br /> <br /> The movie had enough input to make at least a movie because enough, there is such a confusion as Roberts should believe. However, a large amount of charges appears to be also forced because Roberts's behavior does not seem to be touched by simple things as we think any intelligent person can. And his answers have been delayed allowed to allow easily and without consideration, especially in finale. Perhaps Sweeny was the right choice for this role; The newborn also encountered ways that remember Kevin Anderson's obvious persona in his behavior in 'Sleep With Enemies.' Or, if Lisa Roberts is written as a powerful character, this can also be enough. At the same time, the film is not all good, even if the low budget targets B.
