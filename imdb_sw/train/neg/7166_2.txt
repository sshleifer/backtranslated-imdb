This movie would be very good, but it comes in a short way. Cheesy special effects and so-so acting. I would have watched that if the story was not so good. If there were more stories of history, it would be better. Part of the plot revolves around the evil witch of Druid who is connected to this woman who gets migraines. The movie grows and continues to never clear anything, it just keeps plodding on. Christopher Walken has a part, but it doesn't matter, just like most of the film. This movie was capable, but it looks like some very bad made for TV film. I would like to avoid this film.
