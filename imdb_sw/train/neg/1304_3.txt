A small budget of the police system of police investigators are trying to solve the murder of a woman whose body is converted to a stolen car in Central Park, and their only clue is a tattoo on her arm. Although released by RKO, this looks like an independent producer acquired by the label for distribution. Members and staff, along with a few of them - among them young and vulnerable Jack Lord, director Edward Montagne and actor William Steiner - include that they do not know at all, and shows. The exhibition is low and can not pass on the high school film training, the direction is proud and choppy and, as mentioned earlier, no chemistry among the leading actors. However, despite the many shortcomings of the film, it has few tips. The New York City area, and the lowest film budget, provides a very legitimate fiction like that of the "Naked City", the greater the bottom of the dark floor is taken well, and some observation procedures are clever. Otherwise, not much to write at home about. It is important to watch, however, to view in the seamier segment of New York City in the early 1950s, and the old-car lungs will be surprising to see the forces '30s and' 40 cars on the road. > <br />.
