I basically found the curve of Eden to be very strong built which was hard to look at. However, there is something that I must say about how the director captured something on the early 70's atmosphere in the choice of environment and clothing. The philosophy of "returning to the world" and the interest of gender and drug abuse that was not so bad, as shown in many of the future 70 titles were the same, as was "not ask you not to tell" pseudo- Christian liberation-oriented- on the beach, except that I would think this was more likely to be in New England school than one in Virginia, where I think the thought of a "good boy" continues even the academic schools like this one. Another thing that I have accepted and that can be considered is that this was when the homosexuality was not directly involved with the skin or flying monkeys and I appreciated other homosexual roles that do not relate to these very neglected images. I heard it was very unfortunate that "gay culture" got some kind of common in 80 of Castro and Christopher Streets and these described the movements and left a large number of gay men who were more than their lives. I enjoyed the film as a way of remembering the most natural way we were on our sex and personal relationship without "event."
