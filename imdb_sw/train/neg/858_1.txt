I love this film! It was nothing like a book, and just thinking about it made me mad. If you watch the movie before reading the book, then yes, it's a good movie. But the King's book was deep and this film was not like that. I mean, the general meaning can be the same type but many aspects of the film are quite different. Last for example! So in the book it is very sharp and Danny and Wendy seconds before the hotel breaks out. but in this awesome movie jack jack as it takes them through a stupid maze ... yes, no maze in the book and no reason for it. Another thing that has provoked me is that jack just kills Mr. Halloran! what he finds, he is the hero of this book and they only kill him if he wasn't important. In general, it was just bad that the film was too far away.
