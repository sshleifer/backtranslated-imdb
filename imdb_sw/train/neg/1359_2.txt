Good cast loses faster than polasses and comedy. Peter Ustinov tries hard here to bring something to life but the result is a caused problem that loses all the best beats that can make it look. Regardless of the positive views here, this film is bad. Poorly led. Badly changed. It's done wrong. Written wrong. You need to sit through one hundred movies to achieve one of these evil ones. <br /> <br /> Issues of a fraud and very good deal Ustinov joins his way into the US insurance company to hack his computer and destroy millions of pounds. The way he does is more than damage and trust (he learns his computer skills once by reading some books, and computer expert Robert Morley going to South America and stealing his identity). The plot, Ustinov romances another partner Maggie Smith, who just happens to be his secretary to fortune after getting flat in his building. He concludes sharing the sexual experiences with Bob Newhart which goes anywhere, while Ustinov goes around to encourage a little bit and try to try one step before Newhart and Karl Malden. Then marry Smith and they fly to Brazil, which has been the last end of almost every comer UK comedy since (Nuns on the Run? Fish called Wanda?) before. At the end I was thinking I must be away from my rocker to get in touch with this shadow. Even came to Cesar Romero did not help. One of the worries, the uncertainty of the 'comedies' I ever seen, and certainly is the worst caper. Don't waste your time. If you like this you need to see the best film.
