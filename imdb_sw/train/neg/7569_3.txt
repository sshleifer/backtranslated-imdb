It is obvious at the time that Axis & Allies played wind games in many parts of North Africa and the rest of the world. It is not the best film, but it is certainly not the worst films of the budget as previously mentioned from Partnership Partners. Duncan "Cisco Kid" Renaldo was really good in one of his first feature films. I really enjoyed the performance of Harry Parke (known as Parkyarkarkus). Why didn't he have any greater responsibilities than me. Played the role of a full partner / partner and saved the movie ... imho. <br /> <br /> As described, this film was part of the budget fund from Superbox-Mart named War Classics. Eight movies for eight bucks, which included some novels from films with respectable stars trying to pay bills. <br /> <br /> This document is ... well, not too hot. Editor and movies are ... more. If you can pass all of that and want to see the future Cisco Kid and the big head that unfortunately never fulfilled its real potential, certainly take! Otherwise, there are other WW2 films. <br /> <br /> -Thunderossa.
