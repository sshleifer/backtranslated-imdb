I am more willing to have an open mind on com com than many, but this is not just a very good attempt. It had nothing to do with comparison to British nature - I have not seen, and certainly I will do. It has a lot to do with the conspiracy to ring, the lack of chemistry between the direction and the performance of godawful / behavior from his male leadership (Jimmy Fallon). Fallon walks on the screen wearing clothes and hair 15 years old and does more than ten years. He is supposed to be the teacher you see, and of course he is known to be the school districts in the world of willing to employ older people than they want to teach. This behavior is very disturbing and it does not mean that I have my doubts as any actor can make him look attractive, but the old hope as John Cusack or Adam Sandler would give them a shot. It is not Fallon, who is not funny, neither does it, but seems to think he is both. Not once in the entire course of the film you believe fall into his role, or believe that there is any way for these people should, or it will be together. Near the end of the cinema there is a scene where Barrymore (who was as good as usual but could not bear this alone - hard to have one romance) tells Fallon that about it, a lot has been done, and he will move on. And instead of feeling bad about the area, or sorry for Fallon, you are very disappointed - he finally does what he should do last months. But in fact the mechanics of conspiracy will not allow it to be its end (which in fact can be reported from this mess), and instead we see a beautiful girl of the job throwing all away after expelling this idiot of infants and encouraging her fraud. His way was to have a gooey and satisfactory, but it really made me more anxious than anything else.
