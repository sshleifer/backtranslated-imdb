No more can I say that this film was bad. The whole Chineseness has been raised to you because of the grandparents were selling hard. But tell listeners that every Chinese knows Chinese history without even learning is laughable only. That's like saying every US knows the history of the US without reading or every Filipino, etc., etc.. Not only is it unreliable. The story is flat out of the secret. Talked about Shin being from a home-based house in China - later to identify from Bejing. However, the early filming process shows the map of Mongolia. I know the current Chinese rule wants to claim areas like Mongolia for himself, released. But it is a different nation and even the texts "Mongolia" on the map. What? Studios Disney Failure 5 Geography of Geography? The relationship between Wendy and Shin is very high, and somehow she feels connected to him. His training is just cheesy too. And, then cut run: everything about this film is bad. Its bad enough to laugh and cry. Taekwondo's action was played and impossible in many cases. The eyes of evil were happy. However, the left end would be the only natural thing about it. They should leave the evil eyes that live in it. But somehow evil is a failure. Yey!
