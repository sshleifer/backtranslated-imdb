I was very interested in this argument. Everything was terrible from the beginning. The comedy did not have any help, the action of the action, songs refuse. Even the storyline had no weight. From the author who has written success scripts like Guru and Dhoom, I had great expectations. Workers worked hard and did not help the film. Of course, Kareena screened the screen in bikini but for two seconds. I think Indian directors should examine how films have been done. They tend to expand many ways. In Chinese films, this style works because it is their signature. But, the Indian signature is a song. Good action of the action must last more than two hours and cannot look odd. But, in the future, I am sure that these action movies will get very sharp. Also considered: the popular and drama films are not confused unless done properly. Good luck in the future.
