Jennifer Jason Leigh and Mare Winningham are a good match that shows many different brothers, but Winningham is the one who can bring something influential or substantial in his role. Leigh, playing the band singer and the Sadie Basin Basin, relies on the oldest to the older Georgia, the famous singer of the Joni Mitchell mold. Perhaps because of his two works as a producer of the film, Leigh seems to have put himself in a corner: it is not believed as a singer and, even if this is deliberately, he gives himself a lot of time on the microphone. Perhaps the hope of a visit-de-force, Leigh is a wire-drawn and nervous and jagged; However, we cannot see any talent in this character (Leigh is a clear actress, but he makes decisions here to get us from him). If Sadie had a little bit of charisma or referral, we could buy in the concept that it gets shortcomings (small) that she does. As is the case, the possibility of he will rise on the stage is small. The Ulu Grosbard director of the most beautiful series, and the final editing of the juxtaposes of Sadie's bar and the outside of the Georgia-all-performing are singing that song - and it's very sad ... but in fact, it is what action? * 1/2 from ****
