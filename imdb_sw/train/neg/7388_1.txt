drss1942 really took words out of my mouth. I liked the original Segal movies and felt like someone alone who is still faithful to him. I saw this movie (ok, slept over 90% through, so I had no end). When I woke up and saw when I was on the DVD list, I was grateful that I was not involved in any movie and I didn't want to know what happened at the end. There was a wonderful thing about Segal's voice and others. Kinda reminded me of Max Max's original where the voice was called, but in the same language (Australlian is English, right?) However, if I had 10 fingers, they could drop right now for this Segal right.
