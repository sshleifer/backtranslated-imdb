This was a rip-off of the trash we were looking at Bob Saget's host during half an hour before this. Dave Coulier thought only that he was funny and it was very much of the same show as America's Funniest Home Videos except the hosts who have shared the IQ's third. Tawny Kitaen should really need money and Coulier had to go to the graveyard for his joke. It was enough to see him imitating the Pope and the other of the printed cartoon begins at the Full House. One dude who played all the jokes of every person deserves to be at the end of receiving A wedgie Grade. Coulier must've needed money to please Alannis Morisette when they were compromising.
