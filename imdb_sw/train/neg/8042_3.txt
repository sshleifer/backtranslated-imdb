The secret is ... this film is beaten. Sorry, but only made. <br /> <br /> **** SPOILER **** <br /> <br /> In this riff rough on I KNOW WHAT YOU DO IN SUMMER AND SCREAM, Beth, played with beauty and Dorie Barton, includes several friends on the journey to Spring Break. The group offers a concept house and tries to enjoy a fun holiday. Then, death begins. First of all, then one of the friends is killed, resulting in sad and dirty priorities and predictable results. One word, Dorie Barton is the Reese of the Poor of the Poor? he looks like Reese, he does like Reese and he can go to Reese on the police line. Maybe they did? Anyhoo, the best movies and the right acting can not really do bad conversation with awesome text.
