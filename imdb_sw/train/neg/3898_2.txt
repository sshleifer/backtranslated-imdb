I am very sorry, I know that Fa√übinder is still called one of the main directors in Germany after the war and that most of his films are considered to be "pieces of the master", but when I see "Lili Marleen" today, in 2004, I know all about everyone he is up and far on this film! Acting is awesome - Hanna Schygulla is smiling as idiot! - The change between Nazi and the fight against the war is ridiculous, the whole film looks like it was done within two days in the hut. Maybe it was that way and many people seem to take this for "real art", but for me this movie is just bad and cheap. Compare this with Viscontis "La Caduta degli Dei" and tell me again that "Lili Marleen" is a good movie ...
