I can't find words to show how completely this film is very bad. I was bought on the promise of action, with Segal Birds and Birds, which makes for a beautiful film. I can honestly say I would like to touch my eyes out with a cocktail stick than seeing this film again. Acting was so bad that it was almost amazing. That story was weakened, and the holes of the plot so largely could fly F117 through them. The script was very bad, if I found that the 10-year-old wrote that I shouldn't be surprised. Trends and production are amateur, I can even employ these people to beat my worst enemy wedding video. Speak out loud. Those responsible for making this film have reduced art, and should see themselves. Steven Segal should never show his face again to the public, I can't imagine what made him star in this, the worst films I saw in all my life.
