This is an official array of '92 sci-fi action action. In the beginning, Van Damme was among the most of the deaths of War Vietnam were raised to become a perfect soldier (Unisols). In this, it is, I think, about ten years later, since Van Damme has a daughter about that age. He now works with the government in the order set up to teach the recent Union - controlled Unisol 2500, for some reason. As always, something going wrong: the site on the site (named Seth - like a snake in the "King Cobra" the same year) goes power-mad, takes command of Unisols, and even allows its computer to become a new body of super -Unisol (Jai White). We look at the next step in reform, people! The Battle of Van Damme has a direct meaning of Unisol (pro wrestler Goldberg) who just keeps on the comin ': throwing the building - it's not good; run away with the truck - no going! Shoot it, screaming - forget! Huge humor comes from how Van Damme is now out and out of class (going even gray around the side). But, though he takes lickin ', he keeps kickin'! Most sequels of this kind are pretty lame - the color of the natural imitation, and when this one surely no stroke of genius, manages to be constant entertainment, especially if you're a pro-wrestling fan.
