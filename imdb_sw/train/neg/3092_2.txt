If a movie like Ghoulies removes Gremlins, then Hobgoblins dive into new dirt to remove garbage as Ghoulies. These non-animation openings have a form of complementing fantasies (which include the characters of romantic characters - oh happy), but what is connected with anything is to think of anyone, except to allow the director to use kinky penchant for rescue . They show this under the 8th circle of Hell, one accused. No real plot - just "goblins - kill!" and a non-humorous attempt and an attempt to arouse audience audience.
