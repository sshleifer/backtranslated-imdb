I often love interesting movies. I am very happy. But I don't get the point of "envy". I mean, it has inappropriate content / topic, and it's not true. Even though acting in general is good, not enough for the movie to get at least interesting. Still Black does not show all their talent on this film. So, if you are approaching a comedy, I tell you sure you don't go to this. Unless you want to be bored, and I see it's not alone with these comments, because even Jack Black apologized for it (see Trivia).
