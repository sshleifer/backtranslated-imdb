"Bullfighter" was made in 2000 but released on video 5 years later for some reason. I wonder why? Could it be: the story of confusion, anonymous conversation by Oliver Martinez, and exciting editing? It should be. I think the plot was Mary (Michelle Forbes) and Jacque (Oliver Martinez) to go on a mysterious road trip. They meet many wacky characters and avoid some evil too. Movie looks good and there are many style, but no substance. Many movies, while trying to have a trick, do not look at themselves for non-responsive development, and special effects of weakness. <br /> <br /> Do not get lost by the lid: Willem Dafoe is for 2 minutes for more.
