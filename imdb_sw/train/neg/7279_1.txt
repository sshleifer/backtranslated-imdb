I have seen this Movie at a local TV station (TV College "Big Chuck and Little John" in Cleveland, Ohio) I have never heard of this film and I have decided to look at it. <br /> <br /> I do not know which parallel that may even come close and help me in describing how this movie is so bad. Script is bad. Acting, better than one of the two things, is worthless because there is nothing in this material that is suitable for any real effort. It looks like a bunch of few ideas, which came out of the various writing sessions, that where they cast into a blender. It's not just funny. The "focus" feature is well checked. Other references where close out of date (even for release time). It is not surprising that I have never heard of it, so bad, worse than anything on Saturday night, the MAD's TV or even in the color of Life set in their worst days. When you see it on television, it is a good example of how not to make a film. Whatever you do do not play a few. Adam / Adam
