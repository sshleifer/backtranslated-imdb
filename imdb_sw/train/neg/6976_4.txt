The beat of Robert Altman, west of Edmund Naughton's book "McCabe" was ignored during his release but over the years it has found a very important following. In addition to the most interesting state of the village town, the characters here do not appreciate much interest, and the picture looks (for the purpose) of brackish and inappealing. Warren Beatard is a century-old entrepreneur who lives in a struggling community outside the city and helps to arrange the first copper; once the benefits begin to come, Beatty is a common risk for a tough city who want part of the action. Altman builds a beautiful, colorful film that gives the audience a sense of time and place, but the action in this small little town is limited - more than a story that includes vignettes - and stimulating Altman deliberately. There are difficult statements made (just the opposite, in fact) and the administrators of languid deserve to each other without a lot of intelligence. It is a picture of the defeat itself, and yet, through Altman-quirky, it wins the pride of pride. ** from ****
