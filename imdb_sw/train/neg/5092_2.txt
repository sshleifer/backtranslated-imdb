Amazing! In 1965 I saw Jury Gagarin alive. He was faithful, wise and compassionate, and was easily regarded as an intelligent and intelligent person. In this film I saw a clown! The actor is seen as a dummy and signs affected by mimicry. They made a cartoon! The real Gagarin was someone else! Don't believe in this film! I saw this film after the movie as "Taming of Fire" and "Apollo 13" and after reading books "Rocks and People" and Chertok and "Korolev: Myths and Things" and Golovanov. I was shocked by the worst situation, the worst acting and producing, and a lot of variations of "Space Race". <br /> <br /> Movie is a bright delivery of information known in Russian historical facts. The fact of the well-known reality of space projects was not shown. Some of the facts and details were corrupted. For example, in 1945 Korolev was already not a prisoner (independent in 1944), and in 1940 he was already not in the gold gold mine of Kolyma, but in a special office of prison design. Korolev was the founder in the prison design office and was not imprisoned. But in the movie Korolev worked as a tomb of the grave after 1940 (because the prisoner has a shoulder belt on the uniform). IMHO, filmmakers do not have much knowledge about this part of history and they can't make interesting movies.
