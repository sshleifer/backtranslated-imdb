Missed train. Invalid phone number. Additional coffee cup. What happens to those around you when you make an innocent decision? Many people do not get an idea as they think of their own thoughts and actions. "Achievements" describes the story of the relationship with the reason-and-effect of the mundane as it refers to the group of ordinary people of Parisi. It has all the features of what goes through a modern reminder, and a complete disposal of unemployment and frustration. There is a deceiving husband, an illegal migrator, tribal slacker, amusement, grandmother's mad, angry girl, a fool of selfishness, and a homeless person. Audrey Tautou serves as the protagonist of the time (for he is on the camera like any other person to open and close the film) with an ordinary girl who can't seem to find the right rhythm in his life. He / she learns at the beginning of his day from the stranger on the train what his horoscope holds. What happens to him during the day is told through different characters. What? Forecasts are taking place? The concept is good, but the story of the story is flimsy. The connection from one event to the second is weak. There is an excellent animation for 15 seconds of independence of Independence Freedom where one sees a good act and passes with one more than two hours of an event. If you enjoy Audrey Tautou, then it can certainly give you during this film, but you will finish it inappropriate and wonder what this story might have been run by the best producer and director.
