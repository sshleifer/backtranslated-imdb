I first saw this when I was about 7. I remembered what I believed to be an uncertain stream of what happened. It comes from now, 15 years later, that I remember everything with great precision because it seems the authors had no more to do a summary of the story. No plot of this movie / cartoon. There is no characteristic development, no story behind, no arcs of character, no. Good people do things because they are good, while the wicked do things just because they are bad. One unlikely part of the car is when a person who thinks is important dies and nobody cares for a minimum. They beat their shoulders and continue. There are very difficult conversations. If you look at the events of combating operations, you lose 70% film. See this because you want to see good animation and for other reasons. Or if you like to watch the red cover of the cartoon (or good cover of cartoon).
