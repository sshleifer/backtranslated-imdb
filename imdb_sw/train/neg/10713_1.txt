Come, let's get real. The Knights of Christ, Ordo Templi, or Templar Knights as they are known most were not even in the 12th century. The story is very interesting that it is pathetic. Dolph Lundgren appeared simply interesting bored. And moreover, if you want to have a real Templar of life, why not just do the Knights of Christ, who are still in Portugal. At least they should consider history. The only quality of redemption that I could find in this film is that the residue seemed like enough to pass pieces of the medieval or Gothic period. Acting was bad, amazing story, awesome action, and props were the same.
