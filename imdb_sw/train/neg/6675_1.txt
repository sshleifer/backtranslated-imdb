This weekend just passed we watched "28 weeks later" which was very good. After that I watched this film. I have told you it is one of the boring which is called fear you can look at. The events were not true, there was no script and no plot. Alien creature was useless. And anti-mild events are likened to the school's yard struggle. And for the worst, a man named Cody had a language that had no control over which he distorted ideas from the main film. Don't forget about this film; instead of going and looking 28 weeks later. Cheer, Mesake C.
