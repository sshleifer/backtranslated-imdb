Considering its popularity, I found this movie to be a great disappointment. Perhaps I expected too much from this film. After all, it is one of the most popular martial arts films of the 1970s, but I can't understand why. The story is not good. It is also a very talking movie and routine routine. My biggest problem with the movie was that the story does not provide a character that I could reinforce, because a well-organized hero is idiot. Director Chang has no sense of fashion, and can not hide the flames of fire found in the details. I know this should not be a high art, but I've seen a horrible movie. Certainly not the best example of this kind of loved ones. His form of worship saves me. I recommend you to break it.
