This movie may seem scary on advertising, but the real movie was the reason for vomiting. This is less than the average, (even lower than that) and does not plot. I mean every house can make you afraid and sure, the dead woman of Japan will tread your forest, but why? Make a film that can appeal to observers and not just show pictures of people who are afraid of hair (a dead woman in Japan). What? Can you say "Samara (Ring)"? Don't make me start with the "dead baby". Yet it's not there! So? He has a cat and he can replicate, a great bright plan! Just bury the poor zombies and save a certain life that has the potential to be harmful to Grudge! 1/10! Yuck! >. <
