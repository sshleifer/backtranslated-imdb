This film was sent extensively: Christopher Lee, Dean Jagger, Macdonald Carey, Lew Ayres - all the b-movie actors. But this low-film did not use any of them for any benefit, and none of their characters even encountered on the screen (although Christopher Lee can play on his own in several scenes). Attributes to visitors in this film seem to change on the tone of the hat. First, they just want to make their ships and leave, then turn over the main character by killing many of his friends and not leaving his wife after they have received the most important part they need. Then, without anywhere, this "peace" contest determines to destroy the planet because it is caused by a lot of "diseases" (although it produces the main character and his wife is a spot in their community). <br /> <br /> Most of the films are used to look at a man and wife driving or walking or standing around or sitting on desks to do something. Almost you would have been removed by the whole world ends, just for revenge by throwing death. <br /> <br /> Unless you like Chris Lee or seven years under budget, I would like to give him this miss. It falls into such a narrow type of lost cellulodi between Star Odyssey and UFO: Target Earth.
