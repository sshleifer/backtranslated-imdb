The 1960s was a time of change and awakening to many people. Social shock and chaos were common as people spoke about their views. Citizenship, politics, Vietnam wars, sexual immorality, and drug abuse were all part of the daily fabric, and daily news. This film attempted to incorporate these historical events into a recreational film, and has largely succeeded. <br /> <br /> In this film, two families are followed: one white, one black. In the first half of the film, the story tracks every family on the same basis through social and family wars. Unfortunately, the second half of the movie is approaching dedicated to white families. In fact, there are more characters in this family, and the lines of the story are interactive, but the same consideration is not given to the tribal issues of this century. <br /> <br /> Overall, acting has been done well with history footage is mixed with color and black and white footage originally giving you a document feel feel. The film is a false work, but parts of historical data are known to keep the time line. I enjoyed the film but the conditions were predictable and the storyline was on one side.
