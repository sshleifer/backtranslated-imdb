Certainly the worst movies I saw ... Can someone tell me where I would laugh? There is no single sign or shadow of the idea. The three leading actors are the epidemic, especially one (I think it is Aldo) from Sicily who can't_in sicilian !!! It is not talking about the inclusion of dreams like Dracula ... just the most important, derived from bad cabaret traditions, to make this "film" continue for a short time. Massironi and Littizzetto do what they can, but this so-called cinema is also very difficult to save. I would like to give it "0" / 10, but the lowest score was 1/10 and so I had to do it with one mark.
