I already know that critics and other listeners say it was satire, there were political and social messages, names mentioning other names etc.. Possible. I can't recognize such things (I don't want to do anything) because I don't care, I'm attracted to 'movies'. As for the film itself, it is also said that the film is wise and very powerful. I couldn't see anything that we do not see in monster movies except the scene that takes place in the office in the second half. Yes, the area says other things about humanity, but it does not make the film more brilliant. The movie is entertaining (gently) and exciting at some time or scenes, but no more than that. As for the great flaw of the movie, it is the visual effects. It was just amazing, I couldn't connect for a while, because I expected a real monster, because not one of the old Gojira movies, it was in 2006, but it wasn't. It's like if you believe that there is a monster, you can't care. If you agree with me on this, I strongly recommend Cloverfield which is very realistic. The design of the monster is not interesting, but at least planned, there is a bid. Very strong analysis. Some critics say about it as a movie of Kurosawa. Yes, it is rather an exciting game or action, but it should not mean that it is very powerful. I don't want to compare Heshi with other monster movies, but I'm trying to say that the Army doesn't do anything that other monster movies do not. By the way, it may be that some people call a film line because of their sympathy for Asian movies. Yes, I would like Asian movies too, but this is the truth.
