Yes, they say the nymphomania leaves you with no sense. I don't know if Stella James (Sean Young) graduates as a clinical nymphomaniac, but he actually has sex relations with men. He still tries, trying to get "more data" so that he can see what he wants from life with men in it, though it seems like when the age should have a good idea at the moment. (I can't agree, however, and anyone who says Young is too old for a role. For him it is, we should all be very old.) For the most part this film left me cold, although it's not the worst of its kind you can see. And unlike the 'Wide Shut's Eyes' recently, at least something happens in this.
