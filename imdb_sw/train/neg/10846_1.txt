Not since Caligula I concentrated to extinguish half of the film through .... but then for this, I had only 15 minutes when I concentrated. Unfortunately, I did all the way through. Make sure you don't. It is not that the Cradle of Fear is awesome or horrible or scary or horrible or sexually. That is not one of those things, however it wants to be all of them. Instead, it is boring, trite, casual, predictable, and without enough hanging (beaten on video, special effects of high school, no sense even basic learning story, sound hearing hearing) is not appropriate to hear , though) <br /> <br /> This game is proof of the argument that even direct distributors to video need to draw a line in the sand somewhere.
