A woman who is ill (Angie Dickinson who is very angry, whose body is taking two times / tightens her fianc√©e) is sexually abused by her husband and decides to go out. This results in a direct result of a string of recent fatalities (Nancy Allen, obviously I'm in the wrong business if she can bring home $ 600 per night) with her psychologist (Michael Caine). If you look at De Palma to end (forgive me, "respect to") Hitchcock, see "Sisters" instead of this. "He is wearing to kill," while carrying knowledge and skills, it is one of the most exciting that I have been angry to stay. The plan is wonderful and tired. It makes some of the incredible flying events and the evil demonstration of graphic killings that should enjoy any fan of fear, as long as they can pass the line of silly stories, which must be written even in 1980.
