Wow. I went to the video store tonight because I had a bad movie of B Horror and I've got this Gem. I looked at the lid and I thought it looked like a movie just for my feelings. I brought home and put it. This game was not a B Horror movie that I had. This was worse. I wanted a bad movie but I was given it, I didn't know that such a trick was there among a man. This was seen as a 5-year-old writing and referencing which is good about it. I am a preferred director and this film has made me so much that someone out there pays this person a direct film. She needs to work on a waste cotton waste that belongs to her. <br /> <br /> If you think about this rental or purchase. I will tell you one thing that I will tell someone to prepare for suicide. "Don't do that, not work!" I have nothing good to say about this movie. Don't do it!
