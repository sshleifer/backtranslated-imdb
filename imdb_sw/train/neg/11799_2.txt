This could be a good place but I just needed to turn it off. Britain's representation was awesome to watch. Have the creators ever put foot in the UK before imaging the movie? At least put foot in the UK? I don't think anyone in the UK has had the same feeling without skit the comedy of the Royal Family! Also with English boys 2 ... well I don't think any English boy has done, said or dressed like any English child in the history of the British nation since the public appearance of Prince William and Harry. For filmmakers in the United States. There are more than 1 country in the UK. England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland .. means more than 1 culture! I can deal with humor but this was so bad I couldn't look at it. The fire seemed to be cold yet!
