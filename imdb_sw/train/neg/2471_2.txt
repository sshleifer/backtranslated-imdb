I remember back when I was young when I was off camp and we love camp under the stars. There was a man there who would always have a good story to tell which was about the trees around us and always going to me. Well, when I got Wendigo in the library, I looked at it with the hope of being one of those films that had a common sense of attraction in the forests as well as camped stories. Well, I had a lot of trouble, I was away from the truth. Wendigo is very bad. The story begins when the family of three runs on their winter cabin, which looks like your ordinary home town and nothing like cabin in the forest, and it enters into the pig. In fact, it seems that few of the area were playing this hunting and were very interesting to our city people. The movie spends a lot of time following family daily activities rather than reaching the film stage. It was not about the last 15 minutes that we had a "wendigo" action. My opinion is that you are far away from this film. It will leave you want your hour and half back.
