Wow. I have often heard the need to comment on the movies recently, but this is particularly praying for beaten. Let's start at the beginning. First, the author of the author Susan Montford puts Kim Basinger in the role of former victims, completed by the man needed and the presence of large cities. Let it be understood now that almost all that is in this thin film is completely hackneyed and says. The horrible attempt of Montford in the example of the Christmas tree without a star is laughable. When she comes out of a Christmas nightclub with a dark night, Della is angry that someone has stopped her car on the night of the most bright shopping of the year. He decides to do something about it, therefore gives a good explanation on the windshield of the car. Fifteen minutes of the movie are dedicated to Della walking around the shops. When he finally gets his car, strokes tell him about the note, the hunter is killed, and he runs, and they catch him, and he gets away, and chases him away, and goes on. Everything is well known and unknown. The robbers are not afraid or very frightened, and all are taken directly by all means. <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies that all steps depend on characters to be as stupid as you can imagine. Why do the wicked know not only to wait for them to hit them with an iron eagle than I am. And once, just once, in a film like this, will the packet leader die in the end? What is it that all are taken directly at all when they don't know? Most of the film has Lukas Haas around the trees shouting "Della !!!" And the inclusion of the Happy Community with the sound of this bad film is offensive. The part that made me run on my computer device is when Della, tired and injured, crying in heaven, "Where are you, God?" Where, in fact, was the god when this movie took place? I only give 2 because of movies and movies, and not as bad as 'BTK Killer,' the final score of judging any awesome film. Come on!
