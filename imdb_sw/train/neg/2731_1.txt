It is really bad and easily the worst part I have seen .... forever. They've tried to do it with badness, 'we know we're doing' often. That would be strange if it was not for the fact that 'The Simpsons' is already ready. And it is still not good for them to come with the idea at first. The posts were done as part of normal behavior (especially JD). The barriers were not even for the actual events that happened, just a collection of say, J.D fall or, I don't know .... Elliott fell on. If I wanted to watch a collection of Scrubs I'd like to youtube and not lose half an hour of my life. The last seasons have fallen into a trap that many live-and should be disappointed in me, they were able to go to the 5th and quarter season without such a place. I was hoping that shrubs should not be a kind of sit-com. <br /> <br /> And if the thought of passing, why hell was DkCox bald?
