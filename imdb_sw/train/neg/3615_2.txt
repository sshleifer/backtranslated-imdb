How did I ever see or even hear about this junk movie before? It is similar to my barley and teenkill of blood, plotting with a 80-percent mirror that lies next to it. For some reason no one is very fascinated, staff and students of the Catholic university academy have been hit by an unknown psychopath. Recently educated teacher Julie Parker shares the time when all the people who contact her or turn away are dead or emerging. This movie is very bad! There is absolutely no logic or cooperation with each character that is similar to meaning to others. For example, there is a girl who was killed and her body lost on the vessel. Then, and for any reason, the story goes forward three weeks but the murdered girl is not mentioned or even missed. Even with his girlfriend! Acting is sad and there is no stupidity to enjoy. Revelation of the murderer is very funny because the creators seemed to really believe that it was the first ... No, people! "Splatter University" is one of the worst pigs.
