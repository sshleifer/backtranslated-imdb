I thought they should call this movie "Europeans" instead of "Height". Evil ... The type of film that makes people hate New Yorkers. People who look at themselves and think their lives are very importantâ€¦ give me rest. Vaccinated as white that Glenn Close was a tribal character in it, this film was asking the real person to come and steal ... and so set up, get this, even more white character than all the other cast (I thought was the first albino) who should Welsh! I'm still trying to clarify that feeling! Loyalty of pride ... this movie is a kind of film that has the ability to distract many people into thinking it is worth because it has something greater. Better to fill movies with MI5-10 than for this defensive trick ... must be the best play because you can't fall to the floor.
