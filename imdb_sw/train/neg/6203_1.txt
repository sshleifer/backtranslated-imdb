I saw this at the Edinburgh Film Festival. It was bad! Every basket, violence, fantasy boy fantasy was to show, you just knew how it would end up with all the shots of the wife of the chef and the rape of the first girl. The worst part was Q&A and the director / author and author / producer tried to come as an elite but you can tell them it is a kind of offensive. I beta anything they have regular banners and make drugs. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time. I had to put my girlfriend to walk out of it.
