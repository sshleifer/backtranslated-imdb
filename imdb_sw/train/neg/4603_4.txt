I was p *** ed when I couldn't see this during the screening on the Philly Film Fest last year, so when I saw that it would be on the cable tonight, I will remind you once it could. So it was worth waiting? Let's go back if I haven't given them a plot. Sean Crawley is a young man who doesn't know his way in life is. Enter Duke (George Wendt) who introduces him to his boss Ray (Danny Baldwin). One night Ray hammered quite a hammered asks Sean to give up the boy who was seeing it nearby. And it goes from there. Which guides me to the question made. Was it worth waiting? And no, the building was very nice and George Wendt stole the film. He just took the ball and run with it. But there is no place near violence as I was led to believe and elsewhere with movies when the ball is not just dropped, but is beaten and taken on the other side. I know where it happened exactly, but can't say without damaging the film. But it doesn't mean to say it happened. Finally it does not save the film. Poor Stuart Gordon nothing can be as good as "Re-animator" or "Castle Freak". <br /> <br /> My bridge: C <br /> <br /> Where I saw: Show Extreme <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Kari Wuhrer shows ta-tas her in one fantasy and then in -tas next next and it comes down with ... MY GOD MY ME MY ME!
