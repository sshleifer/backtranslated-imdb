Not only was he angry to hear, but he had no joke. I swear, some Asian boy says that the momma joke would be funnier than the filtering of Leary. (Maybe, maybe funny for a few minutes but at least I will laugh at least once!) Leary demanded to stop using drugs during his "jokes" ... ... it seems he was still up on something; he was just a non-anti-drug addiction specifically related to drugs. One of his jokes is something like, 'I will not use a crack, especially to have the same name among my ass' - Oh man, how did he come with one? I swear only the person who needs to install f ** k up is Denis Leary. Thank you God I did not need to see him live. This one is completely looking for. <br /> <br /> If you are easily distressed and swear, and "joke" where you can come to yourself, then waste your time with this junk.
