This movie was capable, but what makes it so bad for acting on Lindsay Crouse. I've never seen him before anything else and maybe there's some fans of Crouse out there that like him in something else, but his performance in this film is bad. <br /> <br /> Its delivery is robotic. When he sent his lines it seemed he was trying to prove that he had the correct lines and was just reading the list in his head. So his voice has very little inflection. I can't trust the bad person in the act was given the role of leadership in the movie. He should know someone in biz. Now I hate that this refers to him, but the opinion should be "this" for a long time and its performance is more widespread than anything else. <br /> <br /> However, I liked where the story went so I kept watching it. The first part of the script has a good film display. But the end was also frightening. Maybe if his acting would be better, I would love it.
