Well, I "get" Pasolini and its surroundings, but at the same time, I feel "Decameron" is largely inserted, and more of a little disturbance. It has been incorporated because the "realistic" genius (group group, misleading architecture, etc.) is reduced by a strange and contemptuous way that the characters do. In implementing the authenticity, Pasolini used the majority of the participants, but their head-and-heads heads of line-making lead to extinction and feel. And indeed - most of the people who are not worried, people who are worried are painful to watch. <br /> <br /> And "Decameron" Pasolini is disturbing (I least) because of the common and normal homosexual content. It is not because I am ignorant or not thinking (I am not) but because the emphasis that Pasolini puts on photographs and conceptual issues is against the neo-originality that he offers, so it comes as free and forced. One can almost hear him saying "Ooh - I must make a good man, a naked boy in this area!" Sometimes it seems that Pasolini tries to play homosexual sex to promote his nose to critics, and sometimes because he enjoys himself, no matter what his audience may prefer. The combination of 9 or 10 different stories in Pasolon's “Decameron” struck him as a failure of Pasolini as the author of the story, rather than the image of neo-realism. He seems to be bored for every story and so he will put them in a steady place and a little bit. Even the last line of the dialogue Pasolini in the film, which some people seem to get pithy ("Why create a work of art when it looks on it is very sweet?") - to me, just makes me wonder why Pasolini would hurt to make a film if it felt so? In my opinion, the best film (and more of homosexual content) is Fellini's "Satyricon". It is also full of wonderful people with a sad state, but it succeeds because of its adoption, direction and animation when the "Decameron" fails with such features.
