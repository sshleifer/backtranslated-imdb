I don't know why Spike Lee lost this movie trailer and defeated the poor Stevie Wonder in ever connecting his beautiful music and this mess of performances. I also hate how he uses controversy as part of the normal process of professional Blacks. The misuse of his ethnicity is a disgrace. Events that appear to appear blue and are not connected to a theme or a small, playing as one of the college students wrote this. I especially hate the spectacular scene that the two leaders play for players without any reason and the fighters come and cross the Snipes. The overhaul of the trend makes a person feel like the pastor has no respect for his viewers or does not have a picture of what the movie is about. The last part seems to be healed to justify the use of a sledge hammer to reach the stage. This movie also supports the story that all people of culture use the F word in normal conversation. I hope he will know that all his movies are in one pool like this that he doesn't know as a film manufacturer. I think his union with Scorcesee in the clockers was a good argument. She should be connected and make the document as Four Girls Four Boys. Horror movies do not make Oscar.
