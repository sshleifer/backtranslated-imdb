Oh my god, it's a terrible film. Film has all the people involved, unfortunately not worth checking. I saw it for free on my local library. If I paid the look at this I would like more. This film is unknown. How could Tarintino be associated with the slow, humorous film. It is not surprising that there was no great distribution, everyone involved must be ashamed. I can make the best film with Camcorder's Dated with my big finger. Its more interesting, I loved it very much. Tarintino just lost some standing in my eyes. This should be some kind of joke. Don't bother with this film. If someone shows even you should watch, kill them.
