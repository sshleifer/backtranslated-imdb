For me this comes just like a soap opera. I think any pictures of powerful people can be considered to be "the definition of society." But in the last analysis, I don't care how you show this film. No characters are very suitable or involved. I don't feel chemistry between Hudson and Bacall. If there is a love story here, it disappears in malaise. And in spite of the rapid and fast release (and therefore, incomprehensible) and Dorothy Maguire on the stand for evidence, the story is not enough to hold my interest. No matter how much Freudian and psychology gives us inside, this story is sleazy, melodramatic and trite. <br /> <br /> Rock Hudson is a beautiful wood. This is the low responsibility of collaboration with Lauren Bacall and one of its poorest performances. Dorothy Maguire and Robert Stack offers more exhibition leadership, but her behavior is bad, and her is beautiful. Robert Keith, like a loving father, out-of-touch two babies, is a tender attitude. Most interesting of all, however, is Robert Wilke very powerful in a small role as the owner of the bar. He is best remembered as a bad shepherd in countless Westerns, but here he is faithful, beloved fellow. <br /> <br /> I take my social definition with an interesting story, engaging a few and a few, thank you.
