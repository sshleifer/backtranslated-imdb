HAH! So this is a film that "Next Action Stars" entered. I am glad I did not share and did not win ... Isn't it funny how one can just watch the first 10 seconds (!) And create a mind about the film? I mean, come! Just look at these names! I watched this film (or part of this "teleplay" since it was released for TV and we can't tolerate the whole thing) one evening during my military service and the audience with me was usually a hodge-podge of average boys who regularly view the series as Las Vegas only for girls in the show. so bar was not very high, the most played movie in my group was the Girl's Door Girl (and not because of a great script; D. But the lack of this original film, acting, scripting, and almost everything else that makes the movie good made it easy to switch to Las Vegas channel (or was it CSI? don't remember ...) without any complaints to any group. And that's normal (!) for heaven Isn't it for this movie? , yes, see. And think about it. My conclusion? Well, since Joel Silver has given some of the best films (Die Hard, Matrix 1), by some name) I can only say that manufacturers don't get the film is the quality, provides money to directors. And selling this film because it is the movie Joel Silver is an attempt to hide the hidden hidden errors of employees who made it true.
