I lost this film because it falls under the "romance" and "western" forms and some of the Grand Canyon scenery are thrown. But if you expect a typical western romance, neglect. This movie is a garbage cleaner! This love is between YOUNG GIRL who hasn't come even for pregnancy and MAN-AGED AGE! The child is also attracted to other men who appear. It's a disease. Peter Fonda is shown to be good for trying to resist his influence on Brooke Shields, and her character is one next relationship. He tries to scream for the first time but finally gives and drives them as a happy and loving couple. It's the opposite. <br /> <br /> I don't see how this film can appeal to anyone except pedophiles.
