When I saw that the film was shown on television, I was looking forward to it. I grew up in the 1980s and like everyone else who grew up at the time, has seen a boyfriend and summer movie every 80 out there. So I couldn't wait to see this film that is completely destroyed by the film. What a desire! The movie was nothing but a very bad joke and gags jokes so, and hardly any plot and no substance. And film artists are trying to the darkest humor of defeat - some of these are called jokes not come with nothing but evil and wrong. The only good things about this film were the music, music, and acting. It was good to go on a recipe trip and see all the styles of summer dress from 80 years, and that goes to music. And acting was a top-notch around: almost all the best Hollywood comedians were now. The worst did not have good equipment to work with.
