If I knew that this film was done in a disgusting style and reinforcing Dogme 95, I have never been hiring. However, I used a chameleon for the sea and I shot. I spent four very minutes very much before giving up. It's just interesting, the desire to pretend. The last French movie I saw was "Romance" and it was also very bad, but at least the camera was stable and not breathing the neck of all the time characters. I am amazed at the continued popularity of overseas of the West - 95 - it will take in America about the same time as the second outbreak of leprosy. (It's called Dogme 95 because that's the number of regular administrators are beaten in the eye with the camera.)
