Believe me, this is one of the allowing a movie that you want to avoid and this comes from a big fan of Denzel Washington. An exciting part is that 1/3 of the great film. The first part of this movie is a unique task of establishing new characters and a new relationship between Creasy and a girl being given to protect. All the films of this film say they have been robbed. Therefore, I do not know anything when I say that the film is experiencing an unprecedented attack after being raped. Whatever the director was trying to accomplish, all he is doing is to make the audience a real nausea. Blowing speed, refusing to cut the choppy follow for the next half hour as Creasy songs under criminals. These cuts are not normal and cancel the nausea that all they are doing is to keep you out of the story. I am sure the director thought that this powerless way of presenting the story showed a change in the creasy behavior and showed that the different film was following. Well, he was right. The film that was followed was complete and unsatisfactory. The result is a destructive end that destroys the quality of forty minutes of the movie.
