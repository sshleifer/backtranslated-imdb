My wife and I look at the film every night without distraction, and especially art films that require ideas. I have tons of endurance for films that are slowly shining. My wife has twice the attention that I do. All that is said - this film is just plain with BORING! It didn't go anywhere. Never shine. It started with a very strong and conspiracy commitment ... then he ignores cookies ... he goes to Spain .... he hits, watches .... credit score. It has never been, filled with holes, begins to lie and end. We opened through a series of explorations to just look at the space. Detailed meaning when played with mud and right. Zzzz ...... It's like a fuck-flick flick which will pretend to be deep or artsy. You can't get to know neither understand the Morvern at all. About half through you don't worry anymore. We just wanted to see at least one of the lines of the plot to develop. Don't waste your time on this. I was scared of that high score.
