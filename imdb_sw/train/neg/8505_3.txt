"Semana Santa" or "Angel Of Death" is a very weak movie. Mira Sorvino has a detective who tries to find a killer who draws arrows to people. Mira has an Italian inspiration that falls on a regular basis. Could he say English? All other characters have Mexican impression that is disturbing. Talk is very bad and its delivery is wood. Style looks good, but that's not enough to save this. SECTION IN INFORMATION FOR THE WORK OF SPOILERS !!!! <br /> <br /> At the time of the revolution it seems like a man will go away, but then he comes down to the level of shooting and making a stunt cool down under insults. That just shows this script does not have any backgrounds. FUNA!
