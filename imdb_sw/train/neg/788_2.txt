A very positive movie to say about it. <br /> <br /> First has a zero speed and impossible in any game. Besides being very slow The Empty Acre looks dedicated to using similar stock photos again and again. How many times have I lost the field "that" at night or that the world to burst. It also has the basic key to thinking that if the audience does not know about things you will be replaced rather than confused. So without indications that there are any issues we suddenly find marriage is not what it seems to be with that given feeling that it's good. We see Jacob is likely to be the worst farmer in the world as he seems to have no time in the field and it also seems to have bought the land with an improper acre. Beth has the storage of books? There are some unknown questions that some of them are later solved in the film, later, it is really late. <br /> <br /> And on the stage of acres. Shocking businessmen are afraid that things that are not well known are not awesome? and if it is meant to be a huge acre then do it. There is also a horrible fear of thinking like Beth (the best executive in a piece, followed by Jefferson's cop) for suddenly it seems to be a suspect of everything under the sun just because he is on "medicine" ". For ten minutes full and run around the fields looking for a missing child (motivated outside the window is six months old) the film comes from a very bad place after the written area. The bad "plinky" picture fails to add the atmosphere. Often bad films can be exciting but not the Empty Acre, which is very bad.
