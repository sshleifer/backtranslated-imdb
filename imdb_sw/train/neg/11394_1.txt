O, with a loud shouting, this should be a LAMEST film I saw all year round, and the most unusual John Cusack supporters were linked to this piece of brain, of evil. Where Sleepless in Seattle has given what is the same with the same message, though on a more subtle, a more mature rate, Serendipity offers it to a sledgehammer, and then inserts it into your psyche for an exciting and half hour or so (and that's an hour and a half my life will never leave again, thank you very much!). It is very bad for the characters of this movie have a degree of emotional maturity of fourteen-year-olds (in fact I know better than fourteen-year-olds ..., except for Jeremy Piven, who was happy enough. The first 15 minutes or so of the movie where Kate Beckinsale's character suggests that the desperate game on giving us all the understanding to the wind (literally) had my best friend and I was more angry than belief. and at least, the characters in Rockstar were not half as if they were not working as the youth who were in this "Serendipitous" mess. How exciting it is. I am sure that this film will be more enjoyable with those who would not be involved in the horror of making the most difficult life decisions and then living effectiveness and results. After all, here is the movie where our hero and heroine live happily after just after destroying and sadness for the lives of two other people (ie their allies), not to mention relatives and other friends, just to get there. <br /> <br />
