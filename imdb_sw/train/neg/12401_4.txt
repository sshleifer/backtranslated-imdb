I am in a bad situation here. I haven't seen the first two movies in this series, although I have seen many films of Larry Cohen. Fans of the series seem to think this is a good film. To judge yourself, it was very good. You can't get real beauty on the face of the rebels (Robert Z'Dar), but what I saw was very bad. Death events seem to be written to eat more films, not to give any enthusiasm. Maybe if I saw the NC-17 Director, I can be feeling. Complete the car run by Z'Dar, Caitlin Dulany, and Robert Davi was very good. The best part of the movie.
