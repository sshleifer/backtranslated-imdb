I have a copy of this for VHS, I think they (television networks) should play this every year for the next twenty years. In order not to forget what was that we remember do not make the same mistakes again. If you put some people in the seat of the director, where they have no property. This Rappin 'movie is like a vaudevillian music, for those who can't sing, or act. This movie is very fun if you try to teach the 'blind' to run the city bus. John Hood, (Peebles) has been imprisoned and returned to the old neighborhood. At the time of serving all the crimes of beauty must, of course. John is returning to the old road and was greeted by female girls and his daughters while playing and singing each along the way. I would like to suggest this if I was feeling, or if someone was really pushing a pot of medicine prescribed by a doctor for glaucoma. Any way this is unintended, written, used and even produced (I didn't think I would say that) satire of ghetto life and 'hood'. Although, I think part of the liberation of the story, through the wannabe batch of the fight against dance numbers, his friends care about their neighbors and want to save ghetto from bursting and cleaning. To forget the spoon of Sonny, Mario could win Oscar for that in comparison to this Rap. Oh well if you find yourself wanting to laugh yourself with three quarters of shame, make sure you drink first. And please, look carefully. (No star, good luck sometimes!)
