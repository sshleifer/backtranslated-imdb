I am a Catholic who was taught in primary schools and scholars, taught by Jesuit priests at school and university. I am still a Catholic who works but can't be considered a "good Catholic" with the eyes of the church because I don't believe in certain things or do some way just because the church tells me. So for the movie ... it's bad because two people are killed by this widow who should be a satire as a religious woman. No comedy in it and satire is not done well and on Diane Keaton's acting. I've never seen a play but if it was completely different from this movie then it might be good. <br /> <br /> At first I thought the gun could be fake and shoot the first program with the leadership of four old female students as an attempt to express the faith of the emotional and intellectual sister of Maria's religion. But it turns out the bullets were real and the story has a tragedy ... the tragedy of life (except the two old students ... the lives of lost children, the life of the mother of the student), the tragedy of the doctrine of authority over the love of the people, the religious disaster planned rather than true faith in God. This is bad for modern Islam, and Judaism and Christianity of yesterday.
