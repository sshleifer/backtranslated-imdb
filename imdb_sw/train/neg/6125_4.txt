This is the best movie of Derek's couple who have ever done and if you think this is a recommendation then you haven't seen any of the others. There are common ingredients: it is as badly to act as their other efforts, we can look at Bo cancellation or detect for the rainbow shirt occasionally, the story is just idiotic laughably, and the film takes itself very seriously. And then: Orang Utans Africa? But it has a few things to go for it. Bo looks good, production standards (sets, clothes, etc.) is very good, and this improves the value of its camp. In a strange way it is absolutely true, just because it tries to be bad and very failure.
