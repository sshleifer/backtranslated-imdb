Well, I could get into a plot, but that's just me maybe. Non-dirty camera pieces sometimes, however, this film has a good crop yield. The work is real to the time and enjoy with the regular sequence involving women who are very dressed, which was good. This period is confused and confused, but still ... lost by mistake, thanx to Stella Stevens. <br /> <br /> Stunts are interesting, especially because of the original 70 vegas background. There is some motion of the camera-motion held at the end of the end, which protects me think, for a while. But I don't think I'll drive the DVD, just yet.
