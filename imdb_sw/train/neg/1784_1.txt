Okay, I wiped this off the TV and I've started too much. The film was about 10 or seconds in names (I think) so if something happened before I lost it. Many people say Mark Hammill is here, I haven't seen him. I found Clive Barker, John Landis and openly Stephen King doing a very bad job as a cemetery. Alice Krige seems to be pretty far from the events where she has a cat's face or is in a complete-up visitor. Even with open titles he has never explained very well what Sleepwalkers are or where they come from. From the sequence of the head I think they are biped as they live by taking the life force from mankind. I think they live long and these two may be the last of their kind. Add to this a very high level of protective relationships (Yes! I thought it was a suspect too), shapeshifting, kill and unknown cat and you have Sleepwalkers. <br /> <br /> It is a very bad story that does not have a real explanation behind two and more characters who came so much to try and distract from the simple fact that it's not enough is explained by the viewer. Avoid it.
