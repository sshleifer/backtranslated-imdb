The movie has a nude area: a man sitting beside the bed, with its clear spots to clear the center of the screens. It's a very long area. What was the matter? I almost think it meant to be funny but we were looking at my mother and it was not surprising to have something that looked at us for what seemed like a perfect minute. <br /> <br /> The movies are cool. There are no even visible characters. Audrey Tatou is good, of course, but her character is unattractive. <br /> <br /> I can't recommend this movie. I expected to be beautiful and clean but was bitter. I wondered if the director came from a very high corridor, a French family taught and looked down on these characters. <br /> <br />
