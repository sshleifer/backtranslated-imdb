This film is good looking, but it is like watching the worst exhibition of the exhibition. The plan (if there was one) is not worth any meaning. But it is very "artistic". Locate a lot of semi-dressed artists and look into each other's eyes. Locate a lot of arty through windows and people out of shape. Remind them and people losing wistfully. Consider closely the surfaces and bodies. When you get to the top three of the roof and cats, you will be ready to throw a KY bottle on the screen. It should be about the relationship of the father and the child, but you will only want to have two of them just f * $ and each other. If you have wanted to see Russian pornographic images without money shots, your desire has been given.
