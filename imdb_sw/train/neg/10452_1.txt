I saw 10pm. show and I must say that this film was not unique. Although I have not left the theater you want my time (since I do not pay for movies again) I have not found any features of redemption. There were a few lines and that made me hate, but most of the film seemed to have a great fan service for the younger (in mind more than the age as this film is rated R) the male audience. The fan service was out of place and also distracted them. I know you all want to hear Samuel L. say his bad line, but let's be honest, it's a lot of crops for very little pay. The only awesome part of the film was CG, which was considered to be very listed and not well connected to the live screen. Now I am a smart person, I knew to go to the reminder that I did not see "Casablanka," and I am at least grateful that this film is an original idea (albiet inane) and not renewing or opening a franchise. However, being honest, if not part of the following worship is better to spend your money elsewhere and see the film on the second sports field in a few weeks or rent for a few months.
