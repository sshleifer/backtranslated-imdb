I love B's movies .... but come ... this was not worth the bridge ... The last was dumb ... b / c NOT TO GET !!! .. not to mention that it comes to life alone ... I mean no storm of light or demon power? It goes down like hell and then just starts killing the characters directly like about 15 minutesâ€¦ and even not starting a part of it killing one person without his head .... and then you can't even see what Jigsaw does even with what is called "The new jigsaw puzzle" .... Unless you have nothing better to do ... Id look paint before the Id suggests this movie left of God to anyone else ... oh and make it better to the other totem movie you can see guy throw The one creature in the bottom of the window was a funny as hell and probably it's just a nice part of the look of the film
