The original movie, someone from the snowy river, is one of the best I have seen, almost entirely. The story of Lady and Tramp in two minds - a rich girl / poor young man, with the power against blood. However, it is not just an innocent attempt to overthrow a natural name but also a silly, more disruptive summary of the best summary as "Rambo meets the Black Stallion." Without the charm of Black Stallion. The little hero returns from the absence of 3 years, and suddenly he is Superman on the horse; in the original film, good, was real and trusted, but sadly reduced to caricature in the sequel. I have never had a passion for movies, and sometimes this made me very angry - they lacked a little obstacle. The audience of Brazen's audience - making the headings of the label think that all of them are related to the horse-loving audience puts the horse pretty in front of them, making them happy? Furu films.
