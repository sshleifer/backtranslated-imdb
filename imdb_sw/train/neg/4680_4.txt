If I am asked how I will be able to define the word "Shallow" I would like to answer "Look at Jerry's Bruckheimer production". If I am asked how to define the words "Loss of Power" I would reply "Look at Jerry Bruckheimer's production". Bruckheimer yields are almost always hot on the box office but almost always get useful advice from critics. From the top of my head I can just think about a STUDENT with a BLACK AND BLACK HAWK DOWN to get many important features. CRIMSON TIDE also received acceptance from the critics, it is certainly one of the best Bruckheimer films that are not to say a lot. The problem I had is a story that makes the story: Russians are fighting with Chechens and the war spreads through the whole Soviet Union leading to the national scientific president to replace nuclear forests and threaten the West if they intervene. Perhaps the end of the cold war had everything to do with it but I have seen this standing very high. It has not been supported by certain errors in geography such as Foch carrier in France on the Med (Is not Foch well placed in the black sea?) Or that the sponsor's report includes family publications confused from the Balkans, the first gulf battle and even Vietnam. Once again the admission "Very failure" has entered into my mind. The story improves some time when the right story - The war of love about orders between the nuclear submarine commander and its two numbers - is done. Director Tony Scott is doing a good job as he does, but the problem is still in an uncomfortable situation. The worst thing is that if this was done in the mid-1980s when WW3 was a real possibility - and likely - this film would have feared me, but after the cold war ended and the threat of nuclear war that means CRIMSON TIDE has little effect.
