NOT SEE IN SAD IN FILM. I have lost time and money on this and it's pretty p ** sed off on it. <br /> <br /> Acting is comparable to secondary games. Script is awesome. There is no plot. Twenty minutes from the end (which I think I had to be paid for) I had headaches due to screaming, crying and crying the five girls to do. Most of the violence is (inappropriate for the film today) suggested instead of showing pictures but I found the characters so angry that I wanted to see them, and indeed everyone involved in making this s s, t die The worst possible. I spend ten minutes more of my life saving from 100 minutes of your very poor. Don't do that.
