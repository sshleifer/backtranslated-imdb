I am a big fan of Fred MacMurray and Carole Lombard. And, moreover, Charles Butterworth (the most enjoyable player) was in this film, ... why was I not so happy? Well, in spite of good casting, this is one of the poorest text and more "Photos" I saw. From talent and money spent on this film, it's amazing how the slip-cover writing was. I realized that the film would be a stimulating moment when early in the film I found myself explaining exactly what would happen in the future - and I was always right! And this is not because I am a kind of "movie savant", but because almost no thought or effort entered into it. In fact, it seemed as if the film is a long string of all the clichés connected together! Also, I found that the fury that Fred had treated Carole very badly in the film and yet, in fact the contract, came to run at the end. Uggh! There is a lot of doubt in Lassie's film ("he will bring people to save Timmy or a string that will stagger from the break?"). With very script, very tired and clichéd, there were a few positive about the film. It was very good to see Fred looking like a broken lush at the end of the film - it was good reliable and it looked like he did not eat, shaved or sleep in the day. Also, Charles Butterworth's "prattle" gave them a few moments of humility. But all this was not enough to make this film look different from "B's movie". It's a shame, ... can be better.
