These reviews that claim this movie is very bad its good going up with one. This movie does not condemn the crime of which Leonard Part 6, World War and Gigli. The films were fun in their worst form, but a spoon of dinosaur ivory is very painful. I've never had a lot of pain to watch bad movies since I watched Geni's Children and Superbabies. Before you start a review I would like to tell you a story. Theodore Rex is $ 35 million of bust The New Line Cinema refused to put in the cinema. They refuse to send directly to the video and make it an expensive film directly to the video for many years. Whoopi entered into this tragedy after a great payment. <br /> <br /> Plot: clones million dinosaurs so they can launch missiles in the sun that can kill mankind and start Ice Age another. A girl girl named Katie Coltrane and a idiotic dinosaur named Theodore Rex team team up to her after the death of a buddy dinosaur. The program is given to you at the beginning of a movie that stimulates the movie of all its secrets. Then you should deal with the fact that this film is absolutely true. A seemingly angry viewer tries to strengthen its performance but is not worth it. Theodore Rex is a shocking sudden and his whispering behavior will wear thin after five minutes on the screen. Many jokes move around and threaten to hurt people and hit people with his tail (on accident and purpose). I thought Burglar was bad but it takes monitoring for Theodore Rex: the worst movie of Whoopi's work. Don't let anyone tell you this damage is bad enough to enjoy. I didn't see it when I watched this film. All I saw was the collapse of the train which was written by people who should have a reputation for the sick of the movie Howard The Duck. Humor is on the same level and Theodore Rex looks like a local cousin of Barney. It is quite disturbing from beginning to end.
