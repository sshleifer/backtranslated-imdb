This was just terrible. I read this book to school, I have done Like all the tests, and seen like this! My teacher redeemed me and 20 other people to look at, and it was worse than Leonard Part 6, the 9th Plan from the outside, and Hudson Hawk put together. The thing that made this film so bad was enough to kill itself. First of all, it was done in Hallmark. Second, the acting was bad. Third, it was quite different from the book. In fact, it was so bad I wondered if I was missing. Basically, I would like to look at the base Institute 2 than this look. Take my advice, don't look at this film. No one would like to view this. It was terrible. News!
