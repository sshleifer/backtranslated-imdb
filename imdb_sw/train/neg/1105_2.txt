Oh my. How can they make movies like that, but that's very bad. I mean, even Uwe Boll doesn't work like this. There is not even a feeling of respectable stories, many colored characters, or gravity. It is a random sequence of meaningless conversations connected together to make 'movie'. I think children only to the age of 3 can enjoy, because the world is not quite capable of that story, that any old person will be angry with it. But again, it is also scary for anyone under the age of 6, that maybe no one should watch this film completely. <br /> <br /> Take my advice and keep away, away from this film. Your little daughter can do the best storyline, and though maybe she can't draw this beautiful picture, her story is more important to listen. And please, in the name of anyone who believes, do not reveal this part to your children. I will give you 2 out of 10, and that's just for drawings, because the story and the development of the character is so bad they would deserve the negative balance. <br /> <br /> And if you decide to look at anyways ... remember that I warned you.
