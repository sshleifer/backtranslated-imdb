In fact, I was very much like Julian Po. I think Slater is involved as an actor, and that many players here are better than they were given the opportunity to show in this film. I know this depends on a short story that I haven't read. Therefore, I do not know if I see it as an error of the film that has happened to the story, or set it by the director / photo reporter. The cluster is wonderful, and I loved the sound of the voice, confessing the confession of the opening revelation. But then ...? Nothing! A few of the local characters stirred to ask the city of Julian to express his intention to commit suicide. One can say that he does not answer, because it is not their business. But Julian is the one who, under the pressure of the token only, appeared to his public interest. Then neither Julian nor the director / author, despite the fact that Julian's character puts a tape recorder for God, it seems likely to give anything more than the original life story of Julian. He says he was a writer. He says his family moved when he was a child, from his father's work. So? There are several interactions with locals who are supposed to look at Julian's goal. But none of them goes anywhere, because Julian seems to recognize all the dopey citizens as if they were aliens from another planet, as if they were the last (and only) one of them. This can work as an example, if Julian Po had any character that describes or anything approaching wisdom to give. The one who is closer to anything about himself is in a place where he deliberately scorns the religious, religious mechanic. And what this article reveals is not something that can encourage Julian. I can only see the character of Julian - as it is found - like selfishness, small, and totally separation. The direction of the director of this semi-framed film, planned. And poor Michael Parks, an actor who had many promises, was not given anything to work with here.
