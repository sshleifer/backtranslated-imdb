The first was different and interesting. This attempt should never be left on the label. This movie did not make you laugh. It's a weak attempt in great humor. Movies offer current and old movies to turn off. This time jokes are used to be interrupted. The audience I saw and just did again in the Hannibal dinner area and was asleep.
