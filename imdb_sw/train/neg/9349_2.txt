This film was awesome. I have given a score of about 2 as I saw more, but very few <br /> <br /> From the beginning of the clichéd to the end of the film at the beginning and at the beginning at the end of the movie this film used everything in a box used in film only for him, as a child with so many fingers. There was a long, exciting story of repetition, moving slowly, freezing of the image, stirring pictures and linked images - no one that made the film much better. It is called “16 years of alcohol”, but there was a little drink or drunkenness and no signs of withdrawal from the film flying over any place without feeling. The story was well documented and very bold and the trend was so bad and it is embarrassing that people have put more money for more films by Mr Jobson, previously they knew to be in the garbage group and on TV making as much as if this film makes. <br /> <br /> I saw it was a great effort to see this last but hopefully getting better I done it hurriedly but it was really a waste of time and I would like better than not a problem.
