The woman asks advice on the road to reach the wonderful city, and hear two historical stories from the local weirdo, related to the zombie. But maybe it finally has something wrong in its shop too ... <br /> <br /> Zombie Chronicles is one of the worst films I've ever seen. In fact I must admit, it's so bad I served fast through a lot of waste. And there was a lot of it, I don't believe. It goes for just 69 minutes, and there are still tons of filling. You get a head of skin that makes a lot of push, a lot of kiss kissing kissy among young goofy (beaten, tee hee) and good examples of reasons why other people should not be actors. <br /> <br /> As for title characters, they don't even have a detailed description in the film. Why, you get a non-undead step in an intro than you do a feature before! Although, considering how the eyes of the eyes coming out of the buttocks and eating in a mental sense are (between 'happy'), maybe that's a blessing to hide. <br /> <br /> And above all, it seems like it has been done on someone's mobile phone for advertising on Youtube. The work of the Jerky camera, scratches on publishing lights, shine ... I had to touch my eyes when I realized that it was done in 2001, and not 1971. Even the clothes and look for three decades out of date! <Br /> <br /> If you think you are not eligible to make a revision of the Chronicles without seeing the entire film, then go ahead. You are trying to stay in it, I say you can't even make it with the first appearance of blue-smartie freaks before you make your excuse and stop. In fact it is laughable that anyone chose to open it, and honestly you will find more fun to relax your drink on disc than actually distract your DVD player and this gigglesome excuse for fear. In fact, it is not surprising if it comes to bags and leaves in the morning, leaving you to watch VHS tags for your entire life. You have warned ... 0/10 / 1 <br /> P.S What kind of fear of 18 was calculated by a woman continues to win big games during sex? See, movies can't even find that part right ...
