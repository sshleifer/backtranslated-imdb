I was probably one of the few people who actually read the book of Stephen King, one of which this movie was founded. After reading this good work, I couldn't wait to see the movie version. After watching the film, I was quite desperate. The only thing this film looks like is the title and names of the characters. In the book, the character of Schwarzenegger installed on the game show. The main thing is to survive. But he is not in the field. He has set free in the city and should escape the game of the game (I think you will call) villians, who carry quite identical to the film characters. This cluster created many tensions and stopped and ended up with a peak. Movie was quite garbage. There was no quality of movies for it. I totally respect Arnold Schwarzenegger as an actor, but he lowered himself to this.
