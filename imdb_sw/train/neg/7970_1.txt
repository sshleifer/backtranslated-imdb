If you want to spend two hours of your life this look depends on how much you love your awesome movies. If you love them so god becomes bad they are hysterical, looking away. Jigsaw is undoubtedly the worst movies that I have seen in my life (and I have seen 'Long Time'), and I say this as a fan of low-budget types of fear / gore and see a few good comparisons. I can't even go to the specific things of what makes this movie so bad, the only thing right about it is so terrible is one of the funniest things I've seen in years. If you can get this rental at an affordable price is certainly worth checking, if you were involved in doing it - embarrassed on you. : o) IMD need to establish a 0/10 rate especially for this movie, it is quite suitable.
