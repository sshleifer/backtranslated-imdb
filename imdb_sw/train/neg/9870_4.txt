I had several problems with the movie: <br /> <br /> (1) Movie - in particular, the voice of Kim Basinger on: movies are not books; should * show * action instead of having a voice on * tell us what happens. Sometimes I find the movie and sound on the job, but here it seemed more than the lazy way of writing script. In fact, it felt like that he was reading carefully from the text from a novel to his high voice. <br /> (2) I don't feel a feeling in the relationship between Jessie and Brother Thomas and I also felt that Alex Carter's job was very bad. That is a failure for me to define Jessie and Thomas's characters - without any connection between them, it seemed to me if she just wanted to learn and that for her it was a matter of sex cuts. If well done, the relationship between them would have given more stories to the story. (3) For the book, I understood Jessie's life crisis. In the film, it seemed more than just weakness. On the other side, I did not think that the film was bad as I turn off the TV. . . though these thoughts came to me.
