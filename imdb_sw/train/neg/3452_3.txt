I chose to watch the film at the recent Dubai Film Festival because it was selected in the prestigious Cannes film competition. I was surprised that Cannes could be far away from considering the quality. Films, other experts, have identified they do not have too much weapons - but natural abuse is interesting. Consider killing your enemy / competitor in front of your little child. Forcing someone to eat a spoon of porcelain to prove trust. There are tips for the children of Corleone who are different from the "Godfather" of Copolla who seem to be here in this Chinese / Hong Kong film but the quality of two is quite different from chalk and cheese. <br /> <br /> This film is only recommended for violent junkies. Better can be considered to be better than normal Run Run shaw production for production standards.
