The possibility of playing was the only thing that could look at this film - and even that was desperate compared to the other film. My scope! To me, this is the worst kind of film - one that thinks it is a work of art because it has all the film-like art. Yes, it is a beautiful picture, but it is ultimately not suitable for the dancing of the dance which the film is involved. Tango is a tease, it's hot, has a game, it's brave - exactly what this film is not.
