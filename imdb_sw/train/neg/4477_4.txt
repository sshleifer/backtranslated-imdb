What is an empty and empty illustration with a few of the classic novels. I would like people not to stop talking to the classic when they clearly don't have the idea of ​​a real or original idea. This version is not different. I felt that the version of Ralph Fiennes is even worse though if it was thrown to Juliette brioche as Kathy needs to be the worst decision to make KUSA ... however behind this version. It aims to make a good story for the modern environment and in the style of music. It works for all but the top art is nit. Long look for rainy days ... The trend was moderate and inappropriate editing. Worse than the ancient Quincy. Deepak Verma has a great change as Hindley and is actually one of Britains's lost talents. Part Heath was played by charm and great trust and I think that throwing it is a powerful step of this project. Although the most talented director could use the best use of the materials he had. It was obvious that he was the director of the lease and did not initiate the project with enthusiasm that deserved it.
