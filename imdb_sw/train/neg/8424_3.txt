This film can be judged from three views: as a history, as a profile of Amin, like a false thriller. It fails as history, it says by adopting a revolution that gave out Obote, expulsion of Asians, and has an Entebbe reserve as history, but not at any time of the right time. If the profile of Amin could be interesting, because Forest Whitaker is very good, and if this was the best film, she would get Oscar. (He found - which confirms Oscar voters do not see the films they vote.) It ignores important historical events in the novel, which has seen Amin and Uganda's history from a doctor's view. It says instead of the fiction of the Scots doctor and his impossible life of life from Amin's perspective. But the story described is one incident that Amin was probably not guilty. <br /> <br /> Like a false thriller, there is no plot to put it together. Origin is taut - it takes the freedom of movies and novels, but sets the story. The doctor's behavior has been described well, but it disappears in the second half of the film which is disturbed as a result. Why does the doctor decide to stay in Kampala is misinterpreted - derived from power? Why he friends not one is wonderful. A friend's behavior in the novel has been lost because Scotsman has something instead of a black doctor - a wonderful destruction that is not even credible, but enables filmmakers to show Amin's corruption around the hand. A man called a little horse at the end appears. Finally, in 1971, Uganda dismissed the left side, incorrect, number plates had three letters and two or three numbers - and where are Equator tips? In short - if you have never heard about Amin, you may want to spend two hours watching this film to understand the Forest Whitaker's performance, but the last hour will allow you to be confused. If you know Uganda or have read the book - do not see the film - it will only inspire you. And if you want to know why the doctor was foolhardy - he did not.
