Rosario Dawson star as a girl who is the date of rape and then begins respect in the dark until she gets an opportunity to take revenge. When it became clear that why Dawson took that role, his opportunity to show his practice to do and make a small self-determination, with the decision of the un-Hollywood film, also shows that far from mysterious wonders, Dawson seems to have no place in that position. Forgive me I couldn't see him. That's not an error, that's how I felt, I didn't know the idea where she was. Yes I know he is on the screen but though I spent the best part of two hours looking at him he had no feeling over me so much forever. I blame the script for this since the other end, not all of that happened on the screen seemed to have any real feeling. People seemed to have more posture than real and what happened was not found to be the same. Forgive me for it is not clear but there is nothing in this film, except the last (which I would like to talk about but can't cause it could lose it), and the image of Rosario Dawson is nothing more than an image, stayed with me I can say, this can be clicking with you, shouldn't , for I am when I can't return. For Rosario Dawson fans only, though warn there are several real reasons why this is NC17. (With Rosario - please, you're the best actor, choose the best text)
