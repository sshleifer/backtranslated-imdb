I understand jokes quite well, they're not just good. The show is terrible. I understand, and that's another horrible thing about her. The only cool behavior in EVER was on the show was that one hobo in the same place, but then I saw another place including that part and the show is awesome. It's not funny, not funny! I don't want people to say "The only people they get" because if they are wise why they judge people who do not know and say they are not smart or intelligent enough to understand? It's like saying "The sky is red" but never will look out. But everything, this is to show the worst I have seen in my life, joke is terrible, I mean, you can understand them, they are just terrible, its controversy is very limp, its joke fart and another joke on the water body water is true dumb and typically includes very serious acting. I don't know what these "intelligent" people see in this show, but to judge others when they don't even know anything about any of us is not a very good opinion.
