Close to the fact and more detailed than "Breakdance", "Street Street" of Stan Lathan is still a very good show. Again this pic is actually just inserting into a 'breakin' craze but at least we get a little leisure from a plot, which involves the life of three young friends and a younger brother, both growing in Queens, New York. Everyone has his special talents. One is a hustler, one dj, another artist who builds' burners', while little bro 'Lee is a hot' hip hop 'dancer <br /> <br /> Lathan can not produce any interest of the audience in the story however, and its cast young people are also struggling with their characters. So it is closer to the funky music and play 'clean' to save the day. <br /> <br /> Choreography is no longer bright for both clubs and streets, but this alone is not enough to lift "Beat Street" to a great length. Unfortunately the film falls very fast, after showing the light of hope that can only be interesting on Sunday, August 25, 1996 - Video
