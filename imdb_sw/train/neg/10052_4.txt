Warner Bros made many potboilers in the 1930s and many of them are fast paced, economical and very entertaining. I love how the studio used a few interesting features in our daily life. This is one of the harder melodramas of the harder that does not work. Edward G. Robinson has a bad newspaper editor who raises a 20-year-old story of the fatal results. Robinson provides good performance but surrounded by executives who do not have a mustard cut. H.B. Warner, Aline MacMahon and Boris Karloff are good, but the worst acting Frances Starr and Anthony Bushell in second leads really hurt the movie. Starr is particularly bad during its large large area near the end of the film. Additionally, the moral tone of the film appears to be ridiculous in the context of the original Hollywood code. LeRoy's trends are full of creative literature but can not eliminate the bad acting and unfamiliar situations. The work of Sol Polito's camera is stable. Somehow, this dreck piece got the Oscar selection for the Best Picture (the year it threw "M," "Dracula" and "Frankenstein").
