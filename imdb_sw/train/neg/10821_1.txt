I read the 'Jane Eyre' novel for the first time back in 1986. It was all around that time I saw the BBC-version with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke. It was the best version and much like the book. Years later, I kept my eyes on this version and I was scared. William Hurt is quite clear as Mr Rochester. Mr Rochester is a passionate attitude, where William Hurt shows him as an ice barrier. That goes to Charlotte Gainsborough. It was like watching two zombies together. This is a story about love and passion, but I couldn't see it in this edition. No, refer to BBC-version. Good time is guaranteed.
