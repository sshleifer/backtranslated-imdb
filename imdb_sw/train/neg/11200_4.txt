The good fellas in Webster's Dictionary describes the termination of cruelty as the fear of words'. I would be a discriminator. Since no mixture of the word is more ridiculous than at the beginning of the film, the words are 'Produced, Written and Guided by:', and followed by the name of one person. Think about it. There are disabled, electric and wheels, but so are a few jack-of-all-business. Even more season of directors such as Speilberg and Scorsese do not get the same control of their films. But there I was, all sitting on my theater, popcorn by hand and on the watch. When they were healed to me as a fastball of Nolan Ryan, they were the words 'prepared, written and led by Brian Helgeland'. Who! <br /> <br /> Become a buff film, I knew of Brian Helgeland. As his filmmaker film over the last 10 years will be graphed as the company's dotcom company in 1998. There were many unpleasantries of exhibition (Assassins, The Postman, Theory Conspiracy) if there were significant and winning achievements (LA Confidential, Mystic River). They seemed to be an alternative? one good, one bad, so knowing that his final film, BloodWork was one of the many attempts lost in the work of Clint Eastwood, I used the breath and I have been optimistic. In restoring, I should not be exhaled. Starts of Heath Ledger's Order (Helgeland's Knights Tale), like Alex Bernier, a priest in the order known as Carolingians, who is called Rome when his fellow priest is killed under a condition that Arch Bishop finds curious'. To meet Father Thomas (also of Amri and play with surprise and 'Mark Standy' still), they began to divide the selected paradox after the death of the priest. is a small plot involving Mara Sinclair (played by Shannyn Sossamon) who has fled from an institution that was the result of his attempts to kill Alex during the evil. Alex has a feeling for Mara and for some reason without the audience, they travel to Rome together. Nary night a good sleep may be with Alex facing William Eden (Benno FÃ¼rmann) who claims to be the old Eater Eater. The sin of Eating, as we are told, is the ones who eat the sins of the dead person when the church is not present, thus allowing them to enter Heaven. William, as lucky had it, tired of life healing and looking at Alex to take his place and redeem him from his secular work. Alex refuses, but after the death of his new love Mara, Alex travels to Sin Eater's service to save him and the change has been completed. Alex then turns out the answers to his many questions when Father Thomas unveils the Vatican program after approving the authority for his investigation. Order is not a bad film, but it is very boring. There were special effects of ignorance and no relationship with any characters. Even in a very strange place - that while Alex was walking in Mara's death - it's a color and bland and he leaves us with no emotional response to the problem of the couple. Everyone seems to speak so quietly and honestly that the flat lines of the film and a pleasant smell can be managed to protect me from trying to grab a quick nap in the middle of the film. So, Mr. Helgeland, I beg you not to try again. Share your vision with others and allow more skilled ones to help you direct you to directions that are not narrow and self-serving. Until then, there is no indication that you have anything more than a bridge that falls. Two stars. <br /> <br />
