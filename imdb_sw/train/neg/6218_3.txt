My views on the film, 9 <br /> <br /> It was not good, not quite good. Seen, it was good. I was very happy with the speed, old cameras, etc.. However, the characters? eh, kinda bland. Plot? Crashed. <br /> <br /> This movie was looking over the age of more than anything else. Organized religion is presented as fear and fear. Science is not shown much better. Creates a weapon of monster that kills everything ... but "spirit" are able to destroy monsters and bring life? True? It is something that blows my ass too. Here we have a CGI movie ... is designed by science ... and they use it to give us a message that science will destroy the world when promoting the idea that spirituality will save us? At least they had the ability to have one partner to ask, <br /> <br /> "Well, now what?" (or something like that). I could not hear very well because of the crowd immediately rise and make a break for leave. It was "the same ... it was very difficult to enjoy enough to stay here for the whole movie but now let's leave here as soon as possible!" type of departure. <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies where you can't think if you want to enjoy. Just look at those pictures and touch your head voluntarily. Think of any like, "what is that to be?" will find you because of unbelief and make you look for signs of enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> Okay ... SPOILERS follow. So, basically, a scientist creates a "Machine" which has the ability to create another, intelligent, robotic life. Bad people use as weapons. However, the scientist knows that he is also wrong. He gave him the mind his mind, but he did not give his heart. The machine goes to Skynet on the ass of humans as well as wiping all life on earth, ultimately reduces slowly. However, a scientist can live and make puppets walking. Every one, with a piece of soul of a scientist. Finally, # 9 wakes up without knowing anything about the world. He sees an amazing device around and takes. He meets another like himself, # 2/2 <br /> Well, # 2 is taken by the last Laboratory robot. # 9 gets more like himself and sets off to save # 2. <br /> <br /> They succeed. The advertisement that there is a similar hole is suitable for the device. He inserts it and the Machine returns to life ... connecting the soul of # 2 in the process. <br /> <br /> The movie continues with action events and # 9 try to save its soul-yanked compatriots. <br /> <br /> Finally it succeeds and destroys the Machine. They leave the souls of their dead friends, who go to the clouds. It is rain and we see life returning to the planet. ? It doesn't matter. Nothing. Why did the bomber want to divide his soul into 9 homunculi? What happened? What? They were created to stop the machine? Everything was dead! The machine was dead! Why are you upset ?! Why did you expect nine small providers to succeed when there is nothing else? Why not build a second machine of mind, but for "soul" to fight first .. at least that would seem like it would have a good chance to succeed. Why were they supposed to have their souls put into the device by the Machine and then destroy the Machine and then release the spirit to bring life to the world? Why not just wait the power machine down and bring life back to all of the insane action?
