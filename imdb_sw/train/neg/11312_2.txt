This film deserves credit in the original way. It combines elements of movies, movies, and epic. Unfortunately, it falls flat on all levels. The biggest film is the lack of willingness to do anything; has camping, ethical, and epic things without doing any of them. For this information itself, Chretien de Troyes spinning his grave in this terrible state which returns to the beautiful Percival, innocent without being guilty in the worst and worst churl. <br /> <br /> Probably two types of people will see this, francophiles or Arthuriophiles. Speaking as the last one, I found an unknown movie with an amazing shade, a disrespectful treatment of a good story.
