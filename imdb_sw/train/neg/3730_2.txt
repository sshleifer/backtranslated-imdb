First, there is something wrong with reading Daniel, Revelation, Matthew 24, Isaiah and other prophetic writings. There is nothing wrong with making a film like this trying to try the gospel message. So my reputation and this movie is not in trust or its wishes. As a Christian, though amillenialist, I believe that there will be a great tribulation and I believe that Christ will return as He said. So even though I don't have an agreement with this film about the rapture that is not because I am photographing this very low picture. It is not what it makes me reduce the rate of the movie is not his credibility or its message, but rather the lack of production standards, bad script, mediocre acting, and FX sympathy. This movie is approaching there with some of the cheesiest fodder of the 1950s. No, this film approaches there with Program 9 From Outerspace. This film has failed for a good age and it is possible to be attributed to the time they planned. The apocalypse film producers could learn how to make the last moments from this film, but they failed. The left-hand series, a series of Apocalypse, and a series of Omega principles failed to learn from this because they talked about FX problems and the problem of checking the date, but their texts are still poor, and their acting are wood. <br /> <br> There are good Christian films, and a very small budget, but this film is not one of them. I wonder MST3K employees have never ignored this.
