Does Francis Ford Coppola have a brain aneurysm after leading "Apocalypse Now" that has made him unable to make a good film? You should ask yourself what the director of "Godfather" and "Talk" was thinking when he made this flabby film. It gives Kathleen Turner a star car, playing a woman who travels back on time and gets her back to know all the things that life as an adult has taught her, and Turner, a lover who she is, does what she can and that, but this film could not be saved by someone any. It doesn't even have any style for them, and, from its director, one could expect that even if he didn't have anything else, it would have it. <br /> <br /> Bridge: C-
