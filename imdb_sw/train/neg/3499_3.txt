Among the Comedy has been successful with the original program using a professional community. Chapelle Show, The Mind of Mencia, The Daily Show and the famous popular Report of Colbert Report all of the professional artists and all it is, or in the case of Chapelle Show, were, demonstrating solid. Given that Sara Silverman is one of the best female artists in the business, I anticipated good things when I entered. I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> There were some gentle order of funny, but given that the star is the caliber of Silverman, the show can be better. It was just a trial, and hope to show next week it would be better. If not, get his help in the form of the best authors of the show.
