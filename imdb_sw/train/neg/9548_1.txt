I can't believe I watched this more than expecting. It starts well. This movie pushes the boundaries of the real way to go away! At least the first was true. It takes the first movie and even describes Joshua's Project. Anyone who knows anything about the computer will lose this hatred. It has one good message in it though, WATCH OUT FOR BIG BROTHER !!! The movie just makes it look like Big Brother is a big way than he really is. That was very encouraging. Even the participants' decisions were very bad. Some acting is very good. Some acting is bad even though. The script was similar in some points and completely deleted in another place. This movie begins easily every five minutes. As I said, I can't believe I expected to expect more. I think I will come in the nature of returning to the world ... Q
