What's a bad movie. Acting was bad, pacing was bad, the movie was bad, the lead was bad, "special effects" were bad. You expect a certain degree of evil in the slasher, but even murder was bad. First, the previous event that started the target of slaughter was continued for 15 or 20 minutes. I thought it could not end. They could have been removed 80% of these and explained what happened well. Then, the victims were invited to "meet" in a left school which still had all the services provided. One of the victims thought this was unusual, but they let it go and decided to break it in any way. Finally, the killings were very fake that they did not recognize. There is no reason to watch this film, unless you want to see the breast, and not the best milk. This film makes Children of the exhibition almost distinguish from the Kenyan Men.
