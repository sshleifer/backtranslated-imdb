Would you like to stand up? Then don't be away from this ... <br /> <br /> In the early circles, there are good colleges, but unless they have a good reputation, they have a chance of snow. Any controversial material and you are OUT! ... and I think I'm hurting as lost criminals, when I see who the hiding judges allow. <br /> <br /> 1 out of my top 4 made more than preliminaries. Half + administrators who gave me 0 laughs. Many of them have raised their material perhaps, something that the judges do not seem to have problems with. It is more fun than a lot of other things on TV, but it's very difficult to watch without thinking about what it would be. <br /> <br /> As producers changed the name of the "Clown Standing End" competition, all my resistance would be legitimacy. Maybe the idea?
