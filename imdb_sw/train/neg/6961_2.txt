I fully agree with the other views that the person should make the top of the tiger Lily and this film. It should be one of the worst French films I have seen for a long time (in fact with Brotherwood's Wolves, two awesome films in a very short period of time.) really sad because the cast is very interesting and the original idea is a kind of fun. proves that a good face and popular parents can get you into the movies but they don't have to give you a talent. .
