Watching Smother was perhaps a much longer-90-minute life of my life. There was no laughter found; in fact, I never remember ever smile. Diane Keaton was very much like a teen-a-teen-smoker hoarder, a book that holds a woman's behavior, an angry woman who has some kind of human disease. He is an observer, a busy, spiritual, young, narcissistic, and worse, who loves. I think I must briefly tell those other characters, but why are you worried? It was a long clich√©s of the film - a non-emerging gold family, which does not attempt to break into "Industry", gruff and perseverance but somehow still loves the father, a thin woman who can only 'We will take it again (but it goes beyond the collision resignation comes home), a group of dogs that are not available to chew rivers when everyone is away, etc.. I've never been a fan of Diane Keaton and Smother just to remind me of what. Engagement is excessive, no matter how many photos you made in your great time. His experiments in physical comedy were particularly embarrassing. What did the director think? I liked Dax Shepard and could even tolerate Liv Tyler, their performances were quite enough and bad that it was clear that neither actor was feeling about this movie. That was the same, because he did not I. I. Keaton's long walk without self-indulgence and was not at times Shepard had no feeling for him. At the end of the film I wanted to lock myself. Do not.
