What Bleep Is What We Know is looking at the illusion and meaningless on the secrets of the universe. We are presented by a specialist debate (no one called) who makes and promotes a non-scientific way. Their interviews have been cut off from small groups caused by spreading in other areas of cgi and banal mini-plots. The film's film continues from science, philosophy, theology and politics, reduces together regardless of accuracy, and somehow explores a few and wonderful conclusions. We are led to believe that the quantum physics tells us the purpose of our existence, and any other difficult to answer the question makers love to describe the finger. <br /> <br /> It is an error-written and logical error that is not a sequiturs. How did we start in the quantum mechanics and end up with this secular and scientific spirit? It's like to say 'two and two equals four, so I can move things and my thoughts'. Nothing / nothing in this movie, and nothing is right. Any viewer selected will be subjected to severe editing, unnecessary and useless destruction and lack of substance. Educated observers will be overwhelmed by tears and the violence that has occurred in science and everything that this film touches.
