Where do you start with the movie as bad as this? <br /> <br /> What! You say the cast of non-identical heroes? On top of doing? Wrong Script? Nothing /. You say that anyone drives money to see the film as poor as this requires their head to look at. I know I do. I respect the poorest poor who have seen in a little or no word from the mags as the Empire (usually a bad sign as a preview of the preview is not available for quality movie mags). However, movies should begin to think about providing cash payments if the customer is not happy with the finished product. I went three days after being opened by two other men. Just another person in the cinema was one bloke alone. <br /> <br /> And that was on a good night. Or the advertising campaign failed to break or the word spreads in many ways of this country just this stinker. Not since the Avengers (1998) I have heard it very easy since watching the film. If a partner comes around with this video in a few months, make sure they give your electric bill while watching. Tara Fitzgerald deserves a prize for incompetence - or walking away; Keith Allen deserves the glory in the midst of the killing of movies; Barry Foster should have been arrested on the set for his performance, Rhys Ifans does his work no favor after the success of Notting Hill and just Dani Behr is seen as a busty secretary. He / she was in the Word, any expectations of viewers of his ability to act should have been too low to start. The values ​​of production are not bad for a clear budget but the script is bad. If you want to hear a group of unrelated characters say "Fak!" for a couple of hours then this should be right on your street. Otherwise, bargepoles are required. <br /> <br />
