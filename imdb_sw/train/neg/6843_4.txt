Excellent exploitation is hit on black and white written by David F. Friedman. Stacey Walker's guide is well cast and an amazing spectacle. She resembles Renee Zellweger who has a shock and bad hair-doing. This chick made only two films and then returned to Texas. Music is awesome. One of her boyfriends plays with Sam Melville (from the TV show ROOKIES) using a different name. The best line in the movie from Tony - "Do you put me, doll? chicks?" Good for B / W movies from Laslo Kovacs (EASY RIDER & TARGETS & many others). Good places (swimming pool, also used for WITNESS). Last but bright. 4 out of 10. The best performance of Stacey Walker.
