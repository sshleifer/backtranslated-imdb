When I watch the film, I know that it's 'just a movie,' but even I would like to allow myself to consider as much as possible under the circumstances. I think this is what makes us stop, shout, laugh, or otherwise respond to the emotion as the audience of the audience, though, down, we know it's just 'movies.' What I don't want is for the movie to remind me that it's just a movie that I can not incorporate into the previous engrossment regardless of the quality of the film. The director of this film chose to use most of the camera angles at the same time on the screen. Maybe I am the only one, but I feel that this is very inspiring and irritating. They can also run the underlying banner under reading screen, 'caution: This is just a movie. Do not let you be very interested or replacing. If I want 'photo-in-photo', I will activate it from my TV browser, but never during the movie I like to enjoy.
