I couldn't wait to see this film. Almost half way through the movie, I couldn't wait to stop. All the characters (white) were giving out their lines as Woody Allen said, "Say like this ..." Then they said their lines on the screen as they tried to imitate Woody Allen. It was very angry. We all know how Ferrell will talk, and he doesn't know about his words as Mr. Allen. The beautiful part of this film was just as amazing as a tragedy and definitely never even interesting or even entertaining. I must admit that I have never been a big fan of Woody Allen, and this movie certainly hasn't changed me. I think his writing was as bad as his direction. This movie will drop as one of the 10 worst movies I saw.
