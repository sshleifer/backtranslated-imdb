In addition to the film shows, this film was good for mid-50 years. Acting was on the average stinker of the budget but the direction was terrible. Several events were magnified out for a long time in an attempt to stop and the effects were not available. The skull attack on the pond should be completely removed from the final cut and every attempt to bring life to the skull was obvious to the stick and stick. I also can't help but think the budget could not provide the house so they could make references to the movers and that all items in the store should come soon. In fact ... it would be more of entertainment than the worst movie. It wasn't bad enough to be a bad "bad" movie but it wasn't good enough to be "good" either. Get the MST3K version ... it's more fun.
