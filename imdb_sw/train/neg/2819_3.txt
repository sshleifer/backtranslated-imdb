Marquis De Sade, Egypt, ancient Gnostic rituals, Robert Englund in the role of two, free sex and magic, murder and violence ... on the paper Tobe Hopper's Revision looks like it should be at least having fun, entertainment flick due to ingredients. It is not. It's a little, odd plot that brings little entertainment. Certainly there is no more conspiracy about the subsequent worship of De Sade's work for some unusual reason they feel the need to deceive the daughter of the local Christian archaeologist and kill him. That's pretty much - I think it has something with Gnostics but who knows what they were writing. Most of the films are aggressive to fight as the heroine is shown by various hostilities, the dream of dreams and encounter erotic, intercut and events of Englund as De Sade imprisoned in the 19th century to chew the environment. It seems like the creators were trying something big but nothing they did was buried in cheesiness, acting badly, breathing and looking at lesser heads. <br /> <br /> Not many good points. Robert Englund is happy to watch, as always with the leading actor, Zoe Trilling, while not very talented, is interesting and in various stages of freezing through movies but watching Terror Night is chore. At least I have seen a film that "When you become a criminal like me" from the Australian certification certification guidelines that were in front of many VHS technologies from the nineties that came out.
