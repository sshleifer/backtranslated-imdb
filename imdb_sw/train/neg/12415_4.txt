I do not remember "Barnaby Jones" being no more than a very bland, the level of common spying where, as with Quinn Martin any show, the Act was murder, II Act was a leading tendency out of murder, the III Act was Act The IV was a resolution and Epilogue was Betty (Lee Meriwether) asking his wife Barnaby Jones (Buddy Ebsen) how he realized the crime and then someone saying something good at the end of the show. One thing I remember was the late, a beautiful songmaker of Jerry Goldsmith's theme. Surprisingly, the sequence of the opened loan makes me see the display and continue to seven show seasons was on air. I will also acknowledge that it was good to see Ebsen in another role except Jed Clampett despite Ebsen being very bad. I just liked the show was more entertaining than when I first remembered. Update (1/11/2009): I watched an interview with Jerry Goldsmith's author on YouTube through an American Television channel. Let's just say that I was kinder than Goldmith about the show "Barnaby Jones."
