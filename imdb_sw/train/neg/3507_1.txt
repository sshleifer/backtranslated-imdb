The lower step in human cooperation was reached by the Maysles writers and this film. Remember, you who have used the words as "Catholic" when you look at this film, that these mayor's orders are not just what happened to drive in the Hamptons and to happen to shoot the film to other Muslim people. No, when they found these poor people who were concerned they had to present their project (and consider what they told the money people to sell the project). Then they contacted two more dangerous women. There is no mental meeting here or real participation of the partnership. These bad crops screamed, donkeys kissed, they did whatever they needed to get Beales to cooperate and then use them as viciously as it was ever done. One would like to think that these hustlers had a constant sadness and guilt. But the film-making process, due to organizing, real shooting and then editing has been a long time and their goal was not actually attached to Beales as human beings. Film-based films from many people. By the time they found their films were damaged by what they did here. Their name as human beings is execrable. That's what people will remember as. Humblers great.
