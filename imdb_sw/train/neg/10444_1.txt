The only thing about the movie is his head. In this case, the "Snake on the Birds" is an example of not judging the book for its covering, the head does not say something about the movie. When I came to the theater, I did not expect Kane of Citizen, I was struggling on Freedom Day, a popcorn film, but instead, I got a bad movie of Roy Liotta called "Turbulence" Yes, this is too bad SOAP. The only thing to do SOAP best is his head. And not any movie header, he did not have a picture of "snake" or "bird" 40 minutes on the film! It is a false advertisement! If it was not for his head, SOAP would have been just another inexpensive b-grade movie summer. And the rate of R? It should be of R unsuitable R movie tested at all! The film makers only add a few f words to do this R, All violence is stored at the pg-13 level. Do you know what R tested? R rated bribes star! See him in Summerslam instead of losing your money on snakes!
