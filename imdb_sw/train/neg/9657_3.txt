1) Not a weapons expert, but I even see the difference between U.S. in WWI and WWII. In the film we can see solitary, armed with "M1 Garand" (established in 1932!), It is incorrect "1903 Springfield" (aka "Silent Death"), who is offensive to WWII. The difference - M1 can load two times more than the shot and 3 times more than the fire rate! M1 was half straight, Springfield needs to restore again after the shot. A little different? 2) The German Army uniform has borrowed in 1940 too. Exactly - helmets. German Helmets until the end of WWI you have a high pike on, we can't see even one in the movie. And if we do additional searches in memory - what is this truth "True Story"? I am wondering, how much "truth" can be film directors in search of affordable results.
