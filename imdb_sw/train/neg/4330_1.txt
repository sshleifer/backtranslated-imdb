Last night I decided to look at the prequel or I would say what is called prequel by Carlito's Way - "Carlito's Way: Increased Power (2005)" which was directly on the DVD ... it is not surprising ...... S% & KS completely! The waist of time looking and I think it will be a good waist to write time about it .... I don't understand how De Palma agreed to produce this sh # t-fest of the movie .... except just one fact that I tip my hat ... Jay Hernandez who plays Brigante little .... reminded me how De Niro got in Brando shoes to describe the little Don Corleone in Godfather II ... but different De Niro was amazing and even got Oscar for it! Jay Hernandez well has to hit the disease by trying to be a little Pacino .... very bad for him I don't think he will be playing on the film again and through after watching this sh # $% movie, sitting down and looking at the original carlitos way to get it The bad taste from my mouth.
