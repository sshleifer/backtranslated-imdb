Have you ever heard the movie of horror in Taiwan? Or any movie in Taiwan? Propably because. This was very interesting, although it has black magic as well as the damaged bodies and people are coming from inside and thousands of bees. <br /> <br /> After reading the ideas of other people, I had a desire for violence and gore, but there is not much. Some puking of blood and substances, if you are waiting for a graphic logo or any adverse effects will be broken. They did not use the use of fibers and other items for their maximum size. <br /> <br /> Nothing good about this movie; One character that was not quite bland with a few black black magic spells, like one eel. The plan was controversial and interesting. The characters were thin and angry, including the main character. The element of fear had no work at all, a horrible thing was a albino girl (not really awesome). This is the worst movie of Asia of fear that I have ever seen.
