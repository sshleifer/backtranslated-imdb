I hate to throw out the lines like this, but in this case I feel it should be: the American remake of GRUDGE is by far the worst films I saw on the movie over the past 5 years. There, I said. And now that I've got out of my system, please let me explain why. When a person dies in a fury of anger, the curse is born. But it gathers at the place of death. Those who meet them will be used by his wrath. That is the basis of GRUDGE and I will agree to be exciting. Those who meet the "curse" are actually used by his fury and that's all you get. You want more? Very bad, some critics and fans say that the only purpose of GRUDGE is to fear you. talking, pictures and sounds are not only available. Director Takashi Shimizu, connecting George Sluizer and fixing his original film (s), strives to create the atmosphere in the first hour? this: <br /> <br /> -design into the home / / <br /> - something that shines with the camera and / or the strange sound is being heard / it is going to explore <br> /> <br /> -som when it begins to sound the voice <br /> <br /> - The person sees the soul / gnome / scream and / or head <br /> <br /> - explore black <br /> Before the audience even given a sense of conspiracy, this same situation opens 5 times for the first hour. At first it was somewhat creepy. The subsequent use was interesting as the film continued. At the end of the film around, my friend and I were wondering if this area would end "with a loud noise and black cutting." We had no mistakes. <br /> <br /> The movie has no story line, instead of being opened in a series of vignettes that leave the trembling audience. I have no problem with an unfamiliar story when doing justice. Film is running from time to time without rhyme or reason. I have not seen a film in the same situation since the opening of the HIGHLANDER exhibition version 2. This method of writing a story makes any kind of secret which the film can have. If you already know ghosts are afraid of two characters to death, how is it shocking when their bodies are available in the apartment? And why should we take care when the investigator tries to investigate the disappearance of secrecy when we already know what happened to everyone? In fact the second green version of the American RING version made $ 15 million at the first weekend, THE GRUDGE is nothing but imitating counted as a real movie. The worst thing about GRUDGE is that it has made $ 40 million for the first weekend and some people see it as "the worst movie made." I wonder what happens to those who are used to anger to pay to see the GROUGE?
