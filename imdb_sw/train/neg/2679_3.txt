(SPOILERS AHEAD) Russian dream "actioner" (and I spend inappropriate time) which I have tried to look over a year. I have finally reached you and now I would not have made any efforts to repeat. In an effort to save two hours of your life I will tell you a plot - a boy who has a long-term project out of his hand returns home to see his mother. Things turn out after being beaten by a friend of an old girl's girlfriend. He takes revenge on the boy when he brings the girl home. The boys mafia mother takes her men to take revenge when the fighters start looking for her again. Little things say. there is no real definition for anything (such as why they fast the girl's trick in the reserve) and the stage, for the most part is all off the screen. This film has a husband who looks like Adrian Brody looking at the edge and saying anything, killing people (off the screen-most of the action happens off the screen). It looks good, it has done well and if there is some kind of reason for what is going to be a good film. Hell, I would like to have a real sense of the original character (all we know is that the boy was chosen as a child). The movie runs the best part of two hours and it feels like its six. If they did not come to tell us anything they could at least take that speed it seemed like it was moving very fast. Instead we find the hero on the boat. Hero in the bus, the hero walk, the hero looking to disrupt.Hero and his girl. It has misled me since I thought this might be a good film if they did something or someone could say something more meaningful than giving "get this person". <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 It's about four hours (all my experiments to see this) I never return. It is for those who want to see the Russian act of spiritual action and a very small step
