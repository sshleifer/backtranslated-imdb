O man, do you? This movie is on! If you have ever been afraid of a review of the type of slasher, done at the best possible and if you are cautious at the same time (pc-friendly, it means no dirt, a common feature of slasher films) Cut it. Each session returns without having fun. Oh, acting is renewing the word. I had to know well if translating directly to the Dutch head would have closed me.
