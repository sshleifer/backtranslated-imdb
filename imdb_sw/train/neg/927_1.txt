I really mean, Charles Band, the Head of Month, how would he allow the full ball as DEMONICUS out. I mean I should never get green light to start. The story is repeated, the characters are more weak, no real story on another Tyranus then is a bad dude. Then the authors or director goes his way to the worst end. That is the end bad end, Demonicus increases. The last Savior flees to the cave of death, then the image of Chimera comes to life, for the cheapest I can increase and expel. Then going home Ala FUNHOUSE. Damaged centuries ago it emerges because there is no fall on it. I mean, that's useless. What? Hell was what Charles thought to allow this puke to be done, and four film companies that were based on movies? They could ask me, I had a good opinion DEMONICUS. MAKING TURKEY.
