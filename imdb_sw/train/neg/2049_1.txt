At least I was surprised to enjoy a movie that is amazing since I was hard to stay. For all honesty, I think it's a covering of DVD's most cost-case movie. And saying that it is the same director as The Boogeyman, when the new version of it came out ... the girls touch good, it was a misleading enough to beat me. One thing that had been more misleading than the unsuccessful act of copycat was her hair cut. You usually just look at that kind of hair on a ten-year-old boy and that kind of attitude did that. The movie seems to have been shot by a D + pupil of a movie film exciting using every film technique he learned while attending classes .... sometimes, the youngest is younger. Through out I would like to get lost and lost to a random plot that led to anywhere or not explained. All this makes bad movies but when the end hasn't come close to connect together, well, that makes the movie odd. Of course this is the worst movie I've ever seen, and this includes the last video of French friends for a senior high school year, but maybe I'm a little fun, I mean to have extra play. P.S. I don't think this even deserves the stars ... even half. FOR YOU!
