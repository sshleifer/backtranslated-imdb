Make your own mind. Personally I found it a pleasure to receive a spinal cord from Stevie Wonder. No mistake Mr. Wonder. Maybe it's comedy, but I just found it stupid. It is not the first choice of babies; Wheeler (Seann William Scott) and Danny (Paul Rudd), two energy drinkers, avoiding prison time are court orders to advise two children from the development center run by Gayle Sweeny (Jane Lynch). One of the misfits is Ronnie (Bobb'e J. Thompson), a five pastor pastor and another is Augie (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), a young man who plays in a wonderful world. Wheeler and Danny are trying to give their expenses within the value of life, love and heavy metal. Lynch is careful with its dry analogies. Help is: Elizabeth Banks, Ken Jeongg, Kerri Kenney-Silver, Amanda Righetti and David Wain.
