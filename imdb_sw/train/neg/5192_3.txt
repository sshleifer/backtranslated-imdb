It won't take long to see why the name of the name: the head of the diamond didn't do on the network schedule. The TV film experiments are not available credit before it becomes obvious that it will be bad. Maybe I missed something, because the plot did not do much of the mind. Depending on what I came out of the mud, the dealer or the thief or something called "Tree" (Ian McShane) goes to Hawaii to steal something to do with a secret weapon. Johnny Paul (Roy Thinnes), the secret writer of the dullest world, has stopped him. Can there be more, but believe me? it really does not matter yet. Workout videos should be in action. When caused, you should be concerned. And the best time should be the game. Nothing in the Name of the Code: Head of Diamond. I have seen others using the word "turgid" to describe this done by the TV snoozer? and it is better than any definition of a word I can bring. No characters are in a little exciting or worth caring. And Roy Thinnes makes the worst possible direction. Its charisma is a little bit north of the slug. Ian McShane is the most simple movie that goes to it, but unfortunately for everyone else involved, it doesn't seem like he will return as a regular member of the cast. Now if McShane is hit in a series of series, then you might have something. I am quick to see that these Gawd films containing the 70th celebrations for TV are making many of the Hidden Secrets of the 3000 Theater. And that goes twice as Quinn Martin was involved. Very good things from Mike and Bots. So when I give only a 3/10 film, I check out # 608 to 4/5 on the MST3K score.
