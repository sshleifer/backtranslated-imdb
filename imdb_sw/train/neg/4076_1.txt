This lesson deserves the best script, and the end result, than this movie is used. The script is full of holes because it has never been conceived as a story, but there is a string of dreams that are bound together. Restrictions and endless lines in the line of stories are many. The place where the victim is being told that his parents did not die, and they have been looking for him since he was taken, is just amazing. It is written as a time of therapeutic therapy and the head of the run to give him a "missing poster" since he was eight years old. In the real world, if the head of the flight found that, under its roof, the kidnapping of kidnapping, would have been tracked would have been a quick call to the police. It is a matter of law enforcement is not part of the 12th minute of Oprah. Everything that follows from there to the end is very short that I can only conclude that the first 90 minutes was for free use. Funny, that's how this film is supposed to complain. At the end it is already joined.
