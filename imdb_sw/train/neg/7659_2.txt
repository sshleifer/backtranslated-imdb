In The Darkness is one movie of BAD and bound by Deuce Bigalow for the worst movie of the year. I would like to say I must say but in fact IMDb says a word of the word and all. <br /> <br /> I have two ideas on what kind of bad movie is the worst kind of bad movie. The low budget has fallen as the Red Zone Cuba, Monster A Go Go and Manos. Or a great budget of shame like Gigli, Superbabies or this guff. You see movies like Monster A Go Go and Manos happen because the director has no clue. A film like this happens because the director is a fool, the money takes idiot who doesn't care about his audience. It is more frightening when you think that Uwe Boll (the behind this terrible trick and already has a real garbage under his belt) has created something that happens just once in the blue month. Very terrible films. Everything about it is a mess. Cheesy CGI, the evil plot, reduced to random cameras and sounding sounds. <br /> <br /> Alone In the dark is a bad movie that should be looked at by anyone. Woo hoo! Check again. Give me a bud, roll on 2006 and I can never say again. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this film.
