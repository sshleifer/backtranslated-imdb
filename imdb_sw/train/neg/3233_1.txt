It's people, you can't be bad, another advertising advertisement time is not at all! This is not very traumatic or horrible or caused - it is just a very frightening amateurish event, made for another party to keep girls. Gore is too bad, even the eye-is far away and makes me want to puke but it makes me want to take a camera and defeat those people on the head. The girl sitting just on the face of the ball, not moving at all. It would be funnier to use a real doll instead. One season "I am a celebrity, welcome me here!" is more afraid than this. Don't waste your time or money.
