My wife and I agree that this is one of the worst films made. Indeed in the top ten of those I have watched all the way. At least "The 9th arrangement" was excited. I really enjoyed "Christine", "Death Zone", "Firestarter", "Carrie", and some of his other films. I didn't care too much for "Cujo" (just because the voice was so bad in the versions I saw and I often didn't tell what people said), or "Pet Sematary (Pet Cemetery)". <Br /> <br /> But this mess was a mistake for every way. "Creatures" themselves seemed designed and aged 9 years. (There is no mistake for children aged 9 years).
