'Anita and Me' is a growing game for various British states, instead of 'Bend It Like Beckham', or more closely, 'East is East', which shares the 1970s settings. Black Country accents, but the film is not suitable 'East is the east of the East and the results seem to be thin and love. Additionally, the display of the relationship between the film, between the Asian girl and her white friend, does not mean to ensure the way in which the movie is closed around. I grew up with the fatigue of the film where years of warrior being a writer, this is usually something that real authors have found, but hardly a new feature in false stories. 'East is East' was happy and bright; 'Anita and Me' seems obvious and lighter in comparison.
