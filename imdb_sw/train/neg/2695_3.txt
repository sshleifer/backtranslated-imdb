When I go to a video shop to rent a flick I often believe the IMD view on the film and, up to this, has never seen a flick 7.0 or above flick on the site I didn't like. Sidney Lumet, director of the story of some of the best 20th century films, has actually lost here by making the most serious offenses of a filmmaker who can: fill a filmed film for uninformed characters with no real character of redemption. > <br /> I love films and characters, but no matter what the black man is we all have light there too, we are gray shades and better or more than others. Mr. Lumet crossed this line by filling this film with quite a concern and around the black-black characters. Hank's Ethan Hawke is the 30th thing to stretch, the young, innocent from marriage to the wife who hates him and the daughter who thinks he is a traitor, which he is very much. His calmness and willingness to allow others to do dirty work because he is very fearful to do so himself causes their two-way plan to fall apart from the mother to be killed. By the time he stands with his brother at the end of the film, it is more amazing than raising it. Ethan Hawke has a good attitude, but is not given much to work and as it is shown as a man with a boot always standing on their face and 'does not care exactly that is there. Speaking about which his wife's behavior is the same as bad. Almost every single shot of films is in her words to tell her about taxes and money for child support and grinding more in her old lack of and insulting. Hardly, that's about all the habits. Her harpy character has limits on evil. Albert Finney plays their father Charles, and when Mr. Finney has been a good actor for many decades, he uses almost 90% of this film and the same mouth opening half-grimace on his face as he has trouble because The worst trouble of the constipation world. For someone who has been an actor for a long time as Mr. Finney, you think he would have a much greater ability to pass. Even though it does not show much, his behavior thinks that sadness is full of anger. And when he strikes Andy at the conclusion of the film is the same as Dr. Frankenstein put the monster he helped to build out of his own trouble. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <3 /> <br /> <br /> <br /> is not given much by its character. He went into an unhappy marriage with Andy and had a relationship with his brother for some reason. When Andy's world starts around without control he jumps to fly the ship, but in fact it does not make him less self-centered or serving himself than any other character in the film, but maybe one with the least common sense. And finally we come to Andy, we played with Philip Seymour Hoffman, just good, that's the only reason I scored this 3 film instead of 1. His performance of the money-laundering heroin "perfect crime" of stealing his parent's insurance shop is in search of awry is measuring. Its deficit from the quiet tenant of the deceased plan of deception, the integrity of human killings is honest and sad. Hoffman's behavior ends up as a great man of the film, but it is difficult to collaborate against him being given an alternative way of a young brother and a father who admits to having an early pregnancy pregnancy led to the psychology of his last son and the murder of his mother without giving birth. Finally this film is only worth looking at PSH's best performance and lack of family trains. Don't expect to have any suitable characters to enjoy, because they don't have the truth.
