John Goodman's software was very good, but this is just plain. The only thing in this mess that makes a smile was to recognize the voice of Patrick Starfish as Frosty. The story will not be optimistic, written by someone who has blocked the record of child rebellion but has never experienced any adult experience in the intervening years. Paranoia oversees the dark world that these characters live. Everyone is bad, and without reason. The plan is predictable but the lurches of the show from the odd one, unconnected scene to another in a non-meaningless way to watch it. The worst thing is no workers in production seem to have ever seen snow!
