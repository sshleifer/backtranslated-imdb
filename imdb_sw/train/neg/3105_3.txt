I can't believe how anyone can make a comedy on the issue as well as a lack of housing. Of course, Brooks hasn't made a comedy about _real_ homeless people. No mention of drugs, prostitution or violence on these roads. The people we meet in this film do not live in the country of fantasy so the only difference between them and we are not eating often. Brooks movies have become worse and worse for years. This is another nail in the coffin.
