First, CGI in this movie was bad. I watched it during a bad movie marathon at SciFi station. At the end when the reserve owner is killed, it is probably one of the worst examples of the CGI I saw. Even the dead of the dead was the best animation. <br /> <br /> That said, movies did not have a close plot. Why were they on the island exactly? Indeed, it was not described in the film. And, why will people continue to come to the cat's area? You have no meaning. One thing that was standing in this film was a good acting. In what can be called "B made for film films" movie, acting was very good. Parry Shen stood especially. If you don't have anything to do on Saturday, check out this film. It can be good for some memorable quotes.
