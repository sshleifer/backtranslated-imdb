First of all I must accept Batman: The series of animation is the best series of batman for far. We watched it while you were on TV. I did not know that there was a fourth season. Actually did not. BTAS ends with the 3rd season, and should be stopped there. Why they had to mix with something good. Ivy's Catwoman and Poison now have a gray gray face. Joker looks more scary, it seems that every time they fix its appearance she looks more and more creepier. He doesn't seem to have any more students, and now they don't even have to look away from man (though he is). <br /> <br /> Bruce Wayne is shown by Kevin Conroy who plays the best batman. Although now it looks like a superman. There is nothing that puts it away because all seem to be the same, Bruce Wayne now has blue eyes. <br /> <br /> Night Wing you need to cut hair, please! Alfred has only students from the eyes, it looks more like a character from the 80s. each section). <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Batman: A series of animation, there is no batman season 4. They only included this series as the 4th season for sale. If they just opened it as the adventures of New Batman I don't think most people would have purchased. <br /> <br /> Close your desires and cling to 1-3 seasons.
