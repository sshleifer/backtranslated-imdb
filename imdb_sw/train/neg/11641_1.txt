Although I am usually a member of a well-designed film, I do not fully know the films that avoid those limits, and more often than we enjoy and love movies that are successful "breaking the law." And it is true that the director Pasolini breaks the rules of the original movie. But it is also my opinion that he does not break the success or for any real point. The work of Pasolini is hitting information through photography, but this is not less than what is actually on the screen than it is. to be shown, and to fly to his films is seen under the issue of artistic choice than the result of amateur movies. This is true of DECAMERON. Pasolin often prefer to use non-actors, and when most directors have done so with extraordinary results, under the direction of non-actors Pasolini remain non-actors. This is true with DECAMERON. Pasolin often includes pictures made by surprise, hurt, or otherwise disturb the audience. Such things can be used for an amazing effect, but in the hands of Pasolini such things are not seen to contribute anything to the film. This is true with DECAMERON. I have been given to understand there are many people who are interested in, even interesting films. However, I have never met any of them, and I have never read anything about Pasolini or its work that has made such a good cause or surprise to me. I judge him for his work alone, I have a suggestion that he was essentially a young director who "did not break the law" too much for a choice as for lack of skills - and who was originally applauded by his mind for his "courage," thus proving only in odds as a film manufacturer. I see his stimulating, surprising, and engaging work. And this is also true of DECAMERON. Also, sadly, in fact almost every Pasolini film has been my unfortunate tolerance.
