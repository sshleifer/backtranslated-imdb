Della Myers (Kim Basinger) is a housewife who lives in a private condom in the neighborhoods with her twins and her husband, Kenneth (Craig Sheffer). Della gives all the attention to the twins, leaving their homes and her appearance and frustrating Kenneth. On Christmas day, he runs a local night in order to buy a cover sheet for gifts, and they do not have any parking space available. When he sees an old car planted in two ads, he leaves a message to the owner calling him "jerk selfish". When the packing stores, Della's car holds up with the old car driver and is threatened with four punks? Chuckie (Lukas Haas), Huey of Afro-America (Jamie Starr), Vingh of Chinese-American (Leonard Wu) and Latin Tomás (Luis Chávez). When the patron protects him, he is shot by head with Chuckie, Della runs his car trying to escape from criminals. However he hits his truck near the forest when he is chased by the group. He takes a box of tools and hides in the wood, fighting against a live group. Several days ago, I saw the trailer of "When He Was Out" and I was eager to watch DVD. Unfortunately the trailer is better than the film, and I am completely broken by this inappropriate and improper collection of clichés. Della Myers is presented as a unsafe woman with a offender and does not know if she is a wife; The mother is only her interest in her family concept. He is driven by four criminals but defeats them with a tool box that appears to be a batman zone. Therefore, the plot is an incredibly irritating one. A group of criminals is composed of a favorite American movie, and Afro-American, Chinese-Latin and Latin as well as American master to be politically correct. Kim Basinger does a good job, but their children are very young for fifty-five years old. My vote is four. Headline (Brazil): "Enquanto Ela Está Fora" ("When He Was Out")
