Fear ... just awesome. Probably the worst movie I saw. And I saw some beautiful pictures, for many years. Sound grows and so the quality of the image, direction, acting ... etc, etc.. Clear only good (meaning funny, because it is very bad) is a special effect. In general there are 5 minutes worth laughing. Some flick gives brain damage.
