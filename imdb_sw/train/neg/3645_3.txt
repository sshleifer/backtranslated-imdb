Young people get a bad day of hair, goes to a hill, and falls into where they can't escape. Then, meets MR. ATLAS, "mythological" dude from 2000 years ago as his best friend, and Arnold Schwarzenegger look-and-sound alike. Herculean's power helps the boy without risk, and later changes modern life. Why is it a great deal? This is the most interesting idea for the "journey" of the family! In any way, this should not be completely tested, indeed! Our false character of power and brawn is nothing more than an ordinary visitor who looks normal to the whole world. Adding to insult is a lack of something new or interesting, and before you know, there are some experimental attempts that do not deserve this as “family” entertainment. The area where Atlas complains to its people engaged, are wondering, though. Just use the beautiful, quiet afternoon afternoon in the reserve change.
