HEY ARNOLD! The first came the air in 1996, I looked at it. It was one of my favorite performances. Then the intervals began to be displayed regularly so I couldn't wait for new periods and stopped watching them. I was surprised when I heard about HEY ARNOLD! MOVIE since it doesn't seem to be popular as some of the other Nikkelodeon other as SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS. However, without having anything better to do, I went to see the film. Entering the theater, I didn't expect you very much. I was waiting for it to be a duplicate of the cartoon film of children as the movie of RECESS was. I think I've got what I expected. It was a little kiddie movie and no more. There was a good place here and there, but for the most part, the movie was stinker. For children only.
