This is not the worst movie. The plan (a new house built next to the house seems to be haunted) is not bad, feeling is enough, and acting is the same. The biggest problem I had was that, with experience with Lara Flynn Boyle (from Twin Peaks and other exhibitions), I could not cross how different was shown by her big, new mouth. I kept watching them. They seem so out of place on his face! They make him quite different (and not better). Mark-Paul Gosselaar, an actress who plays Kim architect who creates and pours his heart and soul into the house, does a good job. And Lara (like Col) is also very good (but the lips!) As the owner of the second home. Her husband, Walker (Colin Ferguson) is a proper timber. Different characters who live in the house were also good. I loved Pie (Charlotte Sullivan) and her husband, Buddy (Stephen Amell), the first people to enter the house. The attempt to involve us in the neighborhoods of the whole neighborhood fails, unfortunately, if some neighbors do not like it. <br /> For some reason the director could not make the house "haunted" particularly awesome. Other movies (such as Amityville Horror, The Legend of Hell House) can reach the same sense of destruction, but it does not give here. Almost when Col shows a picture of a house. Another thing that didn't work for me was to lose a plot that happens to Kim, an architect. At first, he seems to be a victim of a house like others (it has caused him to be in a hurry), but later he seems to have joined it with evil. <br /> <br /> Overall, not bad movie for fans of panic if you can take your eyes away from big lips!
