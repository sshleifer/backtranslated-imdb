What?! ?? Why do people say this is "mind blowing?" Only the last face is on the last end in the movie history! 4 left and the whole world is gone! Not to mention the character 9 was idiot all the time he got everyone killed. 1 was right all the time, if he gave the sacrifice 9 then it would have happened. People giving there live because of stupid and why? ... make rain? I agree that the film was part, and the whole idea was interesting. But much of it was one clich√©s after another. And did anyone feel that this is like "Lord of the Rings?" Participants died for stupid reasons, there was almost no development of behavior, and honestly asked to have only four people left in the world; Its useless and stupid. It was one of the short movies I have ever seen, and thank God! What? Robots turn against human creativity in any way! It's done as a hundred times! This film is stupid, tablet see a film that fits to look like Star Trek, Hangover, or Basterds of Pride, those were good movies!
