James Bond in the wilderness? That's the way it looks: Pierce Brosnan is after all known as Bond in "Tommorrow Never Dies" (1997) and "Golden Eye" (1995) - all shot before this release. In fact, the direction of all this film is very bad, and Brosnan turn into more active lobby, and Annie Galipeau (like Pony, Gray Owl love interests) have a battle with no matter-chat text. Two women, on the other hand are perfect. But the film is not about aunt. It is about the Canadian grasses. And when the picture can be good, no real grit to live in wilds. Annie Galipeau, like Pony, fails to convince, unfortunately, because I wanted to believe her. She was twenty years old on this film, and could work, but Richard Attenborough was probably not so hard on her. She looks at her to be dangerous, which in fact she is .. but in the wrong way. <br /> <br /> But one thing to be sure, it looks a perfect image. But mascara and leafy leaf in the desert? It is not appropriate, especially if he looks just to walk a forest experiment with Bond (sorry, Gray Owl), and use pictures of close-up pictures. <br /> <br /> I have lived with the forest people in the Western Pacific, and they just don't look at this beautiful and stay so sweet while fighting for survival. That brings me to another stage: the film is not suitable for the period that has been installed: 1930s. can add time to action. William Nicholson wrote a screenplay, and his recent offering, "Elizabeth, Golden Age" was opened three days ago, so I hope there is improvement. Yes, I have read the comments some have given, but I do not believe. Great potential, but used mishandled and even pregnant-pregnancy. If it had a religious film, it would have been closed, but because it prevents the environment, the film still remains on the opposition, since it is "politically correct." Sorry, for all that, don't buy. Amina.
