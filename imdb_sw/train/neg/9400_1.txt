It's unfortunate when a movie like this is done. A great job of work and money is installed on a film that is the best amateur. <br /> <br /> The editor is coming, there are obvious errors that can easily correct in taking a second, and the voice sounds do not think. More more can be done with this video movie. I think they ran when, or videotape. Hands-ons feel very clear.
