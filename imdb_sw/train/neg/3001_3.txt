Slaughter Top story of retaliation by a nerdy guy who was affected by one of the cold and coldest jokes in the history of the cinema. Unfortunately after opening open the flick went straight to hell. A very bitter and delicious taste with mediocre slashings and the last half at which sucked on a whole new level of suckiness. The boy who played the nerd committed suicide shortly after opening. If you want to pay flick to stop after prank and remember, choose life.
