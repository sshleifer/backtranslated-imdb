I did not suggest comments, but I wanted to make sure to warn people from this film. It is an unofficial film of the student without any redeeming features. On the technical level, it is quite an absolute - regularly return to the odd way into events, hitting off, etc.. The plot is quite clich√©d, the structure is laughable, and acting is a shame. I don't want to be too strict: I have done my part of the film students, and they were all bad, but there is no reason for this film to be out in the world where innocent fans should see. <Br /> <br /> A safe idea that - as suggested comments are films, friends, and family members.
