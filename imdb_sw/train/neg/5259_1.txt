When I finished watching this film I was very angry that I had lost two hours of my life. That's two hours I won't leave again. Ugh. When you start this you can think "Wow this is very good!" But rest assured that the first impression means NOTHING. I was very excited about this film to the end that I have ever seen. This movie is just awesome. Acting is bland, the line of the story is nothing but nature and nothing exactly on this but it's that WORST MOVIE IN !!! Don't see MOVIE HU! WARNING !! MOVIE IN YOU CAN YOU ASK IF YOU ARE SURVIVING THE 2 OF YOUR LIFE IN !!! 1/10
