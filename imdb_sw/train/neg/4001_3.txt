Having heard so much about the 1990s a series of Cracker without seeing any of them, I expected too much for this. Surely the combination of Jimmie McGovern and Robbie Coltrane could not fail. I was wrong! Evil, backed by a constant, constant and powerful wind, was more powerful. Production attempted to be modern-modern, but the boxes and even the font's font was offensive. Robbie Coltrane sleep-walked through two hours, coming up with an "explosive" understanding and probability, and the police were shown as the idiots of one cycle. As a result, the tension has not been built by the second-last area (no explanation for the fear of the perpetrators) was as bad as a piece of television as I saw for a long time. No, I don't want to see this again, but I will return to the DVD series of the 1990s to see if they match their attributes.
