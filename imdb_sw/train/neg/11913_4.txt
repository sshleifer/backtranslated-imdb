Good nice, misused. Although it would reflect 99% of SciFi movies, it applies here. I love the movies where the good news back is revealed slowly, and I love practical movies, and I love all the participants, so this can be good. However, despite the good acting, this film fails due to the bad writing of Bill Platt and leading. Another expert made a good step to find out where you're going to get there. This movie does not. It puts together in such an improper way that you know the words "second draft" does not exist in Bill Platt's vocabulary. There is one area that doesn't need a bit and can be removed without anyone noticing. This area even begins with ending with them driving, so you can cut from one location drive to another and never missed an area without a middle point. This movie also had a strange character of describing some of the details while on describing others, some up to where you can imagine a whole "plot". He also had a tendency to fight the fight early, perhaps just because they could not pay. There are also fewer incidents that "conspiracy" are revealed on the computer and the last battle with easy "adhesive poison" (weight, what is it?) its okay. He can overcome his "Roswell" several times and make for a good good chick (but not always). John De Lancie has the same character he plays in everything he has done since playing Q behind ST: TNG, so it's not new. All of them, I released this 4/10 film.
