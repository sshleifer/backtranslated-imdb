I am one of the millions of Columbo who uses the world and just looks at this, the part that started all over, on Channel 5. It's amazing to imagine what happened to the same film and I can only be surprised who saw the possibility of "Columbo" and added touch A little that make it a wonderful & classic series. That said, this film is not as good as others (except for the last period of shame and the British cycle). If Columbo has been made of the original 'experiments' of course without going for too long, or being watched and loved all over the world. In this film Lt Columbo is smartly wearing, gives a conventional car, has a partner, does not talk about his family's claims and comes as a mess. There is also no cat-and-mouse chemistry between Columbo and "villain". It seems, but with a novel to see how Columbo started.
