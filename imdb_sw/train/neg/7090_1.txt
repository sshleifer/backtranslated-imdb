I slept on my bed at 7:35 pm yesterday looking Larry Sanders (I usually DirecTivo it, but not last night). They came at 3am (banking on the west coast), and was fascinated to see this in HBO2. I was shocked at how poor this 'movie' was. Great. he was shocked. So he was surprised that I had to write a comment on the iMDB. This is really very bad. The writing is boring, but leading and destroying it is less than those of the freshman in the film school. It is a video. Remember, that is a shot on VIDEO, not a VIDEO OF DIGITAL. It looks like a soap opera. Skateboard video clips have more 'film' to feel them then this fear. I wanted to describe the poor leadership but I honestly do not remember anything. Shots and prevention are fools. Yes, I have chosen the word 'stupid'. not ordinary, not worried, not bold, not good, just stupid. I know people through this review will say "well give me an example". I don't know. It was at 3am. but believe me, I know you will look at yet, you will be admired by the horrible inspection. <br /> <br />
