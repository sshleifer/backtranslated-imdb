The concept of legal gray area in Love Crime contributes to 10% of the film appeal; 90% may be associated with it is very serious. To say that the performance of Sean Young as so-called district attorney is wood is a great fraud. With his bland suits and a hair of improper hair, Young does a good job in persuading listeners of his passion for men. Why would he ask his friend alone to be married so that he could be arrested by soldiers who are trying to take them? This hate is also the only reason to follow a misguided photographer who gives women a personal happiness and the power to drive behind this crappy film. Watching young goes from frigid to the full extent of the soil, but angry anger drives near the fire and lake. Looking at the rant and despair of self-indulgence and sexual frustration makes the Love of Crime a worth of tax lease, but it's descending down and down. With his desire to bring the character of Patrick Bergin to the right, his police skills are running away from him at the throat of his own desire for fatigue and passion. Patrick Bergin does a good job as a small sociopath; if it has worked in sleep with the enemy as surely as hell can work in this. But I can't help but ask if the lack of sufficient energy brings it to the clash of the film and its light. I think it makes and the result is "exciting" and fun which is quite bad and still comedic.
