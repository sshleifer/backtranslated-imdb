Please, show: This film, though a very good story, was one of the most horrible movies I have seenâ€¦ Just remember that before you sit on your sofa enjoy the film. Therefore, it starts off with the party. Your average party but there is someone there. She's pretty in Kate ... if you know what I'm saying. Face his face; will help you later. <br /> <br /> So Kate goes to get George Clooney (I didn't say the plot was bad?) and so it takes the tube. In London underground in the middle of the night, but he is just a fool. So the schedule says next, and in the end, the train will come for 7 minutes. Now Kate, the little girl's party that she is, decides that she can have a nap in a spare half. . Itself. Well, almost ... <br /> <br /> So the film goes from there. Blood, guts, feet, even some parts of the body that I will not mention have been blown and bursted and eventually removed from the body. In short, it is a common fear; A beautiful but heavy girl in the women of trouble and patients, psychological concerns. Or if the case might have it, it might. I would say to give them if you're logged in to Saw, Hostel or the Chainsaw Massacre of Texas but to others, shout out to meet the fears that need to thank you very much.
