Yep, the topic is a quote directly from the film and I think it's very accurate. I was too tired to die of this worthless effort. All flashes etc. without making sense after the first 20 minutes are just making a bad film + If you have epilepsy, you would have died three times already. Of course all the fans of David Lynch could have added the flag to this type of Turkey being "the best film made" because it doesn't mean anything and when it doesn't mean anything should be art, and movie art always good. Right? I say WRONG. This kind of fake art is an interesting way of trying to show that you are a good film manufacturer. Anthony Hopkins as a good actor should just sit acting.
