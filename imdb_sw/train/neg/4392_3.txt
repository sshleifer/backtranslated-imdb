The little scientist tries to continue his father's work on regeneration. Her powerful mother persuades her to be killed by her father and monitors its progress for its own evil purposes. The little doctor uses a reptilian DNA he extracts from a huge creature and when his hand is lost for a few minutes later, he isolates himself from his formula and grows a new hand to kill ... Really the special effects in "Separated relationships" are beautiful and pleasant, but the film The left is bad. The hand is a character like a snake and kills a few people. Work is mediocre and peak is silly.3 out of 10.
