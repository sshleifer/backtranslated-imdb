Sadly, this is not 'the best British film since hellraiser', although the DVD cover claims this, which is what deceived me in buying it. It is, however, honored by many old fears, the film from the very solid Amicus. <br /> <br /> Cradle ... is beaten on dv dv, which though we all know has more than a TV feel than the movie, it can be done better. Each area, the set and shot appears to have been prepared in the same way (common key, fill, set back), which only enhances looking for the finished piece. The year's content is, in fact, laughable. From the opening shots where we see the head of the ball in the shade of the cracked foam, in the face of the cheap hammers, the effects of the creature and the horrible cg, there was nothing there that was really interesting to me. It is a disgusting thing, from close-to-close detection to a gray brummie gray, through Dani Filth, a little boy to fear the bad movie I have ever preached. Each of the heads is more than a formula than the last, and the sets are getting worse and worse if the film runs. Beware of 'Intelligence' - a rural house with a half-dimensional sign, and the most amazing (and not the best way) of the available cell. Four attempts to reach the end of the film without my attention to walk (without, running) away from any space available. In fact I found myself dusting when one film was running. <br /> <br /> However, one mark of the last breast boot of Emily Booth, which I think is one (um, two) things go for it. Once you have been out of that way, it all comes out. I have heard people say good things about Alex Chandon, and I would like to believe, but for this evidence it is impossible for. If you want a good service to Amicus, avoid this and go to the Master's Master League instead. It is now fighting with Blair Witch 2: The Shadows Book in the name of the worst movie I've ever seen.
