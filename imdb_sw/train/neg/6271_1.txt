No words to explain how NIGHTMARE WEEKEND bad is. It's just the opposite. Something about a computer that can change personal items into cash balls that come into the mouth of the victims, which kills or converts them into zombies. The whole thing is so wonky that it's stunning. There is also a girl with a personal computer in her room and a computer chat through a puppet's hand !!!!!!!! I haven't done these things. Computers also control things like cars, although nothing connects the computer to the car. <br /> <br /> "film" is a general waste. The bad fruit of Surreal. Specifically, the bad rubbish of one-type. There are many sex scenes here and there, which are not too hot or good. There is even one area where a woman seems to do a love or wants to kiss French tarantula, which had me rolling on the floor. <br /> <br /> Of course one of the worst movies made. Up there with BOARDINGHOUSE of the video automatically generated directly, or BOOGEYMAN II (both of NIGHTMARE WEEKEND and BOOGEYMAN II have events and nail teeth!). Of course it is fun to enjoy and try to make sense of everything going on.
