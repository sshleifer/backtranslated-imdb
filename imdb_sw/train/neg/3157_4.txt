Indeed, it had some good film displays. The story of the story is good, if it's a bit of bland and acting it was good enough though I didn't understand why Olivia d'Abo had the same reputation of Australia if her character had to grow in the United States. My biggest problem, however, was with them. I know as a rule, a common American seems to be a fighter farmer with any European who honors but this was more than that. The color of Anna's color was positive ghastly! And that the potato sack, the sad forgiveness of the dress in the film has made me rest on the tanks. I think the idea was as realistic as possible (how many school teachers are walking around Prada?) But simple does not mean a complete lack of taste. Word wisely ...
