If you want to laugh like Cage, tax affairs. Cage is about two war heroes, Billy and Scott who are best friends. When Billy is shot in Vietnam, he cannot defend himself, so Scott takes him. I have never seen a movie with more gay reference to two main characters. Billy and Scott like to "fight" with Scott tells Billy that "it's still hard from last night," among other things. The short words to capture as "Move sh" t up "and" Ping "Pang Pong, cut sh! Indigenous American descent who are supposed to play members of the Mexican group are also a high score. As they say, "it's time for the party now. Ba-ba-ba ba-ba." I could go forever, but just watch this film with your $$ socket off. It was very funny I came out and bought a DVD for $ 5.99
