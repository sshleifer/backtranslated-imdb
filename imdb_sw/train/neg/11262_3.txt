Adrian has gone out of the park, rich and without parents, his life seems to be empty. One day, meets Gonzalo, a poor young man whose mother is a prostitute. Failure to get money, Gonzalo helps Adrian find his life and where his parents are. This is a movie from a new director, and it is quite clear in many films: incredible events accurately, a little forced conversation, some uneven in the script ... However, the end is unexpectedly well (well, just a little) and that saves a little film. Employees are known for good quality, however, are not encouraged enough to make the movie appear; all have made the best paper in other films. The film is caused by boring and perhaps you will spend a lot of time thinking about when you will go to the end. Of course there are many bad films, but, of course, there are many many better.
