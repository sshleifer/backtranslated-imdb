Some films are so bad that they are good. This is obviously not one of them. According to the true story, this film was as real to the story as the role of Pinocchio to be a real boy. Acting was terrible, the direction was poor, and it went the fastest way. It was as if the director just wanted to get back and make it back home. Neither Melissa Joan Hart never beat me as a talented actor, but then every film he made was very good - budget however. Like most of his other films, he leaves them down with his sweets so much, speaking very quickly as he hurts his words will make him more amazing. In fact it gives the impression that there are employees in front of him and talking to the camera, when he should involve the viewer in his behavior. It is a huge amount that reduces the entire film, and any foot that may have left to stand, is damaged. Maybe the only thing about the film is when he was nailed to the end. But even then he was not satisfied enough to win my delight for such a bad film. <br /> <br /> Check if your taste in the film is fewer than a piece of dried toast.
