I saw this film opening at the end of Australia at the end of Australia, hoping and throwing the best to Ledger, Edgerton, Bloom, Watts and Rush that the sure story of Ned Kelly will happen in front of me. Unfortunately, despite the excellent performance of Heath Ledger in the lead role, the plot was a lighter paper .... which is not recommended I read "our Sunshine". There were other passages, the support made by Edgerton in particular, the point of reference from Jordan (confirming his talent on the show at the Buffalo Soldier as well), and the production structure that gave a real sense of difficulty to the Australian bush, such as Ireland migrants. The early 19th century must have seen. But I can't help to hear that other opportunities have been lost to describe the real story of the heroes of the Australian people (or was he?) .... in what I think is the Hollywood agreement and selling pictures in the US. Oh well, at least Jordan and producers did not agree to lose only a beard to please Universal ... <br /> <br /> I think I just care for myself with the best Peter Carey "History of Kelly Gang". 4/10
