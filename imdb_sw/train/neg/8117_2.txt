The "terrible people" should be the image of this terrible film. If you want to see ordinary people doing normal things, then check out your window in real life. But if you want to see unhappy people doing good things, you will need to watch this awesome movie with Mike Leigh. The characters talk for a long time, but they never manage to communicate. Why not? It is possible because Leigh's things that are all of us are not working and pleasing as its actors, and he wants a real life film. But we are not, and failed.
