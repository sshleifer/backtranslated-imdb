this is undoubtedly the most horrible piece of evil that I have been looking at. The plot of the cinema is that someone else may be doing things and wearing like santa claus and killing people because she saw her mother give her dad when she dressed as a passage to Santa. WHY IS THE INVOLVING IN? is it just me or is that the worst reason for someone to go insane as EVER? and not the only thing. I am great when I say NOTHING HAPPENS IN THIS DAMN MOVIE. nothing until 1 hour and 15 minutes have gone. There is a whole area of ​​friggin where it finds a skull on it. THE GROUP OF THE GROUP. WHO HELL wants to see what? however I must say at the end of this film made me laugh. so if you see this film on TV or something returns in 1 hour and only 20 minutes to watch it will certainly be the most end in all the history of the movie. and I am bad about it. It is not very good, it is a stimulating, it's idiotic, it makes me want to break the vcr. not the value of your time also I am sure every other audit has mentioned this but the executive who played mother on Home Improvement was in this film for the second division. DO YOU NEED TO KNOW WHAT YOU KNOW? I HAVE A HOME EXPERIENCE OF SIXTY TRAINING IN THE INSTITUTION IN EDUCATION IN ALL EDUCATION.
