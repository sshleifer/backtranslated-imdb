What? Anyone can stop John Carpenter from always and intentionally destroying his reputation? What? Can you go down? It seems this person has lost any personal dignity. This time seems to have been done by a film student, not even beginning to talk about what was bad, because it was only used by someone who doesn't have a talent as a film manufacturer or without motivation ... <br> /> <br /> Come, Lord Carpenter, please retire once and respect others and stop shedding garbage like this in bad traditions from Escape from LA to Ghosts of Mars. <br /> <br /> Drugs instead.
