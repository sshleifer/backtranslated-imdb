R O B O O J X. Too bad. <br /> <br /> No end; there is no closure. Completely and totally bad movies made. It replaces the "Adventures of Pluto Nash" as the worst movie ever. I have this uninvited, non-independent, non-verbal, non-identifiable, non-existent, unwanted, unwanted, so-called "Robot Jox" - and I have found out - THE CHECKLIST! I apologize to Adma Sandler (Zohar Beauticin) and Eddie Murphy (Pluto Nash) for hating their movies. This disease makes the movies worse - not frightening and scary like this. This is the only movie I've ever said - Remove IT from NETFLIX - NOW !!! 10 out of 10 people found this comment.
