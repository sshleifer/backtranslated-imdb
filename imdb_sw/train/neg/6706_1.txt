I saw this move a few years ago at the Central Florida Film Festival as I remember. I liked it, it showed great potential. I think many people here are playing this film because the film seemed to be closed together (for filming on the official website - short was shown as "cut-cut"). however, it was a simple comedy. I think many people are trying to read a lot in comedy. All they have to do is laughing - that's all. I did just that in his show, so it succeeded at that level. Just My Cents 2 Any.
