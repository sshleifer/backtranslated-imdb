Spoiler Alert Well I think this film is probably a very bad film made. Perhaps in the style of Ed Wood (without heart). M electricity is awesome. Music is very bad (piano and advice ... come on!). Acting is ... well no act! There is a boy who may go to the wood to find his wife without taking time to have sex with a stranger. The killer is fat, uncomfortable who could not overcome the string! All members of the cast are stupid and the director places each film on the film without effort. <br /> <br /> The end is far too stupid. Think about it: The boy (ken hebert) who is doing the same skill is writing to him (he is the brain behind this flop) to invite his co-worker and two friends to his cabin at the end of the week and to kill them. .. In the morning of the morning he returns again is an office without anything that will happen. The epidemic is that HeHebert is trying to get us to know that it is a family that continues with a generation (his uncle is a clown murderer). ALL / TOTE / ALL. <br /> <br />
