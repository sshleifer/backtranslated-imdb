For my first Shakespeare taste in action, I can't believe what these people did in a really good game. <br /> <br /> - Start with beauty, do you? Alan Rickman is the same, although some of his conversations could be given more emotionally. Some of the participants needed to pull together. Romeo, Romeo, why don't you die yet, Romeo? Actor, when not only wood and dead, completely did not read his verses and any gusto at all. He had no view at all, had trouble even looking at Juliet in the face, and absolutely no grace and given lines. Whoever gives it is worthy of punishment. Juliet is almost approved, but it does not give depth to its character, and it seems to be completely unrelated to play. Mercutio was very strange and unethical in the fullness of his conversation. Benvolio had an unkind and angry feeling for his line. I was forced to tolerate this semi-baker of Romeo and Juliet. The act was made by the clothes was not misleading. I found a puppet of kindergarten shows more effort. I just want to give this movie a zero rate.
