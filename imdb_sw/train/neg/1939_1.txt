Come! Get more of the Pakistan boys who die. Sound can not only make brilliant movies - but it can greatly affect the audience of the audience. <br /> <br /> I am a popular voice-sounding film but the anti-Pakistan film makes me so much enjoy the screenplay, cinema, tracking - everything. I am very pleased to see that the viewers on both sides of the decline refuse to propaganda, and there are movies like Main Hoon And out there that have done carefully not only because they are eligible for the quality of their voice - but also because it tries to say: give peace space and shows that there are crazies out there on both sides that do not represent civilians.
