Sorry, boys, I have written my comments on this movie but today was the first day I looked at other views. There are many people who agree with me but what is interesting is that there are some people who look like this film. I don't like to write bad reviews or reject other people's opinions but I think it's just right to warn someone out there who can discuss whether or not to watch this movie. This is not a good movie. I really love movies and I will look at everything but this film made it on a short list of movies I watched and was glad to leave half. If you are really tested, see the trailer ... that's the mistake I made because the whole movie is essentially in the trailer ... after that no surprise, just some of the worst bad conversation of time. I love Michael Vartan in Alias ​​and I would like to accuse him but I think it is my responsibility to leave some people to lose their lives on a movie like this!
