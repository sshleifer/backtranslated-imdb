This movie was building long without peak. People who mention the last sword in the end must be out of their mind, or not. The way very often this movie got soft. I did not say that soft movies are bad. But no matter how much you love sugar you should not have a chance on the T-bone steak. This film was supposed to be on revenge for crimes committed against culture, but it eventually became a small bar-brawl. And there was only one of them that knew the sword; Tim Roth's behavior (and yes, plays well). Rob Roy was a weak “hero” who had no knowledge of how to use a sword, and how he was “winning” was a shame. As the film of this film had periods, but the best performance in it should go to Scotland origin. This is just one breath tad that is "soap" in my book.
