Somehow they described 60 years, ten years which changed so much in our country, for four hours. And it is a good hours of pain. They overturned great events and events and "claimed" was about two families but still did not see the family of African-america. If I were NBC I would be embarrassed and embarrassed to beat the garbage. What was exciting was this happy-going-lucky family that you had seen at the beginning was suffering in many ways, but it was able to attend a 60th event through the country. And the second family was not the reason. They volunteered maybe five or six visual images of this family. This poor child ... Please NBC, do not do any movies about any other eras ... from PBS and Channel History
