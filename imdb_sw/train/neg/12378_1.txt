The weak and the wolf of the wolf. Young "Red" is a perfect wear of make-up, with very shorts and shorts. You've got 20 minutes through and realize that it can be a dream of true pedophile. The "up-beat" music looks much like something I would like to hear at the strip club. I really think this movie is a sick joke - not a family movie. Breath, I'm glad I was looking at this with my daughter, I don't want her to think it's normal for families to see pictures of children together. Worse, much sadness is sold as a family film, Joey Fatone probably has been embarrassed in it. And what and advertising are "special effects interesting" ??? Side effects look at the low budget, greatly decreasing.
