The 'Edison' program was honorable, but one actor destroyed the entire film. Justin Timberlake destroyed the film with every line that announced during the movie. He is one of the worst actors I've ever seen, and should face the same fate as FR.A.T. hard. squad. If it was an emotional location, a point of action, or even a quiet place, Justin Timberlake could destroy it. Do not waste your time watching this film. Do not hesitate to download, the midget of porn will be the best choice. And Justin, if you read this, stick to music. Although you are not good at the time, you have done a good job of persuading people to think you can sing.
