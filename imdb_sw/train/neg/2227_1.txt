Every time, anyone out of the blue color looks at me a little and asks "What's with SNITCH'D"? I know once they have a case of non-confidential fear. See, I was a movie starter. Allow me to define some points about the “interesting life experience”. <br /> <br /> At first, SNITCH'D was called ONE HARD HIT. I met James Cahill in July 1999, one day after binding the TRIANGLE SQUARE, a little bit of 35mm that as many parts of the period had no distribution even though it was interesting to the party ... of SAG's bad reputation of the Disease Agreement. But I digress ... <br /> <br /> I though I was on the roll, and when James asked me to shoot his little gangster flick at 16mm with a shot of nearly $ 25,000, not wanting to break down, I took. After all, CLERKS, EL MARIACHI ... I also believed the story back. <br /> <br /> Let's look at it as a "school school" for many people involved, I included. SNITCH'D was shot more than two weeks in August, 1999, in Aliso Viejo and Santa Ana, CA. Cahill taught the Drama at the High School in the last town (yes, she is a Drama and English teacher ... think that during watching the film, or even to watch the use of apostrophe in the head), so the sites have cast. <Br /> <br /> Its publisher in its cast is the only known speed of LA's Channel 2 of the Morning Morning weather girl Vera Jimenez, and of great impact, the beginning of Eva Longoria, who had just arrived on Hollywood and was as eager as I get the film under its belt. I must say his commitment to professionalism, focus on "let us do so" a view made me leadership and it was a shadow of his yet-coming skill. <br /> <br /> SNITCH'D is experiencing poor optics, a few lighting or electricity, several boom publishers, and an unsupported network of duplicates. There is nothing that controls the actual content, which speaks for itself. However, in 2003, the film was purchased for distributors (for net loss, I understand) who certainly did not have Eva pictures on the box (at that time was growing, job name ) but who could find a clear picture of what seems to be a Latino group that is right to give you the trust of SNITCH'D. Since the other cahill desires are an old book to deal with, it seems to prove that he believes you can, of course, judge the book by covering ... as many used this DVD according to the sleeve. ----------------- A year later, Eva, now on soap, and I met James for one day to make a short film that he had made, SPLIT SECOND, which I think has never been see any game despite the festival objectives. 6 years later, I was hired to beat another Cahill film named JUAREZ, Mexico. I though he had worked out the process; My involvement involved on hitting, script and staff control, and the following film really seems promising during the holidays, why was the ... The story of cheap detective around the killing of Juarez girls; in spite of the claims here and elsewhere, the film has never been seen in a concert or any place, although Cahill has claimed that the film has a distribution and was waiting for the release of a parallel DVD of two studios on one subject, VIRGIN OF JUAREZ and BORDER TOWN.
