The story behind this film is very interesting, and generally the plot is not bad ... but the details: writing, leading, continuing, approving, operating action, stunts, and the use of all CG eliminates and destroys the film. br /> <br /> First, the order of action. They all do not know at all. Many include a man standing and getting shot, doing no attempt to run, fight, dodge, or whatever, even if they have all the time around the world. This process is only visible to bland for something that took place in 2004. <br /> <br /> CG has very good features available and animations, but they come to look cheap because of their use. Everything is happening very quickly. For example, "Elle" has been taught to fight in several hours, and from the beginning he can do back, etc. Why is he so much acrobatic? There is nothing out of the film. Like Lilith, he wouldn't be able to go back - maybe he couldn't, because he had wings. Also, we have been in a row like a woman running with a car, and getting up and walking just in a private room and sinking with a mirror, and then jumping into the throat, for no apparent reason, and without any audience who cares that he has just been hit by a car (and then they felt the secondary effects of another, driving) ... "Are you right?" asks the driver "yes, I did well" he says, saved and destroyed. I looked at all, though, the introduction promised me that it would be amazing ... but at the end, the poor performance makes me like something else: Blade, Vampire Hunter D, even the same movie and vampires where Jackie Chan was The comic aid, because they could stop my unbelief, but this made me want to shake the director of the eyes, and give the author to speak well.
