Worse, and completion of people who should know better, (beaten by six of them). It is set in 'modern', (it was done in 1979), and it is about the slave trade. It is easily written and done, (Michael Caine, Peter Ustinov and William Holden reach a low job in this one), and they are not totally excited to consider any ethical view. It is also a planned plot. You are not for a minute to believe that any of the characters could live as they do under these circumstances. Richard Fleischer leads but you get feeling it was on the phone. This is bad if it gets.
