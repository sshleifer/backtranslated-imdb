Trends. Just bad. The script is defined, painful pot, and the story comes just. It is, of course, the ceremony of Sally Potter and little thing. This can not be bad, but he is a director, author and star of the film, and so is only boasting. I found myself uncomfortable about developing love between the two main characters, and the end did not come too short. It has two aspects of redemption. The first is that a lot of shots are quite realistic, especially in Paris, and look rather beautiful in black and white. Second, if you are a fan of cucumber or not, music is generally, better (except where Sally starts singing). Watch this film for your own risk, or if you need a sense of humor. I'm sure welcomes someone. Statistics, we have to.
