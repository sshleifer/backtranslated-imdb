This may or may not be the worst film that Steve Martin has ever done, but it certainly was far from his ability. Obviously, made this trick for pay checks. Dreck like this certainly has nothing to strengthen its reputation as a good person. Something that does not seem to understand is that when people come to see the movie Steve Martin, they expect to be worried, not exhausted tears. It is sad that he motivated Dan Aykroyd and Phil Hartman with him. I do not understand why talented people cannot find sleep on the fact that people do not want to see them in films containing lousy. If you call a comedy film, then it should be funny. This was not. Shame on the US military to allow itself to be associated with this pabulum, too. The perfect jacket of Metal was more laughing than this sad excuse for "comedy service." Indeed, Phil Silvers comes to his grave.
