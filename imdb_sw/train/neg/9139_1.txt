I don't know what about this film director Sam Mraovich somehow broken up on every little element in this film. I would like to say that this is a movie that should not exist, but this film can be more important at all. This movie should be for the sole purpose of being 'The Best Bad Movie Exacted'. I have seen bad movies during my life, but somehow this breaks what I have seen to be bad in something that is more difficult to think. <br /> <br /> Everything in this movie is proud, but one thing of funniest is that Mraovich himself sees this being a great movie. Oh wow ...
