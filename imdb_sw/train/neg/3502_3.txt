Sarah Silverman is really a "delicious new" comic right now. What? Really has the value of all the hype? Yes and no. He is funny sometimes, sometimes with such a trick (his position of standing is really interesting, though it's not always funny). Sometimes, you feel that you are being misled by the media by damaging another executive. She is one of the most beautiful girls that men work very hard, saying they are minding the wit. But if you bind them, many people will admit that they just want to have sex with him, and that's why they look at him. He reminds me why so many people gathered for Margaret Cho and Janeane Garofalo, even though none of them are "hot" now with the question of popularity. Sarah cannot drink or smoke (at least smoking), so she should be hot while she is 60 years old, so her fans (especially men) can be happy. <br /> <br /> For this show, it is very like its comedy. When it works, it's a pleasure. When it is not appropriate, it is a perfect tedium that has been hit and very, very interesting. The AIDS period here is much better. It is always funny, and has a very good satire in it. Brian Poeshn's character has unhealthy difficulty with Tab in one place, and it's hilarious to see him in T-shirt Tab. But they don't go anywhere with that, and finally takes a welcome to him. Sarah's behavior in the series becomes angry, gay couple (Brian Poeshn and another person) seem to have done nothing for the show as a whole, and help players (including Sarah's sister, Laura, who doesn't 't look at something like her) it's okay. When jokes die, they are brilliant. When they don't, they're bad, and I mean very bad. There is also excitement to coprophilia here (emerging joke), which seems to be a chance of a real wit and mind in the comedy today. So you should watch this show? If you have to crush Sara, go to that. You can watch him and pretend to be your own. For her show, it is among the good and absolutely zero.
