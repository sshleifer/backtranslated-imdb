This is a wonderful string with the film, you get the feeling that the bond company should come into this, I am not surprised no credits on it, who want to be associated with this film. Working for all linked is losing too much and the plot jumps around, all makes it very little sense. As I said before it was seen as a bond company had to come because it looked like there were many photographs that had not been made that needed to be, and all music was a very good library library (cheap I think). Very very odd. I might actually buy his DVD though, it would allow me to go into what hell is going on, and what happened to this film.
