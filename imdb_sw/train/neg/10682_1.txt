So I look at the DVD and I come to this film called 'End Game'. It is the star James Woods and Cuba Gooding JR and has a collection of political excitement taught. Well worth checking then. Or so I thought. <br /> <br /> Boy, I was not wrong. <br /> <br /> The end of the game you have about a plot of ignorance that I have ever had for a long time. At the moment being a whodunnit thing, I can break into it if I would without 'losing it' to those who still don't know this monstrosity situation. But questions such as 'Why did he / she / did this?', And 'Where in the world did they get the resources to smoke?' is very much following the hilarious conclusion of the film without giving birth. Do it - you know the films where you can almost feel that the actors have found that they have made a big mistake by signing for a movie, and this shows their time of performance? This is one of those. Track this with a laughable script and focused focus, irritating direction and you have a catalyst for cinema. In fact, this did not do with the movie, and for that reason you should not let it into your bedroom; it's awesome.
