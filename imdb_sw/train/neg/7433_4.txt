I must be totally honest by saying that I slept somewhere in the middle, so I can't give a full view of the film until I see it perfectly. Basically, a group of thieves, including Sid Carter (Sid James) and Ernie Bragg (Bernard Bresslaw), a plan to make shortages to steal contraceptive drugs from Finisham reproductive hospitals. This is characteristic of the title Matron (Hattie Jacques) works, along with Sir Bernard Cutting (Kenneth Williams), Dr Francis Goode (Charles Hawtrey), Dr. Prodd (Terry Scott) and Nurse Susan Ball (Barbara Windsor). Patients and their guests are also close, including pregnant pregnant Tidey (Joan Sims) and her husband-husband husband Mr. Tidey (Kenneth Connor). It also appears by Bill Maynard as Freddy and EastEnders' Wendy Richard as Miss Willing. This plan in a way does not work in a way, because all employees find a way. That's very good all people can say about the film until I see it again. Okay!
