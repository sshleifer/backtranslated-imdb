This movie was t.v the other day, and I did not really enjoy it. George's first jungle was a good comedy, but good .... quite bad. The new actors and actors playing leadership positions were not good at all, they should have an original actor (Brendon Fraiser) and the original executive (I forgot his name) so this movie gets 0 out of ten rating, not a film that you can sit down and watch and enjoy, this is a film that you can turn to another center or return to the shop if it is employed or purchased. It was good to see Ape's back, but he was not happy like the first, they should have a new George like his son Georges, and still had Bredon and (what his face) in the film, which 'we've been better then it was.
