I have been a great fan of Lynn Peterson since his role of the highway in the 1988 movie of the blockbuster "Far North", and although I love him in his single "Slow" film (2004) where he plays "Francis", this is far from his role greater. <br /> <br /> Lynn, if I'm sure you all know (or should), has an important role of "Driver". Unfortunately, others rather than Lynn's amazing performance, I'm afraid that this film is not very good. There is something else - an amazing innovation of editing to remove dirt from television viewers. Unsaved verses like: "You son of guns!", "You son of a sorcerer!", "Shoot!", And "Well, Remember!" OT. Bye. Is there anyone who knows where I can find another Lynn Peterson poster?
