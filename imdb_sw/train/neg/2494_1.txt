It's a joke. I look at Channel 1 and I think the color look is dry is more entertaining. What happened to Caspar Van Dien that tied him in this dream. Poor acting, very good plot and horrible direction. It's awesome, it's funny. It thinks full of doubts, but it's more comedy. If you want to see a bad acting, write a script of ignorance with a small plot, see this movie out. If I am Van Dien, I can only ask 10% of me from my agent, but a hot hot bastard in the process. What Turkey. It is not even necessary to be on MST 3K! It would be a good movie to treat sleep. I especially love the parts where Van Dien is throwing overboard and then going back in just a few minutes! I can only picture that this was written by non-consular writers to use the author's advantage. What a bad movie!
