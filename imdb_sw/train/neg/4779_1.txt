In 2004, I liked it. Then it became very foolish. It suggests that children do not know. It insults children. Cartoon network was huge. One of my favorite performances was Hamtaro. It could be interesting and thoughtful in its way to children's programs. The show (Home Foster for Friends Imaginary) is like setting 20 teaspoons of sugar in your Sprite. It seems that today's television producers like to get money, instead of concentrating on children's ideas and making money! Recently, my children are coming to an old (60) exhibition to find something interesting to look at. Perhaps, for the absence of nature, for television to watch his past and to prepare a children's program from the past.
