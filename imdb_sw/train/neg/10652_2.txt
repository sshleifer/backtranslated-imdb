You know Jason, you know Freddy, and you know Leatherface. Now, the stone is ready for: The nose of the Nose Safety! That is true, in the Workout Killer, the movie of the dumb gun as I've ever seen one, the invisible killer sends its victims (or?) And the safety pin, of secrecy. It is an unusual choice to be sure, the kind of thing that deserves details. Typically, the movie doesn't even try to define what the murderer found like this. <br /> <br /> As a headline, aerobics practice is under siege by a mad killer and everyone is a suspect. In fact, the film provides very few signs about the killer's diagnosis, almost everyone in the movie is a complete killer until they are killed. And since almost everyone but the killer's spirit is dead, it is a complete abolition. Of course, when the whole name is killed, the aerobics classes are going on hard. In fact, nothing can stop playing. When three people are killed in the second room, the workout continues. Death is not even a reason; One character dies, but it still seems clear in future work sessions. Director David Prior knew what he did when he called Labor Workout Workout and not a workout workout. <br /> <br /> Cop runs, fire filters, and two females are battered by a good measure. Much like a woman found on the skin bed, I felt very worried at the end of the Workout Killer. Finally, thanks, ENDA shone on the screen. What happened next? You got, the shots of women working. Even the end of the film can stop them! <br /> <br />
