I hated how Perez showed the people of Puerto Rico! We are not all of the ghetto - and we speak Spanish-not Puerto Rican! I can't talk to people who have no education that has run away. But our language is intact, our island is our pride. Puerto Rico is better than the economy than any Caribbean island! I am glad we are not like Cuba, Dominican Republic or Haiti, without US leadership? Free in real poverty, not the poverty level of U.S. We are not the victims we are strong, humble, honest and intelligent people. Our parents include strong African roots, but are not "black" roots - I have nothing similar to Americans Americans 9do study. and logo. MLK was a good hero of a true revolution - a faithful man who saw the day when we were free. Che Guevarra helped Castro create Cuba which is today, that's why the boat of Cubans endangered their lives to America - because Che made the best place for them? You had a great idea, surprising, sharp but very political. We have many things to boast about as people - do not bring shame to our people by attacking us. I'm not Nuyorican and maybe that's why I can't share your opinion. I am Puerto Rican, I say Spanish, not the victim and I have been able to complete my many goals in America. If there are 2 parts in the future - the smallest politics more history of victory stories - there are many. Damaris Maldonado
