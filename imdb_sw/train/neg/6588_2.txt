The following are some of the most tragic problems with this movie: 1) Clichés has increased. By and large, the worst "twists" are everywhere. <br /> <br /> 2) Jumping information around time, which would be nice if well done, but not so. 3) Characters that do not go too far if they remain completely static, or substantial changes because there is no reason. <br /> <br /> 4) Big one: HORRIBLE ACTING. More advanced from almost everyone. The following are some of the best points from the film: 1) Leadership is looking good. When I see, there are only two types of people who will be on this film: a) People who can sit for 90 minutes to overtake just because the guide is interesting. b) People who often think of themselves, "I like Hollywood photos with clichés and confusion, but if I can just look at the Korean ..." There's a good Korean movie out there, why do you waste your time with garbage?
