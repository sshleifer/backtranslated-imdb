The real desire from the chief master of Visley Ridley Scott. G.I. Jane tells the story of the first woman who received a hellish training on the Navy. The training is more complicated and more difficult as the teacher says in the film for the leadership of O'Neil's style played by Demi Moore. There is no message or action in this film or then I couldn't reach it properly. It may be some kind of information of women's rights and capabilities but all of them are subject to fatigue and clashes of stupid guns at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> I can't understand why Ridley uses too much zooms in the battle mentioned last gun in the wilderness? It seems sooooo ignorant and irritating and close to amateurish so I would really know what the director saw in such a technique. When I watch his latest film, Black Hawk Dawn, there is nothing wrong at the battle (which is a lot) and they are very intense and directed by the skill. All Finale in G.I. Jane seems to be rough and nothing more but shot with ignorance and brain and bullets. <br /> <br /> This is the worst movie of Ridley Scott in my opinion and no key touch which this director is known. I am still pleased to see this in the Widecreen format because there are still positive events and samples of Scott's potential, but they are very few in this film. <br /> <br /> Desire and no comparison with scholars (Runner Blade, Thelma & Louise, guest and so on.) of talented director. So I have to give G.I. Jane 4/10.
