Like all Carnosaur movies, this is a joke. The way of dinosaurs goes, reminding you when my sister plays with her dolls, because they can't have any power or more false than them. It does not have any meaning. I mean, first they are on the bus, then in the warehouse then, suddenly, they are on the boat. And let's be bad, is it wise that several dinosaurs can sit together on the van, or on the ship? I thought dinosaurs were many animals, and now they can agree with the migrating van. It seems to be ignorant even when you think about it. The only reason I have given this 3, is because it's still entertainment. I found it better than the first (didn't look second). Just, don't borrow. I saw it on television and it was a good thing I did because I didn't want to lose money to rent.
