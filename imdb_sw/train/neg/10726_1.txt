I agree with the previous comments, the beginning of the film is very good, and you find it when you look at what's coming ....... That's nothing. The whole line of the story is clear; The two characters who for the first time seemed like they might have some particular significance have been left out of the picture, forgot to 1 or 2 very short scenes. I walk if Ilya did not want to do well to leave them .... On the one hand left, nothing happens with him either. He visits another place of God, and suddenly the film does not get on it again, but about the geriatric witches who spend their days making the dollar out of bread, drinking a vodka of homemade, and it seems flammable. Others may say the movie is doing well in showing a decline society, like the IFFR judges, but for me it is just a bad taste, the work of the worst camera, the lousy script and the worst trend of fear. So I can't be as generous as my predecessor when you classify: 1!
