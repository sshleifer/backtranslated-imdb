The man leaves with a dream about bats. He and his wife come from the desert with a picnic on their honey day. He seems to hear a strange noise, and he is disturbed to see the blow rising on their picnic blanket. He wants to go to a cave tour, which has something to do with some kind of work he does, but he wants to enjoy their honey life. He allows. They go on a tour, but leave the group to do. He falls under the slope, where he breaks down with insects. He follows her. He hears the noisy noise again, and it seems to know the pipe is approaching; man does, and gets his hair. He fights with him, and visits him, hitting his forehead. They come out of the cave, but when they are on the gondola at the ski station, he begins to be desperate that he has a hall or vision of bats attacking people. He becomes angry when this happens. He cannot drink alcohol without a ban. His wife is worried about rabies, and begins the treatment of Pasteur, but reacts violently to the injection. Some people are killed. We see the parts of the person being the person of the bat. It seems not only in his mind. If the bat bite causes the change to become unstable, it already had some symptoms before the bite. When the head appears to be inappropriate, the ultimate meaning is that one thing happens to someone else. Not a very good movie, but I loved different types of desert, cave, and slopes, and some good events. I didn't think this was bad as some people do, and I didn't think that the movie Bats of 1999 was just as bad as others think (I evaluated that one of the 5/10).
