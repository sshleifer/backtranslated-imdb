Chris Kattan is a good actor of artwork on Saturday Night Live ... but should leave the film industry alone unless it gets creative controls. He likes the behavior of angry peppy which essentially comes as a delicate and faster delay. Want to know just a funny part? What they showed in the preview. Yes, his drawing on me is funny. Nothing else. RIGHT when you can tell him he tries to be a physical player, which should not try because he is one. And yet, 'losing the vet office' comes as cringingly bad. This film has made me look at the eye. Avoid all costs, and continue to watch SNL.
