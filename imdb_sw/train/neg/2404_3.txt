Man, I was desperate. <br /> 1) Adam Arkin is whiny more than Ross Geller from 'Friends' <br /> 2) Great cures are lost (Kenneth Mars, Alan Arkin, Ed McMahon, Pat Morita, Louis Nye) and this amateur script. <br /> <br /> 3) The movie faces a horrible pacing. It jumps up through the jumbled, controversial. <br /> <br /> 4) The story doesn't even mean. Why does he want to break the soccer streak? What about the stupid music of the violin? Nothing was explained. It is not even funny. It's like a group of accountants trying to do wrong, saying "Look at me! See I'm funny!" This was an unpleasant attempt to do another "Love In First Bite". <br /> <br /> I love Larry Cohen movies, but someone failed here. I could not wait for credit. Horrible desires.
