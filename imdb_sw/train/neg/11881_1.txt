This movie is not like "office space" except for the premise. The Office's position was highly hilarious. I can't recommend this film to anyone, because I did not laugh at once during the entire film. Mr. Cornbluth's self-rearing trees tend to be more angry than 15 Jason Alexanders in the room. If you decide to watch this movie, use rental or look at someone else's house so you can leave if necessary.
