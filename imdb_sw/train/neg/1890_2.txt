The problem I see and this title is that I don't know if the director tries to produce a document or movie. The combination of these two forms does not work and they leave one thing placed in the center of anywhere. This is more so if the director has chosen a lot more than what is needed around our daily lives and making it an unreliable document. If it means exciting / interesting game this is very small and interesting. In any case, what values ​​or messages does the director try to present to the audience? How close to us are people who treat others who are willing to be treated badly? That there's a lot of crazy lunatics around us? So .......... why?
