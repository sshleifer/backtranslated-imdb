Unfortunately there were 0 for a rating or maybe I would choose it. This movie has the ability to star that the original movie had a lot. Carol Burnett, Albert Finney, Tim Curry, Bernadette Peters, Edward Hermann, innocence for guest Aileen Quinn, and leading expert from John Huston's circle (actor Angelica Huston) made this film live. Even the 1999 revision by Kathy Bates, Victor Garber, Alan Cumming, and Kristin Chenoweth had more to offer more of this sorry excuse for good. Before making this film all Ashley Johnson was known because she had her role as Chrissie Seaver a little while showing the pain of growing. She had a little part in the movie but I don't know who she thought she had enough talent to carry the film alone. And add Joan Collins as Lady Edwina Hogbottom, ignorance! They could not get enough good actors to play such great roles as Daddy Warbucks, Miss Hannigan, and Annie but will be happy Joan Collins to play a certain British woman? It is not surprising that this movie was as bad as it was. Critics had the right to disagree with this film, even if it was only released for TV, it was a poor good for a favorite movie.
