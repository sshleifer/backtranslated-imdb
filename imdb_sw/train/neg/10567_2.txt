I thought this movie seemed like a case study in how to make a film in many places. Since I am a filmmaker, I offer 2 for a merger. Problems remain from the beginning to the end and the plot is predominantly using many bits and pieces, if not all, the stories of the old war. Graphics produced by computers were like watching a video game on points and it seems that there is no attempt by the director to improve true quality for the story. I wanted the budget to get an idea of ​​what she was supposed to do with her, but she didn't have the story. It looked like this project hit the limits of a small movie budget far too far to produce the producer that attracts the viewer with stories without their participation ideas. Participants were not bad, but the plot requires more innovation.
