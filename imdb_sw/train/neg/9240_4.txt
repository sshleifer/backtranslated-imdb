The idea of ​​making a plane service for Berlin was seen in me as one of the most popular German movies (after). It's a untreated theme yet. However, the creators of this series put it with clichés. It starts with a DVD film cover, which is a direct copy of the 'Pearl Harbor' cover. Luise Kielberg (Bettina Zimmermann) feels that her husband, a doctor, (Ulrich Noethen) is dead in Russia and after the war he struggles to live. He works at the base of the United States, he works for the most cool and greatest officer (Heino Ferch) in the city, likes and m, gets pregnant, and suddenly her husband comes back. Come !!! We have seen this often many times. Heino Ferch and Ulrich Noethen are doing their work very well; Bettina Zimmermann however never seems to persuade them. For some reason it always seems to be too late in giving an appropriate emotional feeling on events. It didn't work for me. <br /> <br /> Action events and airplanes and air lift, sometimes we enjoy, often not. Good things always seemed to happen with similar trials. <br /> <br /> Unless you are a big fan of WWII movies, I recommend using your money for something else: chocolate ice cream brings more satisfaction! <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10!
