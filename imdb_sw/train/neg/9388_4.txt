The former eye of eye-turned-guard protection of his recent work of droning and once granted a chance to return to his original work. His work: with a strange woman's French woman who came in California ... and apparently wanted to with a racketeers of suit-and-tie. An unsuccessful attempt to modify the type of green film, without enough sting or wit (or link to the dynamics of the plot) on the screen. The director and journalist Paul Magwood (who later claimed that the photo was altered without his involvement) does not give the impression of the "40s" of "Chandler" films; His nostalgia fits for rumpled, but also bitter-tinged and somewhat different. The handling is amazing, for the lowest, and Warren Oates are well cast like this' 70s different in 'private dick' archetype, but the movie does not have any snap. Good to see Leslie Caron and Gloria Grahame in cast - though they don't have much to do, and the Caron's temperature-and-cool behavior runs everything. A typical exhibition with Alan Stensvold, a good shot of the scene, but fails to come up with any kind of boil. * 1/2 from ****
