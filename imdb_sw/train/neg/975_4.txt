I saw the director "Woman in the Dead" and could not understand well with good reviews. This film is like the same, two people who are found in relationship with very little interest and even less for anyone else. Like his other films, you should want to listen to the conversation, have been through a very small way and have fun with low, uncomfortable writers. If you feel you can make this film, don't let my review keep it. I am like minimalism in the film, but I feel the Tsai Ming-Liang film is very good. He has a very good actor in Lee Kang-Sheng in his films. There is nothing here. I wish IU liked it, but not. Oh, well.
