I didn't think it was possible for a comedy film of fear to defeat it for destruction at all borders .... really bad. The fact that you are not self-reliant (usually a good thing) works against him, because because the executives are very timber you can swear they are rejecting cards to reject. In the upshot though .... the MST3K version, as it had time, laughs a few ....
