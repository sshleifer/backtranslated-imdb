Curiosity led me to this "masterpiece". Unfortunately, I did not pay taxes, I bought it! The most disturbing thing about this film is that it is not very difficult. For the only known reason, the creators of this film showed the human side of Jeffry Dahmer. What are you doing? The man gave a new meaning to the word "lickin" good! And with all the flash and flash-flash I had trouble following the story. All of Jeremy Renner's performance was not so bad. In any case, I would like to measure this as 1/10. It has only got 1 because of Renner's work, there are many books and textbooks on the outside that do the best to cover Dahmer's crime.
