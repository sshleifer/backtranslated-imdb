I am a great fan of Martin Amis, whose book is based on his book. Unfortunately the director cannot translate the book on the screen. This book presents modern and very fake in its most advanced characters and divisions of plot and promotional character. It is a study of the humanity of human desires, excesses and weaknesses and one of the most modern British writers. The film director has missed the novel stage. In his hands, the film blows at the speed of breakdown, entering every known shot of the trick and the 'odd' camera is possible. It's like Ken Russel on acids, and he feels from the old self-reliance director to a hundred. Not even a short (short) picture of a beautiful Christian act of Christian Solimeno was enough to save this bad film for me. Normal!
