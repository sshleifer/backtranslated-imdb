Any movie that Brooke Shields out-acts Fonda will be a bad and scary. Shields really are very bad because he is a young man, he does not know, and is not clearly directed by his co-star. Peter Fonda is bad because, well, because it's bad. I loved in Ulee's gold, many years later, but the Lord over, he is bad here. Not that someone else is good. There is no single function (out of coming to Henry Fonda's fun) that can even be approved. I have never seen these films and films. In the case of Luke Askew, the great villain, it is definitely this is because of poor conversation and direction, as he did a good job in the past. But her lover, played by Ted Markland, is a ham of disgrace. Writing is just a great risk of blood, and artists cannot be blamed for the bad things they say. But they say so wrong! Editing and trends are worse than those on foot. Shots occur in a very long way because they are not surprising, or cut before the impact of the area can be reached. This picture was much worse than I thought and it would have completely forgotten (and maybe never been made) without the participation of several popular names. One bright remedy: the cinema in the Grand Canyon is very good, taking the beauty of the area through even the largest Imax production was not very well done. And finally: this is a bad version of Paper Moon, and a good kind of father-daughter, or is a bad version of Pretty Baby, with a more romantic icky relationship between forty-something and 13-year-old. It recommends more than the latter, and so it is very surprising.
