This is the more romance of saccharin than I sat. A perfect film for a housewife who is ignorant in a string, a hub, and an architect-designed with high stars to watch the day, lying in bed to eat grapes. In fact, candy plays a major role in the film. The only reason I could see to the end, was that I was finally able to look at the face of Keanu Reeves's dream around every area. In most of his films, it goes very fast to get the beauty. The only immediate action in this show is Giancarlo Giannini lifting his hands and emotional Latin - more Italian than Mexican, in fact. The talk is as hard as wood. Unfortunately, no bodices are broken - a hero is a good good-looking and gentle. The family of the old bloody family of blood is as old as mountains. What if it is Ireland or Italy or Mexican? This is a story story. I knew before the names ended that this could not be the film I expected. Vegetable grapes are seen as a paragon of all food advertising in Women's Day Newspapers. I did not see his name listed, but in fact the art director was Thomas Kinkade, who drives a million dollar dollars of cottages in Ireland. This film was shown through colored glasses. If you would like blue and blue sky, this film is for you! (The war is very good too!)
