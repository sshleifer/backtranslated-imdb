'Say yes' is one of those who hope you will go better, but you don't. It is a kind of "useless psychopath" decides to destroy the innocent innocence of innocent, so direct lovers of film makers. <br /> <br /> Talk is clunky and, in several places, misinterpreted. Acting is poor, especially from a piece of man, played by Joong-Hoon Park. He seems to think that by immortality and trying to speak in a deep voice he makes his behavior seemingly threatening, when all it really is to make him seem very simple. <br /> <br /> The plot deserves special mention, like the most idiotic of all beliefs. 'Heroes' do not think it is strange that their course threatens to kill them. 'Heroine' twice lose seeing man when he is not more than a foot away from him. The striker gets a chance to test the police (with a blood-covered shirt, with a fake head of the blood) by showing them where the corpse is in the car passenger car. The striker is slapped, beaten with a shovel and stuck in a hat, but never seems to be interrupted by these injuries, but serious. And don't have to start at that terrible end. Sheesh. The only number of this film, for me, is Sang Mi Chu. Who is very good, but really not more than a good actress. Overall, this film comes as an invalid, unsupported and unpredictable publication of 'Hitcher' and 'Spoorloos', but fails on every side due to lack of talent for everyone involved.
