It is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, but Hostel is more obvious. This movie is more amazing and ridiculous, than the terrible. I laughed a lot of time when I looked at it. Low-side effects (when you search, you will understand what I am talking about AND SPEAKS of what kind it is), the worst actors (I hear them for the first time), and it looks like a shot with amateur camcorder (so it looks more like a TV show, than movie). But at least I have had the patience to look at the end. Like comedies? See. Want to fear? Continue to watch Ju-On: The genius or other beautiful movie of fear. If I talk about the Legend of Diablo, I don't know even if I can make it kind of Free. Just type the bottom of the budget. <br /> <br /> I weigh 3 out of 10
