Today, Bea Arthur died so I was going around the IMDb website and somehow I was injured in a show called "Gloria." "All In Families" was a brilliant show for his four or five years first and I bet I watched every section immediately. However, I swear that I did not know the show called "Gloria". Maybe, that's a good thing. Maybe, it means I had life as a little boy rather than watching television. On the other hand, it is a fear that the "All In Family" franchise has been so damaged that it has shown that I have never heard of - and one that has been counted by the original critics. <br /> <br /> I voted 1 for two reasons - the system did not allow to register without a vote and authors and television officers should be judged for starting a show that had no business being on air and disturbing one of the major exhibitions in history TV.
