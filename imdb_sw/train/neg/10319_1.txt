Unlike many, I don't give you a premise or a theme of this shows a little bit. Its implementation, however, is quite another thing. Like many B-minus movies, all forms of respect are seen on the trailer. For more than 22-minute-or-so we are always expecting any desire for real humor. Or at least something to put one from fidgeting to a remote or counting fiber carpet. For several types are acting bad; A combination of voting and voting for other delegates may be the same as the last night of the night, but not the basis of identification (even one of Canada). Despite the nature of the original culture, I can not help but think this is particularly shocked shot by CBC to simulate the success of the Corner gas. Unfortunately, they have a voice - and the script - absolutely not appropriate for fertilizer. The last insult is that they could not even have a work in a small town (why is it hard to find Saskatchewan?) What? Did they think the audience would be shown by the outside of the city of Regina? As a proud Canadian I hope this thing is going to soon, and that the rest of the world, primed by CBC broadcasters, quickly forget this great shame of Sitcom.
