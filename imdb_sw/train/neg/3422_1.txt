Oh dear, Oh dear. I began to look at this without knowing what to expect. I couldn't believe what I saw. There were times when I thought it was comedy. I liked the government's plan to capture the terrorist leader is the decline of one person, who has no weapons, and expect him to seize and run with a rocket pack. If only it was very easy. Last I've got the movie worse than "The Layout 9 Out".
