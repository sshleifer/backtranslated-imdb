If it was not for an irresponsible idiot I know to insist that I look at this "document" I've never seen this comedy! This film is full of scripting and laughable. One is exactly where the police / Afghan soldiers arrested Don Larson by voting on the road when they allowed the camera to shut down and arrest and then drive, still with a movie, perhaps in his flower hotel. Then there is a place where a car falls on another car that has turned down and is well on the side of the road without any evidence of an accident or explosion. <br /> <br /> I wonder this currently has a rating (5.8 / 10). I thought the IMD users were more intelligent.
