Well they were seen on paper, Nick Cage and Jerry Buckheimer are reunited, this time in a heist film, Da Vinci Code, American History 101 and Indiana Jones. But oh dear, this is for Indiana Jones what Speed ​​2 is faster. The wise cast (including John Voight and Harvey Keitel) will fight against the puerile script and misuse. The film is a little more than an extended broadcast by Freemasons. However, these Freemasons are not your usual shop that uses funny handshake and play golf, these Freemasons are the native descendants of the Knights Templar (and no one will mention 'From Hell' or Jack's Ripper.) I don't think I've revealed the traders of the plot for no reason. There is almost no worries, no surprise and no peak - just stops. The National Treasury is aimed at Dan Brown but it hits the same intellectual level as part of Scooby Doo without humor.
