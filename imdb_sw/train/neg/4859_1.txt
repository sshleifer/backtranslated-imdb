You need to please the director Todd Sheets for his dedication, driving and enthusiasm when it comes to film decisions: between 1985 and 2000, made 34 movies decreasing. Unfortunately, if his blood's trilogy blood is nothing to go, they probably all crap (and a quick look at their IMD ratings seems to prove my hunch). Section 3 sees a group of obnoxious students detaining a little more than usual after being attacked by dead bodies of dead, who have survived on the foundation of a high-entry army under their school. Working from a bad script by Brian Eklund (which is largely dependent on the use of f-bomb bombs) The director's news provides an attempt to embarrass the amateur with enough mental displays from his free talents, best to see well (CGI and what looks like in front of a large basket basket) and its trademark shoddy gore (offal fingers being handled under the clothing of the victims). Finally, after what seems to be an eternity of anger for the people who flee their lives, and do not know the undead people who are happy with the animals, Zombie Armageddon ends the time-travel / complete identification that inspires viewers to watch a few minutes from the beginning of the film. In fact ... once was enough, Mr. Paper? What have we done to deserve to have a look again?
