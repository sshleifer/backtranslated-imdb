Since many reviews of this film have been seen for the past decade, I would like to add one of the most recent films, films made by German B-17 bombs, cutting film for Oskar Werner of Hauptmann (captain) Wust's character and her help help running when making their way to Hitler's Fuehrer Bunker, once inside, they discussed with the bunker staff, the film then cut to one of the most meeting scene with Albin Skoda giving a good impression of Adolf Hitler rallying his officer to "Ultimate." Victory "when the behavior of Werner is seen as coming slowly recognizing the refusal of bunker is found in the world of fantasy-some event of non-bunker is displayed, very important that it is flooding the system under the road to prevent Russian development to them and subplot sub- involving a young Flak unit and the difficulty of his family in this live-film is faced with many things that are not known as Ujer film Peace was only 10 years after WW2 should not be shared; The actor who showed Goebbels (Willy Krause) is wearing a uniform with Hitler, including the tai Goebbels wearing a nude-colored uniform and swastika-shaped "SS" striker of the German army, the memory area of ​​the Hitler's iron cross For a young Hitler youth man is shown to have been done in a gun (carried out outside the yard) and eventually, Hitler's suicide weapon is clearly shown as a Belgian colored color in 1922 - many accounts agree that Walther PPK- Some of the little drama also seem to be quite accurate with the dance scene near the end of the known film, this little is shown as a skit skaba, and a wounded soldier with his hand (his hand in the button) through a cheating voice during music The nurse does a mix of dance / stomach stomach, each with a candle ... this is really a shameful look - a little more amazing is when Werner's Captain Wust get the audience alone with Skoda Hitler, Hitler is seen as being hit on a wall bench, a doctor and a delightful, while Werner's behavior began to ask him, the Hitler scream was brought into the SS guards who characterized Werner's back-gun gun. The production is not based on a true historical account - For Werner's behavior is then closed off to die in anteroom when Hitler prepares himself, the Hitler's end of his staff is seen but suicide is off-screen, the second movie show Hitler funeral pyre smoke slowly ghostly repair The face of the dead face Oskar Werner / Hauptmann Wust-film is more historical than historical and anyone interested in this period will do better to watch a recent film such as "Hitler: the last 10th day of 1973" or German film "Downfall" (Der Untergang) if they want the most true accounting for this amazing story, these last two films are based on The first person, and "Hitler: bein 10 days ago" g written from Gerhard Boldt's autobiography as a staff officer at Fuehrer Bunker and "Downfall" made from the memory of Hitler's secretary, the screen playing for "Der Letzte Akte" is taken from the American Nuremberg criminal case case of Michael Musmanno book "Ten Days to Die", which is more than the accumulation of the event (most of the most remarkable) than the experience of eye experience - it's amazing that Hugh Trevor Roper's account , "Hitler's last day" has never been a film.
