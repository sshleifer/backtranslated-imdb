"Tapeheads", scrappy, intermittently funny spoof of video video business, can be a perfect short comedic, and star John Cusack and Tim Robbins are hard to swing of nonsensical chaos involved. They play two semi-savvy security guards in Los Angeles who start their own company, Aces Video, making hilarious videos for groups, parties, and one star of death. It is very bad that representatives of the film were supposed to make a side-to-side plot for the downtown (shenanigans involving a lost politician and his girlfriends who do not have much but to remove the core of the film's power, sending late-'80s music culture). However, Cusack and Robbins create several backgrounds here: nerdy but free, road-smart without being hipsters or posers, these people are on the same wavelength wavety, and never put each other down. They are the real thing in the partners-members. * 1/2 from ****
