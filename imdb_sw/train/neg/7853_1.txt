There is no plot, a crappy job, and a useless meaning .... <br /> <br /> This should be a terrible movie? No fear, or insist, just BOOM BANG GORE, then done. Some of the marines are in the desert for the worries, the reasons and they get hunting and mutated animals from the first movie, which was good, and would have been left there. This is just another excuse for money, and the use of unnecessary violence, such as "Saw" sequels. They know no matter what the plot is useless, and over a year they can add, people will see it. I have to miss beautiful exciting movies. Come on Hollywood, you can do a lot, very good.
