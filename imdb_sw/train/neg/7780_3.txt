I could have stressed to get away from it or just stop this turd, but I decided to reinforce it just because that maybe * something * would happen. This is the work of the author / producer / director / fx special, Kenneth Herts, who wants to provide information on environmental degradation while making a monster movie. That's what he wanted, however. What turns out to be a lot of acting, either a little hammy or just mundane and without good reputation, and events that seem to repeat themselves as a monster ATTACKS in river water (oh, and what luck, just a woman happens to be naked in it even though already you have an advertisement! This is something extraordinary, but I think it's not too dangerous, not very worried and once or once or twice we get an interesting peek of Brazil's "culture" (which is The father who walks through the city with his group or other parts of 'hey, this is not America!') But any hopes of the director who was giving out Mitchum or Carradine are being introduced to the best operators and in the bad banal and dumb conversations. that when we find something good for the monster and "act" happens, it also happens by simply appealing. not this took the best part of the mid-70s - but for Monstroid or Monster or whatever is called ... nah. <Br /> <br /> If you are getting access to Elvira DVD twice this feature (bad printing and bad quality transfer) and Blue Sunshine, make sure this jump. Unless, of course, you are Elvira die-hard and you can't help yourself to hear his luscious views; personally, I would like to find Joel or Mike Nelson and robots from the Secret of Secrets of Mystery on this Turkey.
