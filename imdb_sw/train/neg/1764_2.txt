Although in many ways I agree with other suggestions of consultants. I see that the plot and idea is very good. Many of the auxiliary administrators were very good. The worst problem with this film is Ellen Pompeo. I am sure, I have never seen the "fewer" performers. In my opinion he would be better than Wal-Mart. Seeing someone with this low level of talent involved in paying responsibilities, he asks a question ...... "Who knows who?" I would like to see this film being revised for some talent. I don't have the author's fault for the failure of this film to be worth while seeing it.
