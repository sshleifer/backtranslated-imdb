If you read Welles and want to see how he fell after Kane of Citizen, this film will prove. Affordable relief to make the protagonist a personal dummy agree to describe how he can fall into the semi-baking program can not describe the wonderful exhibition room court with a twists ignorance program which eventually introduced. Do not be taken to the high level of this film in the db as I was; all I can think is that there are many old players of Welles and Hayworth out there.
