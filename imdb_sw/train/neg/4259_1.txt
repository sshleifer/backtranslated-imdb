I didn't know anything about this film before a reliable view is a friend who had heard it was "non-stop epic war zone from beginning to end". That could not be more from the truth. This was one of the most beautiful, illuminated, inspired, horror movies I ever had the chance to keep my eyes on. I would like to put it there with the movie that I think is the worst movie of all time ... World Hunger. In essence they do not have a story, it is hard to believe that the creators of this film thought that this opera soap would be taken seriously as a real historical fact. It also has some of the worst talks that I have ever heard ... like this small gem ... Guy tells the girl "You buy as a month." The girl responds "How does the moon smell?" MY GOD! You should beat me! The place where the boy was beaten and split well from the audience because it seemed to be radiculously cheaper and the sound of the boy's FX cracked and reminded me of a man who makes a fart sound with his mouth. If this is playing in the playground near you, avoid at all costs. This film is so bad that I made a decision about 45 minutes through that I needed to get on my sleep ... and I did it. Anger.
