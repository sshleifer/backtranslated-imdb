Don't waste your time on this film. It may be good, but the end is one of the lights I saw. I really know how the people involved in this film will be able to look at the last place and think, "yes! Now there is an end!" and lock back back about it. For me it looked more like they just ran out of thought! They built the last events in order to have to lose the winter, but rather letting the entire building fall on the surface. When the last shot was black and I heard the credit music started I was shocked - I couldn't believe what I saw and that someone could even call a call. The best thing anyone can do with this film is re-ending and giving something. Hardly, I'd really get anyone who came with that person in the room, look for the face and say - WTF ?? !!!!
