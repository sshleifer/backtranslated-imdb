I don't know the language or act poor, but everything about this movie feels and looks cheap and fake. <br /> <br /> After seeing Der Untergang this is a great disappointment. There is no relationship between different events, and the acting is very poor I can't even believe people can make a mess like something that had great potential. And above all, everyone in Germany speaks English. A major error. German language has a certain sound, and especially Hitler himself looks just like Hitler when speaking / saying German. The way the story is said has made me believe it was made right there, Anime was not empty and the movie seems to be a collection of random events that could happen. It is English or the fact that I've seen Der Untergang, everything about this movie was fake and ignorant.
