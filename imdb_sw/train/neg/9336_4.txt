Implementation of criminal crime committed by a large-scale urbanization market in the 1970s. Pam Grier's stars in the role of the head, the nurse who becomes a female woman after drug robbers makes little sister \ t of Coffy junkie. Violent violence abuses, with energy and excitement of cans; Grier's only rage provides jolt details (not a lot of actor here, but connects with viewers in a special way). Unlike what Charles Bronson was doing at this time, the film was bought and advertised as crass exploitation has not yet been able to get local viewers of the city. Today, however, is only a brief description of the film's 70s, and has no broad appeal to other movies in this kind. * 1/2 from ****
