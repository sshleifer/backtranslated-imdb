I have to put out the attention around saying that the film should not be looked at. It fails the best tax in the best way that it is close to insult to the bravery of those brave people. A special impact was terrible, I did not expect the total failure of the director's component to understand military technology. What? How much of a fire gun can be rated for 600 per minute at a speed of 1/10? How can the soldiers fall before the grenade blows before them? How can people live when there are arms that are close to 20 feet away? What? How are the heads of weapons just coming to the side of the road and not the road itself? It is not just that respecting the weapon calls me, it is an incredible situation with the incongruity of the talks that I had to shout at the murder. There was a common discussion like Yei bhi weed bhai alive, we laath mat maro and Pakistan are musalmaan masters to Hindusan me alive and LOC cross karo you mera live alive. Fools say the least. <br /> <br /> What Shobha De has written is true. The director worked without script and shows. No flow to the movie. There is no gradual development from one battle to another. It's just one gun after the next without any connection to the battle plan. Characteristics are bad. The captain of the army appears to be unaware. To do the worst things of the games of the games sportsmen chose the best selected to match the long four hours of film within 3 hours.
