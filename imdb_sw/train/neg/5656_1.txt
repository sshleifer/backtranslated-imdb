The ta'kol al lahem is a bad movie. This is just a picture of the exhibition without an open link. But something very strange in this film, talking about sex, women's liberation, nude scenes are very rare in Arabic movies, even nowadays. In fact I thank the director and administrators for their courage. We want to see more of this style in Egyptian movies, but with excellent quality. The reasons that led to this film were very bad not just the event and the act, but also the lack of prediction. This movie looks like one of the amateur. We can see many errors on the screen. If you want a good Arab film Ziab la ta'kol al lahm is not proposed.
