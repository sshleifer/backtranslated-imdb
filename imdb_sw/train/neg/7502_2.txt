I have loved the movies of Spike Lee all the time, but this was a total waste at 2/2. I expected more of Sam's son and instead I got a movie that appears to be very unrelated to the serial killings of 1977. Dog talking was delicious (you know you're in trouble when all the filmmakers have erupted in bad laugh). The whole movie seemed to be very real and very unpleasant. Sexual ceremonies were not fully aware of the plot. I am not against sex in movies, but should have some action (except the XXX movie). For all, we were very disappointed in this bid of Spike Lee!
