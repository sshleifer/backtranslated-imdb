This movie was just below bad. I love war movies and can usually come from many movies and find something I like, but this was not one of them. This movie did not have the power and power.OK I get it, Finns set one hell to fight with that's great, but the story is unknown. You do not have any real relationship with any characters and no line of real follow-up. You just come from one place of random to another, nothing goes in to create a story that is trying to be sent. If you want a movie of war that will insist, and surprisingly enough without the events of the war, then I would suggest "Fall" (the WWII film of Germany). Or if you like a line of great stories and a lot of action then I recommend "Brotherhood of War" (Korean War / Korean film). These two movies will not leave you as a winter war.
