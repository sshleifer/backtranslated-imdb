They should have called this film for many because all of the stupid films around the cemetery map. Not to mention how many of the same boring shots of the map there. The only thing that they show most of the map is the smallest beads that build on the head of our main character. This was indeed a way for filmmakers to show how many things are growing in the Immortal Hills Cemetery. Now, could they just show us one of the events of death? We hear a lot about how everyone listed on the map leaves like flies, but we can't see anything. Some of the ways I live Animals are living in order to keep my mind so I had good hospitality and rating I gave but I can't recommend this movie to anyone. Unless you are very interested in a map or sweat I propose to rent a better movie, such as I will hit your Wave or Your Blood.
