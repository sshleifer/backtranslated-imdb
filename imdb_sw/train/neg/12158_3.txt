.... it may seem to be given very much .... but there is a real story of life .. of a man who had a relationship with a woman, who discovered where he and his new wife were sitting, and killed his wife, making it look like murder .......... he had told everyone that the man had asked him to kiss her. So he left his job in Wisconsin ... and moved to Minnesota ........ .. The end I heard was in the institute of intelligence, Prison Security .... <br /> <br /> she was wearing a "ring of participation." that he bought for himself ... and had told everyone that he had bought him. The events took place in a small town in Wisconsin ,,,,,,, and the killings occurred in Minnesota ...... There was even a story story in the "People" magazine ... Spring of 1988, I want to say in Page 39 I remember this if I was at the university at the time, and my colleague met with an individual at the Security Hospital ....
