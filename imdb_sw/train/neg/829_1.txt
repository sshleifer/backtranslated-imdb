I heard about this film and I knew it was not very good. But I started watching the film (on my film station) and I was interested. This can be a very big satire, dark black on today's values ​​in the media. The small parts of each candidate were good. It builds something I don't want to lose. But when called show start everything becomes implausible, cheaper and rather silly. Here is the author who will add something that makes people think. But instead it is closed and think people are dumb. <br /> <br /> The end is very bad I will give you 1. Even if the film starts promising.
