I watched the Canada videotape of this movie as "Witching" which somehow made the way to New York State. The voice was so bad, I had to lift it up to 7/8 just to hear and the sound of the voice was often caused by the discussion. Orson Welles was a mumbler, worse than usual, and some of his conversations and others went through the echo room. The spiritual figure that continues to lift it had its distorted voice. Some of the closed words had helped! A group of witches or travelers (the last attributes say the group did not mean to represent any true group!) And a cult that finds naked and causes miscarriage by blowing a doll. A pregnant woman and her husband moved to a town called "Lilith," where she has been assigned to a toy factory. Despite one of the AKAs of this movie seems to be "Toy Factory," we never see it, and it is often known at all times. The way to go to Lilith, her husband is patient with some of her questions about what her new boss Mr. Cato wanted to know about their religious influence. He drives the car with violence, and causes another vehicle to leave the road and blow the blow. After the police arrived, she took a doll out of the car, the second of many hands dolls in the film. It seems Mr. Cato and all the people of the city are witches, and that is what they caused him to miscarriage, although he does not know. They want him because he has an innate talent of scarcity, which had no real knowledge. Other images on films are harmful, but for the whole movie it doesn't really matter. The movie seems a bit of mess, and this is certainly largely due to its adjustment and the addition of a new footage. The original version, according to the last features, was called Necromancy - A Life for Life. The DVD player enables us to watch two versions in one shop, but to repeat this film is probably not a priority.
