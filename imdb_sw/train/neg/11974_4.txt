You know that you have been looking at SHURI at SARA for eight years, right? I was able to understand the first curiosity of the visitors to be on the Island, but you think that after looking at the senseless heroes, speaking and stretching to run through the bush and egg on a spoon for half a tenth will be enough to get you dedicated to something more original (and interesting). I have not talked about the legitimacy of the exhibitions for the record I see. It is difficult to stop the unbelief of "Bushy Bill" to eat mice when all the workers of the manufacturers and people of the camera are available in the make-shift bio-dome weather sipping frosty mochcinno and moxy. appeal here? I don't care about these people or their exciting lives. I just don't know. But if you find yourself hairy, uninvited people, I give you your TV and just go to your bus station where you can see people like this in their real home. They call them PEOPLE, and free of charge, you can sit and wonder their ability to get a lot of cigarettes from a lot of litter agent, ultimately attracts "dirt" and creating Dr Frankenstein-styled-cancer cancer, all the time asking people to change food when the smell of "Aqua Velva" on their breath is enough to recommend otherwise. And the most beautiful place? Much like the Savior, every week one member of the tribe "Leaves" of "Island" when sent to help with the Local Institute when the horrible situation of undified the schizophrenia faces in the gear! Now It's TRAINING!
