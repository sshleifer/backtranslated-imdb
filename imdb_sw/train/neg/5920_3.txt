Normal? Yes! <br /> <br /> unfamiliar layout for the American movie, New Zealand. A common lesson, four sisters and their relationship with American soldiers, from one who has an unlawful child of Senator's son, and another who lived with Marine seven (one at a time) before being killed Her husband returned to POW New Zealander. His amazing role as Rocky Graziano in the brilliant "Man Loves That Love Me." <br /> <br /> Normal for two "Stars" Joan Fontaine and Jean Simmons, leave very little on the movie. <br /> <br /> Unusual that I might be worried to write a review of a very bad movie, give them a miss!
