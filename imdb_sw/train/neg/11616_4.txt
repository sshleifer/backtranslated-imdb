I didn't enjoy the film, Joshua, even a little. Maybe it's because I saw another film similar to Orphan 2 days before but maybe it's just because this film wasn't very good. I go with the level. Indeed, the plot of the evil child is not the original but that does not mean the film is not successful. It may be a recreational and entertaining and hot but rather slow and constructive, and it did not leave me to think anything more than 'what was not very good' when it passed. At the end, Joshua's inspiration is revealed. I will not give you away but the fact is that he did not finish his goals since despite Vera Farmiga as his mother, Abby, disappearing over 3/4 through the movie, all the arrows describing his return soon. He gave himself to a mental institution because he had lost his mind but then Joshua / her father was accused of opposing her medication that tells the audience that the institution found that she was not mentally ill but that it was closed with medicine. So .. shouldn't come home soon? What? Joshua will not fail? What? His mother cannot live with him and his sister and maybe his father soon? I ask Father since the future has been left open. <br /> <br /> At the end of the day, I didn't care about the characters. The son of the evil spirit Joshua was not afraid. The story of the story moved slowly and when it took it was still boring. The shock fell flat every time. Previously I couldn't believe I was sitting all the way. Just because the act was good from parents especially Vera Farmiga as Mama but if you want to see movies about a bad child to see orphans. Now that's a movie that took an unusual idea and created a talented film.
