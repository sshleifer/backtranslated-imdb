Stimulating to the largest movie of 1972 to play for action, very interesting Caine as the nemesis of its character from the first movie. But do not do anything else easily. The bottom of the parr from the participants, the Law and the Caine, is overlooked by the weakened independence direction. <br /> <br /> The setting temperature in nature is left for modern-modern housing. The co-operation between Oliver and Caine, which made the first film to be seen, is replaced by a great arrogance, a pride that generates a sudden spectator. But this is not a clever, mindful and ambitious one, then another nature of the nature is well developed, this is a clear kill of WTT behavior from the word to go. This Sleuth version is not worth seeing, see original films and be displayed from the opening action.
