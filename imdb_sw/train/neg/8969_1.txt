The program does not offer any new exemptions, even starting with the cube I. This time there is no additional cube machine, except for an extra exit, which is not protected, highly skilled. The characters are also not well defined as in the first part, they just became "flat" as in the soap opera. If someone does it in a natural way, that person will be asked some questions, if you “believe in God?”, not really creative or natural and especially in my opinion is not appropriate to enter the secret cube and traps. There is really nothing else to say about it.
