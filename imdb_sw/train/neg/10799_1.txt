This movie is so, so, so terrible, which makes angels lose their wings. Shaq had tried to make other tribal efforts, like his work in Shaq-Fu for NES and his unofficial rap songs, and later, epic uses the scary text of the film which is Steel. There is nothing good to say about this movie. I saw it was a group of times when I was very young, but I must be a idiot then, because this film takes all the fun about the film and opens it. It's fun to laugh. I saw it at the Disney Center shortly and spent a few minutes doing it. Although, once a stimulus is happening, it is still disturbed by its fear. See it on television, try this: think, as you watch the film, excluding all the events that Shaq uses its magical powers. If you do this, it becomes like a film about a man who chased a child and laughed at him. That's kinda funny, and distract. <br /> <br /> A terrible example of the film. What? Not, unless you look for shock, look at this film.
