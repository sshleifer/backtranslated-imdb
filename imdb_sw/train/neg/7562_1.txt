I haven't seen nature, but I wanted to leave a quick note for anyone who happens to hit down here: Wicker Man is a very bad movie I saw this year. Maybe even in two years. I would like to ask the playground for my money back or to return to warn yourself to not see. I will give them two positive permits: Cage's laughter at least laughs from me and the island's surroundings were good. Sorry, that's it. Here come the jeers. The film plan is being carried out because other characters will not give Cage any direct answers - and sets this thing !!! How this can continue for more than an hour of my time (a very small day in the movie) is beyond me. Not to mention that the field is full of holes. You come from the theater with enough questions to fill the library. How anyone can read this script and think, "Yes, people should pay $ 11 to see the shady notes of the film which looks like" it's beyond me. Do not go see this flick. Or even rent on DVD.
