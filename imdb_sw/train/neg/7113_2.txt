USING (1 out of 5 stars) This movie has good cooling features (remote privacy guides which will provide free film films while dying for fear of watching this film, awesome shooting of a skull from placid beach and very awesome music but, sadly, all the movies are down from there. A widow takes her new grandmother in her secret house ... urging her servants and friends that the new Mrs. has been very disappointed in the past. In fact, no one at all starts to see and hear wonderful things that no one else can. Her husband assures her that it is only in her mind and ... well, you can see all this goes. What you have done is going on long before our innocent heroine ... because you've probably seen the same plot in hundreds of other movies and television shows (and done well, too). In order to add to the major films of the film, the further reduction of this film (in cheap DVD cooperation) appears to have few important items. You see the heroine slowly walking towards the window ... she might open ... you know she'll see something terribleâ€¦ then ... suddenly the area is reduced by begging her by her husband's hands. Why did he see it? I think we will never know.
