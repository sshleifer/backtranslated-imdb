For many years I have seen this group directly on Segal video movies, and everyone has the same amount of entertainment; unfortanetley, the level of entertainment is below. Indeed, follow-up tracking was preferred, but that was very good. Seagal was actually in his head when he made movies like; Under the siege, Under the siege 2, and the Executive Decision (at least in view of the action), but over the past decade, these types of movies that Segal's star is not worthy to achieve its former features. <br /> <br /> On the most beautiful side, the film made good use of time, as some of the implementation process and wit use. Just when the movie seemed just witty, the scene pretty cool action brought out of the gutter. I believe in fact that most of Segal's movies would do well if not only the fans know in the film. Helping administrators and actors is a very important thing, and if its current films are shared with known and auxiliary participants, maybe the movie will get the most popular results.
