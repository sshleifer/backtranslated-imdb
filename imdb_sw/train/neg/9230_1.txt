I must graduate it, now that I think about it. Checkout is not entirely useless. I have had the opportunity to see it twice, and for the second time I was very surprised at the cost of the movie. so I think it's worth something to it. and it is also important for the pain that was caused by my first view. as another attorney showed, this film is deceived by every word word. not one original idea that came into this film (which makes the comments below about the originality of my most beautiful background). The film is nothing but a longest line of cliches that are connected together and around like a film. it is definitely not the second authors, it is definitely not natural, and not quite "good, fresh to fun." The film is quite bitter for uninitiated (after seeing it the first time, the second time may be quite funny, in a terrible way). When I was near the theater, it was obvious that almost everyone, obstructing perhaps the elderly, was too tired or hurt to this movie. during some of the emotional events, such as Nick motivates his mother, the listeners were shouting because it was not well done. I heard someone * crying * in the theater, something I had never witnessed. I don't care where you have the opportunity to see this film, either in the film festival, or in the theater, or anywhere. make yourself a permit, skip this film for revenge. unless you are like me and you can't deny the opportunity to see what might be a bad movie made.
