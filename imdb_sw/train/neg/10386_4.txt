This can be interesting? Japan-set the story of the haunted house from the view of a new American family set? but it falls on flat because of the higher and no cure for all those made by the director. The movie faces the same difficulty I often encounter a popular modernization of natural price, namely the fact that the spirits indicate that it is bad for any real reason except that they are expected! Besides, does not give much to the awesome department? The biggest crashes of crab is just silly? as, in general, ghosts live in a particular character and make him act in the wrong way, such as Susan George persuading a diplomat / friend-family Doug McClure and Edward Albert power-feeding his daughter's soup dish! One time, the old monk returns home to warn Albert of the danger if they stay there? finally, he is called to destroy buildings. However, history should repeat itself and the tragedy is the only result of a timely situation? leading to a brutal brutality but without the fun that Albert and McClure, who have the spirit of their Japanese predecessors, are involved in impromptu martial arts to death! At the end of the day, this happens at the time of the innocent? tolerance for only 88 minutes, but, in any way, look at the key.
