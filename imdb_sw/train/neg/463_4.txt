Blonde and Blonder did not have an unfunny. Usually, it was a miner girl version version of Dumb and Dumber, but less funny, and they used many background sounds and music.WAY TOO MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS INFORMATION AND MUSIC if you say me !!!! It comes out of the most incredible, and it usually does not take any speed anywhere, and I had a lot more sense if this lie is not going on. Of course, the only thing that cured from giving this film was 1 was 30 minutes ago. and so interesting as it was near the end, but that's the only place. So, I couldn't help but like Pamela Anderson's characters and Denise little Richard. Even though this film did not laugh from me, it had my thoughts. but there are thousands of better films to spend your time and money more than Blonde and Blonder.
