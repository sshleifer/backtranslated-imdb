The Christmas secret was given as a wonderful film, but I was desperate. They were selling VHS and DVD copies of the film when it passed, which leads me to think the producers were very happy with this project. As a screen actor I felt many of the performances called, although Beau Bridges, like Nick, had time or two. If I was Richard Thomas I couldn't put this film to my resume otherwise well. It was a shame. I was a fan since the days of his Waltons, but I found myself not trying to look at any of his next work, so it was very poor this offering. <br /> <br /> In the protection of actors, the lead was hit, mechanical, and quite amateur. <br /> <br /> I hope this is not considered a bitter review and negative thoughts made on my reputation as a critic. I changed the film because it had a good cast and I had enjoyed enjoying the film. However I would protest anyone out there to watch this film and does not like their money, although it was on T.V.
