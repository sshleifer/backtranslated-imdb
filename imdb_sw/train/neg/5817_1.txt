The most difficult thing about this movie is to say anything positive about it. The characters had an unusual "white-garbage", the film "plot" of the film was hit from the beginning, and the worst aspect of this film is that the weakness was very clear from the double body was funny. Unfortunately, this is the only interesting thing in the film. Mrs. Jenkins will be used well as in the future, she would avoid using her life story to be "welcome" people. It was just bad. One positive feature of this movie (this is not associated with the lack of film quality) is that my brother gave money to this stinker.
