To put it easily, I don't like west. And that I've never sat one from the beginning to the end, I decided to look at my "Darling Clementine" and see all the way, no matter how painful it was to me. At first it was as good as expected. I found that acting is interesting, environmentally friendly (your dessert, horse and cowboys) stimulating and music and its time-consuming pain. However, after speaking mentally to fight and fight, after the first 20 minutes it became easier for me to endure. Considering in the movies, and how John Ford could do even the worst situation (lighter according to me) seems quite surprisingly often, making it very interesting. In conclusion, I can't go so far to say that I enjoyed the film and its end. However it was well locked for me to stay to the end, and that itself attracted me.
