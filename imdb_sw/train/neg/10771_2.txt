Did you not watch children's films for several years, so I missed "Here At Tigers" when it first came out. (Never even saw "Bears News Bad" even though in 70 years I worked for boys who planned money for the film, "Warriors," "Someone who would be King," and "Rocky Horror Picture Show," among others. ) Now I would like to watch old or small movies and find people who have gone to a great job though they have had a small movie in advance. Just a few minutes on this film I can take again and jump on the last credit to see if there is a little actor in this film who had gone to a lot of things and well - at least looking for his appearance would be interesting if the plot and acting did not work. Lo and behold, I mentioned the name of Wes Craven in reputation as a gaffer of electricity. He made two or three of his original shockers but still did not create Freddie Krueger or made a movie "Scream". Maybe he had a debt and helped this picture. More surprising was Fred J. Lincoln in the features of cast as "Aesop," a wacky character in the movie. F.J. Lincoln, from 70 years to a few years ago, appeared and produced adult films. It was associated with the adult spoof "Ozporns," and this title is the funnier than all of the "Tigers" tries to keep together. Let the fact that an adult actor placed on a children's movie is a sign of how people who make this film should sleep in the wheel.
