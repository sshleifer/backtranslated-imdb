This should be a WORST movie ever !!! Acting is stronger than the movie. Blood pollution, but no idea where it comes from, because they do not show cuts. I can't believe I have lost my time watching this movie. We laughed as we were looking at the comedy and not the movie of fear. This is a disgrace for awesome films! For one in Asia why there are white police driving waste disposal waste? There are many other languages ​​that you don't even know what's going on in half. The film editing is a joke, my boy can do well. And if I went to the cinema and a good old man was working a window that would be the first clue. Don't see MOVIE HU! YOU WANT TO WORK IN WORK, YOU CAN WORK !!
