This film can be very effective and re-script again. Not that I expect too much in the movie, but you think that even a home-based Jack Mason and city dwellers will ask why a skilled hunter group would like to hire him as a hunting guide. And after reaching the hunting grounds, the T-poor ice is part of its part as if it is going to lead these people through trees that he has never seen. How does Jack Mason get back in Seattle? I consider this film was the basis of Richard Connell's short story "The worst." A few years ago I showed this film to a class of Grade 9 pupils after reading stories. I re-created the film, forbidding all the useless and dirty events. It reached 43 minutes long.
