***** maybe small attackers ****** <br /> I can't say I liked it, but I can't say I wasn't ... very strange. It has bad things in it like for example a shark that hasn't come anywhere and the worst CGI you can imagine, if I was a director I would refuse that part, really gave me the desire to stop seeing all the film. .. For some people it will be boring because it is not good to work, it feels the house is done sometimes ... Take the example of one of the dead friends and what else do they do? nop, not right ... their awesome stories to each other. * sighs * (just after right to hes lost) <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br> /> <br/> <br/> <br/> Other something stupid was when they were talking in a boat that they were like "hundreds" of candles in the table before them ... the boat is surrounded by some kind of rag curtains ( old ones that needed windows) and sofa / seedlings ... I thought it was dumb, using candles but not thinking about the environment, instead of being just in the high seas ... <br /> <br /> Good, some scary scenes have done well I liked it. Sometimes fear makes it better when it is hidden when it is behind something rather than showing, so this movie makes it well, maybe because its low budget I don't know, but it does a good job for me! You will hear the tension if you forget the holes like those I have mentioned above. <br /> <br /> Don't expect too much of it! but if you like to watch this film, patience, try to relax. lol <br /> (sorry on my raw English) =) <br /> <br /> Cheers
