Expelled from heaven, a bunch of naked angels (with large plastic stones) have already stayed in the juniper trees where they plant any senseless soul that should walk with. Not long before a group of friends on a road trip is affected by newborn babies? The fear of low self-esteem made in the UK, the Damned Forest takes an impressive Force to wipe it under the pot and some of the worst jobs, the effects and instructions I have seen for a long time. <br /> <br /> Director Johannes Roberts shows a regular flair behind the camera? The incidents in a damaged home are short-lived and there are some of the time held by shock - but in many places the film is romantic. Make the best performances from awesome Tom Savini and Shauts Hutson icons, and you have one very bad movie in your hands. Some fun can be released from a short film, and there are female feminine loopholes, but most will get this job to stay.
