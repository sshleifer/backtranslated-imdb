I was fascinated by this theme, and only the fans of Drew Barrymore's dancing at David Letterman's desk will find anything to attract in it. Well, he shows the breast (or perhaps the body twice makes). The plan is hit by bits and acting is awesome. Any leadership does not have any material to work with, as the direction of the film does not lead anywhere. Don't waste your time. Check out Donnie Darko instead if you want a Drew Barrymore film that is interesting, and if you want to see another, skip here and see Darko again. <br /> <br /> The treatment of the story of Doppelganger is also a criminal. Refer to Charles Williams's novel "Go into hell" for something that is worth considering. This is an excuse to make a B go film directly into the video and absorb life from people in Blockbuster. What makes any of these people think that acting here was highly praiseworthy? Give me a break.
