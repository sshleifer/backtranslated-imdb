Okay, movie slasher. A very stupid, very stupid film. We have young people who have no views in the house of the house going. We have a FBI agent who seems to be filthy Harry sometimes too. "So what is the secret .... punks?" We have about 4 different camera campaigns and an area that does not really know. "Hey man, I persuade the cartoon" (this person was my favorite part of the movie)) Suddenly there is a preacher tied on the bed looking at home movies, being killed. <br /> <br /> follow the killer in the middle of anywhere, without cops. suddenly she is a church, wearing a wedding dress. I swear this is the stupidest movie slasher I've ever seen.
