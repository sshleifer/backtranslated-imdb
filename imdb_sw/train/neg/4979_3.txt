Why oh why no one can make a good film from story story? This is the second change of "Beowulf" I've been disappointed with the year. But I must say, the original version ("Beowulf & Grendel", with the star Gerald Butler) was greater than this. That was just a little sad. This is a mess !!! What is the most requested? What? What are some of the practical aspects that have added to any reason (human sacrifice? Unconditional preference?), Or a bad CGI, or a misunderstanding of the actors or working unemployed? Worse is the way they made beautiful Marina Sirtis look so awesome !!! And you can't even talk about the bow of evil? And why they always reminded us that Beowulf was capable of 30 men, and still did not show a little sign of that power in the entire film. He was being beaten next to both of them fighting, relying on his side to save his bacon. Even when he hit the head of pride, he did not find him. He was also joining arms. Beo-wimp is more like that. Surely this was not a powerful Beowulf of epic poem! I would like to put an end to this with a positive note but I can't think of the real one. All I can say is, if you've ever read "Beowulf", you will be broken by this bad, incorrect excuse!
