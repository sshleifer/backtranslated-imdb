As a great fan of gorilla movies in general, I expected this would be good - and if the gorilla's effects were, they were really good, however - that's the only thing I can write on this flop. The film says that it depends on the true story but in fact, it does not even close to what happened to "Buddy" - who in real life, was a famous Gargantua, sold to Ringling Bros. and "sensitivity" Gertrude Lintz, known by many animal enthusiasts as a woman who did not have the welfare of her animals for the benefit. In addition to Buddy being shown to be aggressive, this was a general lie and no time a gorilla, in real life, goes through such behavior. The buddy made, in fact, avoiding his wooden basket (not a room of salt cage as shown on the film) during the storm, looking for comfort and comfort in the house, which feared Gertrude Lintz to sell. No, Buddy was not opened in a gorilla family surrounded by green trees in a zoo-paradise, he was left in a wooden basket, deep behind the garage at a certain time with just one comfort pipe and then sold to the circus - where he lived a good more with nuts cast until he died (the oldest historic living in memory, by the way) before the show in Miami. See also, in the film, how Buddy is getting old but the chimpanzee is not old. (Typhoon, by the way, were not raised at the same time with other animals, including Buddy, as shown in the film)
