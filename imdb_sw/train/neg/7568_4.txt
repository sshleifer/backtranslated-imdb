Chan Wook's park is not something like an innovation. I am a refugee but this is a very smooth and engaging in low technical skills and good ideas made in the middle. Trying to walk in the footsteps of the interest of Marc Caro and Jeunet (CITY OF THE LOST CHILDREN, DELICATESSEN), the park includes a fanciful story, lighter which is leaving largely due to its common morbid journey. Of course anyone who is wrong with his own ambition or vision, is definitely not expected, then seeing all the efforts of the park increases to a very little. It is a CYBORG but it looks amazing to delete it from itself when it goes, and the end result will be part of the whole part of its parts. Columns are promising, gags are magic and bad humor increases but all fails to amazingly create any relationship with the audience. The characters are good and grown and play with gusto and cast, but, try as I can, I can't protect myself. THE LADY MESSAGE OF THE LADY VENGEANCE was bad, suggests that the park was very low, but it has been able to show some unique client and after the amazing film, it was easily forgiven. There is no courage that ordered the area of ​​general protection or SYMPATHY FOR MR. VENGEANCE looks here. I am a frog but this has been left to me not completely stuck and I have been actively frequent (often as the film continued). I gave him a LADY 5/10, and for that measure, maybe this is not more than 3. For the past, I will be generous: 4/10
