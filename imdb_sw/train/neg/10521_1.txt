This movie is a bad waste of time. Although it's only one and a half hours you feel somewhere around 4. I've never seen the motion of the film so slowly and so without purpose. This is also a "fear" film that takes place during the day. My friend and I laughed a lot of fraud when we were scared. The only thing we want to know is why this terrible movie was released in many countries. Can't be on demand. Nicole Petty's supermodel should stick for example because though she is good she lost her accent often in this movie, half of the time she is British and half when she is American.
