HeidiJean saw this movie really? Great Christmas movie? Not near. Dull, bland and completely missing in mind and heart. I kept watching this film wondering who the hell thought that Carly Papa could lead to this film! The woman does not have a personality to explore and gives enough work. Baransky was as good as usual and provided just an interesting thing. His involvement was probably the only reason for this project was green and advertised. Perhaps I expect too much for a live movie that played 15 days from Christmas but I sat for this thing to think that for a different director and JJ to reconcile with an actor who at least could hear this sympathy could be a very small movie.
