It is not surprising that historian Ian Kershaw, author of Hitler's story, who was formerly a science adviser to this television film, separated himself. The film is historically not just accurate. Errors begin immediately when the father of Hitler Alois dies at home, when he actually died in the pub. In the film, Hitler says from Vienna to Munich in 1914, when in fact he moved to Munich in 1913. I could go without end. Hitler's childhood and adolescence are shown a very short way, which makes it very difficult for people who have no historical experience to understand the character of this troubled person. Important people at the beginning of the party, as a friend of Hitler's father Dietrich Eckart or a "philosopher" Alfred Alfred Rosenberg did not have any. Ernst Hanfstaengl's behavior is very difficult. In the film he is shown as a good character which almost despises Hitler. The script follows clear of Hanfstaengl`s himself gloss on his own view which gave in his biography after the war. In fact, Hanfstaengl was a combat pastor and had things about his "Fuehrer". But the biggest problem of the film is the image of Hitler himself. He is known as a person who is a constant friend, does not charisma do not charm and always orders everyone around. After watching the film, someone is wondering, how a hateful person has ever had any followers. Since we all know, what Hitler breaker offender, usually every author is tempted to show Hitler as a very embarrassing and non-core. But the fact is, in private can be charming and entertaining. His traders did not follow him because he called them often, but because they loved this wonderful man. In addition to all these historical errors, the film has been made well, executives are the first class, the shots of the area and design production provides a reliable sense of the era.
