Words cannot describe just how bad this film is. I looked at the video last night, and I just couldn't believe what I saw. Basically, "Snakeeater" is about an old military man (Lorenzo Lamas) and his search for his arrested sister who has been bound by Rednecks of Deliverance style. Film, writing, direction, photography, and editing are sad and a song called "Soldier" which should be one of the worst songs of all time! <br /> <br /> However, there is one cure. "Horshack" (Ron Pallio) from "Welcome Back Carter" is in the movie playing bad man. Otherwise, please avoid this mess on ALL VIP.
