This movie was announced on radio, television, newspapers, etc. Nearly every hour or every issue. So when we went to the multiplex Kinnepolis our expectations were very high. But oh boy, how sad this movie! It's a film in Hollywood style about the movie in the movie. Shades shows very clearly we are not ready to produce 'great Hollywood movies'. I'm not a movie critic, but I think a good movie starts with a beautiful script. And the script is a dream. If my subject line says, it's not something, and then it is given. You can just watch television too, without seeing anything. That is how we feel when we saw Shades. Shades is BAD Production !!!
