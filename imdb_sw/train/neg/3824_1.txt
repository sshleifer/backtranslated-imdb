I feel that movie did not show Smith history. The aim of this movie was to tell Smith's life in such a way that it would be "good" to the LDS Church leaders, historical accuracy seems to be less of concern. The movie was designed to be "faith promoting" experience, not the view of Smith's balance "as a man." I have isolated myself to learn the life of Smith and have read both LDS and no LDS work. Movies, like more LDS projects, were well photographed and taken well. However, this was not a true example of the early life of Mormonism or Smith short. The most important time of the time was given to the accidents that Smith had when he was seven years old. When this event was not very important in creating his mental attitude, it seems that the main reason for doing it in the film is helping to create the sympathy of Joseph Smith. Another feature is the image of Smith's teenage years, the film is silent about the family's Smith's involvement in magical practices during the 1820s. he sometimes lost his temper and began to be strong. <br /> <br /> I could go on and on. This movie was not historical in any way and should be considered a false movie about a person. I would like to see this film for any other purpose then entertainment.
