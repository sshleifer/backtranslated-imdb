Okay, it's very rare that I complain to something I got for FREE. So I think this movie pushed me on that limit. I saw it at the Hollywood cemetery for FREE and walking very far away. The question of one member of the audience to the director about using Native American references as "bookends" instead of interfering with the best movie, basically says everything that this movie has fallen on. REABERENCES OF NATIVE FOR US • The American Americans felt true out of place and emerged. It is clear that this director and author had tried to deal with the field they had not played before. They should be connected to the old adage of "writing about something you know". If they are truly known in this fact, they did not show in the film or the beauty of this unique culture was not given the right right. <br /> <br /> Clichés and ON NOSE --- I accepted this film on the basis that it was indie. So I put it on high expectations. "Little Little Sunshine" was indie and observed before becoming very popular. Before the release of the release for a long time I was already trying how it would be hit. UNFORTUNATELY I could not say the same as "Expiration Date". "Sunshine" took us to a photography event but the filmmakers were clever in their way that the result could lead us to a different direction to avoid the trap of being "cliche". This movie on the other hand had no way to fall into the trap because it had already been beaten from scratch. Antics of the psychological mother, a couple of Hendrix, etc.. I hate to say so, but the best movie and the WORST that I have seen this year are all Indian. "Little Miss Sunshine" will be the best and this movie will be worse. I wish I could say otherwise. But I thank the filmmakers for having such a good from their members on the cemetery.
