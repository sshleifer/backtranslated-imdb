... This is the worst film I could see. Hmmm, OK is probably bound by Boogeyman then. No, really bad. I had low expectations and failed to meet them! I honestly did not think about one good thing. so here are the worst points ... <br /> <br /> 1. USING 2. MIBU 3. CGI (Xbox 360 has excellent graphics .... seriously) 4. FAMILY 5. CASTING AND finally ... 6. PLOT <br /> <br /> There are many unanswered questions, Did they make a 2:32 film for a long time and then know that they did not keep Lex Luthor and Superman in the area as well as had to solve a little of 3 minutes or really thought no one would see that the great hero and the villain had a limited time of screening with the son of Superman and the killer? !! Was it half the budget used to influence Kevin Spacey to do so? When Superman is going to the hospital, why the doctors do not ask "What F *** wants us to do? She is F *** is a stranger! We don't know jack about her anatomy!" <br /> <br /> What happened in 5 years Superman was away to cause technology to develop 28 years? Where people wrote a good review to watch the film? <br /> <br /> and finally, Why? Just, why? BTW, for those who wonder how come Superman could lift the whole continent of krypyonite, I think I have done out ... his. so the mainland is the only one who prevents his fear of the green rock .... or that or the authors are half-a-half who didn't think it was a clear mistake.
