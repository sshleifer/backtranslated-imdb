This movie is one of the worst movies made. Jon Bon Jovi can play in movies? He is a singer, not a actor, Is it? He kills vampires and guitar? And what about the awesome plan? O my God this film is very interesting. At the end is the Queen of Vampires played by the Vampire Forever Arly Jover (Blade) surrounded by an army of vampires, but when the strange "murderers" arrive only 4 vampires left! What happened to other 10-15 hurricanes? They run away from the sun? And what about the "Grand Last" when Bon Jovi hits his head and shotgun ??? That's "NOT" true. In "Buffy killer of vampire" in 100 events is not a single vampire is killed by SHOTGUN ??? This is actually a lack of nature!
