This movie begins with a certain amount of commitment; but, from my point of view, it begins to lose when the protagonist hits the Samaritan Samaritan who comes to help him when his car declines. That the visitor begins to fix his car when off to make the phone is implausible enough, but that he is one of the few people in the country who can help him keep his family's life on track is a kind of unfortunate beginning the authors warn against using in their stories. <br /> <br /> You've got an average of this excellent movie. Artistic leadership can be better, as it can be a movie. Acting was good, and also singing to Eva van der Gucht.
