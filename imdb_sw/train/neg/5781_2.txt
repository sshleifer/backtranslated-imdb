Russian Polanski has made many movies, which are not available. His glory loves me. There is no such thing as the top top except Chinatown (I haven't seen 'knife in Water' or 'Tess'). Any contribution made to the film concluded more than twenty years ago; His work is only shameful, safe and / or evil (Pianist, Frantic, Oliver Twist, Fourth Gate, Pirates). It is an independent and highly contextual concept for the 1968 "horror" movie (do not show a child). But this is not just the fear of horror. Everything stops because the plot of the conspiracy becomes quite clear in advance (Um, thanks to the last name to destroy), and on the clear day you see the end of the day. It didn't promote my interests. I see that whatever this film can be, is completely destroyed by the 1960s of the female female. Farrow is a chronically ill patient, the anxiety of the mother / mother. His excitement is growing more ... he is very angry. There is no real thought in it ... nothing to consider but to be the mother of the devil. Dakota is not used because it has great potential.
