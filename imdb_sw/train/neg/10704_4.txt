It's Hard Hard meets with Cliffhanger when the ski center is facing terrorists and it's on one soldier, Jack (Crackerjack) to stop this. The movie B-action which claims from other films and is quite good and very good, conspiracy plot (like in these movies) and three beautiful stars. Thomas Ian Griffith as a soldier and Nastasja Kinski and Christopher Plummer as terrorists. If you do not like the B-action movie this stupid is not yours.
