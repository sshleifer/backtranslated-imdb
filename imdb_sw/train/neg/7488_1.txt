Anyone who saw the movie's original 1970 knows how best, the script, and the director can put together the comedy hub. With the same gesture, it is easy to see how the opposite of it could create another stupid Hollywood-tone! This movie was sad! If it was not for John Cleese (comic thought), I would like to walk out of 15 minutes on this bad cell. Neil Simon did not write other screens for this version (he said he could not improve on first), and I was surprised that after this cinema fiasco can not be charged for defamation of humor! Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis did a very good job in the original, what manufacturers thought when they lost this? How can the director and editor see these pictures and think of any of them who was funny? I don't know, but one thing I know â€” it's not surprising why foreign and independent movies become more popular and more .......
