With the habit of repeating itself, Wenders has been a strong ambition since the big bang with 'Paris Texas'. 'A lot of country' is not different. Considering the fact that I expected an average film even before it entered, Wenders' expectations seemed much better. Taken to grated now its films are heavy handed and bombastic. <br /> <br /> I was not sure if I was looking for a comedy that will stimulate Central America or some exciting. The result of Diehl's behavior is quite permanent. The emphasis on Wender on many events and a rock song is also very sad. She had hidden holes in her script and direction for photography. I am sure that many people will get this important and enriching film but for all honestly, these social and cultural efforts only speak of a bad trend. <br /> <br /> Interesting that Wenders claimed when doing 'Paris Texas', had a great support from Sam Sheppard and script. Yes, that's the best trader and should understand now he needs a text writer. His films from the last 15 years were a complete mess.
