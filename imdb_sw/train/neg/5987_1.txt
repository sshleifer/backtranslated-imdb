I really didn't like this film. The plan was very high. The most common American plan, I think. Guy gets a girl kind of something last. And London has Monorail? London Bank ??? UK Bank is what really! - I did so even though looking for Tracy Island and Thunderbirds themselves. And Brits were baddies? (away from Parker and Lady Penelope) What had it? Oh and they kept saying things like "Here comes" Thunderbirds "- but it has never been known as 'Thunderbirds' in a series, why do you do it? I would like to see this renewed in 20 years and more of the British cast. I liked the previous series. Sorry!
