Well, I saw this movie yesterday and it's - unfortunately - worse than you might think. First of all the plot is idiotic, completely useless. Screenplay is full of deliberate discussion of funny. The audience was often laughing. And doubts are very low. Workers play so-so, except Sharon Stone, who has a good time but also a very bad time of action. The sad part is when he tries to be a boy and says things like "I want * beep * you" and it looks like, let's say gently, an old woman very grateful and not quite sexy. Sufficient tension from BI1 has gone completely. From the technical point of the Basic Institute 2 is a black movie - better than usual to DVD, but with a lower lever than the original movie. For example the joyride area of ​​things happens badly. Primary Foundation Director is not Paul Verhoeven and shows. The new composer is not Jerry Goldsmith and its shows. Script is made by people who do not match for Joe Eszterhas. There is no alternative to Michael Douglas in it. The film looks cheap and destructive at times. Sorry but my first thought after leaving the playground was: "Why didn't they make this film earlier and with the original talent behind the first movie?" All on all the original movies are like Citizen Kane compared to this. The first foundation of the Institute is a classic and was a kind of break-in in popular movies. It was a stimulating, sexy and confusing. It had the best performance of Sharon Stone in his work. It had this special style of Paul Verhoeven. Unfortunately the basic instinct 2 is a non-movie movie, directed by the Razzie Prize winner in many categories. It is a pity that they made this film.
