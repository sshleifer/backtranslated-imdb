I was lucky to sit for a minute of 102 minutes, in my opinion, is this awesome film. Fails for too many levels; The cast is bad, it works best and the plot does not have any deficit, and helps me to feel bad enough for the result of any lines of the story being transferred. It does not have a charm this has a scope to convey and I have found myself physically in various points where the script makes meanderings unprecedented everywhere wherever the comedy area. A fiona saccharine spelled a turd of the movie.
