In this film, the old Amitabh Bachchan loves a very young woman, again. She meets him at his restaurant. The little woman, Tabu, makes herself. We don't know what to do and ask him out. His responses to his invitation are rather strange. Was supposed to be funny. It is angry with me about this movie. It was not funny. Jokes and script were bad! The only Jokes I liked was about the groom's teeth, but after several times, even it started to bear. Amitabh has a little girl called sexy. This was a wonderful relationship! The little girl with the mind of an old woman! It was awesome! I know someone can hold a child, but this person has an adult conversation with this child. It had no meaning. The Tabu's father is Paresh Rawal. He should give Amitabh a difficult time, but we all know Paresh, can not do it. So even the conversation at the end, when they are sitting on both sides of the table, even that should be interesting. <br /> <br /> I just like movies that are real. I think I won't watch this film again.
