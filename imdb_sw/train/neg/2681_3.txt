A very good story of a film that has been made well will be quite interesting, but where hell is the end of this film? Really, what is its point? <br /> <br>> Screenshots very quickly so that you have not been a part of the emotional film, and the feeling of being closed due to understanding the story story. <br /> <br /> Disposal displays are responsible, if not reliable. Have I lost a conclusion somewhere in the movie? I think we should wait a servant. <br /> <br />
