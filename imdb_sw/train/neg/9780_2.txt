Good Lord, anyone who made this turkey needs to be buried alive. Sorry, but another reviewer has never seen this film, must have a look at something else, or has never seen a film before ... 9 out of ten stars? What does he say, this is as good as Ben Hur or Gone With Wind? An incredible rage, unreliable characters, a strange situation, looked like it was shot at Griffith Park (which works very well - MASH was shot at Griffith Park), a crappy script, almost everything that could be wrong with all the film is locked in the bag one. It is necessary to look at all potential filmmakers as an example of how films can be very bad. It reminds me of something that a USC student can do in a movie class. This is a pass away unless you are taking drugs and you're in the top camp.
