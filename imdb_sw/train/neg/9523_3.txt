This film program is not quite powerful, many holes. If you are approaching as a movie of his car is not bad, many cars in this one. The reason I love it is because I am from a place where this has been done. I am very happy to look at the identified places in St. Petersburg. Cloud MN and see how the city has changed since 89. A historic piece of interest for our locals. It looks like every film is being done here everyone wants a relationship with it. It is not possible to get copies in any local video stores if they were all stolen once they appeared VHS. It had to get a copy from Japan on Ebay I see it interesting how the race way of drag is located on the city. I didn't know the director was from StCloud.
