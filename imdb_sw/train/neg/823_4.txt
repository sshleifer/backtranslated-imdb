First, it takes half the full hour to get hackers out of jail and start working. What a waste of time, we all know Hackman is getting out of working for his masters, why lose nearly a third of the movie on this procedure. Then hackman resides hotel with arc stories goes again, just assure us that hackman is under the watch next to anything he says or knows he knows to masters. Again, another 20 minutes. Then the most lost time suggests reunion with his wife. All this would have taken more than 10-15 minutes just like the set-up for real action, delightful and conspiracy unfolds. By the time the actual action was going, I was so tired that I just wanted the finished movie. Hackman is as good as usual, and other actors also, but this is the first dud.
