This movie is AWESOME. I watched the other day with my cousin Jay-Jay. He said it was the same, but I think RULEZZZ! I mean, it's very cool. Ted V. Mikel is a hero and wise. He made the film very different from these awesome Hollywood films, like Matrix and Stop or My Mom will thrive. It can be better, though. I love ninjas and pirates. I also love a great deal that this person wear. I think he's a coolest boy since the sister of Domino Pizza claymation. Not only does this film seem too cool, such as outdoor movies that my father made on my birthday when I turned 6. Include the narrative of the hard story and many characters who seem to be unrelated, but all meet at the end. It is wise how this network is connected to make everything meet. I would like Ted V. Mikel would make a client. But it requires more visitors. And the pirate.
