The concept of Thumb is not the winner for the second round. ThumbTanic was not as good as War War for several reasons. Basically, I think, Mr Oedekerk had a small amount of work to send to Titanic. Unlike the Star Wars, the Titanic of the film is not suitable (yet?) To be a cultural story and there are few references that are available to viewers. <br /> <br /> In ThumbTanic, holes are filled with one joke that is not recommended for anything. For example, the insinuation of the hero that the heroine is not recommended during the "fly off the end of the ship" area - not funny. Instead, you think yourself, "Have I lost something in the original movie?". There were many of these types of jokes (cf. arachnid). On the other hand, the shipping of a smarmy ship manufacturer was meaningful and interesting. It is also very funny to send a bloke in a movie who wanted to go "fast" as a maniac run around claim * everything * to be "fast" including the sinking ship and himself being the first to die. These types of jokes meant something in the Titanic environment and paid a sense of humor to Thumbtanic. <br /> <br /> Finger "media", faces and sounds, still exciting. Props and sets and CG animation deserve thanks. In general, although ThumbTanic proves that the quirkiness alone is not used, this film still continues to be upset and lose to the end.
