Nada I think can be collected with various comments on this thread. I was very surprised by the number of people who loved this film who want to do it "must" or "must." <br>> <br /> I think this gives us little insight because this film and the basic issue is misleading. Temperature temperature is a great deal for people who want to force others to "do justice". It is especially appropriate for many "living" people who live because they are not connected to the bedroom values ​​which usually find counselors who want to force you to "be good" to go. The problem with the film. Al Gore is a politician. And one very successful in it. We cannot join and ask those people who want to force others to do as they want. Political appeal is only great. <br /> And there we are left with the scientific issue that can be of great importance, the reduction of the political issue appealing to those in the political body and predicting others to "do justice". Another interesting question is how does the Environment course be hosted by those people?
