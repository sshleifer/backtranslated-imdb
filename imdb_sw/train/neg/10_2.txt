This film had many promises, and the plot was interesting, however the actors, director and editors allowed the film below. I feel bad for the authors, it would be good. Acting is a wooden, very few of the characters are honest. Who has ever edited this explicitly just to learn some new techniques and wanted to publish them all on the film. There are quick 'flashy' settings in almost every area, which means that it is a sign but only ends up like anger. I wanted to love this film and expect to have a decent resolution for the breakdown but not, it left me feeling if I was wasting my time with filmmakers lost their money.
