What begins as a gentle, wonderful and enjoyable country of romantic story of change as Edward Norton's favorite Harlan gradually reveals more about himself and things turn to the sinner, because the film goes gradually from the southern romance to the modern western wild. Norton walks in the city and enjoys the little girl (Evan Rachel Wood), seems to save them with the last life of death with her badly angry and ruthless romance, but gradually becomes clear there is more than this cowboy than facing the eye. Edward Norton ?? The real player (with changing hair on the scene) playing the string of the country, feeling very little but perhaps because he just tries to do the part without worrying about the emphasis. In fact it makes it seem impossible to make a few adjustments as we learn more about Harlan. However, very few changes mean that we do not know exactly where Harlan is from, and what seemed to be a good performance from Norton gradually becomes confused. Evan Rachel Wood is delighted without having a great deal to do more than their talent in Norton. Down in the Strike Valley as a little story varies due to its rapid change, and never really do the intention of the main character clearly the sympathy of the audience to the characters still remain uncertain. What? We love this drifter or not? Even after the major changes of events are still unknown. This lack is for the effects of the film, such as the author could not create their ideas what kind of story they wanted to tell and stay at a certain amount of hot pot. If the film remained one or the other could be a solid film, but as much as it was left to be a mess. The old romance fans enjoy the film part but they will be removed by the sound of darkness. Full fans of Norton aside (or fans of the beautiful landscape of San Fernando Basin), do this miss.
