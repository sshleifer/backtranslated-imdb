Sorry but this is just pathetic. The little girl was brat, was not the enjoyable characters of the plot. Besides that was not even a gator if the film would like us to believe. If you look at any complete guide to the creativity, you will find that it is actually a Mamba, not a gator. Obviously they did not hire a real animal specialist or they would know that the creature is croc. It is a sad forgiveness for the film. Especially the end. I almost sleep with this.
