I think it's when John Rambo continues his life and trying to keep Vietnam behind him. This series gets old and Rambo is no longer good but a bloody killer. Ever when he turns on the screen someone dies. Vietnam was not a fun place to be really exhausted and making Hollywood look like it was. This is not the worst film about Vietnam, that honor goes to John Waynes Green Berets. In any case John Rambo carries around 50 Machine Gun take over what appears to be half of the Cong Cong army and many good Russians are insulting look. What's worse is Rambos cheesy conversation last ... Please !! That's what I've heard they do ...
