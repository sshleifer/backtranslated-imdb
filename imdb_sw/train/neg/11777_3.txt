Years ago I saw the godfather and made a lasting impression on me, the state of the movie was the first class, a memorable statement and a classic story. Recently I bought Trilogy and after watching Section 1 again I looked forward to looking at the second part ...... I enjoyed the early detection in Part 2 that here it was best to track the great movie of the Godfather, again everything was just about full and I couldn't wait see the third God ........ WRONG!, I would stand at II. This story was not good, it seemed to me as a story made just to have a story, the characters were particularly weak daughter. The Pacino app was a weak character that could be eaten alive in 1 or 2. Godfather. Then scenes such as, Corleone have invested with all the trappings of the Catholic Church and full choir, the killer on horseback riding off in sunset, invisible helicopter machine gun assembly ( where 'goodies' get away from everyone is shot), daughter and cousin 1 rolling bits of pasta in the board, pathetic shooting on stage ..... Corleone stuffing sweets under it with orange juice for diabetes (someone of His mind and lies are not ready for emergencies? ... RIGHT is not good and for the best of the world I can look at it again. But I will look at 1 & 2 times less than years.
