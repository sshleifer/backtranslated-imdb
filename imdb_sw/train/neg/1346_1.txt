Dear Friends and Families, <br /> <br /> I think if a young man wants to be a Bible with another boy, then that's their eternal judgment - just remember children, "birth control" does not mean "oral sex", I don't care what a decent student says. On the other hand, even if the senator's assistant describes himself as a "young boy", he still hits a girl at school. If she was my sister, I would like to eat these boys' knees. More than that is that I have seen that the Mongolians did not want the same way to French and that baseball players are called Zoo as low clothes. I think I would like to watch Richie Rich once more than to suffer the anger of this slip, hanging, walking. Thank you, and a good night.
