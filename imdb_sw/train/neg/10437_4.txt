It is strangely unusual, though it means a drama comedy-drama about a wonderful young man who expects to fly like a plane through the Houston Astrodome. Robert Altman-led easily by characters and Hebrew characters is full of weirdos which begins to form early due to weight. Some cinema movies are evocative, Shelley Duvall is sewing at its beginning as a tour guide, and Sally Kellerman looks at every glamorpuss inch as a vision of Bud Cort's "mother bird" (consider Altman and Lou Adler producer describing his role! ). In the lead, Bud Cort is - once again, after "Harold & Maude" - a real nature; not far-set as, say, Michael J. Pollard, Cort can be geeky, wacky and unsuspecting, hard to pull. Unfortunately, this is one of the misrires of Altman. He can put together the cast and show if there is no one else, but allow him to cancel another false inspiration and jumps up. ** from ****
