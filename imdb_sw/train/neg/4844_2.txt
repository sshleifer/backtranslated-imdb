I am obvious in a few comments on this. "Painer Locker" has won more "Best Photos" awards from deliberate groups than any other film this year. However, not just what I liked, I found it difficult to stay. <br /> <br /> There is a small farm and a small character development. They armed weapons, fight, and bomb more weapons. That's the whole movie. But the worst part is that the camera has not stopped moving and always trembles. This has become a recent fad in film making and should make it seem to be true because it has to look for cheap. The camera was shaking so much to make me a nausea to see the screens. I don't always care about movies and "Hurt Locker" was not different. But you don't need to take my word because critics love him.
