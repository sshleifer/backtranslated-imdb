"Godzilla vs King Ghidorah" is a perfect example of how a great idea can be destroyed by a pathetic topic like pseudo-patriotism. Here, immigrants from the future try to destroy Japan, and replace the inner hero Godzilla with their monster's puppy, the golden dragon of the third head King Ghidorah. They fail, however and at the end Godzilla fights Ghidorah. The battle between the two behemoth is very cold, but the plot of the movie is full of holes and anything about "Japan is great" is very stupid. The creators of this film had no threat to respect for Japanese enemies, making them ignorant madness of the young man, who lost easily with clever Japanese. The good thing is that finally Godzilla and King Ghidorah destroyed all of Japan and are ignorant enemies in one of the most amazing (true) battles. But until the battle was fought, the film was lighter and pathetic.
