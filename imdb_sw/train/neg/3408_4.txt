I was in the second grade, 12 years ago. I remember clearly. We were learning about space. All children want to go to space, right? Well, after seeing this, I was so scared to die that I could 'decrease' in space with a certain psychiatric robot. I did not know that this was a movie. I thought it was a news plan or something. I think it was my version when people were being evicted from the radio program 'All War.' So, recently, I find this movie again looking, seeing my famous actress, Joaquin Phoenix was in it (known as Leaf Phoenix). I can tell you, I was laughing in a large part and laughing heavily in acting. I mean, when Andy is in a position, it goes to slow motion, have you ever noticed that? I don't think that in space lets you talk that slow or think it is slow. The best part is when Andy finds the oxygen and oxygen tank, and begins to float back like the security doors around. Little Max tries to pull in. Suddenly, we get very close on Max's face as he screams (slowly) "Whaaaaatttt'ssss happpeniiiinngggg?!?!" I had no idea.
