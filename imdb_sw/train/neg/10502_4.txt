Movie has several lines of stories that follow several different characters. A different story line does not feel like a single piece that makes this comedy very unusual and makes it even more irritating to watch. It can seem weak and clich√© but it's true; You are the best way to look at a series of Mamba crocodiles at the diagnostic center with Steve and Terri Irwin. It's more fun and even more hilarious than this movie is. I am sure all who have been sent by the staff have enjoyed doing this film but the film does not give us pleasure for the audience. For comedy not only enough with Steve and Terri Irwin not just good actors, even when they play themselves! Their antics are not only enough to make the whole movie around and feel for their long-term, distracting and unwanted place and even occasionally sad. The movie was very likely, meaning Steve Irwin is one character that is incredibly exciting with all the monitors to watch, so when I first heard that they were making a film about the 'crocodile hunter' answer my first was; brilliant! The movie however faces its weak story and incoherent story lines with uninteresting and unfunny characters. The film has a certain amount of entertainment, at least enough to make this film appear at least once but still, I must not recommend this film. <br /> <br /> Watching this film saw as a waste of time. Still this film can be seen immediately, when available on TV, daylight. It makes a good time but the story lines completely destroy the movies and its power. <br /> <br /> 4/10
