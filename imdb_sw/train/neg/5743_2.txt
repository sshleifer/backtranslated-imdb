Yes, I know I am one of the few people who wish to beat this movie in an unconscious soil. So let me tell you why I hear this. True, if it has been announced as a film of Zombie or so on, I might be happy. I don't know what to destroy * Let's start with the first big mistake. If I did not know that the film is called "Darkness - VAMPIRE Edition" and I did not see a certain series where some people seem to be taking blood, I did not see the connection with Vampires. I mean, FANGLESS ???? Give me a break !!! <br /> <br /> Second stage: what is with Metal? It seems that all the young people, but especially those called "Vampires", are in various forms of Metal, judging especially for their shirts! Do not make a mistake, I have been in many kinds of music for about 15 years, but no one will be afraid of me by showing me the ignorant young people in Iron Maiden (all the band !!!) T-shirts run around, pretending to be vampires! "Pathetic" is the only word I could use here. <br /> <br /> Three fine: executives. Wait a minute. WHAT DOCTORS? You mean the wooden friends of the director! The words would be desired here. Yes, of course, movies are very gory, but what difference does it make? UN can be strong and enjoyable if the "smart" director is not chosen to create a vampire topic of ARTIFICIAL in this film. I wanted to see vampires, but I had been taken to stupid children who wanted me to use my baseball button. The film traders should only spread the film that said "fear of B-grade inexpensive without a plot but a lot of that"! <br /> <br /> This movie is contrary to the whole concept of Vampirism. And it makes the disease.
