This movie is AWFUL! I don't even know where to start, I don't say I can't even describe how this is bad. Blood is the first flurrescent, and acting is AWFUL! The only good place was the chick of the biker saves the day. This movie was bold, I don't see how it could even vote 1 is very bad. It seems like it was done by high school students.
