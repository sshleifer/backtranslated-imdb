At the end of the film I just wondered: "Is it the worst movie I've ever seen or is the worst movie I saw?" And the answer is ...

But as a matter of fact, I cannot think of the relative weight of two types of expression for human, made I was also shocked by what I had seen and felt (sorry for bad English)
