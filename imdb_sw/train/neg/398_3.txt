Yes, some old authors have written around the novel about this section. It's just a 60's show of old TV! The Star Trek period is known for the largest child (Yeoman Barrow) who has been used in Star Trek and the fact that it took place in the actual outdoor area. Unlike a series of TNG and Voyager which was completely closed with sound action. This outdoor use (and babe) provides an accurate and close film as quality on the most common part of this current and the most common displays. Only a few exceptions are known as "City for an eternity", "World Heritage" and "Tomorrow is Jana" The old Star Trek series you need to have a lot of fire - to mention and leave doubts trouble. Half of the 79 most favorable events from the average are the poor beat. This is a typical example of boring Gene Roddenberry's stuff back then, contrary to popular belief where some people worshiped the land he walked, he actually made the LOT of trash! He is not worthy to speak with one breath like Irwin Allen for instance. Just look at the quality of the Enterprise class from modern view. They used clay plywood with floor, restaurant chairs and plastic feet and the most affordable card panels. You can see clearly the heads in the paper! All costs reserved or what!
