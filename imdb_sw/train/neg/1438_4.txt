Well! What can anyone say? First, this situation is too long for 4 hours, with difficulty (or lack of that) of the plot. The characters are working hard to do something for this film but there are very few content at the time available. Swayzee is not actually a quatermain character at all. After translating the Sean Connery translator of a good man into the "Wonderful League", Swayzee does not work. This episode with a repeat gun has no power, desire, deception, or humor required for that part, and is faced with everyone including a witch of witchcraft, who usually appears from my view to be more attractive as an actor than others of cast. Some vistas are interesting but there are silly errors in the movies. For example. When a happy team comes to the water hole in the middle of the desert, their songs appear under the oasis, waiting for them to walk in them. Rising out of the mine causes to go out (on the next shot) nothing like a visible exit from the passage that they have gone through, and so on. I waited for Doug McClure to appear at any time. Somehow I would have had. The Russian leader looking for Quatermain is a very popular player who drives everything. Swayzee does well as a sad father, returned to London, who can't get the bond of his son. Swayzee should be connected to that kind of thing. He cannot bear the part of a gentleman with a hard heart, life experience, and a sense of similarity. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10. Barely
