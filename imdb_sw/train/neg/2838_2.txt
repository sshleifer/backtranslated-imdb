Skip Message: Galactica and look at the original Living Legends instead. The Web took part 1 and 2 of Living Legend and put them in one plot with the worst part of Fire. Although Galactica is experiencing a written control by the network and lack of time to prepare for the proper production, Living Legend is the best of the TV series of 1978. Hot in space, alone, is one of the worst events. As historical details, see Galactica, Star Trek's original, and then revoke the Trek series, and you will see the difference in quality between the sci-fi network and sci-fi syndicated.
