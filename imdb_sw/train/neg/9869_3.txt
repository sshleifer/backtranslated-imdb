It didn't matter the movie, the book was excellent. Does anyone know where it has been done? *** This was my first visit on your site ... just found the answer to my question. so now I look like a dummy, but I think I'll present my opinion. and yes, British Columbia is good *** Or why did they withdraw from South Carolina Coastal environment? (This question stands) The place was important for the fabric of the book and its change was part of my disappointment and movie. Oh, I read where I need to write at least ten verses. Here is my other major issue and film. Kim Bassinger was very poor and not all I gave from the book. I know, that book was a book and movie; well not very good. I have seen a character in this book more compassionate. Also a rustic book, almost old monastery pictures. When the "castle" in the film was looked more surprising, it was misleading to the story and it seemed to be inappropriate to the characters.
