Once you watch this movie you will see why it didn't even do it on the movie! This movie is not eligible for "prequel" tag. Instead this is a common theme on Hollywood, destroying old movies and bad prequels, sequels, etc.. <br /> <br /> This film program was bouncing everywhere like ping pong ball, and the development of the character was not available. I felt so much like I was looking at the comedy in some points in the movie because acting was very bad. P Diddy needs to stop filing movies and acting badly, making me laugh all the time. The only thing that came out of this film is Jaclyn DeSantis, who looks best in this film and actually brought some joy to this film. <br /> <br /> If you are a great fan of Carlito Way, I recommend you not see this. If you decide to watch it at any time then treat this film as it broke the nature, because it did.
