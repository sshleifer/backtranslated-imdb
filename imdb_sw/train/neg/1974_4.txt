Some people have taken the initiative to lose this film because they question the possibility of black people in Old West, Asian people in Old West or gunmen in Old West. Find and read the book. There were a few Asians (Chinese), there were a few minor (free) people and everyone outside the group class was ready to get a gun; is the second revision you know. And even if the use of modern language goes, none of the Western people was so concerned with the language that was used that was similar to the period shown. Americans had different odors, used different inflections, spoke at different speeds and used a lot of words and phrases that would be unrecognizable today. Do not mention historical mistakes for the fact that you did not dig. Be faithful. Maybe you are not worried about what you see.
