You want to see the film "THE Gamers" and Dead Gentlemen Productions. This is not a film. This movie is not funny. It's a waste of time. All positive comments here are written with (third parties) third parties. People who made this film seem to be trying to create a fake mind. <br /> <br /> This movie doesn't work properly. Comparison with "Tapua Wind" or Christopher Guest screams. That movie means so much that I can't think of anyone who knows that interesting thing. Being able to laugh at yourself is the key quality, but if you are the one used in this way, you would have to enjoy yourself. <br /> <br /> Movie should not be due to the great satire of the topic of events but because of the constant ban.
