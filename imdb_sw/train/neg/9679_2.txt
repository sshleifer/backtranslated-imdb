This movie was so bad in the worst way: you don't care. You didn't care what happened in the field; you care about the characters. Everyone had a heart. I finished walking out of 45 minutes in it because I didn't want to wait for my mind anymore. There is too much sex in the film. Sex can be the same; can even make a movie (therefore Karma Sutra) but sex here was not good or sexy. It was very bad. Don't see this film.
