I got this film from privacy and I had a great interest in it. It had 7,8 in IMDb (9 votes only) and external views were good. But I must say that it is a normal and irresponsible giallo. Yes, the cinema, the film is directed well, but it never opened me. It starts well, but even though it didn't mislead me, the story is normal and the most common things, which I don't like very much. <br /> <br /> You can make a few soups. And you can see some small tits. But if you would like a variety of giallos I like (wonderful, surreal, non-emotional, gory, atmosphere, brutal killing ...) you highly appreciate this film. <br /> <br /> I offer 4 for good leadership and editing, and the last decline, which makes the film have fun. But it may be better.
