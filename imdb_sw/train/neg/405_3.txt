This film should watch if you are wonderful on special effects. There are photos that occur. Besides, it is usually the nineties / summer hollywood which seems without constant. Suitable for the head. It is not worth imitating the story. That's like making brain surgery on the dinosaur. There's not much there to start with. It's not the original and not so special. So do not enter the story. Just look at the effects. <br /> <br /> As described, it got a little flashy at the end, taking the FX treatment of an invisible person (sometimes invisible). However if you ignore the "standard" pyrotechnics, it is a sight to see (or not see). For all, it's a good FX film that deserves to see for that purpose and that alone.
