[I saw the film immediately at the public broadcaster, so I don't know whether it's on the video or not.] <br /> <br /> This is one of the "Baby Burlesks" (sic) which Shirley Temple made earlier in the years 1930. It is hard to believe that anyone would leave their daughter to be in this small film which today can be considered on this "kiddie porn". <br /> <br /> Shirley Temple star in a cast that is possible has an average age of 5 years. They are all in diapers, and are in the saloon which uses milk instead of alcohol. "Money" is in a smooth manner. Shirley who plays "fatale women" climbs the bar and talks to the soldiers who make a pleasant comment about it (!). But Shirley does not really need their lollipops / money because his bag is full of those from other "people". At the same time a young black boy has a beautiful dance on the nearby table (!). </> <br /> What a wonderful film. . . Children who use racy conversations do adult roles in the saloon. Who thought these things in any way?
