Here is the awesome version of PRISCILLA: THE WORLD OF DESERT (they love!) With Melinda / Mindy (WORKING OF WORK 3) Clarke as Pipi, a desert host who takes away a shadow bank and partner Johnny (Jason Durr). He completes the South-border-border jail headed by Chief Screw sadistic (interactive Robert Englund in toupee). He and his heroes of pet lovers end up in the hiding of the gas station until they are replaced by a fallen meteor. Dogs turn into gold without "bitches" and candy continues for a long time, talking, killing a strangled tongue that cannot control. The robbers are looking for the damage caused by the other numbs caused by them add more problems. First, Clarke is amazing and what does it do on this film. You look at him and see someone who is very interesting during the slapstick events, is very persuasive during the scary and VERY sexy scenarios in various wigs and hiding, including an increase in eyes, latex skin and ... \ t A big star. It is very bad rest of this attempt of worship does not live according to his promise. <br /> <br /> The director / author of the defendant Sciamma, who thinks the political cluster alone is enough to develop laughs ... but its vulgar gags, disgusting concerns and stupid chat is not a substitute for real sense of humor. Another nail in the coffin; The cheap-looking film, most of the garish and sets are very disturbed by photography of mud and desert dust. Luckily to Sciamma that Clarke is in her film, because she alone keeps watching.
