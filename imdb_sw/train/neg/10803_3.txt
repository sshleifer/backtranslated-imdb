Similarly after watching this fascinating and losing time and many minutes away from my life here is a basic summary: Genie comes out of the ghetto box, gives this baby with shaggy hair 3 wishes, the child loses his wishes about forgetting, The shaq takes time to crash, and I think that. So I laughed, I cried ...... but especially I laughed at the comedy of the head that came from the skill of the performer of the player / rapper and the boy with shaggy hair. I highly recommend this film for college students sitting around drinking beer with their close friends and they need a lot of laugh. <br /> <br> I will give 3 out of 10 only b / c movie depends on 3 magical requirements. If I had 3 single wishes it would erase this awesome movie and for everyone to pretend if Hollywood doesn't lose money to do this.
