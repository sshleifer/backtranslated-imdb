I don't know who Sue Kramer, the director of this film is, but I am sure that A) is a lesbian partner and B) somehow despised everyone involved in this project to prove that it is not homophobic. I can think of everyone thinking, "My God, this is terrible. It is not to laugh. But to focus on their mouths for fear they will be told that community members or" do not get "homosexual lives. gay people also.) However, it is not worth checking. All employees are directed to play every area at the top so there is no trust or loyalty in whatever they do. I just loved it and I was not afraid to say that. So bad people without water who gave Kramer money to make this bomb was not as useless in their sentences.
