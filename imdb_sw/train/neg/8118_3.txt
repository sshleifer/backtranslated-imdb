EYEboy, I must say that it is interesting even to the end when someone puts me out and tries to look down on me, especially when it's someone who seems to be smart like you. My favorite part of your post was "But no big bang-bang good-guy guy here, kimosabe.I say you stick to the movie and hang bang bang." He said! I love practical movies, especially if they are well done, but I also like movies that don't work much, as long as they have done well. Sorry, but Mystery and False are not suitable in that category and are just a very bad movie. Indeed I do not see many non-American films, so maybe I was destroyed, and I didn't realize how bad foreign movies were when I saw Mystery and False. Maybe if I judge foreign films at different levels I can some day see how Mystery and False can be one of the most tested movies on IMDB. Hmm ... If it's true, that's very scary. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Barger bits@midohio.net (new email)
