The back of the DVD box says Ellen's stars in this film. He even happens until two-thirds of the movie is completed and then they have a small role. I don't see it is a responsibility to help either, but instead of "bit". Also the plot has many things that are not translated. Some examples are: Why is the main character rejecting his older son? Why does her little child drive into the train? He says to bet "sucker" which does not explain anything. To clear the painter does not know the definition of a bet of sucker. This film is not recommended for rental price in my opinion. Save your money and see it for free on TV if you think it needs to be seen.
