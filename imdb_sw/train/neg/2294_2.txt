Poor Paul Mercurio. After giving us the chance of Scott Hastings at Strictly Ballroom, the best film in history, he was able to find himself doing many trash. No characters in this film can not be seen, or even hated, but leading to Mercurio is the kind of person you prefer to ignore - it's completely unacceptable and wearing ALL. The biggest mistake in the design of the clothes, the same.
