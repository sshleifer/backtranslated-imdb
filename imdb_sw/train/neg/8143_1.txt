I was angry to see this film in the 2006 Vancouver Film Festival. I have been attending this festival for more than 5 years, and I have indeed seen poor movies sometimes. However, 'Bite First' has already reached a new film. Despite being shot in good places, and on a regular basis, close to enough food, film stations are a large number of acts of creation and manufactured characters until I pray for him. The leading actor, David La Haye, failed to show any development of the character in the movie, showing the prestigious chef from beginning to end. The smaller elements, such as eating disorders, were made so badly and they did not fit into any environment in which the movie showed up to that point. The conversion theory was used as a poor attempt to conceal a movie that is not good, goes anywhere, and completely despairs.
