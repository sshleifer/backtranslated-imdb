As a Military fighter, I was very skeptical of this film. In my opinion, it is a shame for those who fought the Vietnam War. To say that the true SF soldiers I knew were faced with this craft is reduced. If the film was released as satire or even if the cartoon (it was), it would have received the best. But it was taken seriously by my many people, especially abroad. Silly looked, wherever I went to Europe at the end of 80 people seemed to condemn me and the Americans generally with this film. Isn't it true? Hmm, let's see. Creos's basket of misuliyllabic, locked from prison prison work to go to the secret role for SE Asia to free the POW US. In a firing battle he kills 500 enemy soldiers with a M-60 machine gun that will never leave ammo and never ever. And he never loses, riding with a 32l-bound gun with one hand. I could go on, but I'm getting a headache. I paid this only 2/10 because it's better than Rambo III.
