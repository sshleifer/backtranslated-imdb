Monster from the Enemy Mine somehow made its way into a small mountain community, where he has taken shelter. He is surrounded by a female-turned-vigilante doctor who is out looking for him. A female killer, who looks like a refugee from Motley Crue's video, sits on a motorcycle and tries to save a group of children who have chosen to have at the end at the end of the weekend dab in the middle of a monster's turf. Damages and blood are a place where ideas are kept away from the story that continues as much as the bad version of Dr Island. Moreau (and yes, it's worse than that of Val Kilmer).
