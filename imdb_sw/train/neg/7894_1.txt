Unless you are a Muslim Christian then you are like Egypt and avoid as a biblical distress. <br /> <br /> Why not - why oh why IMD's list of the most beautiful reviews on the list - it was due to one of these that I lost the end of what started a good evening on this claptrap. The plot of the plot was very strong - I was attracted to the film and I was interested in reaching the point where Bible preaching took. What is it. This movie is very angry because I have been registered with IMD for the first time just to complain about it - I hope at least that for doing so I save someone else's night. Hay - what is the Christian act on my part ;-)
