It is bad when the synthetic film of the generic has more information than the film itself. Summary of the “ethnic session” written on the film page contains details that I could not collect to see the actual film. I found myself constantly insisting to see the details that I had lost that could tell me what (bleep) went on. Alas, nothing - this movie comes from pieces of story, if you can call it a story. It's like they tried to distract us in thinking that there is some kind of movie here, just photographing enough so that there was a similarity to the story and leaving others to our imagination. The news has persuaded the creators: I paid it to look at the Design film. I can stay at home and think of stadiums and story lines for free. And Rosario Dawson? This is a person I have never paid enough to make a name to face, and I can see why. He had one of the fake exhibitions that I have ever seen in the leading behavior of any film, A or B. I have seen the same, maybe he was not really going to have a role, he had a decent event for a film he didn't have? Not right. She was listed as one of the producers. Sometimes when you produce something, do not pretend to be a leader if you can't do it. If you can, then create a good character to be. Also, someone here emphasized the white / latino - yes, I hate to say, but this film comes as a revenge against the college-old men who wear baseball caps. That's what happens when there is nothing in the film to love observers of the latino characters. Adrian's behavior looks like a cocky kitchen who is not better than a competitor of the story. As with the character of the Maya, he was not seen as a real person. However I am ashamed for Hollywood that this film was made even.
