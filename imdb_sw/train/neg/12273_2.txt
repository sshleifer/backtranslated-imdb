PLAN B looks like a fast planned, unsupported, inappropriate script, for films and an attempt to give out to linked participants - the expulsion that would have been installed from the beginning. It's just another Mafia-based 'comedy' which has nothing new and reduces the level of those involved. Joe Maloni (Paul Sorvino) is the boss of the most involved crime and clothing than his regulatory business. His personal assistant Mario (Anthony DeSando) is dumber than dirt and his ignorance should be funny. Maloni has lost one of his debtors (who just happens to marry Fran - Diane Keaton) and Maloni considers Frank as his assistant to work for her husband's 'hit man' debt. Fran is afraid of her own shadow and cannot do the work of Maloni, choosing instead to transport 'whackees' to Florida to hide in her brother's house until she can know what to do next. This alternative to killing three candidates is called the B Plan, the plan to kill them! The latter is quite predictable as well as every row set in the script for characters. Diane Keaton has made many good films and is one of our talented comediennes and comediennes, but here he screams and smaller and stimulates his way through ignorance that comes quickly to see. Paul Sorvino is, well, the kind of Paul Sorvino released from other film groups. Support support is also allowed to play on the balcony on a wide slapstick, a possible pratfall style. What should be the comedy end up being just silly and overdone. Director Greg Yaitanes needs to return to the television stations: he had this flimsy story stressed in the gig of half an hour he could have a chance. Grady Harp
