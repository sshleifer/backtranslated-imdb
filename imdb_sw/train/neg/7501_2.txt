I went to this film looking at a short film that refers to Sam's impact on the community. I did not expect Spike Lee to give me more power of rubbish on ethnic tensions, human attacks, or the inability of ordinary citizens to make choices under pressure by their peers. Lee has a harsh comment. <br /> <br /> The whole movie can be more effective if in the 90 minute format and look more, smaller squares. Don 't even tune me video rental unless you like to enjoy Spike Lee; in this case, the theater is worth. This is not a movie of the voters.
