This is an unknown hedonism and / or social clarity tied in a bad story about a woman's jealous drive to drive away from her father and her partner. Is it a cohesion or just a glance through the eyes of a daughter with an electra complex? Who cares? All the characters, except Anne (Deborah Kerr) are leaving the bad. Seberg is poor (I agree with the "boys and breasts" view of early reviews). The plan was hit. These predictions were enough for 30 minutes of films which was unfortunately sent for an hour and a half! If you want to see a large coat and jewels on the River, I recommend "Receive a Thief" - where you will find additional bonuses of entertainment and characters. I love the movie to please me. I personally don't care exactly where the film is installed. Any time or place, I want a good story - comedy or drama. I also want to see other characters who enjoy it. It doesn't hurt if I can contact them. Poor Deborah Kerr provides good performance, and also David Niven in the role of contempt. <br /> <br /> The quality of "2" belongs to Kerr and Niven only, and for movies - a picture of rich and clear colors, black and white scenes. Unfortunately, all the major exhibitions in the world cannot save bad stories and unattractive characters. The seed of the seed is still the ear of the seed. So looking at this dirt was a great waste of my time.
