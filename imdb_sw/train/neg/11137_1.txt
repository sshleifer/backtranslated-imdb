All women who do not have a world around the world were able to prevent me from hitting a one-stop-on-one-on-one-way through this bad rubbish. With an exciting acting, the same awesome script with poor CGI FX identical; This movie is insulting to the kind of Werewolf. It should be bad, which itself would be strange if this film could even make it a bad joke. This is one of those movies where people behind the camera are clearly capable but are very lazy to do something even a good one quarter. Avoid at all costs and look at one of the classic Jewish movies instead. <br /> <br /> 0 out of 10!
