What happened? What we are here is basically stable and solid foundation and for cast and talented, but somewhere the movie loses. True, it has never been going. There was little excitement when we knew that Angie was not pregnant, then see that she is after all, but that is. Steve Martin, who is a very talented person and usually brings much to the film, was afraid and all his behavior was not close to being important for this film, except to make it again. I undoubtedly would like to see more interactions between the main characters, Kate and Angie, and maybe not to try with a fresh comedy, which unfortunately was not, but maybe a drama with comedic elements. I think if the movie did so it would be very interesting since both actors were very interesting in their own way and sitting here I can think of many events that would be chaotic.
