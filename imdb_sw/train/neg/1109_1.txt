This is almost the most West I have ever seen. The story that follows the most common form of Western films and military art - the hero learns that the family / friends have been killed, so the hero revenges, causes an unsuccessful consultant, saves a loving woman, and kills an arch-nemesis expert in a pet cruel. This form has often been successful - otherwise it was not a formula - but Gunfighter is the most sophomoric implementation of you ever seen. Scripting is a simple and insidious theory; it seems like a high school wrote a discussion because it has no deficiency, maturity, and originality. Sound is bad; sometimes it appears to be called. The movie is blind, and the sets are sometimes displays. Acting is sad; indeed, some artists can blame the script, but others cannot use the excuse. I hope never see Chris Lybbert in the role of talking again; every time he says a verse that should be angry or mean, does nothing more than slowing down his voice and looks just like a child trying to act. And speaking to Chris Lybbert, who plays Hopalong, look at his duds (if you look at this film): Wearing these new clothes that make him more like Roy Rogers than a hard, low-and-cowboy cowboy. If you are interested in a cinema movie that just serves to worship the greatness of Hopalong Cassidy, then you get this, but if you have more than two neurons, see something else.
