The most horrible version of Lorna Doone. Many non-spelling, no romantic events, changes in the story line, very short, seemed a low budget. Not enough conversation to understand the story if you do not know and novel. In other cases it looks like Lorna has a cold trouble on her upper lip. I am sure to make up-up did better to hide. I think they didn't want to stop photography until they were healed, compassion. Most likely why this film did not have kissing events. Just one of the most horrible of the last kiss. Lorna Doone is a great epic story and must be told the truth. The 2000 edition of Lorna Doone is twice a long, more romantic, more enjoyable and more realistic to book.
