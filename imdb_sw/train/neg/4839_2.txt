... And drop down more than ever. I will not make any direct references or nothing here, but say a few, this film is awesome. If you are a training team, do not bother looking. I put it on a DVD with two friends who want to watch some interesting action / battle. Why can't I read the first review first. <br /> <br /> Already in the first "bomb" film has great glitches, and they continue to show and become bigger and bigger. My friends 2, not connected to the military in any way they saw several film films as soon as I did and asked me if some of the things that happen to us are true. Well, if you have thought, they don't - absolutely. Stay away from this movie unless you can stop these incredible idiotic and happening again. 2/10 to get my interest for the first time.
