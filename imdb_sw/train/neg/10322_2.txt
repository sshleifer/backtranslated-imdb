If you are expecting to be suspicious or rejected or both, you will probably need to look elsewhere. LMOTP really is not a lot of thought too much to stimulate the rehashing of common silly clich√©s. At the end of the second period I felt a little embarrassed that I sat in a mess that was caused. Most of the Powerful Force that was so tenderly attracted to all preliminary precautions is just another wound, guilt and anti-septic attempt in definition and entertainment that CBC usually increases during production. And once "ZOMG MUSLIMS IN RURAL CANADA ROFLMAO!" The hype takes a welcome to him, the show is possible to follow into the ether of the cancellation because it is too low when you are judged on his reputation alone. Unless you are faced with Islamic culture in the west and / or are easily fascinated by the minute-minute idiosyncrasies on the subject I don't see how LMOTP is more interested in meeting the curiosity that comes from the hype. Other exhibitions have highlighted the issue of cultural / ethnic dichotomy in the west of the various communities. LMOTP will not exist among them in entertainment or awareness.
