Even if you could pass the idea that these interesting characters saw every important moment of the 1960s (ok, so Katie didn't join Manson Family, and no one died in Altamont), this film was still not bad. I felt that the "authors" tied themselves in the room and watched "Forrest Gump," "Wonderful Years," and 60 films of Oliver Stone from time to time and called it research. Canadian television critic called the conclusion of the first part "head of the head". He was the same.
