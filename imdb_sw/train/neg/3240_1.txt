This is the first Giga film of Pig from Japan and this is very bad, in my opinion. The youth group teases a girl for several days before they kill him. And this time, I will say that these films are not true! They are awesome films that try to be as realistic as possible. <br /> <br /> Events are illnesses but also not enough in most cases. For example, if they hit a girl on the floor, we can see how they beat and throw the floor next to the girl! And how this stupid looks! Sound effects are also untrue and useless. Other events include the intestines of the animal that had been stabbed by the girl, the girl screamed for hours, stuck to her fingers, spots on the girl's body, broken eye and deep-seated with things like that. It is very sick and refers to a spirit-inspired film and has nothing important or known for movies. The first entry is the worst hog and amateur Guinea, although it is not as blood as the next section, Meat and Blood Flowers, which tries to be astounding as possible. The experiment is perhaps the disease that I have seen and the closest thing to smoke there. This still (of course) faked s (n / t) uff, the only difference to the "hot film" is really no one dying or hurting actually in this film. I can't recommend anyone since thi s is so **** y and ignoring. Those who focus on this are a great horror film does not know anything about the movies and the real meaning of it. I looked at this as a curiosity (like the other part in the series) and now I know how this useless rubbish is. They only work at a shock level and that is not a great achievement of movies. The devil's attempt is probably the worst movie I saw and the Mermaid in Manhole (Gaga Pig 4) is probably the most disgusting film I saw. So these are very good in my book, but that's all.
