Rex Reed once said of the movie ("Julia and Julia" became special) that looked like it was shot through the pomegranate juice. I was reminded that as I beat through the Butterfly Purple. This appeared to be shot in the way. The story was boring and was not helped to have a large part of the events of the artists were not mentioned or could focus after the extended time period. Also, everyone seemed the same and so it was difficult to distinguish between characters. I will call this a "Dead Sword of the Dead". <br /> <br /> Total desires.
