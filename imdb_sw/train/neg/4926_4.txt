I saw this movie for two reasons - I would like Gerard Butler and Christopher Plummer. Unfortunately, these poor were forced to carry a beautiful dumb movie. I liked the idea that Dracula is actually born again to Judas Iscariot, because it describes his shame for all Christian things, but there were many camps that this idea did not have been as it was. I see this film as a way to have talented Gerard Butler to pay its pre-recognized realities and channels of Christopher Plummer's story to remind the public (I and 5 other people who saw this film) that is still there. I really enjoyed a special feature on DVD than the movie itself.
