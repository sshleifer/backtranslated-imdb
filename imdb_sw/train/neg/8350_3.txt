I returned from "El Otro" to play here in Buenos Aires and I must say very much. The film is very slow (not available, I am enjoying the slow films!), Slow to reach the driving point. All you hear is Julio Chavez very breathing throughout the film. This is not a good film, but most importantly, it is a non-fiction film, I feel nothing to the story or its characters. "El Otro" was released only for making a film ... make it forget. I would like to advise you to pass this, if you want to see the best movies of Argentina, see the film with Sorin.
