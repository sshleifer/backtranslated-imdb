A wonderful mix of traditional-80s, smartassy, ​​Chevy Chase-type, "every-ten-lines-you-get-funny-one" farce and sickie comedy black. Likes easily in ads, but not entirely. There is a sequence of ski which incorporates the back of the fakest estimates since "The Secret Service of His Kingdom". (**)
