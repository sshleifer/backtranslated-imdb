I'm not any comment (I read other comments) ... but this, this I _have_ comment ... I believed that watching this movie with the world as a step, F-117 and other tech stuff, but just for the first few minutes and I have changed my mind ... The work of the lazy, the script of lousy and the great lies of science. It is one of the worst movies I've ever seen ... <br /> <br /> Just ... don't worry ... <br /> <br /> And something more, before any film will look at the user's comments and comparisons on this site ... 3.7 points and I offer this trial of movies, now I'm trying WHO to test this movie by giving more than 2 points ??????????
