This was the worst movie I saw and I saw many bad movies. First I'm from Kansas this movie does not shred the truth in it completely. It is like BTK's name and they did it. On top of that it seems like someone had like I've got a $ 20 here just to take and make a movie with o, you don't worry about btk research at all just to do something. there is no very good dookie to see this film. Cattle cattle and let the victims eat things and describe BTK slaughter for animals did not do the same thing but the movie makes it to the love of God never saw this bad movie movie. What made for TV is the best and most accurate way
