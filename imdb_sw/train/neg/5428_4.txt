Priyadarshan another / Vohra flick another movie that appeared to TP instead of real desire, the only reason I saw this movie was the fact that they were not always present in this film (Akshay Paresh and many others), but they don't need to say i had a low expectations from this film. I was happy to beat in general except, Rajpal Yadav, who is no longer persuading, however it takes some laughter, but these were the usual slapstick of the original joke, in fact this whole movie is like playing the storm , I mean it takes a hard talent to make a loud noise, or even play a good sound of dhol for a little time? Only those who can carry different beats in a good way, for a long period of time that seem to be great. It brings us to another instrument, Dumroo does not require any talent, it does not differ, and it can be fun for a while when monkey dancing (hmm looks like Rajpal Yadav, a good example), but it is not an interesting tool for time tall or even dancing like Dhol does. This movie was like dhol and dumroo was played, sometimes Dhol was played once the dumroo, sometimes all together, but especially Dumroo played alone with the monkey played. And if any of the age of 24 years earlier than I got bored. <br /> <br /> The movie has a good time Dhol (good) but after all the time I heard it was annoying Dumroo (the original entertainment, then tolerating it irritating), the most common parts make sure that this film is very good for its parts videos of "MERE BHAINS KO NAA KYUN MARA" (if you don't see me looking at Filmy, it comes in the evening and is really true). This movie had time, participants did a good job, except Rajpal Yadav (who can do it, I have seen in Meri Patni?) Who is more surprised than to get involved, I have been talking many times and I will say again I think Joshi and Tushar Kapoor have a good job before them in most players of the stars exactly. <br /> <br /> Some of the scenes were really funny as the experiments caused to impress the father of the girls, the zany attempts to ask the girl to take him away. But after this there was an affair attempt to make this film more and more added, this means that once the girl came in, the following 45-60 publications were getting worse, the peak was "TIME TIME IN CATEGORY", what I mean they were thinking if you should end up at least to make an attempt to make it so interesting. The movie is also very predictable, there is no place where you can't predict and will continue to break into a few laughs here, more like it if you see it coming and almost start laughing before gag. <br /> <br /> Movie is following a sharp drop in all movies except for an unusual odd, low or high, and then slows down once they have made friends with a girl. Most of the worst scenarios were the last, one movie tries to be more run by the comedy mill, also many of the jokes were very very stale and reeked to repeat, THE 10-15 final was particularly DISTATEFULL and SPEILS SPOILS THIS MOVIE. We found Tanushree Datta at the ultimate siren he was playing, and his talent to work is in a big question, especially with his impulsive view, if it might be HOT and they don't spend how long you can live. <br /> <br /> Neither the movie was weak, and the regular eyes of the female and the lamp lights and the work of the camera. <br /> <br /> Songs without track track was not good either, while songs played in the second half I could feel together from the audience. In all the movie that is usually just because of the cast, and very low expectations. <br /> <br /> Avoid being a bad idea. And if it is necessary to look at the TV for free or a cheap matin√©e or something is necessary, if you pay full multiplex rates you will feel desperate. <br /> <br /> -and a lot of jokes, RAJPAL YADAV, MININS 45 LAST and 15 MINS LAST especially, bad songs, bad songs. <br /> <br /> +/- s tries to be more than what it was, not often (I'm more happy), Tanushree Datta. <br /> <br /> + s some good events for the beginning, head song, good acting and cast except RY. <br /> The total of 4.5 / 10 (I'm trying to have a goal here, I don't like Rajpal Yadav or Tanushree's Database and this movie met my very low expectations, so I give all of the doubts, on the full issue of this movie not more than 4)
