This film fails to offer anything new to a kind that has often shown a cross-cultural tradition of politics led in the mid-20th century / WWII India, where Britain and their modern ways are bad and old and honest Indians are the truth is good. Indeed the cliched images of Britain have now passed. <br /> <br /> In addition to the game that enhances the second part of the film this description can be predictable, acting is a two-dimensional foot, with a clear and indirect mind. The story was required to be opened and it would surely benefit from half an hour of screen time to give the characters a more detailed description and give the viewer something to feel invested in. for everything, instead of deleting. Oh and Linus Roache can not make a tragedy - go to the eyes and emotional pain just doesn't work for me!
