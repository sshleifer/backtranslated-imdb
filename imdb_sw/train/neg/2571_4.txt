And Goldie Hawn and Peter Sellers in this movie you see will not go wrong. But what can I say? This was a bad misfire. The movie is about Peter Sellers as an old gentleman who suddenly finds himself in a relationship with the most wonderful young people to mention an interesting hippie in Goldie Hawn. The movie is disjointed incredibly and I didn't understand anything about it. Peter Sellers and Goldie Hawn are very interesting people but this film does not prove. <br /> <br /> The song about arabella Cinderella 'is pretty cool, but it's so. I only recommend this film to people who like to watch the films of this secret, this is almost one definition. I think this movie more than anything else is a sign of the times, in terms of experimental experiments and all around the unconventionality, the problem is the quality of the stripes completely and writing, not to mention the direction out there out. Peter Sellers especially are very hit and miss, he will go from Dr Strangelove and Be there in all his work, throwing a movie like this with a magic Christian, which was similar to this one in the context and style, but that movie had a momentous time. This is folly, and I'm sad that a good person like Peter Sellers was in this movie. Not recommended for anyone.
