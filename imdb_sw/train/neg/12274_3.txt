I am not usually saying that the film is not suitable to watch, but this is the expanded state. The only true side of this film is Cornelia Sharpe, looking interesting look, and the fact that this film is quite realistic. <br /> <br /> The program in the film is amazing course and may almost anywhere in the film. There are no even even interesting characters and no reason to take care of anyone. I don't know why on Earth Sean Connery agreed to make this film, but he must have passed this. The only reason I could see by watching this film is if you're dying -Shaan Connery fan and just want to see everything you've done. This last store however. Well, if for some miracle you have seen this despite my review (or any of the other comments on this site), then I hope you enjoy more than I did. Thank you for reading.
