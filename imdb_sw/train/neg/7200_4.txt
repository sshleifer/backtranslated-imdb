I wanted to love this film - the stadiums that were published in Pittsburgh and the trailer had a very good photo. But, even with a cartoon made, it was a very bad movie. Continue with all the pacing were just bad. The best bits in the film are under the last credit, so it is (almost) worth reinforcing until the end (though, odd, does not take less than an hour ago). <br /> <br /> The best performance in the movie is by Andy Dick, you know there is a need for a problem ...
