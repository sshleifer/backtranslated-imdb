I was so surprised by this show. After hearing and reading hoopla all over it, how it was "show ground breaking" and all kinds of wild promises as quality, I tried to look at it. <br /> <br /> What to lose! Acting had been forced and spread. The story was not very meaningful. For any feeling of concern "look at the life of young people", I could only see a tough attempt which had a real reality like a real show. <br /> <br /> Some wonder why there are so many negative comments on this show. The reason is that not all good and hitting on the quality on this show serve only interesting how it was damaged.
