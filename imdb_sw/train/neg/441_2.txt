We don't have this on TV in UK but I walked on the Internet on YouTube. It's dumb, sandy and cracking! This is from the creator of "Earthworm Jim" Douglas TenNapel, I have not entered the cartoon but I must admit it better than this. The artist has not done anything for years since now. With Doug TenNapel, this is a skill to return again and at all times down! The story is about three cats who inherit a house and a lot of money away from their old dead master. They are arguments and disagree on what they want to spend their money. "BORING"! Animation is awesome. The main characters mean to be a cat, right? But they don't see anything like a cat! The astonishing animals of many mouths, said their teeth and bad eyes! The human beings and other animals are also badly given! The theme of the theme is awesome and irritating! Also the stories are crippled and can be copied from past displays. Surprise how this show has got 7.5 / 10 lots of other IMDb viewers. Television really is not that used to be! But now most of them are dumb, cheaply made and interesting. Some of you on the site may disagree with me. Sorry but this is a total loss of money and you completely lose your time and feel happy that the UK don't also tolerate this crap (oh yes, if you have digital you should) but I'm not so is not my problem ! Chest! 2/10 (and it's very lucky to find it because I have given some more serious displays!).
