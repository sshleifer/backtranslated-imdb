I watched this film after seeing other views on the IMD, even persuading my wife to be a "awesome movie." I wanted to love this film, but it couldn't. The “love story” was good, but the aspect of fear was very bad. If the story was just about a boy who loved a girl who is infected with parasomnia, then it would be the best movie. The service center that has put a good trust has gone beyond the limits, in fact it was absolutely ridiculous. The doctor ignores privacy and professional rules. The nurse enters the room for regular feeding patient risk (without escort security), leaving the tray and running out of the room shouting for no apparent reason. Patient caregiver (and the villain of the film) tied in a position to stand fully dressed - looks for years? Nothing makes sense. The movie doesn't have any other actors that I like in other things, such as spies, but I still can't recommend this movie.
