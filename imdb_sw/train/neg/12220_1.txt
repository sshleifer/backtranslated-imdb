This movie is much worse than many movies I have suffered through, and I have suffered in many ways. Do not ignore it completely. It has a strong shock; development of plot; in fact provides pictures of 'gray pictures', which are more visible as an art project to fix secondary school than a terrible movie; 5/10 for the most attractive women; Long, sexually active sexual intercourse involving women speakers (forgetting what you know about widows! Especially those with fake milk); talking, difficult to understand the speech from other characters; and actually used masks from Killerns Killer from Space out during the laughter area, which should be a grace to save because the movie was pretty funny, but not. Veden Fell is the youngest person in the history of the film. <br /> <br /> Absolutely give this a miss.
