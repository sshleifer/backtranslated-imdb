I don't know how to comment on this film. The only side effects were enough, acting was terrible and if there was a plot for all, it was behind the box. I don't think I can remember the movies that this is so bad for a long time, and I am a big fan of sexually immoral sex! ;) Yet it could not save this film for being just a terrible exemption to pay someone stand (or put in this case) in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> I was very low and dropping down with a "zombie" effect. Since it appears in this film, zombies are very common that runs on a couple here and there, and usually talk about it at a gas station (one in-house repair but no indoor bathroom), zombie movie's movie 't even a matter until the end. However, it came with twelve zombies removing the girl's clothes does not include being a zombie movie. Show war seats: It seems all the zombies are male and all vampires are female, which is similar to me. I don't know how the vampire outdoors during the day, or why / how the vampire of the soldier came to stand in the middle of the road, carrying his gun to the hole through his heart, waiting for the Queen of Vampires to close all the way through. The last part in the old nunnery did not know, and when one of the lesbian hot vampire asks another vampire lesbian hot "Do you think we did the right thing?" to kill the two heroes found in the movie, that on top put. <br /> <br /> The effects of the act and specific were under all time as well. You can almost see the hoses that the fake blood was struck out during the close of the zombie who rushed to the Great. Speaking to the Great, where did Kenny Rogers look right? There is no idea which was the Great, without confusion and loss. All of them, check out if you don't have anything to do or have a great power to lose $ 3. Just $ 0.02 of me.
