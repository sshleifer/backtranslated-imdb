This film is high, predictable, wise, and basic on its foundation. The settings are trustworthy for the age but they reveal themselves in their long-term promotion. Losing on residues prevents the action and close pieces such as empty talk. Tom Hanks seems to be asleep as Bruce Willis did in Hart's war. Tom, you can not give a detailed character to just make your face clear! The content did not agree with the writing of history and Paul Newman. This is a dud wrapped in an atom bomb.
