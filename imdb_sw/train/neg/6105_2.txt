If you are a kind of person who can get a kick of a very bad movie, then I recommend this very. If not, stay away. This is an incredibly cheap movie, and sometimes you may be wondering if it is not just someone who is attracted to you. The best views I can make about it is that responsible people seemed to realize that it was a lack of a large budget, so there is at least a sense of fun here. <br /> <br /> But this is as amateurish as it gets. Their idea of ​​a great killer of the killers is just boys covered with beige paper and what looks like garbage can cover their heads. It is obviously not meant to be taken seriously (to say the least), but even by rejecting it you will find yourself shaking your head with all the enthusiasm. Or laughing too many sounds, as I did.
