Anyone who saw the original will have to go out and destroy this bad remake. Alex Baldwin trying to imitate the late Steve Mcqueen by word for remake the word does not work. When Baldwin has done this exciting work this is flop from start to finish. McQueen had a charisma, never trying to compete with the stars. For Kim in the position of Ali McGraw enough said. McQueen seems to be dangerous, awesome and reliable as Doc, the film was excited to insist, Baldwin and the company made this a comedy, I laughed at one time and just saw this sad film. And a bad hairstyle for Michael Madsen who is one of today's exciting and reliable artists! Did the people of flowers have them in Michael, what they thought. If you want to see the film-making a way under Sam Peckinpah's direction Get the original!
