I lost this only because I loved the first movie. However, they call John Carpenters Vampires: Los Muertos is just a trick to give you a tax. In fact it is an executive producer and clearly did not have any connection with the effectiveness of this film (Jeepers Creepers Anyone?) of all time. Not too bad. We are finished with the film is red, unveiled with a bad and odd script and bad clich√©d. It reeks a small budget. Avoid as a bubonic blow.
