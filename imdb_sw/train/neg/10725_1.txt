Since I don't like to say 'I too' by responding to other comments - it's true that the first 30 minutes of this film have nothing to do with long-term singing that includes the following 90. <br /> <br /> Banned somewhere does not make visible film. Because it does not match Hollywood brands it is not reliable. Still, more than a mysterious plot (unless there are many places of mud in Russia and many people, even very old women, drinking a lot of vodka) the number of pictures is so unnecessary despair I'm in my pocket the second of Rolaids. <br /> <br /> As for vendors - well, the film is so without any thread thread I could not write one if I tried. Do not waste your time or money, don't bother this with the best Russian movies.
