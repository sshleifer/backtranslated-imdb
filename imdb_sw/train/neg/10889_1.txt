The worst movie I have seen since Gingerale in the afternoon. I think this is panic / comedy. I pretty much predicted each scene in this movie. Special effects were not very special. I believe that I can come with good results from what I lay around the house. I would like to have something good to say about this film, but I'm afraid that I'm not. Even Coolio should be embarrassed to appear in Turkey like that. I, after a little thought, have one thing to say about this movie - has ceased.
