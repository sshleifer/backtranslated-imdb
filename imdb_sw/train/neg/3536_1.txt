I don't think I've heard this dropped by the film before. After the filming of the previous two of Guy Ritchie (not counting for freezing - was a blind pussy), I was expecting to see this. <br /> <br /> Reviews were poor, then again, I don't believe advertising however. More concern was the fact that the internet buzz was that this was a bit of stinker, so it had some confidence I gave Â£ 4.80 my yesterday afternoon. I even try to describe this film, because because I have no clue going on and at one time I was close to standing and asking if I was the only one I had not found! Unfortunately I think Ritchie seems to have fallen into the trap of his wife to take too much stress. It seems not good for making films and plots mounted, laughing, snappy and beautiful talk. characters. It's almost as if he had a list of films he wanted to pull, here are some of what I realized: <br /> Matrix, Fighting Club, Death Death, Participatory Characters, Vanilla Sky. that the exhibition from two chief executives, Jason Statham and Ray Liotta, were really very good and it was a fun story and editorial / guidance that let the film down. <br /> <br /> So big, big thumbs down from me.
