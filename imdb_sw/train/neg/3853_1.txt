I think Jason Lee has great potential, but this was a WRONG car that tries to hit the stars. The program is bad, the comedy is bad. I laughed twice, I think for relief, because in the past, they were jokes lame well. I found myself scared for the future of Fletch, and I was convinced that it was a guilty film, not Lee. <br /> <br /> Julia Stiles and Selma Blair are hot, but I recommend checking at still Photos on this site to see that out, instead of this film. Save your time. 1 star.
