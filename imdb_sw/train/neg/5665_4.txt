The deliberate exchange of stories of the story of Borges is an example of Cox. His strong feeling of feeling is, as is the case, has been lost by a bad statement that caused half of the cast. The film is obvious in the surreal tradition of the Mexican period of Bunuel, and it seems when a poor person takes the things of Lars Von Trier of Crime. Cox's preference for one takes, jumping jumping, and recording all sound sounds against the effectiveness of the film. The value of looking but ultimately disappointing.
