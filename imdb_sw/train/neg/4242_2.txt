Men, I love police movies that came with action, shooting, running. The boy, I was leaving it after watching this short and exciting movie. We have seen all before, hostages, banks, neighborhood ... However, 2 bad people that shoot many officers and innocent people who just stay in the fire line - without getting hit due to some Kevlar. br /> <br /> Not just a few shots, no, hundreds of shots. Go back to the bank, where the dumb's captives did not close the doors or doors when bad people went out. Why the director thinks we will be. Well, the shots between that fake thought was good, but after seeing the film I had just thought: why did the police get a good shot course? And why there are so many cops and SWAT on real long-term breaks. Really bad.
