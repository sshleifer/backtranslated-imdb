I saw this film on Flix after closing time. I was looking at F Troop and I had a serious problem with Wrangler Jane so I had trembled, I was shocked, knowing after seeing this film that the homicidal dealer was reduced to Melody Patterson, who looked good but also looked very different and unfortunately not found. I've never thought he was in a million years. What does hell do in this picture? I agree with the boys here that the movie is not suitable what is going on. No sex, no year, no tease. It is also a remake of Atomic Brain aka Monstrosity (1964 or thereabouts). Most of the actions are provoking; The main character spends a lot of time running around the doctor's house and the doctor's house, with the general neighborhood, or running with soldiers, all scary and filling time. Now if Italy could do that, half of the film would be the Slingblade / Uncle Ernest / Jack Elam henchman to induce the unconscious girls. But you only get 20 seconds.
