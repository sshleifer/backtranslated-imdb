WOW is all I can say if your reading looks at it or thinks about it. hope I can look! It 's really laughing in many parts of this movie very badly made work is very funny! I don't believe they believe it is a school sign! I must be playing the area only once to laugh more and more every time. If a film like this can be made it gives us all hope of making our own films. even the costume was bad. it looks like my 7-year-old cousin could do a better job. heck i bet he could write and act better. all I know is that I must look at the second part just so I can see if it was bad as the first. His idea of ​​cooling about scarecrow killers but better works could be made. hope the other movie to kill the scarecrow comes out, not like this one.
