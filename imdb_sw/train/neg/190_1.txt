I have always heard that a good film should have a plot. This film was not exactly one, and I feel it would be more effective with the plot. This was worse for the fact that it seemed to go on forever; I was worried to finally end up. However, I only saw that it was only 123 minutes long; it looked like four hours. It is not just that there is no plot but the film also did not have a great crisis. It's not the worst movie I saw, but I was saying it was seeing "Fasting and Anger". Therefore, do not think this review is from someone who needs nothing but action. I really hate many films today; it's just that this film is all the way to the other side of the spectrum. It does not really happen in this film. However, the environment and clothing were good.
