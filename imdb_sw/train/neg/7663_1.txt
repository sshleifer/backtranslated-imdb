Tara Reid as an intellectual specialist, Christian Slater (very common) as a dollar store Constantine and Stephen Dorff as ... well is STEPHEN DORFF for Christ WANT! I only want to thank these great brilliant directors for hard work and effort. You men. Here is the idea, my low opinion of humility as a movie going to the public but it follows you directly to your previous choice, the movie about the most talented physics in history takes one pill to treat all diseases known to man and get this, heres clincher should play with Jessica Simpson and Paris Hilton. I knew you people would like that. Eager though you give me $ 7.50.
