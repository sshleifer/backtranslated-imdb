This little sad film is very similar to Broadway's 1971 revival which was a 'nostalgic' hit. Remember that when Burt Shevelove explained the revival, he wrote this book again. I feel that the author of this screen made a lot of changes from the original 1925 origin. I played 'Jimmy Smith' who was innocent in 1974, and I think this $ 1 DVD could restore memory. It's not a chance. Even happy to expect to see the "Topper" Roland Young play 'my part' was a great disappointment. Three songs from play remain, and they are done very well. Even the classic duet, "Tea For Two", is done as a virtual solo. Many faces known in this 1940 fiasco do not brag, and the stars, Anna Neagle, is embarrassing herself. When I get into the dollar, I know the film must be bad. Another publisher mentioned the Doris Day version, which is called "Tea For Two" and is about to play for the original stage (original, of course), so those who are really looking for "No No Nanette" can get the most acceptable version in there. .
