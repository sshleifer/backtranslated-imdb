Judy Holliday beat gold in 1950 losing the George Cukor film of "Birthday Jana," and since then, his work included finding enough things to allow him to discover gold again. never happened. In "It Should Do You" (I can't imagine the head of fraud, by the way), Holliday still has more distinctions on the blonde blonde who probably is not dumb after all, but everything about this movie feels more warm and half heart. Even Jack Lemmon, in what I believe was his first role of film, can not gather enough energy to strengthen this modified comedy. The audience knows how the film gets closer to the beginning, so more it stays close to waiting for the film to capture. Maybe if you are suggested by Holliday you will have this fun; otherwise I won't. <br /> <br /> Grade: C
