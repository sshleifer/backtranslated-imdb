Here we have a movie that fails in every way possible for the movie to fail. The awesome script, acting of lousy, leading amateurish, laughable special effects ... is just a very bad movie. Not to mention the fact that when you reach the end you will understand that nothing is impossible. After using the whole movie you wonder what the world is happening here when things finally explained you realize the story is built on the foundation which is very difficult. In one of the followers "followers tell the whole film" series we are told that our villain has done something that can not only be done and which makes it absolutely no meaning. Oh, and after that we see that there also seems to have some kind of jell-o monster involved. I am sure Drew Barrymore would like to pretend that this film has never happened. If for the wrong reason God is tempted to sit down and watch this film I can recommend rather than take the time to hit your head against the wall for 10 minutes.
