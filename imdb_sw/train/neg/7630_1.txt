An exciting movie about boring city in 50 years. How can one think that this is a classic? The producer finished his work by pushing his girlfriend, Cybil Shepard, in several movies that were on his ability to act. I think this movie gives insight into how the future of Peter Bogdonovitch's films have been. Cybil Shepard's work began to dive after having several movies that Peter Bogdonovich produced. It was not until "the brightness of the sun" that his work began to return. I thought that acting was a bad race for "Trainer". I found that this film has not been shown in the US. The only place I watched was out of Europe at the end of the night.
