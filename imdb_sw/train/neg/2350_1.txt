This time was very bad. Written text, chat spelled. The boy who played Craig could not make his way out of the paper sack. It was Thursday night, this was very obvious look with some beer. Good music, bad acting, poor writing, all gathered for my entertainment. It was a drama / unfamiliar game. I don't care what happened to any of the characters, they all liked and stupid. The first five events were worse, as they could not recognize the victim, they had to write around the conversation, which was terrible. I mean, eulogy in funeral was ridiculous. In fact, all the events that were happening now were quite horrible. Well, let's take a look. Everything happens at the moment is facing. Scenes flashback, just write, dialog and Craig's acting sucked. Music reigns though.
