I was expecting to see this film for a long time, after seeing the "Return to Paradise," which I found to be good. I was very disappointed. The most important thing about it was the endless prediction which I think was being stolen by "Return to Paradise." Maybe I expected too much. <br /> <br /> On the positive side Danes, Beckinsale and Pullman were wonderful in their roles. Although I was not like the Danes' character and I have found him very angry. I couldn't see anything about the film. It can be done very well, for example there may be more emphasis on prison conditions and fear. It was also fun of the movie to be true. There may also be more stages and tensions. I couldn't predict that. But at that time I didn't really care what happened to them. <br /> <br /> 3/10
