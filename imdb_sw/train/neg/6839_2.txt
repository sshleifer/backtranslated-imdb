Twin brothers separated themselves at birth (Due to the deaths of their parents) reunited twenty-five years later to take revenge on their parents and take back their million dollars. Two impacts run two hours long and essentially enhances the real tactics of the Corsican brothers and Jean-Claude Van Damme as long as the twine bad brothers are just ashamed as a good twin brother. Also the process of action is not exciting at this time and Jean-Claude relies heavily on the guns then on his military art. Also healed is lost and for two hours the movie is quite clear. Over / within * 4 (bad)
