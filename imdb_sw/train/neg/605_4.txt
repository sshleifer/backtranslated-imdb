I will set as short as this film is not suitable for full review. <br /> <br /> From the settings, this film can be something special. It may be "28 days later" or even "Blair's wizard project" <br /> <br /> The first 20 minutes or so of the movie I was very excited, the executive did a good job with movies and exciting, although I don't think He could catch The power of the bottom down to London. <br /> <br /> Stories had been reduced. Our "heroine" in this movie is a piece of nose, and you care if it dies or not. As many people have said earlier, I was robbing homeless people and a black man, who could give me a chuckle or two (if it was for the purpose of authors or not.) the first film, but when it was revealed I was desperate. I can't destroy it but it only allows my 10-year-old sister to beat her in a fight. All this is another terrible film that falls into the trap of following the simple Hollywood formula. This film had great potential but failed to mark. <br /> <br /> Just to show how this film was standing, the characters in this film had at least five times to finish and kill the main villain. SEARCHING.
