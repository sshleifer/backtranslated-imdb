Gloria Victor and Dolores Reed in the girl's dress of space. <br /> <br /> I love 50 sci fi, and I've even loved sci sci 50s, but this film is real, very bad. And it's not the MST3K method. It is not known if several bozos make their best sense of the "hip cats" of Abott & Costello. <br /> <br /> Chessecake can save sci cheesy fi, such as "Women's Cat On The Moon" but can not be in this case. This film requires dumb button and fast forward feature. It said, I could look at Gloria and Dolores walking around with a temporary ship for an hour or more.
