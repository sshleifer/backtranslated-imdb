The worst attempt to reject "Seven", is full of second job, bad camera work, half cooking story and powerful surveillance of malicious propaganda. Well, they "sex offenders", live close to you you will get raped, in fact. <br /> <br /> There is no surprise from the vice of the terminatrix woman, she does as always - as reliable as a piece of wood. Richard Gere keeps sliding down and down - and it's up as below as Steven Seagal late. <br /> <br /> The female singer and mad eyes are best when she is dead in bed; and even the wolf was down (although he was the best executive in the film) - maybe breastfeed before the shots, or something. <br /> <br /> Unlike "Seven", which was up, but interesting) stories, which one can involve more or less regardless of the country, this movie seems to focus only on obsession of America. If someone does not care much about "criminals" - and the figure is that lack of exercise and bad food causes more pain, suffering and death - there is little reason to see it, or fear. </> <br /> There are some parts of the body that make up some of the feet, but the cloud is very small, and it fails both as an artistic device (because it doesn't mean) and as a year, because it's not enough. <br /> <br /> Don't waste time on this.
