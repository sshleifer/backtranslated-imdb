I lost this film on the movie but I had some ideas behind my head that it was worth looking at, so when I went through the shelf on the DVD I thought "when looking at it". Great error! <br /> <br /> A long list of stars cannot save this Turkey, certainly one of the worst movies. Anonymous attribute is delivered in unsupported and unsupported hands. Perhaps it would have been more meaningful if I would like to read the Robbins novel but unless the film is very different from the novel, and if Robbins help in the screen I am sure, the novel would be reading well. I hope the executives were well paid as they seemed ashamed to be in this celluloid waste and more recent DVD buttons, taking the model Pat Morita. Even Thurman has the grace to look at the constant stress. Keep yourself close to 98 minutes of your life for something more valuable, like stretching your fingers or choosing out your sockets. Even when you see it on "less than $ 5" to lose in your local store, resist the desire!
