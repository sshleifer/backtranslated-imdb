I was very interested in two films in one half of the sex parts of Lena and the other half are her curiosity and political / social. Whatever the director's intention, these two do not have mesh together. The director should be connected to Lena's sexual side and make a different film for politics. There is a wonderful mix of political gatherings, Dr. King, major political interviews, breast hitting, and publishing hair. The film feels more like a false document than a movie. More than sexually interesting events, you will be bored dry to watch this film. Unlike many other critics, I think nude / sex scenes are overdone for what it is. If you want to see the actual picture, I'm sure there is a better choice. Widespread creativity is a serious problem from any existing plot. I think the cast did a good job however. They played their part of course. There's a little over-the-topness I'm so used to see in American films this time.
