The problem with this movie is that it is shot on the worst camera and the film is blurry and grainy. Maybe it's just the fact that anyone who was doing the camera could not hold it because they were shocked or something. There are also many ways to vomit in this film. There is someone vomiting every twenty minutes and makes me think that this was done with some bulimic or something. It was disgusting. Then there is an outrageous cry that goes on and on and not stops it until the end of the document. I also did not like it when all his friends were shot (or do not know) and he goes to the car and sets the port. That was really really stupid even having it in the movie. What? How much of a gas can a man can beat to go? It should be very much because it does not predict the gas for all the film. It was a bad movie and I would strongly recommend I've never seen it throughout your life.
