I, also having hundreds of children's movies in the past, consider this to be one of the worst I have ever seen. 1) I love this day and age to be explaining to my children that Russia is not "bad people". Also, disrespecting Russian names as "Poopchev" was not helpful. 2) The birthday party's birthday party had a joke of sex lovers who said that men drank beer and women talking on the phone. Two other rivers also use the word "crap" twice without use. 3) The whole movie faces a fraud and the propaganda of the 1950 which I thought we, as a nation, had the pride of the above resurrection. <br /> <br /> For everything wrong, very bad, even more wrongly written and it is not worth spending time seeing.
