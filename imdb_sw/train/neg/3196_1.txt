The only words you need to be afraid of Joe Don Baker if your view of the movie is Gray Clark, and if it's all there, running for your life. However this is a very interesting film because they are getting into a lot of weight! It comes from bad and goes down from there, many things that are being done, the badly worst and Ugly as the caterpillar will send them to the floor with laughter. Yes, he is the best deputy of Texas, to track the man of the mafia hit Malta just as he can. He makes his own rules, does his own things, while all wearing the boots of cowboy and cowboy style of cowboy. Want to see a bad but interesting movie? Keep going, your move!
