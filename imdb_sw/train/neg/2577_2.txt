This story had a distinctive horn that attracted me, which had enough to buy VHS previously visible to invisible. That was a mistake. What can be a very good story - about people with very severe disabilities in hospitals, and their various features - they have quickly turned into a very bad array of opera and unrelated characters. <Br /> <br /> We have "Bloss" (William Forsythe) a white-colored person, who says f-word every other sentence and is despicable to give him the first name in the movie. She is so happy to be around. Then, there is "Raymond Hill" (Wesley Snipes), a woman talking fast. Snipes must have loved the proud roles of talking about "hip" because they played for their number, like "White Men Can Stop." Then there is a good player of Helen Hunting playing "Anna" to be a very good, caring person who has a habit of adultery and a leading character in the film, "Joel Garcia" (Eric Stoltz). is the heart of the heart, feel good. It just makes my heart melt to look at these beautiful people. But, if you are one of those who love evil characters are shown by the uncomfortable people in this evil film ..... can you really like this! Add to the political level of Hollywood and there you go! What more can a person want?
