had to see this cos it looked like a great concern to prisoners - prisoners to get a magic book, oo err! claustrophobic terrorism goes, etc. <br /> but it was not found to be a story going along with a great idea. instead of a bad fear / physics, it was dependent on the external effects of the fire and the exposure of the OTT body, which was not afraid all the time if it was over 12. . losing the best characters - which was the best thing about this film. <br /> <br /> Open budget below, which should not, the film is not recommended anywhere, and you believe it is going to say this - it requires a remake of Hollywood. you just leave interest in this version. certainly not in the same league as other French films that came out in the last few years as blue rivers which were at least seen / entertaining, malefique is not available at the end of being honest. and I bet you might think the end before seeing the film. really really disappointing - it is impossible to recommend.
