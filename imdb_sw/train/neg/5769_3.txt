The dream of an elephant was supposed to be a project for the open-source community. And when it was a very interesting idea in the concept, it actually failed miserably. The movie is well presented, which may be the only reason for redemption. The main problem with them, however, is the greatest damage to the flowers. It's awesome, though I think it helps to provide a quality film of dreams. One thing of note is a terrible voice that makes it. When the Proog voice actor is at least capable, the sound of Emo's voice is HORRIBLE. I think when you have a budget that is based on zero, you can't afford to employ real voice executives. For me it seems as they hired one of the animators to make his voice. <br /> <br /> Generally, movies does not go anywhere. For me it looks like it's more than "see what we can do" kind of movie instead of a real film. The program does not go anywhere and it is not possible to show any interesting point. The whole movie hears as it was made as an excuse to make interesting places to watch. Overall, it may be worth downloading quickly from the official website, but don't expect anything except a beautiful picture.
