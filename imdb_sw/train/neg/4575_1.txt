I will admit that I am just a college student at this time, the English prince there. When I saw this film I was a high school student - I want to say a small year but it can be a senior, hard to remember. My experience with physics of quantum goes very well with my physics physics study, the purpose of the quantum mechanics that has led me to read on the subject in several books on the theoretical field and everything that I can find in discovering and so on. It's not PhD in any way. <br /> <br /> That said ... <br /> <br /> This movie is very bad. It is designed to appeal to the scientific intelligence of the New Age guru who longs to believe how special everyone is. My mother is such a man and since he found this movie he tried to find all his friends to see and buy a copy of the film. I tried to explain the errors and problems I had seen and the logic of the film and science - and they are many - and denied my claims because "oh, so a high school student knows more than all those with PhD." In this case, it seems so . <br /> <br /> Leaving behind the fact that getting PhD should not require someone to be right or, in fact, has a mind. Stop behind the fact that my basic understanding of physics is enough to open a half film. Leaving that back, the creators of the film made their interviews and at least one of the participants to make it appear that they supported their beliefs when, in fact, he totally opposed them. I would go on but I think intuitor did a very good job of destroying the film so don't feel free to read if you'd like to do it. <br /> <br /> http://www.intuitor.com/moviephysics/bleep.html
