There is a reason why Jay Leno himself will not accept this film. It is always an array as one of the worst films of all time. Acting is bad, the script has no leadership and the director himself does not seem to be sure about the way to take this film. "Film film," "act / comedy," "secret." It seems half-way, drives, and includes just for a trip. Jay Leno and Pat Morita are skilled and dedicated artists. It is a shame that they lost their time and their gifts to make a mess of the movie. Jay Leno and Pat Morita before engaging in this, they had spent years losing their crafts in Hollywood. Mr. Morita had been a star for his own right, doing steadily since the mid-1960s as a TV star and cinema cult as "happy days," and bad but affected "Mr. T and Tina." And win the hearts of America and its roles in a powerful film, "Midway," "Karate Kid," and the army of others. Mr. Leno can appear on television shows from 70 years in the middle. And he was a top actor in American clubs. He can appear in many TV ads and in the main film. It is a shame, that they accepted the appearance of this lie.
