I loved Dewaere in the Noir Series. His talent is reduced in "Waltzers" aka "Going Places". Well, it is a few of the young people who oppose the contract in a strange and unadulterated way; Many people find such an exciting character. This was a boring, useless exercise that was amazing. I see smirk on the face of Blier, face behind the camera, angry. Noir series was a legitimate demonstration of personal freedom and independence. From the first time we see him passing Patric Dewaere in the left vote we get the idea of ​​fighting with the wonderful heroes we will be spending time with the next few hours. When we see him chasing him away from an evil woman and her friend Depardieu in the "Going Places" we have a definite warning that two hours spent by these chaps will be spirit-draining. I have trouble eking even "3" for this awesome excitement.
