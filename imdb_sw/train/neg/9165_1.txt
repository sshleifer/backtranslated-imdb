There are no providers in this review because everything was already shown in the film trailer. I am trying to be balanced in my opinion because I am very helpful for local movies, but I can't help but support the intervention against this film. It is slow, interesting and boundless without meaning. Even "almost short and honest time" were once undercut with painful clich√©s and acting evil. Vernetta Lopez and Wong Li Lin, whom I usually love, were only approved in this film. It felt like the director was trying to make a sample of music TV, then he was taken and decided to put it on the big screen. Leap years should come with a RA rating (counted Awful) but has not changed my belief in local movies. The best films will come, as long as more films like these are not available.
