Avoid the USA version. It includes the American additions and the worst dubbing you have ever heard maybe done by New York lovers. Dubbing is so bad that it looks like the Mystery of Secret Science 3000. I think a black man from Bronx does the voice of Chiba. I couldn't watch the entire film was bad. Instead of this version of the Standard see other greats of Chiba as The Streetfighter or Karate Warriors.
