The most beautiful woman in the show business, and sexiest, Debbie gives another good performance here. Although his work in the US marriage was much higher, it is still worth looking at this film. It has been sent filled with your common type of Melrose Place, stripes and sliced ​​pieces, which I have never seen. Besides Debbie, Laura Nativo was the only actor I had seen before, in Delta Delta Die like that. The part of the plot around the California foolish group that initiates the poor poor Debbie Rochon in their laughter. They tell him that they have a killing club, and that he must kill someone to be accepted. Debbie wants nothing more but accepted by these cool people, so he kills a person quickly, and now the group should decide what to do with him, after the fall of their joke. Debbie Rochon has always had blood on it all and all events of the murder have been done on your face. Debbie Rochon has several nude events such as many non-name actors and executives. For the pool party it seems to be an excuse to find everyone naked, male and female equals . The character is already over five minutes. <br /> <br /> story: $$ (It can get a lot of vote because the plot was very interesting and unique but the plot is used as a filling out of naked events. B-Rate film uses dirt many times, but this it is excessive border). It is a low level to say a little. Rochon is always in a reat, the best best actor B-Rate in today's business, but his behavior in the US Nightmare was the best. he does a good job like Debbie's desire but other participants were nothing to write about).
