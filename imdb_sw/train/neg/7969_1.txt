Similar to another film purchased by me and Joe Swatman. Well this is not the worst movie that I have gone through this week but has played royaly. we were so happy to look at this piece. <br /> <br /> The Jigsaw of Monster is a mish mash of all these ideas of non-working students, you know ur only with difficulty when someone gives him buzzsaw equipment and sawed the shotgun, the film was not as much as we expected, i mean on The deaths are a heart attack. Again I think acting is trying, the general practitioners must be a porn star and one will enter his undies for any reason. The worst part is the end, leaving you open for a little bit of jigsaw but that won't happen to the gunna facing face. <br /> <br /> My testing: <br /> <br /> funny 4/100 shock (what a joy we were despising) 73/100 doing 8/100 generally 12/100
