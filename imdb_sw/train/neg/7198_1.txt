After the wonderful life of Disney George of the Jungle, I had a great hope of this flick. Great desire. Open copper, bad actors, bad effects of sight. This film was based on the crumbling pieces, the placement of idiotic products (and uncertainties), and the most prohibited bids in the gadget object. I took two little children to see and where they lost their minds. Only one laughter found in this film was a bad moment of time when you need to show a guy playing on the groin!
