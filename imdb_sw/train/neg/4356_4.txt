Since I am not a fan of blood and guts I have had gory events completely without unnecessary (hitting) and also realistic to me, if you are the kind of person who gets their rocks on the head cutting on a movie or web site, therefore, it asks for faith what kind of person writes this dream of the disease however. <br /> <br /> Besides that it was likely to be a great movie, music was a high class too (through film and especially last credit). Some parts though they were unreliable, if you were found only by your faithful girl on waiting for the suffering and death and everything you do is to tell her about what happened and how you got there, (why didn't you ask if she came to be any wipes or even some fresh air or piece gum when he was there?), come now, most probably just scream "fast and open me then lets get f *** out here FURA!". Where to fly, dirt etc., and when the girl came out of the crash the very point of decaying meat would have looked at a few bell bells! I would just recommend this film to friends of Dennis Niellson and so on, I am sure a video like this would make sickos like that to have a very big Christmas.
