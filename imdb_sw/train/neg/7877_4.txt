The creators of this film have created a future where not only abortion and contraceptive controls in every situation, but women are judged for murder and sent to serve long prison sentences. The political agenda is too heavy here and the style of film is so important that it loses steam very quickly. Regardless of the side of the fence you live, I would like to recommend flying.
