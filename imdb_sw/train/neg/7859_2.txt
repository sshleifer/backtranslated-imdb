My God. This movie was bad. I can't complain about it. I went to see it just out of the outside. It made enough, kind. It is funny that the most disgusting part of the film was at the very beginning, where the woman is forced to be born the most tragic birth of a child. <br /> <br /> I also think it's funny that most popular actress in the movie was a Spanish soldier, who was an actor to help next Friday. Everyone in the film did a terrible job. It was some of the worst jobs I've ever seen to see. I expected that it would be worse than the first. It was not. I expected to be very bad because it sequels the sequel and fear movie usually is less successful than their predecessors. I expected to be very bad since the year and the usual violence to sell a horrible movie these days (Grudge 2, Saw 3, Creepers Creepers 1 & 2, Silly Dead), but in fact it wasn't almost like gruesome as the first, which was still other desires. <br /> <br /> The first mix was a kind of disturbance but the authors of the film were trying very much for this to make them angry that they were quite hilarious. I also hated the whole idea of ​​showing a piece of a female soldier's cell phone saying "I love you, mother" POUR TIME. It was folly to show the first place because they were trying to make us feel more comfortable for a more vulnerable mother than all the other soldiers, and it was more foolish to keep trying to make us feel even for him by showing it three times for any reason. This movie was a joke.
