I saw this recent movie of Woody Allen because I am a fan of his work and I am making it a thing to try to see everything he does, although this film review led me to expect an antidote. They were the same. This is a confused movie that can not decide if it wants to be a comedy, romantic fantasy, or a drama game in the middle of women's life. Fails to all three. Alice (Mia Farrow) is a middle-aged woman who is married to great wealth and leads a luxurious life to her husband who loved her and their two small children. This unusual concept of conspiracy is associated with such an implausibilities as an old Chinese medicine man who makes his invisible and certain magic plants, and the spirit of the former partner (who he jumps on Manhattan). If these sounds are also good for you, what about something that is going on further, like the thing of the saxophone player? I've never been sure what this mix was confused you tried to say. There is only a very short time in the film, and the end of the touch of Pollyanna. It is a very well-designed film that deals in combining comedy based on ethics and values. Or return "Annie Hall" or "Manhattan".
