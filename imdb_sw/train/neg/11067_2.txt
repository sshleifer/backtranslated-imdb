I am a big fan of a kind of real crime, but I couldn't stay with this piece of putrid. It was almost like Dahmer was aimed at decreasing, up to the voice of photography. No look at what made Dahmer tick, no observation of its victims. Nothing but "See how this boy is stirring." And it should give the filters of this film - Dahmer they are the only thing that ever scared the screen.
