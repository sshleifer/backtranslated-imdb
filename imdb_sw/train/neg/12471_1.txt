Living in the Middle East (in Israel), I was happy when I bought my ticket for Syriana. After seeing the trailer, and being an exciting partner, I expected to see the first move fast, the breath that gets the film, which is smoothly made in international decisions and the connection between oil, power and corruption, from the new horn. Well, almost I came out of the middle movie. That step was so bad, almost all the characters were hit, the interlinked editorial made the logic very difficult, but, as Steve Rhodes wrote in his review, he finally cares about it. Save your money, forget your time, choose another film. <br /> <br /> Wife Chernitsky
