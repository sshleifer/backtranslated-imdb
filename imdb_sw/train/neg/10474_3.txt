The Omega Code was a symbol of the difference of movies. There was a little (but a bit of value) of a good acting, especially with two prophets and Rostenberg, who appeared only once and had no lines. Otherwise, the acting was bad. The plot of the plot was very weak, and only partly on the interpretation of the Bible. Surely no one of the best year.
