This movie was disgusting. They should be a warning that a sad writer is trying to make a name for himself before attending the kidnapping of the hour and a half. What trash? Abuse of people, abuse of energy, and loss of any kind of education system that taught him how to read and write. You are a sicker loser. Your psychiatrist should prescribe powerful drugs for your problem. Acting and conspiracy did not give me a choice but it was very fast through the trash. I ended up in an unfamiliar area. If you want to learn how to scare people to watch the film Larry Clark. I lost all respect for the whole cast of this film "no more help from me." Can actors or practitioners sit on a set when a large-scale demonstration of human behavior is shown from the psychological mind? I feel for all actors involved in the area. I think the devil now knows who wrote this film; Congratulations won his attention.
