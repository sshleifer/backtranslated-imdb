This should be one of the worst filling I've ever seen and have seen a few. It is slow, interesting, amateur - not even consistent within its simple reading of the plot. Actors do not work. I can not accuse them - they have been given a script to ban all that they can do is to enter it with that pain behind their eyes which is not associated with the bad action in the SummersIsle. There is no time in this film that becomes real - not a line of loyalty or one instant where one moves. The character of Nicholas Cage is very interesting that one does not feel the feeling of sympathy for him through all his troubles. I have no doubt that I was seeing a sick person above but Nicholas Cage knew perfectly the fact that he was in the worst movie of all his work.
