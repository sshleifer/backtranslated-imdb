For a series of fan, I must admit that the Frontier secret is not all bad. But, reviewing this series cannot depend on whether it's a fan series or not. The effort is very interesting. Creativity also. I think these are ordinary people, with a great heart of passion for Star Trek. But, do all this work. Take all these resources. Take all this time, and still all these errors. <br /> <br /> First of all acting, and lines are bad. For many. The conversation is in the military show of 70, not in Star Trek. Captain (Mr Squinty) looks like he's about to burst in laughter at any time. And many characters read their verses. Directors should be aware of the fact that "restore" is not just a word in the dictionary. But I also think that the series is made in the form of "two takes a cake", who has led many of the events and movies of TNG. Without going further into that concept. <br /> <br /> My great concern about the entire project, is the quality of releases. At first they decided to spend a lot of time, and resources in this series - why didn't they make it available for the best quality? Using short-term structure, and the bottom down resolution is losing talent. Even the "higres" intervals are considered to be the best quality compared to the standard quality of the standard. Using the Xvid codec, and the big resolution and file size could improve the experience. If the trouble band was the issue, set up a torrent tracker could solve it. Let's have hope the staff will decide to push the top series, and maybe take them out of the DVD, and give the project a worthy quality.
