"Nat" (shown by Trevor Gagnon), with his brainiac friend "IQ" (made by Philip Bolden) and "hungry scooter" (David Gore) are children with great dreams. They want to be the first flies in space. And what motivates their dreams is the first place of land on the moon, Apollo 11, is waiting for its historic journey on the launch pad where three are dependent. The first thing you see is the film animation. I saw that it was done very well. The beauty was deep, as far as the things really look like were behind the direction of events. I didn't see a film in 3-D, as planned in HBO. However, I could see that there were no incidents that used the 3-D benefits except the war between the characters near the end. I am also very interested in the structure of the characters. For me, they were not seen as anything similar to flying, especially in color. The rivers were usually blue-gray that were despicable. <br /> <br /> Displays from cast were not bad, but not good. There were often more attention to my computer than the story. Certainly the text was written to the small audience, during the comedic which will make young children laugh. I haven't seen anything for adults, like jokes who will get punchline for adults to understand the meaning. <br /> <br /> History was not followed in this film. In fact, I think it was completely ignored, if the main goal was the rivers. I also hated when a well-known man appeared on the screen and explained that the story of the river in the film was a false work, and there were no rivers on Apollo 11. I did the way he thanked the men and women who sacrificed their lives for space observation though. If you are an adult, this is not for you. It was not done for the whole family. This is true for children only. But, forget this for rainy days.
