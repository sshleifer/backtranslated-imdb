I didn't have great expectations, but I was fascinated by the details that revealed that the secret was in Christmas Factory decoration. Secret is solved very early and the film becomes automatic romance. I was almost standing on 5 minutes, 10 minutes, and during the first break. My partner, who is a fan of Hallmark & ​​Lifetime, stopped at the first break. Forest River is a company of the company - the main business is Aikens Ornaments, which makes all kinds of holiday decoration.The sister's company recently, so later the company can be a question. We are coming to meet Noelle, who would like to be on the Wall Street rather than the Great Street, and Justin's wonderful, who gets a date with Noelle after a great snow-striker, is injured in Justins's car. Once we meet Alison Aikens, diligently for the Board, we have set up our story. If you are not able to nail the nails of all the stories by breaking the first trade, you have not seen enough for this type of Holiday film. Maybe that's a good thing.
