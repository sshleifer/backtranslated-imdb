During his 40-year world, author Jack London was able to run as an adventure and event as possible. This 90-minute film, supposedly a human life story but for conversion, is not even suitable, and it remains a very elaborate story for modern voting. Here, Michael O'Shea, in one of his first responsibilities, tells London, and all his performance is powerful and compassionate. He is not a problem here. Then is little Susan Hayward and the best, playing his future wife, Charmian, whose London profile is the "foundation" of this film. London's life here is broken down in a series of events, which the film decreases slightly. So we have short events with London as the pirate of oyster, sealer in the Bering Sea, the gold client in Yukon and the author during Warso-Japanese War ... color events, indeed, but hard to be given anything as well as the treatment deep. And Alfred Santell's direction (also inspired one of the first of Susan's films, "Our Leadership," 1939) is much better than lackadaistiki. Doing things here is a very bad DVD, with a source of source and voice. Perhaps the best thing about this film, for me, was one of the DVDs: a list of all videos of Alpha videos, including hundreds and hundreds of full movie posters. Let's just hope that these films have been better than "Jack London"!
