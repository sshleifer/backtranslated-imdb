This is one of those films that are more interesting to look from a professional perspective than from a entertainment perspective. I am doing my testing according to how much I enjoyed or was welcome by the movie, so I give it. The pseudo-silent film and elements of sound effects and reality. It means to convey a non-incorporated and shared mind, and is interesting in this regard. However, the film has a lot of disgusting things that I didn't find all of the entertainment. They are mainly disturbing. It has very interesting pictures, and some interesting ideas, but some behavioral relationships (especially between mother and child) are very interesting. All, this film will attract you or you will not be. For me, it was interesting from a professional perspective, but it didn't look good, and I probably would not go again for the second time. <br /> <br /> 4/10 if you're looking for entertainment. 10/10 from a professional perspective.
