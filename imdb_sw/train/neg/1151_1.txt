This movie was very bitter. <br /> <br /> The characters were very cool. Mother, who is the main character, is everything but "mother". Well, she was happy in her marriage and always put her husband and children first. Her husband is dead. Then you may visit her son and meet this hunk who sleeps with her daughter and ends with her. Until this section, movies are the same. Not better, but it can look. A boy who is attractive and who can blame him? Equally not very mother sleep with your girlfriend but let's say that for the shock of losing her husband. She has been busy with the boy. I think this is the place where I started to love the film. He is always wanting to please him in the "old" way and snacks when he works in his son's house (I think this is the only thing he learned to do), as it was the only way he could find him. This guy is very clear (in fact, it looks more like he thought to sleep with him for help) and instead of being treated with it, he keeps begging him to go to bed with her and be happy when he becomes very aggressive. "I want to please you", he tells him in a desperate way. What is angry with this film, is a great lack of self-respect for herself. He tells Craig something like "I am brass without copper" at first they sleep together. <br /> <br /> This movie is insulting to women of the kind. If it were to me, I'd like to buy a little something that will bring me the same satisfaction as a lot of emotional pain ...
