This is the only film I have seen that has been done by Uwe Boll, I knew it is probably the worst director who always makes a film according to video games also that "The House of the Dead" is one less than IMDb 100. I am a great fan of the game and I wanted to see what the doe film has made it very bad. After watching I agree that it gives us, the movies had no story. In the first 15-20 minutes there was nothing but girls who had no intelligence girls riding (for a little while I was going to ask them are brain-dead zombies or girls are?) Then at night the zombies don't exist anywhere & start attacking later woman began to shoot a shot I think it takes one place then another every 5 minutes. Should be a comedy, or fear? or both? Before I know I slept in the second half & wake up when the last credit so I don't manage to check all, which is a good thing! Film is a real insult to tribal game, Be Boll please do not make any film. Thank you!
