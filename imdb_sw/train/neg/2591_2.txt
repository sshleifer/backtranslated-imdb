At the beginning, I would say that I am a fan of the series of American Pie. Even though the 'naked mile' and this are two of the worst, this seems to be a deficiency of all the series. First, the best part of the film was that it was the American Film Pie, which is always recommended. However, there are tons of bad things to say about this film. First of all, the story has a very stale 'arc' structure. First, there is the introduction of the characters, then the promise of the house of beta and finally the Greek Olympiad. Each has a 25-minute height. In addition to the fullness of the plot, there is a little promotional character, which makes the whammy double the worst plot. In addition to this, I have not been very interested in this film. That is, showing jocks as a very cool youth, thinking-about-sex, and clearly showing geek as inferior. Also, it shows women only as sex objects, and men just want to treat women as sex objects. Besides this, acting also was poor. Maybe except Steve Talley. So, at the end, the most unusual movie, as shown from an important view. If it appears from a young perspective, I think it is best, but this film is 18+ scored in many countries, so it is not recommended for children.
