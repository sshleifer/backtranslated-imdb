This is the story of the Jewish family without work. Divorced parents and mothers are still returning home. Father, Murray Abromowitz, goes with his California children, and goes around Beverly Hills so that his children can get the best education possible. Things are true when Marisa Tomei, Murray's nephew, comes to live with the group. <br /> <br /> The film deals with various adventures of hard family and neighborhood drug addiction. <br /> <br /> Jessica Walter costars like a woman who wants Murray to enter with her since she wants a friend. Carl Reiner and Rita Moreno come into the end. They play Murray's brothers and sister-in-law respectively; they are also Tomei's parents. In front of the children, Reiner stops reminding Murray that he has been paying them all. The film ends in the shape of the ear as a shy family comes from their concepts and takes the Beverly Hills rush into their car. I think the film promotes freedom and some good self-esteem.
