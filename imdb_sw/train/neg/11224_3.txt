... and yet, even they can live without seeing. In order to be honest, this film (like someone who calls it) is of real interest for freaks of slavery. Bettie Page fans will learn anything new (and I don't mean * anything), nor will they enjoy fuzzies of warmth to meet anything called, loved, or interesting. <br /> <br /> Do not remove the odd screenplay, non-working works of the local community, the absence of patterns, crappy lights, or any of the low-production products. This is definitely "Hey, kids, let's make a film!" making the film of the lowest order. I think one can be grateful that at least knew how to run the camera. No, I am poor to say that none of these are due to why this is definitely not * incorrect. It is wrong because this woman who plays Bettie Page, a little stupid girl who just resembles the Queen of Curves is black hair and trademarks, can never bring anything to a more committed role. touched. This is a good thing for his film work before and since this extra pain, but not in addition to the pain itself, which includes a large number of B&D repairs made by love among the great faux-biografics events described Mrs Page's fall from grace (to say). There is probably probably more information, for se, about the life of the Page in credit and the opening of more credit than all the film. <br /> <br /> Removed. This is not a suitable "Betty Notorious Page" film. This is not the best film. This is a piece of fetus that makes the business of one of all the pins of all time, and it does without class, without fashion, and without a real understanding of Bettie Page's behavior. No true Bettie fan will find you to be anything but desire, I make sure that. Avoid at all costs. If you are free, remember that time is money, too. Yours may not be worth much, but I am trying to have enough value that you will have the time you lost with this. That is, I'm done, you've been warned.
