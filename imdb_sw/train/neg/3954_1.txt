MOVIE OF HEART is flashbacks from the first movie Boogeyman with, of course, pictures from another film of Uli Lommel / Suzanna Love Brainwaves. It is currently written more (from the early 90s each time) footage which is boring, wrong and shot down. It's not the only film that looks next to the flashbacks, REPEAT flashbacks the same in the same film. So you see the recurring pictures, as if you have never seen. If that nature was not very bad. I have never seen the film being hit .... Someone was knocking the last dollar out of these films. Total rapoff. And talking about padding ... why do I write 10 verses about this garbage? If I can show that it is garbage in verses 2, that should be enough.
