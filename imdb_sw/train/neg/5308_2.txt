Nothing can prepare you for another sword of lousy bimbo! This time, it is brought to you by Fred Olen Ray who can never be avoided! Since experimental movies go away, this does not happen! As a fiction science, it is quite clear! All we see is an adorable android female wearing a bikini to destroy the world, and show everything that is close to close! Give me a f-ing break !!! If this type of entertainment is your own, then why don't you have dust from these old SI's swimsuit from the attic for change? This would have been better if it hadn't made the highest item, but still can't make this a good one. I would like to mention another film called ASSAULT (1996) and Jim Wynorski, which resembles ALIENATOR's identity. It explains why on-notch 1-person "fatale women" movies movies does not translate well into America. Sorry, fellas!
