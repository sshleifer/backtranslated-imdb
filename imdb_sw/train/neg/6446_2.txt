The Western society has understood ideas about India being a poor country. These films only make these beliefs more powerful. Such models become more difficult for Indians to receive abroad. Agree there are poor and homeless in India, but why there is no representation of educated people if they are not successful. I hate the idea of ​​a film that shows Patrick Swayze as another Mother Teressa. In my opinion this movie has shown India to the worst light to give a negative opinion. It is not fair to discuss only one issue of society. Exactly why people ask me, “When we go to India, we can employ the elephant right out of the airport so that we don't have to walk on the road full of destruction with snakes? Those who want a second opinion on the modern Indian society should look for "Monsoon Wedding".
