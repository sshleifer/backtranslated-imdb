That's true, you've heard. I am a great fan of James Patterson. I have 10 books of his books, and I have read the whole series about Lindsey Boxer. In my opinion, the scribe should be shot. What kind of film was the right to kill a fake job and to make it the opposite of the secret type? If I had ever thought that Harry Potter was punished, then Michael O'Hara has proved that it's okay. I can only ask that the next screen writer who can cope with this amazing book will do something bigger than the right. By Michael O'Hara and Russell Mulcahy: don't leave your work day.
