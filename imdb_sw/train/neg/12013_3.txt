I had to think that any movie with the lady of the Poltergeist in it would not be good. In fact it starts well, but during the first murder scene you see that the movie you watch is a movie inside the movie. There are people living in the cinema watching the movie. One girl in the audience is so angry that I would turn and spray him. Wonderful thing, but far from good.
