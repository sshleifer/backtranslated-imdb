It's a waste of time! I have tried to stay through 'Sky Captain.' About 6 times, and every time, within 3 minutes, I start doing something else - nothing else! It is a very interesting movie, acting is bad, and obviously the director of the first time, because it is hard. And I wanted to love. , but my God, what a waste of money I was working on Main Images, and I wrote Sherry Lansing in 1993 about using the blue screen for screen settings. Sherry was correct in 1993, but should have forgotten his own advice when he reduced this dog. The screen of the screen is a shooting effect, but not the whole movie. Paltrow reminds me of the high school effort. It is not bad - it can be worked ed, but only under the knowledgeable director. The amazing thing is, the director of the Sky Captain will continue to find work, even after this stop. It's business, not art!
