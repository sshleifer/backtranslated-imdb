There is good. There is a bad. And then they are Sentinel, the "priller" of the bottom of the political barrel which is among the worst movies I've ever seen. The mole program in the Secret Service is good, but it has never been the most highly developed film. Directed by the "edginess" of the ham set by ham and Clark Johnson, each actor in this film seems to work independently. Even the chief Michael Douglas looked tired here. I can honestly say I have never been, in all my life, I watched another film with lots of conspiracy. From it is predictable from one square, and the attitude of the character is quite so ridiculous that they inspired laughter from the audience. Avoid this at all costs. This is a tragedy of the movie without the redemption value.
