99.999% of pure skin. And another .001% was a short time when I thought that the donkeys of the blond was going. Nope. The talk was bad for the law. The move was followed, and did not have sex (the sheep described above is normal to wear, alas, the entire movie). CGI had the reputation of being the worst I ever seen in the film, and the many chronicles were so hot and hot. Working was confidential even from Ben Cross and Marina Sirtis, the only 'names' in this film. And Marina Sirtis looked, it's quite bad. I've seen high school produced more. This is the type of film that MST3K has been developed. The pieces should turn to Sci-Fi for allowing this drop-down.
