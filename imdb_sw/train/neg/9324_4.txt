Well own this DVD I got a new amazon ... i mean i think its badass and flick pretty cool and melissa bale slutty / bitchy girl they take it hot like hell ..., acting sucks and the whole polt follows just a clown is a great man wearing a mask and its disgusting but it's okay I can't recommend if you want to rent a beautiful flick after hard work but if you don't have anything to do with ur created by these stupid movies like me, see sometimes, and don't know how the artistic DVD has SICK in collection its DVD, sick it's not good to be owned by a movie of the honorable half of OK OK quite well
