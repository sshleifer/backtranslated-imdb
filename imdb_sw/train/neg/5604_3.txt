I've heard about this film for many years, and finally I had a chance to see it. The massacre of the heroes back in 1963 and 1969 finally makes the camp of cheerleading closed. Quickly in 1982, with Bambi, a former student, reopens with new employers, among them Candy (Carol Kane), Glenn (Judge Reinhold), and Sandy (Debralee Scott). Directly, they are killed by the killer, even one. That's when we know who did it and why. Also in the movie is Tom Smothers giving a strong impetus as a Canadian Mountie, and Paul Reubens making his player Pee-Wee Herman. The general work is not widely available, and it is completely disabled, but some incredible events occur, ie the House of Bad Pies and the poker area of ​​the line. The latter is seen as being thrown together, which is a shame. Overall, good for ten or fifteen minutes total, others can only continue fast. Maybe you get it on television, but it's not worth buying.
