I am the best of the best film. But this was bad. No wonder I had a very difficult time to find it. I tried 4 video rental outlets, until I got one for a copy of this movie. Acting was bad, the plot was joke, and the action was also bad. I miss miss Alex Grady, Travis Brigley, and kickboxing original characters and themes that this film had first Style 2. <br /> <br /> John
