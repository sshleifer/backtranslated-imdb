Wow ... I can't believe how bad ZOMBIE DOOM (aka VIOLENT SH! T 3) really is. I would like to hear rumors, read reviews - but I had to make my own mind. Well, tell me - IT BLOWS !!! The worst of any films made, dubbing which must have taken place when everyone involved was completely lost, was not enough FX capacity, worthless, "cinema" which looks like my grandmother did with its camcorder, weapons that are no joke - carried out by paper-plains - the list continues with the ... Three / three are beaten on the island where the weirdos group runs around with plastic and tap-foil swords. Two immigrants are released with rebels of the island's attractions, and are given the head of the day before being hunted by some of the "tribe" ... that's pretty much ... <br /> <br> Sure - this is one of the WORST films that I have had unfortunately involved also. The budget had to be about $ 200 and was used entirely on FX of the year (which in fact could not be a bad idea ...). There is nothing to ZOMBIE DOOM except to consider the things that are carefully combined with lots of HORRIBLY conversations. This film makes other non-budget results like PREMUTOS: THE LORD OF GOD'S TIME appears as TITANIC. Others can put ZD in a "bad-so-good" category - and I think if you really drunk or up and look at a few friends of MST3K style - I think it might seem that way. But not for me. I hated everything about it. If ZOMBIE DOOM or ZOMBIE 90 (which is surprising and included as "bonus" on the release of Shock-O-Rama of ZD) is a sign of other works of Andreas Schnaas - then it should be banned from having anything to do with make the film again under the death penalty. There is one exciting kung-fu fight in the last half of the film, and a lot of blood - so I will give it one by one 3/10 - You have the permission and explode this.
