I just saw the DreamGirls yesterday, and I was quite less elected. Despite all the Oscar buzz, this is not special. Anyone who has been so impressed with this film has never distracted any music music. Except for the great performance of Eddie Murphy's music, Dreamgirls is the only movie of the non-style TV or flair. Only a group of lovers sing to each other! Now, the first half of the hour was good, but I was angry with how Eddie Murphy's exhibition of strong raveup was hit by interruptions and montages. That was the best songs and best displays in the film. And "rising up" part of the film was the only part of the film that had a consistent view or any view. The remaining hour and 45 minutes was an unpleasant mess, which was not true and should not be interesting. It also looked good and included many sound tunes. Condon does not attempt to turn any of the tunes into many pieces of display if I would like to expect. Any number in the 2nd half was just one close after someone else's "singing" AT to each other. And the way they hit a large number of "love me" of Hudson was criminal! Condon just shot and hitting the race around the stage - no drama at all! God watered! Look at all participants - that "chat-chat talks" things can work on the stage, but doesn't work in attractions (see failures of Evita and Phantom). All that "I'll come teeeell youuuu something Efff-ieeee!" Crap should be left on the floor of the editing room. Those who are not "songs" <br /> <br /> Again, the film - except the amazing performance of Eddie Murphy - was not just more than a movie of the TV glory. You must have megabucks behind the PR function for this film! I wonder how much money was used to give it before the release "one beat" Oscar buzz? Overall this film was, except for Eddie, now here close to the film Oscar caliber! (except for Eddie) I would like to put them up there with Grease 2. The desire of the BIG, especially after all (reduced $ I've been)!
