Quentin Crisp once said that when things are also shown beauty, one is romantic. When things show that they do not agree, it is true. And when something gets good treatment, they look. Unfortunately for Leon de Aranoa, he falls in the second match. This director has tried very hard to make a film of "Ken Loach" of Spanish, without the comedy, and the heat between the characters, which thrives the Loach movies to be just "sad". Los Lunes al Sol, it's just so, just sad. Things cannot be bad. The characters at the end of all the crisis come to a point at one point, and if the story of glum is not enough, Aranoa clears the story with the color of gray and colorful. The films were more interesting on Goyas. The film that shows sympathy to the weak people in the community, in this case the unemployed workers, does not do directly for a good film, though I am the first to hear it and the fate of these people. This movie only can make me grow anxious in their fate. In the 21st century Spain, unemployed people do not live as beggars, and public transport fences have good centers, and it is difficult to reach bar with very few punters and little fun that meets them. Leon de Aranoa certainly have no clue about the work of class Spain, and is not recommended favor. Priority is the only conclusion I can draw. The area where men are looking for a football match for free, has been taken directly from the film that takes more 'core' trap of “trap”, ie “Perfection”, which is more engaging, humorous, and still sad.
