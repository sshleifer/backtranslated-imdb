A truly awesome movie. I did not know earlier that this was Kiwi's effort - but recently I began to realize that all the characters were talking to the unveiled kiosks under the fake America. Why was it necessary to put America even? - can be installed NZ and then participants could use their normal voice. Surely someone in the production team can hear the evil experiments of talking with American accents? Bad movies. I wonder that it has led to a long time - how did it make it out of power? It seemed just like a lesser attempt in Segal / Willis a kind of person flick.A TOTAL WASTE money! If there was any TAXPAYER money in this rubbish piece, I would be leading a revolution to have all the money returned to the Treasury. I still miss (get? Pun, touch!) On the trash I saw. Why did I keep looking? Well, I am helping the fanatic and infinite film, myself!
