The pastor is on the side of the road and ensures that everyone listens to the speed limit (doing his job); then pulls on a woman who seems to be a mother (there is a child in the back seat); he is the one who tells him what is wrong and BAM ... they are killed. Well, this is the beginning of what I thought of myself would be a good movie. As I watched this movie on the playground I had some friends. It was our first night after summer so we could want to go to see a good film. We all decided to see the excitement / excitement that seemed good for everyone in the group ... this was one of the biggest mistakes of my life. It's not just a waste of $ 7.oo on a ticket to a film, but I was a ticket for the brain. This movie started with a mystery and stopped and I thought so much "this can't be bad" ... I wasn't the same. The whole problem with this movie is that it is useless; even if you could pass a bad act, the "non-threatening" story, and on the horrible mess of this movie was, you will still be surprised. Not because you're not smart enough to understand, it's because no one who has a brain can understand what this stupid movie is around. Right now you may be thinking "Oh man! I need to watch this film just to see if it's bad if this person says it is". FIND TO DO TO GIVE YOUR GOD ONLY NOW !!! I am trying to save you the trouble of watching this film by telling you it is so bad that there is no sure to even consider seeing. Please people do not make the same mistakes I thought this film has the potential ... it is not good. I give you 1 of 10 videos (if I could give a zero I would like), and I would not recommend anyone to see this film, you will save yourself from sleepless nights trying to think w. The same freaking movie is near.
