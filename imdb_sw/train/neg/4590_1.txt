Anyone who has studied any physics or cognitive science will come out with anxiety after 40 minutes, as my wife and I did. Uninformed people may be interested in the arguments of the hand and the strange "conclusions" (without even an attempt for logic) from real science. I am saddened by untrue lies under the example of "science". I can only conclude that the authors took the quantum of physics, they did not understand the word, then they looked at the Matrix a thousand times, and wrote this film. <br /> <br /> For example, Washington DC crime trials were made by the Transcendental Focus Program. Short search will explore the science of their methods. (http://www.freedomofmind.com/resourcecenter/groups/t/tm/disseer.htm) <br /> <br /> Save your money.
