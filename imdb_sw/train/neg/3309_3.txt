The program, promotional behavior, and practice in all this film is very weak. Damage of time. The conclusion of the Grace of Salvation should make the person feel warm and fuzzy as though the characters have grown through their struggle. There was no such progress to make such a warm feeling as possible. Drugs of drugs have been identified and many films are not really available. The plot builds what is supposed to be tension but the characters have not been established enough to maintain. Then it runs through a resolution of all the best problems at the moment of the screen leave for the viewer to hear if they lost their time.
