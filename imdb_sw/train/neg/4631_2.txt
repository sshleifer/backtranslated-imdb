Although Misty Ayers (the burlesque striker) certainly attracts as a blonde shot, this flick is only to allow him to blow up a few times (no shortage in 1954 when this film was organized, not 1965) <br /> <br /> The boy who uses working in a house house is similar to Bud Abbott's Abbott & Costello. Many of the other women are unacceptable, and the woman is dressed in half-amusing through the refusal. A 2 out of 10. Mrs Ayers has a physique to lose, but you can't judge any performing talent because the ENTIRE film has been published after. Some of these "exploits", which take place later than this, are more attractive in some way, but this is really fun. Sid Melton (Do ROOM FOR DADDY) directed. There are some samurai-like face-to-face and interesting rooms, but there is really no here.
