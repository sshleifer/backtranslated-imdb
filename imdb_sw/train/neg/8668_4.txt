I've never read the novels of Bradbury that this movie depends on but from what I have gathered, it will be interesting (when I finally read it and I will like). My opinion will focus on the film. Once I saw the trailer I knew I had to see and I was very excited but when I finally did, I was desperate. This is because the movie itself has felt very much. Participants were not smitten (although Robards and Pryce are good actors - not here). Children's actors, they seemed, were just asked to be shown, to get the clothes of the characters, say lines and make faces. The sets and talent were cheaper. The trend was amazingly terrible. I was shocked by the bad condition that I had to go to the web and watch who managed, just to see what kind of work he did. The editing was broken and linked to the screenplay (it was also the same (though the author had been involved himself, irony?). Built with tension, panic and waiting was very severe when it finally finally came. <br /> <br /> I have read some comments on this film and it's hard to believe people really like that. The worst thing is that the content is interesting and fun and exciting. It had great potential. Unfortunately, the film was so bad it takes away from the beauty of the story.
