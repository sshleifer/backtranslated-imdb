I was looking at one part of this app and I couldn't even reach the end of the app. Every minute I was looking at this IQ program should enter about 10 points. This is like a children's program but by swearing. Even swearing and insulting him tells others to make me laugh. Anyways stories must be written by a monkey and people who actually put this script to this app through for copying must necessarily be held in a thorough gun and had no choice but this film will lose, desperate, very bad. Sarah Silvermann should use a little money she actually made from this app and get some of the goddess acting lessons.
