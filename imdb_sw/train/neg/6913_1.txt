Believe it or not, "The slaughter of Woodchipper" gave me a full gonorrhea! That is true, I have a rainbow bow from me just because a group of children went to play near the camcorder and somehow made an alliance with the devil and distributed. It is beyond my understanding how anyone with moderate intelligence can tolerate this film. The only reason I could sit all the way (without a few attempts to commit suicide on the way) was because, firstly, I was happy with weight, and the second - I think I wanted to continue to explore this recent kind of hate I was seeing ... This movie is a 'shoot-on-video' "horror / comedy" about three brothers who have been left over the weekend in their aunt's service. The little child has already given the woman an accident with a Rambo-replica hunting knife. They have broken the fragments and different tools (it seems that it did not have one drop of blood in his body!) And took him into his father's dad's father ... His son's guilt then stops by looking for his mother and children grinding jackass too. ... I don't remember ever seeing the worst publishers who actually made me nervous. To a large extent, one blond donkey has healed me with constant pain. All the characters had a bad feeling - in fact they shouted their chanting sounds and jokes that should be composed by a chimp that doesn't care! Now, usually I can strive for self-effort, but only from those who can realize that other people than their relatives can have this look! I don't need to see a 3-minute drive of a car that walks out of the driveway and a good way to create an amazing summer lawn, and fluttery music that plays on it. Further, why does hell make this movie's movie the piano? There was a piano in one place and no one was killed near it! I am through to remember about this movie. Unless you want to spray, I can't advise anyone with half the brain to avoid this waste.
