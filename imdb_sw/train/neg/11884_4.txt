The biggest percentage in the joke. The size of the world, the deepest joke. Starting the humor and humor of 'everyone' of office space, this film gives an appeal to this film down by making humor that would only be well accepted by legal authors of books. The audience is asked to take an unknown position of the legal secretary, and then plead with the dictator. The entire film takes into account the legal secretary to find free time, listen to music and write a novel when working. These are his goals. You can't imagine a face-to-face strike (around half the way) feel that he has had a job that matches all three criteria, but gives it UP! The director and journalist (Jacob Kornbluth and Josh Kornbluth) are ultimately causing the audience to feel or even to find the main character who lost away what he complains about his lack. Apart from a major barrier, the legal secretary is interesting because they should be able to explain it to the audience whenever they happen. Without it, the audience would not see anything wonderful. Humor is only effective if it is not appropriate to be fully interpreted by the audience.
