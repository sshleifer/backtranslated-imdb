This film is nothing but a religious way that promotes Hinduism and the New Age of Europe is wearing Western pictures to swallow and those who do not know the comparison of the religious basis. Hindu basic tenants have regeneration. (Some of the characters appear both at this time and also in the 1600s) clearly inclusive. God is a supernatural force. Animal life and plant life are the same. (This is Pantheism). Redfield has tried to combine Mysticism of Eastern and Western Christianty. His syncretism experiment can deceive them or confuse those who are not looking for the truth but this film is an unnecessary excuse for any final truth. As an ad in Berkeley's Old Barb said it for $ 10.00 will show you how to start your own religion. As one famous prophet said, "Use Luke's Power".
