To be the only movie I could see in the "Nordische Film" in LÃ¼beck, this year's festival will be remembered as a little time for me. <br /> <br /> This movie, advertised as Thriller's nuisance, is nothing more than a patient's piece of skin! Sorry the language, but no good words to describe. First, artists are not the best. But even the best actors did not save the film. E. conspiracy: After the first minute it was clear that John was sick, neighboring girls were not real and that he killed his first girlfriend. The so-called "sex-area" was nothing but disgusting (fighting until the blood lost for me does not have any relationship with the sex), but unfortunately it is not just disgusting images displayed. Everything else published by other directors as e.g. Lynch, but of course without their loyalty. Therefore, to summarize all the films and save other viewers time and money: someone loses a girl, a partner returns home, someone kills a girl and becomes mad later, a guy thinks fire, but girls' female girls , the boy has a very nasty sex with one of them (or so he thinks), at the end he knows, he is mad and his girlfriend and his new partner sitting in his house all the time. A bad story, bad actors, pictures, making you want to vomit. . <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10 (1 point to reality, that you realize how good you can understand Norwegian as learning Swedish - at least one advantage of the evening - and you can not choose 0 points here).
