ALIEN LOVE (As this film is known in the UK) is a very wonderful movie. I don't mean that it's a movie of art of esoteric art in the style of Peter Greenaway or Derek Jarman, I mean it's TVM to swear, sex, T&A very good, bad script and feel very retro. You can just think of someone like John Hughes leading ten years ago, though he would surely cut T & A <br /> <br /> Return to a bad script, one of the problems is that a few of the characters have any kind of motivation especially Amanda. Why takes Connie on the bar? So he could meet a stranger? Do you see what I'm talking about retro? ET, CIRCUIT offshore and many movies from the mid-1980s had this type of conspiracy and many of them are defined and more persuasive than what is seen here. The storyline continues to follow a rough, unreliable and unreasonable way that means I have seen the love of ALIEN seen and not just under the T&A shown. As a comedy of sci-fi sex is better than FLESH GORDON and EARTH GIRLS ARE EASY
