The story line was straightforward and easy to follow and had a lot of non-brainer comedy to the place where it got boring. Some of the listeners seemed to be funny but I love more sense of humor. There were several Swedish actors on the film and their performance was polite to consider the script. Lena Endre had a good look as always. <br /> <br /> I don't remember the original movie so I can't say if it's better or worse. <br /> <br /> If you like to enjoy movies like SÃ¤llskapsresan this movie may be worth watching.
