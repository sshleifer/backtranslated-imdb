I wanted to love this film, yes, SAW, blah blah blah ripoff but I love these movies. If this has done well it has all the ingredients that are good, not brilliant, but a good film .... unfortunately these links went away! Acting was terrible, and this was the first to be seen when prisoners were initiated by their direct captor (hoods taken away), the words and one liners are just awesome, yes I know, bad text .... but this is more than that , it was a bad text with bad acting. Two immigrants had had a relationship with each other and did not even accept this even more in the film ..... / / <br /> Sorry, I am even wondering why I am confusing this movie all the time. <br /> <br /> I will end up with PLOT sessions, PLAY & PLAY PLUS PLAY! KNOWLEDGE!
