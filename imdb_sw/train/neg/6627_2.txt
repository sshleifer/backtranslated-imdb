What happens to RGV? He seems to repeat himself in every movie. Did he run creative ideas? If he has, the time to take the back seat. It came to see the movie in anticipation very much - of course not once I thought it would be anywhere near the original. I knew it wasn't, promos said it all. But however I thought it would be to treat the big RGV, after all not the same man who led Sathya and the Company? Or he? I have doubts after watching Aag. I can't talk about a plot or story, as many are taken from nature, if you die to go and see this, you can play fun game with friends: see events from one nature and give your own scores! So Veeru becomes Heero (how?), I think Heeru had no voice. Ajay Devgan is a very disaster like Heero, the comedy is bad and slurred talk that really was effective in the sound fake Company. Chemistry between Heero and Gunghroo (Nisha Kothari) does not exist. In fact Nisha attracts more tries to be more angry. This is approaching the final climax. Raj is not really bad compared to others, he is a boy looking at later. I was disappointed with Amitabh Bachchan as Babban, looked like a caricature of Gabbar Singh. There is a place where he has to drink something from a bowl covered with shawl, rather than a spectacular panic looks like an anchor and his bowl. The only function that had been standing is Mohan Lal as Auditor Narasimha. I'm afraid that it's not the patience to write more.
