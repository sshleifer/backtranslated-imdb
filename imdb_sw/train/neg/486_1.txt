This flick was a blow to me. I think young girls should have the prospect of becoming a model of swimsuit, house makers or builders, since it seems to be all that will be shown as. It is truly sad to see the work of the artist and life to be equally accurate. Inconcievably (or perhaps it would have been expected), the character of all Artemis and all that he stands, has been reduced to ordinary Hollywood, female character; a little sad, physical, helpless, characterized by any attribute of the character that actually received this position in history that had been sent here. Sadder still, it was to see that a large part of the audience was very bad knowledge in the area to understand the amazing gap between the messages given in the film, and the truth. To show the artist if the person who loves and the opponent of real life, a person who has actually been accused of wanting to ask him even when under persecution, is only exposed to me. If the director did not have anything more to say that he should restrict his story to the real person.
