Five of the "Black Emanuelle" I have looked at it, possibly, the most striking line of interest in what you do with a brave female journalist looking at a lot of slavery / prostitution that takes him from San Francisco to Rome to Macao and returning to the city, New York! The film is the people of the series of series which, of course, are doing quite different tasks, namely Ivan Rassimov (visible here as the head of the UN committee for the Third World countries!), Karin Shubert (as an author of the opponent female) and Don Powell (as Rassimov player) <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, as usual with this type of film (in spite of night show), it has been greatly modified by a specific image location (translated "Stracultr) where the Asian slave trader gets to him for being sodomized and the dog is not available here! However, a sharp sequence at the end of the film when a stupid politician tries several girls (including casual, Gemser and Shubert) to the night of eight down the bridge of New York and a group of bums (this is the way to get their votes, get!) - and its top looking giddily people - it looks very pretty. <br /> <br>> The most ridiculous feature of entry this - away from Gems er's penchant cancel completely every time he enters into the house (even in front of the perfect visitors) - it's his journey to India to interrogate with charlatan / Guru (George Eastman has been looking very much like Christ!) Who has found a way to go long lasting; In fact, when Emanuelle has called upon him, he has to have an early spill ... !!
