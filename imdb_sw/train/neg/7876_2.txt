In the discussion of the panel I attended after watching this film, the film representatives said that one should watch this not as a film but it causes thought. Indeed, the only ideas that came from me were time to watch movies. Film films (style documentary, futuristic scenario) served as restrictions on what they thought to be a thought-provoking examination of the pregnancy. This film shows a problem when people are trying to use the film as a platform for their political views - usually the most exciting movie for the musicians.
