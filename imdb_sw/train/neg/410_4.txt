Unfortunately, one of the best attempts made in the area of ​​special effects have been done without any meaning to be set aside for a consolidation, confidentiality and useless image and inappropriate image, clichéd screenplay. Sneaky person is a very improper film. Usually everything that appears here happens to death - the characters, the idea and the order of action (especially the lifting point!) - with a special feature of the realistic film that has special impressive effects. However, it is only a special effect done regularly, and the end of the film that has been made to die too. I was hoping before checking the Hollow Man that the invisible landscape of the Man, which is not difficult to the original itself, will be the basis of something new and more interesting. This is not the case. Not long before the film turned out to be the most popular bloody bath and the crowd of unnecessary histrionics - the clichés hill is so fast that it attracts. Over all of this, Kevin Bacon has a very bad job and his cast is not quite a try. A good pole can be a symbol of Jerry Goldsmith that can be approved (but there is no competition for its best efforts), the most interesting use of warm images and special effects. I was tested to give this three-tenth film, but the effects of push the character of a Hollow Person to one point. <br /> <br /> 4/10
