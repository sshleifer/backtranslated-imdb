This movie is awesome. One of the worst movies I have ever seen. The story does not almost exist, the characters are full of discrimination and special-FX just make you laugh. The only amazing thing about this movie is the appearance of the Rapper Coolio visitors as some sort of police. <br /> <br /> If this film was supposed to be a comedy I didn't get quite sure. If you want to watch this film: please get a drink first and then prepare to laugh wellâ€¦ especially when the first FX-FX screen appears on the screen. But if you like rubbish for cheap films: this film is a must-see for you.
