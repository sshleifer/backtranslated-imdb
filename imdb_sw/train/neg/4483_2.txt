I will admit that I first loved, and I was looking for it. It was revealed. Certainly the special effects were really amazing - but they were not seen. It seemed more like a cartoon. Indeed, I agree to love 80% of the expulsion area - but to fight with Mr Smiths all? It was very clear to be alive. I can accept all of that. What I cannot admit is that the non-step parts were lost. Every time Morpheus opened his mouth, I knew I was in an ongoing speech with any sign. I was also disappointed with a little plot that was there. What this movie did tell us that there is no truth in the first movie (except on the existence of matrix). This movie was like seeing a part of DALLAS where you see that last season was a dream. Ugh! I want to back my $ 7.00!
