I have often liked it like the lowest gonzo budget films, but Darkman III is amazing to the amazement that I don't feel except for its contempt. It looks and feels like a TV show, and especially one shock at that. The set is small, flat lighting, logo and effects have emerged, and the camera function is a film of 101. There is no plot to talk, the characters are one direction, and the participants are asleep. Many of the cast look like they should make a basic base of porn .... In fact, the only reward I received from this mess was seeing an amazing player who was joined by Roxann Biggs-Dawson (B'Elanna from Star Trek: Voyager) without Klingon bumpy head makeup up. His skin tone is over two shades than it is on Voyager; either has been reduced to this role, or has been left for Voyager. A very strange way either.
