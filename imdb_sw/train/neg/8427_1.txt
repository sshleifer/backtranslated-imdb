Let me begin by saying how much I love the TV series. Despite the poor condition of a middle-aged man he seems to be unable to carry out his dreams because of his father, a brave, he had a bright and cheerful look to look. In my opinion, of course it is one of the UK blocks all the time. The TV series has a 10-digit 10 rate without reservation. This way of deleting the film on the other hand is a real tragedy for every word of the word. No doubt the essence of the TV festival has been successfully transferred to the film. This film has a dreary drop, which is a crack that was close to me with tears several times. See Harold being beaten in the pub (and not in a pleasant way) is not my idea of ​​comedy but it is definitely one reason why fans of TV series do not like this movie. The movie was unwantless unfunny except for the area where Albert climbs into the sink and is seen by the neighbor. <br /> <br /> Love between Harold and Zita is quite a tone and it makes me wonder if the producers of this movie has ever been horrible to watch a television series. In a television series, Harold has always tracked retired girls, not bandits. Albert's ears with words made against him and Harold's friends were very valuable in TV series. In the film, Albert says almost anything when the opportunity increases. Most of the UK sports films are not recommended, with the exception of the BUSES films (which in some respects were better than the TV series itself!). But, STEPTOE and SON should be the same under a bunch, even under GEORGE AND MILDRED. <br /> <br /> I advise you - skip this and see the second row, STEPTOE AND HIS SON instead. It has a lighter sound, it is more reliable for TV series, and in fact it is very funny.
