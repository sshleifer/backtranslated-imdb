Garland Beverly was born at the wrong time. He was an excellent actor before his time, bringing strength and grace even to what was formerly had the Corman film. In Gunslinger, he is the wife of the city sherry. He reduces, so he takes his job to follow his killers. He is much better than the material he makes with them, far away. The movie is gray, stilted, and especially boring. There is a humor (without pretending) and tracks everywhere, people run behind a single emerging building in front of another (I have felt on a false fronts, but this is ridiculous!), And a line of stupid plot line of a new Sheriff widow who loves the man hired to kill him. Even if she didn't love her husband, it was just something like a week or two since she died! And she finished shooting the guy the last guy, however. No luck with men, this. The piece of animal is another woman, the owner of the saloon. He intends to buy a group of land only if the road goes and makes him rich. His plan of action if not very good-he will steal much from the city as he can and skedaddle. Hell, he is the only one with his guns hired last city. What? You tell me these people have no weapons? Look at what happened in the Old West cities when the bank robbers came to steal the bank, then they were shot by the bullets and armed men. to talk and walk around, interspersed and out a few shot out. The latter is as bad as usual in Flick Corman, although thanking the goodness does not follow ethical values ​​at the end of which was in the world. Sheri turns his badge to Sam Bass and runs the sun, although the film was too gray that has never seen the sun.
