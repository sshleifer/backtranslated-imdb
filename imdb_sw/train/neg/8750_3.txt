Aldolpho (Steve Buscemi), a favorite filmmaker, lives in the NYC apartment beaten by his mother to help make a tax. He has a nice neighbor named Angelica (Jennifer Beals) who may or may not marry but Aldolpho would like to love stars in his movie. When Al unexpectedly gets a financial commitment to finance his film from a wonderful man named Joe, he thinks he's done it. That is, until Joe will take Al with an adventure to steal Porsche for part of financial support. What? Will the film take place before Aldolpho completely without a moral back? And, angelica stars in the film? This is, in view of the viewer, the awesome film. Script is bad, and the plot that wanders willy nilly. Sticks that use all of his line and Buscemi, though apparently, are nondescript. There is a good deal of characters and inappropriate boot material. Finally, the production values ​​are very poor, too, and make the film appear the second level at all times. If you have time in your hands, it is still a good idea to stay out of this movie. But, if you're a moral style, go ahead and look at the darn object. Bees look good, after all.
