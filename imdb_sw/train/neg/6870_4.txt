A positive film about Sonja Horowitz (Renée Zellweger), the wife of the ignorant Talmudi Mendel (Glenn Fitzgerald). who is very excited. Brother Mendel Sender (Christopher Eccleston) sees this and employs him to work in the field where he is already an expert? He also starts with him, and then he spends time with Puerto Rican artist, sends him to the family, which prevents him. There is a small part that Sonja's brother has spoken to, and it seems to take the situation of a woman who prayed spiritually, but why it is unknown. Much is unknown, unfortunately, including what is going on with Sonja, why he tells Rebbe there is a fire in it and maybe not from God, and what it means, and what a magician woman asks him. Significantly the story is faced with the problem of women in the ultra-Orthodox community, and Sonja is still not well. Nor is the idea of ​​being redeemed and the love of another race very well-thought out. The title comes from the biblical definition of a beautiful woman and is still a bastard Assistant who explains to Sonja. Zellweger faces a part; he should be a Jew from the middle of the west and sometimes his emphasis is flat, and sometimes it is taken on the sound of the character of Brooklyn. He is very good when tough and take charge, but finally the movie is a mess.
