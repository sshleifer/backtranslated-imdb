Time is worth. This movie is not. I must learn to ignore critics who love about a small film like Fargo and quite a waste of time. <br /> <br /> The Theater was closed and everyone left with the same response: What? Is this the film that the critics say? What a piece of skin! The hook of this film is the black daughter of black phone searching and finding her white family. Get it? <br /> <br /> Acting is good. <br /> <br /> Production (lighting, set, editing, sound) is about 2 steps on a 60-minute story. I scoffed at the fact that these people could not understand everything that was clear to the audience; The listeners were grumbling on the film screens that the characters should say next. <br /> <br /> I have been more happy to make a wash.
