I was happy when I saw ads for this film because I read it recently and I liked it very much. Movie, however, did not meet my expectations. After reading this book recently prepared me for a great deal often happens when stories are translated into movies. The characters did not seem to be identical to the book. The direction was weak. I had a hard time getting into the characters. There was no real relationship with the viewer on what was going on. The discussion did not adequately explain what is happening. It seemed just beaten with a run. All in all I had found heart and movie. I think if you haven't read the book, it can be the same as itself. At the very least, it can persuade you to read a book, which you might be enjoying most. <br /> <br />
