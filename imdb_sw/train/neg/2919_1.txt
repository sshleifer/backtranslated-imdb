Geez, as a Gay man who lives in NYC I can confidently say that I have never seen under Gay's culture which is shown in this film - and I enjoy it! What? This film was broadcast on television all over the United States and there will be a great revolutionary fight against Gay and I can't say that I would punish them. People in this film do not represent the average American Gay or even the American Trandgender average, what they do is represent bad and bad dreams. The inclusion of the less obvious characters is amazing and a clear racial sense (anti-white) is clear and inevitable - society cannot be blamed for people who have chosen drugs, unemployment and rejection of education for "cast" for the film - the actions of these people are not discouraging, but rather than rejecting anything similar to personal desires and a desire to do something outside of your soul.
