It is hard to say something that was the worst on this show: bad acting, poor acoustics of different parts, bad CGI, improper sets for time, poor script. It would be good if the script was following the original story very close - there is enough tension and materials containing Beowulf to provide a lot of good material, and the line of the best story, than the script writers can come. <Br /> <br /> And why would you set up a new new weapon like a rainbow riding the explosive bolts? I see that this film was made for just 21 days. It shows for lack of quality. I start thinking this is a common (poor) view of the Sci-Fi channel (and others) when it comes to making movies out of old stories in the last few years. !
