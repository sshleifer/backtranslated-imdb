It is not just an easy-to-play film that two psychos can catch a pregnant woman without breaking a sweat but it was a terrific 'Misery'. However, the main reason I made this film is low is because it has completely disgraced me. I am not a person who is easily prosecuted by those who are making films and have had the love of fear Flicks but this film went too far because of abuse and suffering only for earning points because of shock. I think most people, while looking at the first ten minutes of 'Hide and Search', will find themselves in the village.
