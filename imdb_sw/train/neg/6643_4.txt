Terminus Paradis was unique, but "Niki ardelean" comes late. We already have enough and we want something new. Older leaders should not have problems seeing more than their time, not back. Why do people see Romania as a future country? We are only born again, and no one gives s ** t again about old times. Most people who don't remember or need to remember, and a new generation of movie users don't know a bit. This should be the first day of the movie romania not the last song - priveghi! Perhaps small directors should move.
