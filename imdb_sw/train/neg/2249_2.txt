This is a great film disaster. From beginning to end, it is filled with bad leadership and the worst direction and editing. Only part of the film redemption is few with Streisand, because parts of Kristofferson are not possible to watch or listen. The main problem of this film is that we cannot see Kristofferson's behavior at its peak or streisand striving. The first should appear to decrease and the second increase. Streisand's last number - would be one of the biggest finals in the film, if it was directed and edited. One shot of his face for the time of the song was a big mistake. It had guns, listeners and broader shots of the action shown, this number would be powerful and interesting. This film should be directed and edited by leaving the NYU film school. Any worse thing is that the screen caused. The last number of music is the only part of the release of this film, and even that is completely complicated by the technical decisions.
