I saw that an inspector who passed away (who appears to be still in school) gave this movie a very good review and I can only assume that this is because the viewer has not seen more than the BBC's 1989 novels of this classic novel. The biggest problem I had with this version (1999) was to make Anthony Way like Tom Long. Anthony Way was a brave young man who shot in popularity after being seen in the "Choir" TV series. I can only assume that he was thrown to the role of Tom Long on the power of his best acting in "Choir". Unfortunately the little boy who appeared in the "Choir" had grown up in a toddler and stupid when "Tom's Midnight Garden" was hit and as if Anthony could not persuade him like Tom's schoolboy. It is far too far to believe that Tom (as played by Anthony) would be a friend of Hatty very little. In the 1989 edition of BBC Tom and Hatty are very close in age and development of their friendship is much more reliable. By the 1999 movie even special effects have failed to influence and not any improvements on the TV effects of 1989. Offering and acting on this version are inferior to the original revision and all in the movie was a lack of a true lusta version. If the last observation I will say that the VHS version of the 1989 version of the BBC is using more than £ 20.00 second hand when the new DVD version of this version can be purchased for less than £ 5.00, I need to say more?
