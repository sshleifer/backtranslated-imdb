One finds that his parents were part of a nuclear experiment in 50 years and that now he has the power of ... burst into the fire! <br /> <br /> I was organized for this film, what is to be directed by Toby Hooper's great and watching the wild card Brad Dourif. Unfortunately it was not on the average movie-power-violence-movie. Your combustion has a fascinating effect behind it, unfortunately it does not appear to live according to its ability and increases its time. Special effects are not bad though and help carry the film to the end. <br /> <br /> Sent not bad, Dourif does not steal the show. <br /> <br /> All around, there is no classic but not very bad kind. <br /> <br /> ** out of ****
