"Man In Attic" is a movie set in 1910. It is dominated by a true story. Unfortunately, it's a story that didn't need to be told. Watching the box, people involved in the filing of the film tried to make this film look bad and enough. They use the words as "bad luck", "prohibited", and "unlimited enjoyment". They even show a picture of Neil Patrick Harris (Doogie Howser limited, M.D.) a gun! This story involves Krista, played with Anne Archer. He is surprised by the owner who owns his own business. Edward (Harris) is her husband's company. Krista and Edward take love for each other. <br /> <br /> The part required to be "awesome" is this: Krista's husband gets information about it and stops them from seeing it again. So what do they decide to do? Krista ends up with Edward living on their house. Wow! Krista ends seeing someone else and Edward gets envious. And so on and so forth. <br /> <br /> "Someone In Attic" does not want any new district. It is an original picture of Showtime, which explains why the stars are the characters of the B list and all seem for a short time in the buff. <br /> <br />
