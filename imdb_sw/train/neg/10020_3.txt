Vijay Krishna Acharya's 'Tashan' is a top-hyped, stylized product. Certainly one of the most stylish films, but when it comes to content, even citizens will reject this. Why? Script's film is as amateur as a 2 year old child. Script is a king, without a good script even the general director of all time can do nothing. Tashan is produced by the most successful banner of 'Yash Raj Films' and Mega Stars that appear in it. But nothing in the world can save you if the script is bland. Buttons down! Exhibition: Anil Kapoor, is an old actress. But how could he work like this? Akshay Kumar is a good actor, in fact he is the only grace to save. Kareena Kapoor has never been seen to be very hot. He looks wonderful and leaves you, all stand. Saif Ali Khan has not received his payment here. Sanjay Mishra, Manoj Phawa and Yashpal Sharma are lost. Tashan is a stimulating film. Style failures in the box office, you should put off.
