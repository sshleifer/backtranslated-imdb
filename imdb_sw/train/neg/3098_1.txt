How Rick Sloane was allowed to make five movies is hard to believe than cold fusion. This film is completely criminal. Before I watched this film I thought Manos: The Hands of Hatma was the worst piece I saw, but at least Manos goes slowly and can sleep, and thus save your eyes from the pain that will be disturbed. The greatest tragedy of this movie is that an old man who puts Hobgoblins "closed" on makes it the last area. The time I spent watching this film was completely lost to my life.
