This film is just one of the average flick steps, but it would be much better. When guns emerge, they need some volunteer support. Someone like Andy McNabb - who made a series of positive steps in the Heat while removing the road from theft - would turn a series of bad moves into something special. Because the remaining film was good - predictable but will appear - better than you would expect from this type of film. Then came the last, show-down, what we were waiting for, but it was like looking at something from the A team in 80 years.
