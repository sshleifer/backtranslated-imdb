I've never seen the worst movie. It is possible to take a video shootem video and make it a good film. <br /> <br /> Bad 1: absolutely no relationship with any of the characters. In this film you do not have guarantees with any characters because ... you have no chance. <br /> <br /> The only character that is kind or even attractive is the hand of the deck: Salish as played by Clint Howard. Except for this particular character, the results of the movies will not be meaningful if all participants were not living since the beginning. <br /> <br /> Errors 2: The worst area of ​​the gun. I love gunfights. I love when heros opens on a bad house and a clean house. heck I even like to look at the bad house sometimes. But this gunfight was wonderful I think that the best way to describe is "Apathetic" I've got people shot with more emotion and feeling when playing VIDEOGAME. In this film it looks and feels like "takers" were walking through the shooting everything that moved without feeling. <br /> <br /> Why? Where does garbage talk? Where is the fury between the gun? These should be the children who did not get in the rave have gone bad ... but even the real soldiers are doing professional work and bravely demonstrate their humanity. If you want a GOOD movie of fear about a secret house filled with monsters, I recommend a series of Sam Rami. Don't see the disaster that is the house of the dead. I hope that they burn the master with all copies of this movie.
