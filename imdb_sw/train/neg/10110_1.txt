This movie was the worst film that I have ever seen in all my life. I'm not even giving birth. It was done well and the participants could not act. It was a waste of my time and money. It seemed like a film that my friends and I can put together alone. The movie's case comes is definitely hidden. Nothing in the movie looks like a zombie in front of the case. It seems that the director or artist pretends to put the eye of a black eye under certain eyes that calls them a zombie. Gift at the start of the movie takes about 20 minutes of the movie. Which check credit is the best part of the movie. This was a trustworthy movie and I couldn't believe how it was put together. Events emerged from one thing to another and sometimes as if "what is going on?" The sound was bad and the shots of action looked like a young player playing around to make an anti-fake area. <br /> <br /> If you think renting or buying this movie I would like to advise you at least looking at the trailer for it because it is shown how it really is. I wish I had checked before the lease.
