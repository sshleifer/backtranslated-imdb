For some reason, many young couples who are walking through the Italian Alps are divided to see who can reach their first camping names. James (Gregory Lee Kenyon) enters the cave, finds the ancient skeleton of the demonic gladiator and retains the spirit of "Tyranus" while wearing a dead hat. It then uses all the films that run around the hunting forests under his friends and sprinkle their feet in order to increase the damage to the "Demonicus" damage. This month's monthly release is stupid, useless, has a bad acting and voice and (Los) Angeles National Forest is a poor alternative to Italy. However, it is very good for the most unusual thanks to laugh at a very high level of leading movements. If it is a bug that walks near a cheap weapon that uses a sword or a fight against modern Latin religion on demons and resurrection, the Kenyon's facial expressions and the provision of an unnecessary line must appear reliable. Oh well, at least he is not boring as many of the cast.
