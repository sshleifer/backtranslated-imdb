HOME was, uh, interesting. Certainly not to kill me at an hour and a half, but it didn't interest me either. A group of children is taken on the road and musclehead muscles (in an area that has a slightly attractive head of a film that stimulates sound effects) and is taken into a concept house in the suburbs. Here Dk Divine and his team are making brain transmission to its former rich patients so they can have a few bodies again. Hey, this was quietly and a big budget a few years later as FREEJACK! Who knew that when you climb the brain of an old man in a different body that their new voices appear similar to their old sounds? For all of these pineal glands and the use of green-green serum, you can almost see a vision from BEYOND and RE-ANIMATOR to play on producers' heads. But the actual production has no guts to pull. I have never understood why, when someone makes a terrible film of the low budget, that is not found on the edge of the shape and the year. Acting is very safe, and only good performance from Clarke Lindsley as assistant Dr. Price. She has a good good laugh. Any other thing to remember about the HOUSE is that it has many older people who do their own stunts. To a large extent, most of the cast takes great terraces to the ancient people.
