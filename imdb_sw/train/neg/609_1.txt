This was the worst movie. Do not be included by Christopher Walken or Michael Ironside. Both are chief executives, but this should only be their worst place in history. Even their great acting could not redeem this storyline of the film. This movie is an early piece of the nineties of America. The most spectacular events were when Columbian rebels were on trial. Maria Conchita Alonso appeared blurred, and her love and pseudo and Walken was nothing but emotionally overdose in a movie that had no real meaning. I am disappointed that there is a movie like this, destroying the actor as the name of Christopher Walken. I could hardly stay that way.
