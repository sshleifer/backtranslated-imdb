Worse of De Niro Scorsese collaborate in this horrible mess of severe violence. Scorsese is far from its feature in this film and panic sings the sound of a sudden voice and blows the door of the scream which seems to be interesting and embarrassing from such a master professional. Absolutely thrown here and the southern accents are very angry and forced. Nick Noltie has a strong lawyer in history who would ever believe he can defend anyone! De Niro's physiological Bowden is nothing more than psychologists of the 90s. One of my awesome experiences of the film. The original tax is 100 times better. <br /> <br />
