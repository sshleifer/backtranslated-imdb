I looked for a video shop everywhere to get this film, to be a great fan of elvis that I am, and I've had a great desire. Kurt Russel was more than a "elvis step" down and copying the sound was very good, but the sound of singing of the elvis just didnt work for me. The sound was not the same as a sharp mouth, and it was difficult for me to get lost in the conspiracy because it had trouble for it was visible. Also, there was a lot of variation in the film, people who don't know a lot about elvis will probably think it is true. The songs sung by him earlier than he recorded them in real life, when he got his first guitar is wrong, im pretty sure his jerse brother garron was buried in an unknown tomb, not one for a great headstone to read JESSE GARRON. I know it was just a movie tv, but skipped on important events, like coming-back-specific, and dragged some events for a very long way. if you want to see a good film that shows an elvis in its principal tax that is not recommended way, or another elvis festival. hearing and seeing the actual view of elvis is the only way to see good talent. (A brilliant statement I know, but still ... go out and rent a good elvis flic.)
