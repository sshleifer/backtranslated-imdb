I had great hope for this film because I loved it very much. It seems that Disney, however, tries to pass the full art of sequels directly to DVD. They deserve razzie. Several, in fact. I thought the idea had a reputation, but the music was very bad and the story wasn't much better. What happened to Disney's great music with their films. Mary Poppins, Aladdin, Beauty and Beast, King of Lion ... even Hercules and Hunchback of Notre Dame. They have made the most beautiful movies over the years that are so sad that they have declined to the point of making rows that are not even suitable in the movie. <br /> <br /> I hope this film is not a sign of things coming to Walt Disney Corporation.
