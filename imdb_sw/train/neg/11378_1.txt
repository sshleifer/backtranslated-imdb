Dudes on the MST3K should see this movie dog. It's basically about dopey actor hack in Hollywood who can't create any gigs of acting. And she has this wonderful obsession with Driver Movie Driver. What does dumb actor do? She puts her hair blonde and starts acting like L.A. The dude surfer in the hope of this ignorance will make him do the roles. You will laugh at the top of the most amazing movies of this movie. As when the actress's dude's heart is a broken heart and cry and say like, "How can you do it to me?" And why does he cry? Cos she wore her blonde hair and became a dude surfer to get acting gigs. This movie does not mean in ALL! The actors who played the governor on Benson are also in this also and has won the right politics of modern wing and dumb's funny conversation. This film will succeed, believe me. You say to me?
