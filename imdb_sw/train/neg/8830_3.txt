Just a lot of holes in this movie will be enjoyable and do all the amazing work around Hollywood-like end up that is completely out of context with all the movie (this is not a spoiler if you never guess how to end!). You will also need to have thin skin for all low political types. The clashes between whites and blacks were very common with one side. I did not understand why the author had a local black community doing in an unacceptable manner, does he try to be a racist? <br /> <br /> The real movie of bizare. Just look if you would like to be very angry with holes in the plot and would like to discuss everything that might or could not have happened. But on the positive side of copying and working is the best.
