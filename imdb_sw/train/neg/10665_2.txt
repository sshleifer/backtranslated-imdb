About three minutes in this case I started to move quickly, just stopping during the dirt (why is that bad movies always include the best women?). In ten minutes I happened, and I wanted to get my money from the rental store. People who write these movies should be approved by MPAA. Coming to the authors - bad people always get into the car with a bomb activated by a good remote control! This is what happened since the days of the Ottoman Empire! Also, to add insult to hurt, the "misleading" end was so formulaic, which would come from any movie action written in the past 25 years. Burt Reynolds was good, but should focus on the real film. <br /> <br /> This game is a waste of time - Run! Run!
