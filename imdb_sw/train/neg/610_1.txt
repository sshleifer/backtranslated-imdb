I bought this film cheaply on sale, after reading back to the DVD trial and assumed that any way I could lose, if it was garbage then no loss, if it was good then let the business ... <br /> <br /> Then I looked at it ... <br /> <br /> I am usually a fan of Christopher Walken, but in this film he ordered the presence of very little screens, seemingly not doing the whole job, even the death of his friend close to the beginning that triggers " The action "in conspiracy seems to stop him a bit, and retaliation for him is always boring and despising. <br /> <br /> Usually a movie with a grand theme like a revolution and revenge is the ability to capture the audience and catch them in the sense of something to the characters, however watching this film saw more like seeing a series of confusion, and almost random events which freely bound together to its end conclusion ... <br>> <br /> At this point I cried ... <br /> <br /> I thought this film was a very sad part of what I saw. where fighters sacrifice themselves by refusing to jump out of a truck being transported because of wanting to kill any civilians not so much depressed as it is not terrible and bitter, though it is not as bad as emergency surgery for an injured girl. Acting was bad all around, the script and the story was weak, "action" was weak even, and "illustrations" were not quite clear. In summary, there are films that are good, bad films, films that are very bad are good, horrible films ... <br /> <br /> And with a whole new level is "McBain"
