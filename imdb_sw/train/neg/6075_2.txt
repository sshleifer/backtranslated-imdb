One of the worst movies I have ever seen with Robert De Niro, a partner is an idle picture of exercise in the slasher flicks. Tries to blow or mislead the forms and lines of the preposterous plot of the favorite fan turned out psychotic - the film's film became something. (spoiler) Should we believe that the idiot of a ignorant knife can kill a football player in an attractive hotel without evidence, security, or camera? The film does not mean trying to touch our heart through a baseball cap that ends exciting and exciting. Sure that all actors thought when they climbed this razzie. This is great as they arrive. Stay away as you prefer to think in your movies
