This was not fun to watch. Frank puts all his dreams on the burn back and does a normal job (boring!). The filmmaker should write the camera and just shoot, not to run and comment for snide details. The anger and hatred of the filmmaker for the father of the father is obvious. And sad. The goal seems to be to make Frank appear to be dumb and pathetic, instead it comes as a human more than 3 featured people. <br /> <br /> In fact the campaign smear all dressed up as something more beautiful and edgier than it really is. It has left me with severe hatred for the film manufacturer.
