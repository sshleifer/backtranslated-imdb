Anyone who made this film should have done as a joke. I mean, this was the stupidest movie I think I've ever seen! Snowman murderer scares a small town? Give me a break. Love him when he takes a car. More like a comedy than a horror movie. If you want to laugh, lease this. If you want a movie of fear, continue to hell away from this!
