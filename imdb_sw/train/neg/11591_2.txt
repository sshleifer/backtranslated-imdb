This film is so bad, that I almost heard the patient looking at it. Up to this point, the other phase has had one good thing about it. Part 1 was to insist on itself. Part 2 was removed and beaten. Part 3 was interesting and serious effects. Part 4 had a good music, very good effect, and a new entertainment Freddy Krueger. Section 5 is more boring than anything I have ever seen. Alice, very blond, from Part 4 is back with her partner Dan. In this section, it is alleged that Elm Street installment becomes a detergent daylight. New characters seem to be rough, and even the beautiful Alice has a nose on her shoulder. Freddy seems to be far from this. She looks tired, and doesn't seem to be bad. Its two pieces look out of place and different, where as in Section 4 they can be very good. Leslie's story Bohem is not quite available and Stephen Hopkins's leadership is very serious, and makes my grandmother look so good! All movies of this movie are ridiculous and untrue. It is also a mess and a good fool. Avoid Part 5 at all costs!
