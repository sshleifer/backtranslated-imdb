I saw recently with my wife and I found it better than Caine believes, although it is not very coping. The main actor of the UK screen that has never been seen is the intention of this role, which is kind if he could raise it with more faith in his play. Rex Harrison looks even less problematic, perhaps not surprising, if his behavior was not written much. William Holden is the best, but his screen time is short and longer, his behavior is not good enough. Beverly Johnson is a beautiful woman as I have ever seen, but has been given very little to do, the film may have found a great deal to focus on her story. Ustinov steals the show, but essentially playing the character of the comic completely out of the set and loud sounds of the sound. Music is poor and Omar Sharif makes one of its most useless things (his work has been based on this for decades). Richard Fleischer should be harassed for the lack of efficiency, he was a film director who cannot be predicted, and this is one of his weak movies.
