Gayniggers from the outer space are pretty summed up with his name. Running just 27 minutes for a long time, it explains the role of the white whites who come to the world to redeem men from women. When I see the little importance to the plot, it is also really worthless. In fact, it means that the comedy / spoof in society and science fiction. I found myself laughing several times, so it worked out there. <br /> <br /> Special effects are awesome. When the line around the Earth, you see the stars concentrate on no apparent reason. The asteroids shown at the beginning seem fake, shipping equipment is useless, there are several misspellings in the literature, artists do not know, the characters are broken; In general, the whole thing does not take itself. If you pass all the features that make it bad movies, it is very available and easy to see until the end. Other parts are hilarious. But in general, the only thing you have to remember is that it was one of the many concepts of ignorance forever. Because its short film and has good things, it's not the worst thing to see. But its useless and has a little long value. I can't totally recommend it; if you look at it, do so with a unique concept, not quality.
