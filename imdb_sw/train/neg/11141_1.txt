Man, this movie struck a lot of time! I couldn't even see something of a hole (my daughter did though). The worst actors, the worst of the worst computer screens (woman for waswolf), wonderful places, the list continues to continue. What? Don't know whether it's me alone or does this film remind you of porn movie? And it's not the meaning of all the ladys of naked ... It's something about light or something ... This may be perhaps just a classic because of the bad acting and all naked women, but not because the original movie white good twist plot. My last words are: Don't see it! Not suitable time. If you want to see it because naked there is much better to see!
