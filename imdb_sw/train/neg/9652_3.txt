The film has been written 10 years ago and a different director was preparing with SRK and Aamir in leadership roles. It was now done by Vipul Shah leading by Ajay and Salman playing together after ten years HUM DIL DE CHUKE SANAM (1999) <br /> <br /> However, the movie is decreasing because of the 90 care and worst. <br /> <br /> The movie tries to pack it in many business links and we also don't have a love triangle / / <br /> Everything is predictable and films and also screens! like how Ajay runs from London Airport and does it without someone? even the way he starts his band is not to influence the second half gets better and deviates from the story of Ajay destroying Salman but sadly the top falls and the film approaches bad note <br /> The direction of Vipul Shah is usually less than average Music is the worst stage, Many songs are mediocre <br /> <br /> Out of the Ajay characters offers his best shot though he doesn't know as a rock singer but he is as good as a negative Salman role yet irritating and punching her and talking meaningless she attracts just when she gets The medication and so Asin is not just a big piece of Ranvijay show should remain with MTV Om Puri is the same
