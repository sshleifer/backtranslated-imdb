I bought this condition because I enjoyed Anne BrontÃ«'s novel when I read it some time ago and usually enjoy the BBC dramas. But I am very disappointed, I never thought it would be so bad: the whole series made me laugh more than emphasizing me as a novel was. First of all, music (and songs) appears quite in the game period (it looks like written for a modern awesome movie) and as another advertiser, I was particularly angry with the camera-hit cameras. around the actors. I have seen certain scenes have been done that way in the "North and South" and it seemed to be the same there but in the layout, it is definitely interfering with just spontaneous. The camera movement cannot work on the woodwork. Many other tasks were difficult to distinguish the first time and the script was not explained. There are no preliminary characters at the first time. The little boy gave a very good performance, he was very good and the best feature of the film. Tara Fitzgerald's Thumbs of Helen Graham's reputation made her seem cool and tough, letting no feelings pass. He doesn't seem to cry at all in a real way. I could not just believe Markham could fall down and not mention the very bad hair given to him. I could not help to sympathize with her husband! Fancy to be married and such a valentine ... Besides, she was the only main actor that seems right to me. Toby Stephens have found that right, Helen Graham's family is not very good. It is probably difficult to deal with the novel that deals with subjects such as alcoholism and violence. Besides, what is only known and left for the reader's mind in the book sits up and focuses on the television comparison: doing some of the major events and comic, (like Huntingdon's eye starts bleeding) and others are also intercourse The festival period! I mean, can't we find enough matches in modern sports?
