Before I go I agree to be a big fan of Bon Jovi. This is certainly the one that attracted me to the DVD's first place. I probably would have bought it to be a great fan of fear and have the first reputation of the most vampires. But this is not a good half. Even Jon could save this film to me. My main problem is that it's not just terrible. In addition to the character of Jon Derek Bliss no other characters make sense and you will not have to worry less if they die or not, especially the woman addict vampire / drug woman. Vampire's female is not just awesome or sexy. Instead it looks like a 14-year-old anorexic girl, it is not surprising she has a desire for blood then. Another big problem is that everything is "very bright". There is no state or condition of fear. I know the first Vampires set up in New Mexico was not exactly the twilight area for the issue of scarcity but still managed to become dark and anticipated when needed to be. This film has no such tension. <br /> <br /> Stories are the same as before. Vampire wants a Berzier cross to walk in the afternoon. However the story has less cool bits at this time. There is no reason to know this is the master of all the master - the original vampire, as in the first film. Surely you don't care who or what this is. No host of masters. Rather he hides in the old destruction that is more evident as the Disneyland attraction then the tempered temple. That is the truth. Lack of horror, lack of atmosphere, lack of interesting stories. The truth lets me personally.
