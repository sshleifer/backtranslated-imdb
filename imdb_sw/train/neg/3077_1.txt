Hobgoblins ... what a concept. Rick Sloan was a master with this film. He had the beauty of producing film and actors who could not act. On top of that, he chose to write a script according to some sort of bad acids that went wrong. Put together, you end up with a film that takes more than a full of suction cups and vaccines. This movie was very painful. The pain caused is the same as the pain caused by having your joints covered with a spoon, and then with all the wound covered with salt and hydrocarbons.
