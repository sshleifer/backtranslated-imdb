A brief review but ... <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs, a comprehensive waste of 90mins. At the end of the film I was not as wise as what happened. It's full of cameos (Stephen Fry (3mins), Jack Dee (30 seconds), girls of "Philadelphia" and some unknown people but have no meaning. br>> Set the DVD instead or relax and relax! <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10 (for cameos and Morris small drive chase)
