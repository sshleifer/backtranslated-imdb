Oh, my gosh ... I thought that CBS shows the first television programs are <br /> <br /> bad things Gerald McRaney appeared in ... br /> <br /> computer. That is, don't borrow it. <br /> <br /> I saw this under one of his names— “Gray Problems,” and <br /> <br /> maybe one of the worst films of recent memory. Others <br /> <br /> reviews are the same, are bad. Do not have too many setup restrictions to set up on the screen, NEAR. Sent is bad, direction <br /> <br /> is bad, and the script is bad. I can't stress how this is bad. Avoid as much as you can. <br /> <br /> This has been tested (PG) for physical abuse, other gun violence, lighter, slow, and other adult situations
