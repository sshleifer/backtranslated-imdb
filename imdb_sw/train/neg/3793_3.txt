Nutcracker has always been a ballet problem. It brings a small story of the original ETA Hoffman story which is installed. <br /> In the ballet, the story is much higher and the second half when Clara (or Marie in this version) goes to the Kingdom of Candy to watch a series of character dance. <br /> <br /> There are different types of action that translate the story in many ways (not always successfully) to pay for free ballet free. <br /> <br /> The Balanchine version has no meaning for the game or story at all (despite the fact that there is an interaction with the secrets of the first Tchaikovsky first music). The result is the first Christmas party to forget where there is nothing that happens and where to play (a little where there is) is not particularly memorable. <br /> <br /> Work on the top pantomime, especially the Drosselmeier, which can seem to be stepped on the step, looks just silly hit with big screens. Unfortunately, things are not much better when we get to the Kingdom of Sweets (Act II in action version). Although there are important factors of choreographic, most of the choreography are bland and uninspiring. Certainly not Balanchine crop crops. Balanchine looks very much like a master of the abstract dance, but I've always heard that it was not a successful success as the creator of the story ballets. Watching this version of the production of the Nutcracker stage has just confirmed these comments.
