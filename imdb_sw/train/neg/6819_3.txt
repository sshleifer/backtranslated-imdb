in this film, joe pesci slams basketball dunks. joe pesci ... <br /> <br /> and be consistent, all script cannot be trusted. <br /> <br /> pesci is a good man, who saves this film by sinking the back of the cellar, but other tasks were too bad. The father was a greedy businessman who valued more money than people, which did not play well. instead of that person being the archetypal village, it appeared as a android amoram planned to make money at all costs. then there is a feature set for a pesci like a girl or something ... I even remember ... she was that forget. Anyone who has this 5 or 6 movie movie is a member of a particular type of film studio trying to create the features of this movie, or at least one of these millions of journalists who are they can't ring for efficiency (you know, people who feel like they give anything under 6). <br /> <br /> stay away ... off. and embarrassed on the middle of the comedy, where I saw this film. often takes the best.
