This is one of the worst written movies I've ever lived. <br /> <br /> Stories are not something new - but it's a cartoon, so who cares, as long as it's nice and fun? I'm going to go deep like a character, or I'll be here every day (except that there is nothing; characters change personality at any time it's easy for a conspiracy.), But anyone who wrote the script and the direction of the view should be blocked access to pencils and paper. Slots down? I would like to beat his fingers off. "Go into the object / prop. Repeat on the next character. Characteristic gives insight to know, which listeners cannot even understand away. Repeat several times, with different items / props." > <br /> "Do the characters don't care about all the edge of the rock around them, speaking, generally destroying them everywhere, and that can kill them at any time - but stop them and be afraid when they see a green rock, near the soil." is a long series of events, actions, and behaviors that are just there for the ease of the author, forget him to think or strive to write a good story. <br /> <br /> Are you gracious: use your cartoon budget on Pixar movies.
