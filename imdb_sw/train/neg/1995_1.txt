Well I paid only a dollar for this movie, and it didn't deserve it yet. It seems to be from small printing and is in the public domain, I think. Neagle - despite his glory, rewards, and praise - is a sensible UK player who cannot sing or play or act. Some of the former characters of Hollywood behavior were shown here should be thought they were doing classic. Herbert Wilcox (husband of Neagle) always thought Anna was an exciting and talented woman on the screen. He was wrong. He was very popular in the UK before and after WWII. His "serious" responsibilities are much worse than his appearance to music here. <br /> <br /> Only the most popular songs included with no one released properly. Skip this one and find one that star Doris Day. At least finds the real comedy and play in a professional style!
