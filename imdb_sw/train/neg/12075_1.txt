This pastor made for one of the most amazing MST3000 sessions ever. I'm not a fan of shakespear, but I don't believe he has ever done his job to slow this and foam. It is also one of the most difficult movies to find because there are many Hamlets listed. As I said though this is completely boring. It is black and white, pacing is slow, and there is a beautiful environment. All vendors are also called to help. This is 3000 MST which I can look at one set because the boy's way to play Hamlet says his lines can put anyone sleeping.
