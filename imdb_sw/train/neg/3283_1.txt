Surely we all love the daisy heads, but what is being hit by this. Let's start, Jessica Simpson like Daisy, there is not one thing about this girl and Daisy didn't worry! Brother Jesse was probably very close to nature. There is no Burt fault, but I've never seen Boss HOg very long. That was part of the humor of the Boss Hog was its size. What? They even tried someone like Danny Devito ?! Okay, now get this voted Jessica Simpson made anyone look at her husband? She agrees with Luke Duke in tee !!!!!! Cleary these manufacturers did not look at the appearance of former members of the cast. Screenshots were not available for leaders! This has caused the movie from the beginning. I give this to my fingers down.
