1 looked 5/26/2002 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Michael Almereyda): A wonderful story about a druid wizard who tries to capture forever by inherited the body of his grandson. At least I think that was a connection. The quality of the best quality takes place in this film is not different from Shining Stephen King. The difference is that there was stability in the performance of Nicholson which is not entirely in this film. All of these are taken to the point until the end of time when some of the limbs and attempts to overcome feelings do not work at all. Displays are not a problem here, but the story is. Everything does not seem to come together very well and the viewer is left with many pieces of information and no real understanding of what happened in the film. There is very little performance for Christopher Walken as a grandson of granddaughter who, of course, gives him a high bills in an attempt to sell the film. Don't sell it to this gimmick and avoid this film. <br /> <br />
