This is one of those issues I can relate to most of the people if I like the noise and do not know how those in the big cities, New York especially how people get sleep even! It is amazing that people can stand out there in these days. The basic film program is that it makes an interesting topic. It's so bad that it's about it. Tim Robbbins is a respect though except for two events (particularly with a full supermodel watching Margarita Leiveva) was not found to be quite there. My greatest hope for this film is that the agents of stealing will see a wonderful and talented actress, Margarita Levieva. She does not have much to do, but she is a good supermodel. Even when they try to make him look at another girl around. It makes me sad that there are people like Paris Hilton & Kim Kardashian in the world w / no talent or talent that can be excluded, becoming more popular and successful than this talented beauty. I don't care a lot of this film because the script is not very good, but I'm happy to see new talents. I hope that manufacturers and directors think about Margarita when they need a good new actor to be in a big budget film. If they can make the star of Megan Fox (c'mon he is not hot, and "legitimate" it is worse than made for TV show Disney channel) from the film 1, it should happen to him easily, as he is good and has talent! I would like to recommend changing his last name so we can pronounce it and make it more. Here is this hope it does its job, & if there is any right it can emerge on a big summer movie or two in the next few years.
