About half, I realized I didn't care about these characters for at least; however, I looked a little bit more. Sadly, I came back the next day and finished. I should not worry. <br /> <br /> If you know * anything * about the film before, you know that the leading character will win the plane crash - and the head gives you a good idea of ​​what might happen next - he will be able to get a call and call people about it! That was almost as bad as the "Snake on the Birds" (another terrible epidemic of the atmosphere). I found that this is an old film, and the style of making those days was less natural than today. But even with these standards, acting was a shame. These were not characters, they were witnesses. I think this movie was, beyond anything, the attempt of Bette Davis to help her husband's work (Gary Merrill). However, it is not appropriate - I have seen an oak tree that expresses more feeling than he did. Davis' with a happy disability (that is, an unpleasant role) may have been seen as a mixed and bold move to work. It was not. It was just boring. He was a kind of Tiny Tim in the film, and made Trask (characteristic of Merrill) to see the truth about love and forgiveness (though he was less attractive than Tiny Tim), calmly gives wisdom about life and relationships without feeling that his beloved husband was just died. The last part, where Trask has called his wife in Iowa to reconcile, had been severely affected by the end of the phone line, I was almost beaten. I had to remind myself that these people have been paid for what they did in this film. I realized many people seem to enjoy this film. If you've got a lift, that's good. But in fact, I found it wrong. There are a lot of old movies from the Golden Age of Hollywood that are well written and done.
