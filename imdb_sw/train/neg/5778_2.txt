Indeed, so I've died to see this film. He stood on, "who is" in the terrible world in the film .... well, my friend rented this, inserted it, and we started to look at it. It should be comedy .... I had no smirk even ONCE, until 40min <br /> <br /> Is it related to the budget? Not quite, in fact, there are films out there that have a cost around the political situation, and it is wonderful (to me anyways). Also, when watching this film, I could not help but identify identities (ie, FULL) on the under-indie budget indie called "ACTRESS APOCALYPSE", read my comments on it (it opens this BTW film) > This film ... was a real possibility. It had a "star power", a stolen plot (allows films behind the scenes of film ... IE ... "ACTRESS APOCALYPSE" .... for weight, this adds me more and more I think about), ... really can be funny. LOT, LOT of joke falls flat. Acting is the same for what it is. But it was asked about, it was not surprising, and the plot was completely stolen. I do give these two, because it was not SOOO AWFUL, but that's the only reason.
