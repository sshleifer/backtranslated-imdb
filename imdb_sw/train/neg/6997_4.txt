I mean, I know God is working in mysterious ways, but to help thieves and murderers and prostitutes find deliverance, forgiveness and change of heart in the area of ​​God caused .... In any case it is difficult to see the movie. Whatever Gable had a way of charm does not exist in this self-self-image, Crawford is as pleasant as she was to me, not quite, and the whole look of the film makes it seem like it was made 10 years before. "Stagecoach" and "Mr. Actions to Go to the City", this seems before historical.
