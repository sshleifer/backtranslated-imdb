To be a great fan of the "other" film of the APES film, I took this DVD in spite of the opposition to me everything Tim Burton. Once again, he cannot fail to despair and his improper attitude. Even the fibers of the threads seem to be the second level, which has not been so focused on the bad budget of this monstrosity. Mark Wahlberg confirms once and for all that it is not an actor (like BOOGIE NIGHTS was not enough evidence). I was ashamed of real talent like Tim Roth and Helena Bonham Carter. Of course their rewards encouraged them since it is impossible to have a planned screen. I lost this DVD for a $ 1 special night and I still feel broke.
