If you can imagine Mickey Mouse as a New York street pimple, or John Wayne as a spy for the Communist, then you can believe Pat Boone as a child of a grandson losing his uncle's field in Kentucky and you can enjoy this film. <br /> <br> This film is very stupid that has never been even in the mid-50 years of sexual love. And the problem is that Hollywood made a big deal about the refusal of Pat Boone kissing a woman is not his wife on the screen before being released that the audience knows she did not kiss Shirley Jones so you can't create any desire to "complete the screen" of their love. It's kind of looking west which cowboys don't have a gun. <br /> <br /> Story is useless. Even the title of the head sings and the passion caused. The love of April is in the worst part of the business film with Ishtar and Program 9 from outside space.
