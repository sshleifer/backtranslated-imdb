Most of the book changes are bad but this film has come from the most important parts of the story and notes the details and other characters. They repeated stories and stories and changed the order. They added things that are not in the book and never will happen. If I had not read a book before it would have been a very rare film, it did not give you a service about the characters, like them or dislike them. It turns the characters into jokes. <br /> <br /> Angry. Ridiculous. It is worth two hours of my life.
