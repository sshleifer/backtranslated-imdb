and Dane Youssef Group of strokes. Complete plan. It all goes wrong. They are in trouble. Police are out. They are locked up. What? What will they do now? <br /> <br /> Sound known? <br /> <br /> Movie looks like trying to be a mix of acting workshops, "indie" film and theater. It is a kind of thing that the actors like - it's kind of a seminar or play because it involves a lot of attention to the actors who work ... when, when, afraid, talking, planning, planning - giving many artists free free of course even all. <br /> <br /> Lead the trioks, one leader, one goon, one brother, comes with a great plan of redemption. and monkey rice is thrown into work. On objects, there is a bit of "fender-bender" and one of the crooks dropped through the back of the windshield. <br /> <br /> Anime is on their tail and they fall into a bar called poetically (and leadenly) "End of the Dino." <br /> <br /> Spacey, as a director, tries to focus on the performers' performances and delivery of dialouge. He gives us a red cigarette-red ad of smoking and smoldering Bogart. And he sets the violence away, in fact. <br /> <br /> I think it was a mistake. Considering the incidents of violence and brutality would have given a particular film. <br /> <br /> The problem with the movie is that it goes very slowly and facing miscasting almost every role. Matt Dillon ("Drugstore Drugstore Cowboy" and "Wild Things") seems to be very limited and also idealistic to be the leader of this gang. Gary Sinese seems to be deep and deep in thought that tag-spineless- with these boys and Joe Mantaga is effective as a traditional dog evil dog dog system that thumbs all, but it's not given anything to do here. William Fischter is the only actor who is trusted in his role as an unconscious pastor who wants to shed blood. <br /> And the strokes are a bad situation where they may go to jail or try to think of some way. <br /> <br /> Spacey has no ability to create a lot of tension and continuous. The characters are talking away, trying to think of the plan ... and they are calm and also citing. There is also a place where the whistles play the pool with a large force of armed soldiers right out, ready to blow. At one time, one of the strokes calls even the police who have right out of the bar. Oh brother. O worried. These merchants are going to beat them off or go to arrest them. Are not holed holes should be less fearful, not less worried? At the same time, the real step of the truth comes in. A man blows a gun, a baseball gun, which leads to evil fighting off the screens and there are other injuries being done that ... well, kinda sad. But ... ...... Faye Dunaway also had to spend a lot of time with the language coach, to improve his emphasis on New Orleans. Skeet Ullrich is good in small parts. <br /> <br /> A trainer who hears the packet of the match for the worst time is looking good. And so it is a place where one goes through the back winds. <br /> <br /> Dialouge tries to go through David Mamet and it's bad, but it's not really true or wise. <br /> <br /> The movie feels like a lot of what is actually ... the bottom-budget movie and the actor behind the camera for the first time to lead other actors from the script which "is not bad, but it needs to rewrite it. " Spacey shows that it is not a shock director, but does not feel the kind of feel "to create a film" and feels like he's just film actors. but they all feel out of place. As I said earlier, the movie is facing miscasting. I don't mean that bad actors were thrown. I think they just got to give us justice, but they put them in all the evil roles. I think changing some of the tasks would have been very helpful. After a former match player Joe Mantagna played a packet leader, Gary Sinese as a police officer out of his cows to give his troops orders, put Fischter in his "part" of blood ‚Äùand Matt Dillion as a sacrificial lamb. That would have a great improvement. <br /> <br /> When other executives direct, it works. They can even win Oscars for it. But most of the time, when direct actors, they have a tendency to just look at the displays. Just shoot working executives. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it works ... but they need to show good to it. The solution for it. Transition status is very similar in real life as the story of normal age is so common that movies about them will come out from A to point B and there are too many true things in the form this. 'Spacey himself appeared in such a film about hostage: "Identity." This is definitely not a tribal ritual, leaving only one of the 100 AFI. However, it has a short time with a personal touch, but at the end, it's forgetting once with a kind of film that could play well on a normal TV. It's not just worth going out of your way to see. <br /> <br /> I give 3 out of 10. <br /> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> Spacey leadership credit, "Beyond the Sea" seemed to be the best effort. Hmmm ... maybe it's true. You need to fail before you succeed. Dane Youssef
