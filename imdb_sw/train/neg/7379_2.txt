What did Steven Seagal think? I mean first I love Seagal. I love all his movies until mid-2000. His early things are some of the best in kind. This however does not live up to its best name. The Army Attack (with the protagonist Marshall Lawson {Seagal}) would be expected to be an unreasonable movie of action and Seagal in the form of a typical pipe of the donkey blow. However, what we find is the secret of crime, bordering on political excitement and little or no. Seagal is always shadows because of its weight. I couldn't follow this story. There are people who use superhumans when they are taking medicine. What happened in this film. Great for Seagal is shy, shambles and shy. Why tell that person? The story is awesome. This got 2/10 from me because of the area where Seagal is asking for safety despite having an army with him, and a very fighting area that seagal closes his hands like a girl facing the camera! "Revenge is two way street" seagal says in this movie ... well forget to take revenge Steven, you need a redemption!
