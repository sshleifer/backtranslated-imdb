I had to listen. I warned, and yet, I paid the money for this, after reading all the comments, after knowing the nature is "very bad is good", and that part 2 is not recommended in that category completely, yet, however, I could not resist. Exactly what happened here? One part was Hilarious, with many political mistakes, and other Crazy, Fat Entertainment, and this, here could not be worse than the green earth of God, not the 2nd Basket, hell, even Troll 2. This is the only thing The worst in history and that says something about the destruction of the land, under the characteristics of the original barrel. The section of the crime section was simply a completely different brand of bad. Shot on the Video, zero score, the value of zero entertainment, 1/3 has preliminary barriers, and above all, mad, Ethel oil has lost part of his wife. I mean, honestly, is this kind of sick joke? Thank you very much, Nick Milliard. 1/1
