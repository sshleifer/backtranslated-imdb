BACKGROUND! ! ! For the soul I do not understand why Pete did not save the life of Williams, I mean that it would be good to know why William was mobilized, or forced. clear, well known. If this film is not sponsored, it creates old but used restrictions, the average act - it's just things in this film, just by keeping you waiting for the last time. I wonder how producers (eg Michael Douglas) left this film on movies.
