Bloodsucker Leads Dancing - it's a disgusting name, it's so completely lost. It is not surprising that filmmakers try and lose us because this is one awesome movie. This story involves the mystery of murder on the island island off. Very little happens in this film. And when something influences the viewer from his account, it is often an unintentional comedy in the form of uncomfortable dialogue release and trust group of voice artists. These guys are bad they make executives present a voice to be seen as a modification of the adjustment level. In fact it is difficult to determine how bad practice is when you take this picture of damage. But sound artists cannot be blamed for the script. It's very bad. Deliberately funny when surprising, worse. Stories in general are, say at least, vary. Women's characters are mainly idiotic; Men may have creepy or anxiety. All businesses are experiencing misuse of listeners. It is not appropriate to offer a commitment and even when the killing (finally) begins, all occur on the screen. All we find is the shots of the half-half head. Few people have said that this film is a giallo. I can't agree with this comment. Anyone who enjoys the Italian buttons should give this film a broader sense because nothing is so interesting about it. Basically it is a soft film of the core of the porn with a terrible angle. But it's not very good. <br /> <br /> I can't recommend this to anyone.
