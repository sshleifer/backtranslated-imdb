Competition Warner Bros worst movie Kay Francis is hard. I just saw maybe eight, but the comet on Broadway is worse now. The best thing about it is that it is short. Oh, and Orry-Kelly coats (of course) are good. James Wong Howe's movie is not. Kay Francis all faces the face of fat and not less attractive than he usually do. Minna Gombell who I do not know otherwise is as good as a tough "burlesque" dancer (looks more like a fashion show than burlesque). The last shot - Kay Francis and his child (when did the child learn that Kay Francis was his mother? Did I go?) Walking on the dirt road to the prison that was wrapped in misty lines on the sound tone is more than fun. The whole film is cheap, so it is impossible and it is not ridiculous that it feels to be infected with depression for everyone who made it: Warner Bros to throw garbage in dollars that they do not know, in Warner Bros' calculation of their calculation, that what they find is garbage.
