Looking at CBS "Dedication, Dorothy", I kept wondering why Diane Keaton would like to be in it (not because it is a television movie - and a shortage of interesting roles for former actors, not surprising why winning Academy Awards such as Keaton turns on the TV - but because it does not give Keaton a chance to shine. One mother, mourning the sudden death of her daughter twenty-something, puts it - and gradually becomes friends and - a group of her young daughter was close to the time of her accident. From this novel, this teleplay gives us a group of individual characters who can lock one without crossing the road to avoid. In addition to being a tribal and lighter, these people caused by fraud can not fail, as is the case with the worst and the bungalow near the beach where children live (one young man, wearing muscular shirts to tell us he is gay, hears Diane Keaton said, â€œSurrender. , Dorothy "and really asks," That is from "Pastor of Oz", right? "... no, professional, is from" Citizen Kane "!). Keaton may have wanted to make this material according to the subject of death. She is trying to turn this unseen woman into the shadow of her own person (lots of kooky), but does not live well with the viewer since Keaton has had a pleasant temperature and a change in the wrong way. Here, he is a desperate harpy who has not learned a lot of lessons on his independent discovery (the movie quickly remembers it about a dead woman and becomes odyssey for the fall of the mother's nervousness, who seems to be a hippie of overage who has never lost anyone around him). This is the type of film actors who advertise on the exhibition and the cemetery, "It should help many sad mothers out there". I can't imagine that it helps anyone because it is subject to low, muddy and surprising conditions. Stressed.
