I love the series of "Masters of Horror" for many times. Terror fans live in a constant lack of food. Such projects (and "Greenlight Project" similar to what we have been given to "Feast" - as with the nose or the nose) are the basis for talking to good guns of thought in the minds of frightening directors to develop and bring fruit to us for the love of eat on fear. <br /> <br /> This started with a kernel of a real-kool idea and run ... right away from "where on earth I go with this? !!!". <br /> <br /> I do not know how to destroy the damage but "SPOILER AHEAD" suddenly ... no, there was that light turning around at midnight ... we've had long visitors of hair animated (huh? ... HUH?) The men dig the brain and ... yes, I get it but ... well ... the worse curse of writing stories - to raise and promise to set up without a bribe. br>> <br /> Cue for journalists ... your building has to have benefits that are increasingly creating. It's not another way around. Story story 101. End of Spoilers - Big Oops!
