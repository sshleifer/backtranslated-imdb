However, someone else comes into a teen-age area, sitting at the university with the nerd effort to cool, and how he decides to share the trio of the most popular jocks in making him a girl. It has all been done before, and all has been done in a more satisfactory manner. The great humor that has made young people beat like the "Pie of the United States" and "Dude! Where is my car" which is well known to be taken out completely by this situation in this phase, looks completely randomly that the viewer can only pull and refuse. The film is badly written, and artists are not able to do any of it even a little bear. I can't even mention this bad picture for opening it, if it's wasting my time and yours. For best, Slackers can't manage or attract laughter, and the worst time is very bad and sometimes not quite known. Jason Schwarzman, who was attracted to his first Rushmore, is hurting himself to appear in this picture and someone wondered how work could end up in the toilet very quickly. Please avoid, please try. Save your money.
