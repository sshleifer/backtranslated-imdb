Please, help the economy - spend your money elsewhere! The movie chapter is: The First Woman has killed her husband because she had deceived him. That's right. It is not available to anyone, except Cuba and Angie, makes and uses a massive killing system that no one knows about ... and is completely removed. <br /> <br /> Some of the special points are especially hilarious: When standing in front of the president, Cuba causes a shot of the killer ... which enters the head of the president. Cuba and Angie look at the film from the news camera, and they see ... clue. They go to great lengths to protect the film, believing they are the only people who have a copy of this public film. <br /> <br /> Cuba speaks to the president of the president. PSM's comments that there was no plot. Cuba claims that there is more than one person involved. PSM shows that the plot includes FBI, CIA, and NSA. Bosh, I wonder PSM is involved. Girl Archer, First Lady, is an amazing artist. Cuba can not make a painting, and says, "You're close ... stand back ... look at a different perspective, see from my perspective." Is there anyone who can lose it?
