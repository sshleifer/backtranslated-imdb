Andrewjlau, I could not accept more. My girl is looking at this at this time, and I see this film worried. Quote from my girlfriend of China, laughing: "They do all this for someone!" I see these women are powerless, there is no fight between tragedy and identity, and that these men should not fight. During the dance where Zhang Zi Yi prevails, men seem to be more stupid than pleasing. Japanese people are more powerful than Chinese people, and geisha is a Japanese culture. I am sure that Chinese had something like that, but the faces are not the same. However, these discussions are amazing, so they are of America. He had a European who worked in Eastern Europe, would do better work. I add: it seems that most of the people who love the film are America. Sorry to say, but it's not surprising. It's all written to you, not ordinary, not enthusiastic. I think Chinese actors are interesting, but I couldn't say they were good actors in this film. Yes, the movies are good, but in fact, I can't see how it can be seen that these characters are hard, deep people. Go to Japan to see something real. I am sure that it will be wonderful to see.
