I talked about whether I should draw a spoiler box. Since 99% of this show seems to have already been shown by any of the Cookies followers may not come under the spoiler category. <br /> <br /> Shows video clips. Grrr. We all knew Friends were coming down when they started with video shows ... and five and a half years in the heads of trees had gone and fell into that hole. I need to ask myself if the authors could not have trouble writing that week and they said themselves "let's show some wonderful things." Didn't work. <br /> <br /> At the beginning, showing all the time that people have fallen is not funny when taken out of context. It is not surprising to see Todd shouting with his banana bottle unless we know why he was standing with his banana banana. Second, why was supposed to be a fantasy group of JD, one was the dream of the Turk, another also was not his fantasy, though I forget which. <br /> <br /> And that's a problem. This period is completely forgotten. We've seen all these things before. And the collection of people are playing? Why? That's not funny. Finally, I must admit twice my preferred preferences are shown in the last collection ... Dr. Cox recognizes that Ben died ... and JD tell him how proud he is. <br /> But even seeing that time again did not save the part. The summary says all. <br /> <br /> The worst part ever. Bill Lawrence, PLEASE don't let your show go the same way as Friends, go ahead, make it funny ... or close it.
