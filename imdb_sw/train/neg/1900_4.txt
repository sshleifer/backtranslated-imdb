Randall "Memphis" Plants are a retired thief of a retired car who has to return to the "game" when his younger brother is faced with death by failing to comply with the orders of the British crime boss Raymond Calitri. The work involves "lifting" 50 cars in 24 hours or Calitri will give its penalty. So Rains quickly collects workers who can believe and put on the job. But the police are on it and some cars on the list are not easy to take. It looks like impossible work is not possible to complete. It has completely beaten it in the Seconds 60, Nicolas Cage, Angelina Jolie, Robert Duvall, Will Patton, Delroy Lindo, Vinnie Jones, Giovanni Ribisi, Christopher Ecclestone, Scott Caan & Timothy Olyphant. All more eligible. There is the ability to make horses in Porsche 998 Turbo. The trouble is, is that this is a very serious case of many cars overstocking the car car, the characters of the mucho, not zest enough. From far we are doubtful that this is Bruckheimer / Simpson production, script bonkers laced with loud and lashings of cheese, scattergun editing, and directed to subtly sledgehammer and Dominic Sena. Basically it is a great remake of H.B budget. Halicki's 1974 movie indie of the same name, and Power to provide adrenalin power fueled car-based movie. It is possible that sadness has never been recognized. There is one time or two of the above effects, daft to the point, but it is never recommended below. But if you forgive pardon, the film is not found in the first gear, it is more than a job to work with the ream of characters who strive to make a boorish screen {Scott Rosenberg} work. The fans will find something from them [cars are ace on eye}, as well as fans of non-optional movies of the comedy [see the sadness of Ecclestone's text time]. But no, in fact it's all the poor told. 4/10
