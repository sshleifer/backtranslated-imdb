Boogeyman's original was an unusual but non-leisure flila. It was not a great film but it's fun in the right frame of mind. The third item in this series, the return of Boogeyman, on the other hand, is just anger. It includes two things. First, a new cheap and non-existent footage. Second, LOADS of the printed bits from the first movie. The new material is normal without childbirth but not in the most convenient way, just very interesting. This footage is locked quickly and without any effort. It is used as a repair tool for endless parts from the first (and second) movies. And the boy, do they pull the milk from the original films; sometimes uses the coordinates again and again. Just new features of these parts are voices on that it accurately describes what we can see with our own eyes. All the experience of this look is real-numbing. Boogeyman's return is an example of the worst kind of exploitation clicking; The type that uses the audience through pride. I want to make these changes briefly and accurately because this movie is no longer valid. Nothing here is worth even. This is free.
