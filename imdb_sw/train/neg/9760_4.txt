The film traders had no access to supervised areas, thus concealing the image of Israel's side led. I was hit by almost all points of the mother's opinion. The mother of Israel lost a child who had the possibility of a happy life. The Palestinian mother lost a child who was only likely to lose life and despair. With these very different views, any meeting did not have a real chance for any intelligent meeting. The word "peace" did not mean the same for each of them. Peace for Palestinians was freedom. Peace for Israel was security. For such a hole, this type of film is very valuable? I ended with the feeling that I was looking at the imperial propaganda - both sides were unstable.
