Users who tested this film are largely unable to see enough good movies to compare it. What? Have all been intelligent? I have never heard of this with passion and films and some of these should be linked to the hype of anxiety around this film. <br /> <br /> From the first, BU is a track film. We manage at one end following and go straight. And another. And another. And another. What? Do you see an example emerging? There is almost no 'losing' on a plot, promotional character, or an old reality. If you haven't seen two other Bourne movies, you are very lost. If you have - just want to be lost - somewhere long from the movie. Paul Greengrass's style that worked very well in the 93th Union which was a great burden to occur, but on Bourne and his unexpected disaster affects only the exclusion of viewers from behavior. He runs. Jumps. He blows. He gets a blow. He opens large buildings. Yada yada yada. Best of all - he saves. He lives like Action Action plastic life, which only makes ridiculous stunts he pulls all more slack and missing in any kind of tension. So it gives the building? So? He will live. Yawn. It is a girl thrown in a mixture because the love of Bourne's love died in the previous body, but she is only decoration. I've got more chat conversations with snappy conversations in Captain Scarlet events. Bourne's own trip to personal study is simple and useless and tells us what we don't know from the first film. It turned out to be a murder machine. Main item. He sees his true identity. So? It doesn't have any emotional resonance when it comes. <br /> <br /> The end of 'moving' is telegraphed and weak. Oh, dear, more I think about this film more I hate! I have scored my score up to 4 times to write this comment! I would last more now before the slide continues. <br /> <br /> I love good flick action and I love good thriller. Ultimatum of Bourne is not. It is a great, exciting series of flashy changes, sound effects and dirt of the cartoon. <br /> <br /> The idea that 'shows the way' to the Bond franchise is a perfect crap. Casino Royale strikes out of the water.
