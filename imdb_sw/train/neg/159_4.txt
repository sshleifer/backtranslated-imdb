I have been acclaiming Susan Sarandon for its fulfillment and trust in his personal life and his talents as an actor. So I found it strange that he would appear in a film that distorted the truth. The rescue of his behavior from the South Pole was held by the Canadian contractor from Edmonton, Alberta fly Canada built and built the Twin Otter plane. The trip was hit by US Airforce, Navy and Coast Guard as more than their potential. The company made the same rescue a few years later to extract a person from the Horn of the Horn. I feel that the film represents a very interesting subject and wrote a very brave woman who faces a terrible job. I can't see why producers will see that they must ignore the courage of the rescue pilots and show the rescue plan like the HFules of the USAF.
