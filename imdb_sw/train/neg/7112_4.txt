Well, I agree this was one of my favorite things as a child, when I was looking at a home project as a top-8 reel. Now there is not much to recommend, except the value of the camp's executives to be "panic" and replicas of human skull. Special effects are very interesting, which include the skull on the wire and the powerful "spirit" images. But there is something that says for a set. The big house that is done is very good, especially because it is not very good (perhaps because of budget reasons). It actually encourages more to laugh than to scream, however. Just try to get dirty when the wife (who does more than his part of the scream) gets into the dirty and faces the spirit of her old husband.
