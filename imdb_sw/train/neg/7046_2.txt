I saw a waste of this time on the Comedy HBO's park, so I did not really and I really think that this was a comedy. But there is nothing strange here. A good offer is essentially lost in the script that I could write with my left cheek - after the firing of the vanity and victims of the 15th century court. time, and a zero zero zero to talk. The fact that stars such as Ewan McGregor and Zeta-Jones are located in this small movie and yet this film has less than 1000 votes on this site, should tell you everything. The best publications of the waves of the winter coast of England, but that's about it. This is the type of film available just because people who wrote it are a good relationship (family relationship, preferably) and / or a lot of money around.
