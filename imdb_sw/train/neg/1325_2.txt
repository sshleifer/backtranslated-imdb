Richard Dreyfuss is true, in this flick, but for a very small part. NOT "suspected" film player - is the group business manager / accountant. Even the box describes the film without precision. There are no events related to Sondra Locke, if they are announced, unless the person uses the word "erotic" completely for free. I would like to consider watching the film without Richard Dreyfuss being in it as the main character. However, I would have realized that the 60 most famous song, "Suzanne" Leonard Cohen, had an artistic influence. In addition to the short summary of the verses from the end of "Ulysses" of James Joyce, and the last interesting record of Ingmar Bergman's "Seven Seals," I have seen that it is an unpleasant effort to make up-to-date elements and harmonized films such as "Last year in Marianbad "and" Un Chien Andalou. " If you like the idea of ​​an art gallery, there are many top films, from "Bye, Bye, Brasil" to "Cecil B. Closed."
