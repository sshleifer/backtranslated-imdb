One can think (as I did), that with Steve Martin, Goldie Hawn, and John Cleese, the movie must be, at a very low, respectable level. These stars (especially Martin and Cleese) have produced some of the funniest functions of the comedy of all time <br /> <br /> Well, obviously I was very wrong - this is one-handedly one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It convinces my thoughts how one joke after another can be very unfunny. It hurts me to watch these talented actors to perform one of the best texts I have ever had. According to only the major names, I held the hope for a long time through the film period, but often did not give any entertainment. Normally, both with movies and in life, I try to stay away from the suggested suggestions and generalizations. But for this film, it's hard not to stop. I can focus on one hand, maybe even two or three fingers, a great Hollywood product that left me more bitter than this. This is one of the worst contestants made. I tried to enjoy this â€” I did the truth. But those outside the Towners eventually fail. If you want an effective recreation time, just do your money and look at the swirl when you pull down the toilet. Please watch this film.
