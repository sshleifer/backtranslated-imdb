SPOILERS AHEAD <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst movies ever made - it's simple. There is not one quality of redemption about this film. The first 10 minutes are hard - it really leads you to believe that this film will be awesome and will be on your seat. Instead, you will spend about 83 minutes when you are looking at the stolen and badly run by any organization. Lake was ridiculous, looked like aquarium, and had the plant in different parts of the lake bed. The characters show their ability to transfer teleportation, for example Alex Thomas who falls into the lake (drink), and then ends up on his boat for an impossible chance. Angie Harmon has put a sad performance like Kate, worsened by the opening time of the opening that appears to be written in the last minute by the fifth farmer. An example of this will be when he said, "Flashlight!" in such a stupid sense that shows the threshold of how much the human body can intervene before it decreases by half. Finally, the editing of this film was the most amazing and awesome that I have ever seen. It was like cameramen were a bunch of chicks who were given camcorders by scientists. An example of this will be when we suddenly get closeup of the head on Alex's car. I would like to bet that there was little time for any time you used to edit this film. The end was very sad. The authors were clearly trying to create a secret type of conspiracy that made the viewer say, "ah!" Instead, we are left to look at dumb's spots in some way fit into the story line. Unfortunately, there is no one view in millions out there that can save this film to a piece of decoration. I offer this .5 out of 10, .5 from the fact that this film recorded on the film instead of a picture book.
