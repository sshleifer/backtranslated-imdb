How do you tell the story of fear without fear and story? This is the most interesting thing about the film: I feel the feelings of the authors have not really decided what is going on in the film! It is a different thing to know that, to give attention to the audience and not to reveal it completely, but here, you get the attention of the artists do not know, the characters in the film do not know and the viewers feel that no one knows! (Remember "Cube"? Even the film knew more about itself.) But many important things are not available. We don't know anything about the characters. They continue to repeat empty lines without too often. The story is not really good - it does not exist anywhere. B-acting is the same in this kind of awesome films, but there is not much to do in the script. We don't care about characters. There is nothing to remember about them. Not even cheesy humor or unwanted sex. And most importantly - no thrills, no chills. You just get the most common things of the type of film of fear. They show the monsters of Lordi directly but the characters they do not contribute anything to the story. I believe in the fact that this amount of story, the development of character and situation can be achieved by a small number of workers and equipment. Oh, the filmmakers did it - and more - 20 years ago! I felt the shame of the audience as the film ended. Still very bad.
