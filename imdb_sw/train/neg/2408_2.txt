This movie is about a little scientist who builds a serum that raises the dead. He uses the first to his brother when he is shot dead in the car. His brother affects the other members of the group. In some cases the zombies seem to walk very slowly and in other cases they run very fast that makes little sense. Acting is mediocre but the story does not support the film. Milk has blood on the face of the zombies. The budget of this film I am sure was greatly reduced. I believe the film would have been made well if the story was more original and better budget. If you don't want to see a beautiful zombie flick don't see this.
