I would like to enjoy this film but Van Damme does just the same old garbage. Pigs are fighting with events as usual. The only thing this loser left out is the Russians usually end up killing at the end. This film is a very advanced technique to make a high nature, Please please please Van Damme to find acting lessons, you need. Anyone who loves Van Damme has issues, seems to be sad that the only way Van Damme ever finds any job job is when he writes the film, co provides the film and makes the screen play for the film. AVOID VAN DAMME AND HIS OWN WAS NASTY WIG. I give this two-tenth film, because one and sandman was the best. To add insults for injury I lost a quid in this fertilizer
