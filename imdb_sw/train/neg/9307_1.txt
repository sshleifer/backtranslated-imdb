I lost this film a month ago when I had anything to do on Friday. All I can say to describe this non-existent film is 'TRASH' Acting is very bad I have seen children in secondary school doing their best. In other words the special effects were interesting and one thing was seen as being hit by any camera that can buy a shadow of the radio. Clown himself doesn't look at something like that on the video cover. Heck does not even show in the film until close to the end and all makes hum songs and go around talking a few characters. No real killings are shown or not the real real film or since I have seen it asking a few things. 2. If your friend disappears why can you go out into the forest to have sex instead of looking for him? In fact sad. Why is it that the only REAL characters lost in deception at the end of a sudden? Are people sent to finally decide to show their efforts in their work? This film is as sad as they come. I advise you to avoid hiring so that you do not lose one hour or two when your time is more louder than shouting.
