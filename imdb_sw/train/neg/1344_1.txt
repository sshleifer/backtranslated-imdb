Any movie with a title like "The Bagman" should attract the attention of any movie partner, but the plot is very different from what one can expect after watching the DVD cover. Bagman is not suitable movie. It comes to a group of films that seem to be (and maybe were) done on a home video camera. Acting is bad. I have never heard and saw these wooden trees since Troll 2. There are many cases and dirt and sex, but obviously jumped very fast. The characters are morons and completely forget. Finally (which I cannot destroy) you can easily expect after watching the first location. Due to the good nature of the film, nothing of good production practices is terrible (a realistic experiment actually, a driving area where the car makes it clear, etc.). It is recommended for only aficionados of the film.
