Well, I can say, there are B-Movies movies and there are B-Grade Movies and this definitely falls into the end. However, it is clear that even the film makers know that it is not a reliable movie (see closed credit) can be forgiven. <br /> <br /> The program is essentially a psychologist who has been sentenced to death. He accidentally has its genetic material mixed with experimental acid that is connected and then lost in snow. The murderer now takes the form of the striker - if you can believe it. Snow player, Jack Frost, is after the city of Sherif who has put him behind the bars. To do this, Jack Frost ends up killing half the city. <br /> <br /> This movie does not have any real guilt and effects only reminding the B-Grade movies of 50 years. Film passed time off.
