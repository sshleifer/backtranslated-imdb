I don't know what you all look at Steven Seagal movies, but I look at them because, like the wicked, they are at least always good to laugh. Why can you measure this movie 1 out of 10 according to dubbing, when that kind of thing is exactly what makes a film like this in a favorite worship which you can laugh at the silliness? <br /> <br /> The power of the attack is not available in the big movie, but I felt it is similar to Steven Seagal's car as its many movies; I really didn't think it was one of the worst for a long shot. It was, often, half of the plot, and it was, often, exciting essentially. The end was well filled, but even that had many interesting features. Finally the story did not give what was promised, but in fact I thought that acting, character (if I could use such a big word) and all the production standards are given exactly what the fan of Steven Seagal would expect. Seagal himself had the face of a stone, a non-nonsense person we had come to expect, and the rest had a very good impression, without telling him. This, people, is what the Steven Seagal film makes. Take care of it. Or even better: laugh. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10.
