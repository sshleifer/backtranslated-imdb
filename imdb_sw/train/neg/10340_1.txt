This is one of the worst films I have ever seen. I looked into it mainly due to curiosity after the novel, and I would not have. I stopped it a little later than an hour, although I wanted to delete it after five minutes. I wish I had. Ignore many novels and changes all kinds of things. Unless the film could free itself in 50 minutes or minutes (which is not possible) I would recommend this in any way. It is insulting to one of the most 20th century writers. I would almost see this one day in the hands of the director and the scribe of the screens who can do right.
