I have read every book so far in the series left behind, and the movie does not work any right. Indeed, I have seen the worst movies, but this was very terrible. This movie would have made a good part of MST3K. The script was a bad change of the book, and it felt like executives were reading their verses, instead of telling the truth. The characters were hard and impossible. The effects were cheesy, and it looked very false. The end was bad. First of all, it did not even go through the first book. Second, it was useless. If you have not read the book, you will not have an idea of ​​what is going on. It was very fun, a student-like film that I had ever seen on the film. I am disappointed that I earn money for this movie. If for a certain miracle, they get enough, they should do it completely and allow Hollywood to take over. Two producers of wannabe film, and the wannabe director should leave the film to make professionals.
