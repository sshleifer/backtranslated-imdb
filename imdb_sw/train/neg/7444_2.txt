Unless you are dissatisfied with the Russian people or boats, this movie is snorefest. Actually, I slept over 40 minutes in & I had to fight a desire to leave the theater. I wish I had. Losing Saturday's perfect evening. Even "Silent Hill" was difficult. Heck, even the "Labyrinth of Pana" was hard. I am still unknown about what should be awesome in this flick. At the beginning, I have a lot of movies that use "Russian pidgin" as this does in the opening legacy. It's a shame for me since I brought a group of my Russian friends and we all broke it. Oh my god. Hmm. Well, for my luck (and maybe you, too) this film has already run my brain & I just left the hour ago. So I don't have any specific details, the bad illustrations that go anywhere and the perishable-now hope that will happen. Perhaps I have seen the full version of this film because I can't believe I had a good idea here (that's why I saw it) and ended up not quite the Horror or Suspense only but the overall Entertainment Entertainment. I / I give 2 because, yes, I slept and I wanted to leave after 40 minutes but I woke up and didn't leave.
