Marty nerd (Simon Scuddamore) is being sexually abused by a class of class students and then in a laboratory explosion (too too) where his face is hit by acid. Years later all the jerks are invited back to secondary school (since they are closed) for reconciliation. Neither did they know that Marty invites them to return to kill them. Then the storm begins, they are locked up in school and Marty begins to take revenge. Pretty silly. The murder is an innovation and there are some shots of the school atmosphere left - but that's about it. Scuddamore's humiliation is more than brutal (broken, has a dumbed head into the toilet and burned) and is not worried to look. Considering Scuddamore committed suicide shortly after this opened to make them difficult to see. Also this film comes from its dirty way. There is a full sight of Scuddamore (surprising to any movie) but one girl decides to bathe alone ... IN knowing the killer around after them! And then there are a couple who should have sex. This is a kind of film where the killer appears to know where everyone will have and can be teleport yourself. It is approaching to lose what I had to whisper and stretch my eyes then lose another that was with me wanting to throw something heavy on TV! Acting carries - not good, but carries. Caroline Munro is also here. She is a very beautiful woman but not a lot of actress. <br /> <br /> This gets 3 for gory killing and atmosphere. Otherwise it is run for the mill and forget. Suicide for Scuddamore give him this film more cautious than it suited.
