I paid only a sad thought of a comedy with ridiculously 2 because some popular old porn movies have been found in it. A group of tourists, who are considered vacation in Ireland but in fact in Canada, run away with anything else or another, and the plot is more or less out of the HILL has WRONG TURN. The only problem is, unless I testify, there is only one mutant to show, and not all surprising. Such kind of mummy potbellied in this homemade film from five years ago. Some of the deaths are well but helpful, but the film is a very emotional and very interesting night. The end is predictable and is dead. No pun is planned.
