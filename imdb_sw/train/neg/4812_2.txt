I thought that any horrible film or Orson Welles in it would be wonderful. The sure assurance was but it was also very good for it. The film has an impressive feeling as it deals with a traveler / wizard contract in a small town and a woman's attempt to avoid. The director though it seems to be deliberately trying to combine the audience using a guide and a dream system. In the end, there are many unanswered questions. What's worse, as the story combines, it is very difficult to plug for characters. It seems strange that Welles would accept leading this film especially because they don't have much to do. Maybe one day they will put the release of a bloop from this film. Now that will really be fun!
