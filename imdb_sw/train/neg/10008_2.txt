The movie is bad. There is no other way to say. The story is weak and temporary, especially for this country. I don't think most people know what "walker" is or will really care. I felt like I was watching movies from 70 years. This lesson was not believed in 2007, even in DC. I think this was true for everyone else who looked at it as if the complaint was low and fast at the end. Many did not stay with Q & A either. I don't think Schrader really thought the film before time. Most of the events seemed to be reduced if they had never finished or did not know how to finish. He jumped from one place to another and had to try and think or think what was going on. I certainly didn't get a personal life of Woody (Carter) or a boyfriend or. Are all "culture" of male slavery and torture images (from Iraqi prisons) about? What did he think? I think it was his poor attempt to try to create this dark life of self for Woody behavior (Car). Didn't work. It didn't seem to have a real feeling. The only thing about this film was Woody Harrelson. Played his character (Car) without precision. In fact you have found a great meaning of the "walker" that can be like (say twenty years ago). He was beautiful and most likely will never be recognized for that. <br /> <br /> For Lauren, Lily and Kristin ... Boring. Don't see it! It's painful! Unless you're a true Harrelson fan.
