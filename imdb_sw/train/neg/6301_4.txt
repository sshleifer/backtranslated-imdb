Besides good work with the characters, and the script of the mind and Alan Plater, this film is faced with a bad mistake - the lack of charm of medium / actor character. One of the characters explains the behavior of Richard E Grant as "a little stretch" and unfortunately this takes him completely. There is nothing about it or her performance to believe that her boyfriend and pastor / friend will spend a lot of time and emotional effort on her. He is cautious, arrogant, self-centered and angry. This section is called an actor who can make you even more attractive as a pastor - Ewan McGregor, for example. All of the magic satire on the class system was lost, due to this functionality and inefficiency. All I wanted to do is to shake and tell him to turn.
