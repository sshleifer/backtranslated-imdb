My friends and I went into this film without knowing what to expect, but we'd better. When we came out, we had only a little story about what the movie was actually. Although it's not the worst movie I've ever seen, I certainly don't recommend using your money to see it on movies. Maybe a friend hires you (it is not even worth renting, either) if you want to see it. When the movie is helped to not know what is going on until the last five minutes, there is no really very much that can be mentioned in its defense. Acting was polite, more than you would like to get from this film, and some shots were good, but they were all closed with a blind program and bad script. This video was really bad that once it went wrong, I went and bought a ticket to see a good movie just to clean my mind. I recommend that you all leave the first step and tablet to see a good film instead.
