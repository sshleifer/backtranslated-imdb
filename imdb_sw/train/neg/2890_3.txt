The past has increased in the addict-redict when he joins his sick brother and former partner after what he hoped was his last stint in detox. "Drama life", made here in the most convenient way of thinking (even even writing no bite or wit). The source is composed of actors who appear shouting to each other, and music and photography are lugubrious (a couple of invisible is interesting, indie-clich√© touches that reek of the puny budget). Although written and led by a man, this was made by a woman, and I do not know but I think this might be a different reason why this picture about two men, emerging brothers growing up, have never had gels, they never feel natural or apparently lived inside. It is an attempt to get into a male relationship, but the presentation of attention, falsehood, is a fraud. No human heart lives, living, breathing, or stopping this blood. "Holy Son" varies quickly with many kitchens.
