After staying in this pile of elephant, my husband and I wondered if it was actually an attempt to see if a computer program could produce a film. It was a non-list and formulaic. But the U.S. propaganda your face on the film shows - desire - that it is human work. Call me an expert on the plot, but as, "We should steal the Freedom Declaration to protect it" it seems like ways to justify acts like Iraq's invasion, etc.. The fact that Nicholas Cage sends lines like, "I can never use the Independence Declaration as a business venture" with a direct face made me and my husband ask if all tariffs took Valium before hitting every area. The "reason" behind each revolution of the plot and the "clue" is true and not praiseworthy. And there is also an extra plot of misogyny, and Dr Whatever-Her-Name-It was chided and all involved for "never closed." He is obviously in the film just for the sake of looks, but they felt the need to blow "Dr" title on his character to give him a gravity. At the same time, the Cage character says, "Have you never fasted?" and the camera caps on his eyes, as he is a child. Very much. The only advantage to this movie was that it is very strange, you get a few laughs. The most frightening thing is that many people are watching movies and we seemed to enjoy. Creepy ....
