O my dear! It often has a film "scared" to beat me, or make me laugh, like this. After a powerful start and an exciting premise, it comes from no more than a flick of slasher, with normal and gender acids. Most often Alice Krige is lost in this one, and the act of conspiracy is irrelevant. Don't worry unless you like it very much. Testing: 3/10.
