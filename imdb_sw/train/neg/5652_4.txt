This is not a bad film ... but it is your partner's kind of look. The story is not bad .... it only makes an hour and a half to be seen for a long time. It is difficult for me to lose this film because I do like their idea but it was only long and narrow on the story ... very bad. The main character has not been completely seen to change all of them from beginning to end. I mean it goes through something "change of life" and can break a smile. I thought Mac was very good. His amazing quirkiness put the film into full stress. Maybe not just "get" this film. If anyone can tell me I would like to know.
