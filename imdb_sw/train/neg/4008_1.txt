As a fan of Sookie Stackhouse books, I see this series to be their absolute representation. The Vampire Bill is not so good and it looks much older than described in the book. I have found that they have already made the characters of amazing colors seem really and bad. One of my favorite things about books is that despite all the cotton that goes through Sookie is always a woman, and yet in the TV series it doesn't look like that. Not only the discrimination shown in the TV series is not nearly extinct in books. I did not expect a real copy of the books but I at least expect them to be used in a series.
