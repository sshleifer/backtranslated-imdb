Full driver. The unfortunate manifestation of false culture, the poison of ten years ago. In this film, sadness of foot slaves goes along with colonial subtexts (bright scenarios that feed on Shaka rice?). Forget historical facts too. Did most western slaves not come from West Africa? The American slave can get a question for a few people? Finally, David Hasslehoff could not be worse. Can anyone think, how could he succeed in the ministry? (Most likely to be crucified). The service was very good, and it is unfortunate that DH would have got his hands on something unique, and made it mundane. (I tend to think that he had a hand in building this fiasco).
