SAPS AT SEA <br /> <br /> Ratio: 1.37: 1 <br /> <br /> Type of voice: Mono <br /> (Black and white) <br /> <br /> 'The horn of fear', Ollie begins the journey to 'wash', but she and Stan are confused with a runaway (Rychard Cramer). Chaos continue. This time element of the feature - a good inflection that you don't know if just a good job of Laurel and Hardy - showed the last cooperation between L & H and the producer Hal Roach. Strongly in the structure, the movie approaches an unforgettable sea trip after Boys are taken hostage by a tribal Cramer (who draws a seagull to prove how hard he is!). Gags are the same, but the impulse is lacking, perhaps because of the recruitment-turn-director Gordon Douglas, who was previously responsible for the first efforts of Ollie in the era (ZENOBIA, produced in 1939), but his work here has no pzazz. Right, but nothing special. L & H regularly Charlie Hall and James Finlayson seem to be a stranger.
