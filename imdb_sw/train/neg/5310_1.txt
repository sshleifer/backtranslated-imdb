I don't know what other reviews would talk about. Surely this is not a movie of the bimbo, in fact, I don't think there was one beautiful girl to look into it. No, it's just cheesy, not done-done, Ed Wood style style schlock. And it's bad. I can't even start telling you how wrong. I saw the night at the end of the cable, and I was shocked. The fact that this movie was released is always insulting to all of us. Vendors were friends of the producer or lost mentally, the special effects are the dragon, and the speed is not suitable for speed. For me though, music climbs all. Monkey can write the best theme with the xylophone of the toy. Do not borrow this, but if you have seen it on the cable, see. You will be surprised how the movie can be bad.
