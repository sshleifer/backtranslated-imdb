Very film from times - a very long series with no chat, bad flashbacks, and almost completely cast male. Two women who are seen have a total of less than 10 and have a sexual interest for men. O'Toole hates whenever he speaks; unfortunately, he spends most of his time looking through the shrubbery. Alastair Sims always enjoys seeing but she, too, is widely used. The film has one positive feature, because it shows a lot of UK funding and the sympathy of the participants (such as the appearance of Mosley's graffiti) that most people today don't know. Most of today's films about WWII coloring Members like all good and Axis as all evil, while history tells us people are much harder than that! This will be a good movie at a time when you are recovering from a fever and are given to bed and you can not absorb anything very hard. If you only need something to pass the time when your electrolytes are stabilized, this is your film.
