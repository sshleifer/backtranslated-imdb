The Dark Wind is your worst typical, quick-looking fear / sci-fi / fantasy movie. It has an amazing, unprecedented plan and great holes you can make an elephant through. Often I did not know what hell is going on but it was not worthwhile, it was a demonic farmer who came back from a state of hell to save the story of the aliens and the confusion of things added to witches and the book of evil and conspiracy and perpetrators who do not meaning or disappear completely without reason. Acting is bad but there honestly not much they can do with this script I want. There are two high scenes that are probably the only reason for this bad movie made (such as many bad movies). This offer exceeds nothing else on the T.V.
