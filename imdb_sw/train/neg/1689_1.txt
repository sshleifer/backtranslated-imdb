Wow, total wholesale will drop! The fact people think this scary film is ridiculous. Specific effects were made directly by "Pete." Stories? Is there one? Not in my opinion. For a flashy picture group. The whole film was boring, stupid, aggressive. I think there is always a bad film market and good marketing campaigns. However, this is the worst movie I have seen in years. And that Chick Buffy? Well, he's a bad actor! As a plastic like Barbie and as talented .... No, wait, that will be insulting to the talent of Barbie! I think many children helped this film at the box office as it was PG-13, and if it was counted R, it would have hit IMO! Movie stupid!
