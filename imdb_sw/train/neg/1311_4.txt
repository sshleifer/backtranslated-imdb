Jerry spies Tom listen to the creepy story on the radio and takes the opportunity to shock his nemesis. I have not seen this special place that is interesting: humor seemed to stop and the introduction of the whole kinda blind (Jerry is basically a 'bad guy' in this, tightening the poor Tom for some reason) There is a constant flash of inspiration (such as the actual 'heart of the mouth' of Tom, and when his nines live out of his body), but, in general, this effort is not recommended for freedom, animation The best and most beautiful of T&J cartoons
