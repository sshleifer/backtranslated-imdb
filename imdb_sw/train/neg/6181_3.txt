If you are a fan of the Mystery Secret 3K, Attack the Leeches of the Giant, or Pinata Survival Island, this film can be yours. I lived in Nashville and did not even know the existence of this film before the release, when the advertising company feared to upload Row Music with dozens of pieces and banners. It's hard to finish two weeks at the show however. <br /> <br /> Bad work, bad text, and poor productivity begin to describe this film's shame. At the beginning, names are small: Bo Price, Angel, and Dixie? Eesh. The provision of slow Toby lines makes one wonder why the production assistant has already held cue cards off the camera. The character of the angel changes quickly from his way to the city-way of cowgirl, entering the southern slang after two days on the ranch. Her wardrobe comes from chic to the feminine edition of Toby's - in fact, in the last place, their clothes are identical, and they do wonder if the ward assistant is called sick. It is not appropriate - perhaps the most obvious example is when Toby will decide to swim and her voice suddenly looks like she is shouting at the gymnasium. It has never been enough information or character development enough to happen on the screen. Witnessing, despair, grimaces, and good state describes the definition of artists and leadership of the awesome script. This game is much more enjoyable after drinking more alcohol and for your company's brave friends. But not to say much.
