You know the film is bad when showing it can see a short time of "Class!". The most sad thing about White Men can not fly is that it had great potential. For several years, I lived in the area as shown in this film; color tension was high, and basketball means everything for everyone. Movies about the members of this "basketball culture" would be very interesting, but the script to act with the poor in White Women Can not have Job left something to want. <br /> <br /> The sequence of the episodes is rotating. First, Billy either win or lose money by playing basketball game. Then he returns to his home with lounges next to his partner; and the process is repeated. Many stories include a climax of some sort, but the "peak" that I saw is just another sequence in this repetition (this case is "Billy succeeded or lost money by playing basketball game") <br /> <br>> , some problem must be solved; and this problem should be interesting if the film is too attractive. Apparently the White Men's writers did not want Jump to forget this principle, if the plot could be shortened as "Billy needs to pay the bills." I was grateful to change the speed from other films, but - sorry - this was very bad. I would like to have little worry if Billy got money to pay his rent. With all of this, white men can leave it a successful film. It seems that some sports fans will take away the horrible text for a few events and basketball in them. Others, I assure them, when they were lost by the great names play the leading role. This makes me surprised, if the cast was completely changed by the previous actors, and the basketball theme was changed by lacrosse, would anyone visit to watch this film? I don't think so. <br /> <br /> I'll give this movie two stars out of ten; The extra star is for "Class!" area, which made me wake up for a few minutes. Thank you, Trebek.
