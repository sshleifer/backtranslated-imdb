Dream on Elm Street: Child of Fantasy <br /> <br /> This is a bad movie. No run. I love the series and I think Freddy is probably the best behavior in awesome movies. But even that fan can't help but see this movie is mediocre. <br /> <br /> There is no attempt to create an interesting story with powerful characters. Now they had just quit. They don't even try. They are of course production, hope for a few more simple dollars. Stories are not good for your attention. Its very simple is around. Alice, saved from the 4th section is now pregnant. Freddy comes through baby dreams. At first we learn that preventing Alice should give her mother. And that's it. The story continues slowly since there is a very small plot that means a very good turn after a few minutes of bad conversation and acting badly. In fact that is the only terrible thing to do, acting, since death is not a little cold. We are not very interested we don't care about them. Girls are not interested as much as possible. Searching for the whole reminds me of a large group of amateur sports. I have seen the best actors in school games. It's a real shame. Lisa Wilcox can still bring a class to this. She is beautiful, sexy and has some talents. But the material did not stop. It's compassionate. Stephen Hopkins's work does not exist in the vicinity of Renny Harlin in the Dream Teacher. She tries some shots to think near to the end but that Harlin's tension and Craven created very well in the original movie is no where found. <br /> <br /> Baby Dream is just another seimaginative good. It is a kind of film that provides a series of horrible bad names. <br /> <br /> End to Freddy once scary. It's very sad to see him now. Clown which is not funny. Joke bad. Good Freddy.
