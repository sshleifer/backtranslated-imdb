... except for Jon Heder. The boy played the entire film. <br /> <br /> The program showed entertainment. A 29-year-old son (Heder) lives with a widow (Keaton) who happens to love new love (Daniels). Slack's son is jealous and tries to lose his good life and tries to destroy the relationship. She also meets the girl (Faris). I really liked Daniels's performance and especially Faris but anyone who was beaten with Hader would be better to sell hot dogs on the beach. Heders performance is anger, which will be a good thing since he plays with an angry teenager, the problem is a bad practice to open this act to make this person look at finale. At the end you still want you could give the person a flat face and you are faced with the end on the end. In the future every movie and this person will be no going to me!
