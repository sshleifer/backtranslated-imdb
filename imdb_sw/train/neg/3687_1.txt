Not only is this a bad movie; not only that a few of the "best" of Mexico's films are in this film; and not just that script is awesome. It's just so ... this film takes ... much time. These people lose money in awesome writings. We need to criticize the Mexican community but we are fed with this kind of film. Should bad language be fun? I don't. Mexico's movie is in great trouble if this movie will continue to play (and it is written and reproduced)
