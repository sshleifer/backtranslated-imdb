I remembered this show from when I was a child. I didn't remember much about it, just a few things about the characters. for some reason I remembered it was very intense. it was also early in the morning to PA. Finally, after looking around the web for a long time, I've got a part. The first part is low. Criminey! This edition was awesome. it was just plain made to show children playing lazer tag and have a good time. The show opens and the board told his mother "My names are not Christopher, I'm a board-PHOTON WARRIOR !!!!!" we then are forced to watch children playing lazer tag for song "loose foot". and not just a bit of quick, but all the song. ahhhhhhhhh my brain hurts just thinking about it. o, and if I can't be worse, you can't see even the laser rocks from their guns. it is just as they run for the entire "leg of release" song. later, after board going up in space or where, they have to fight with laser laser guns for Phil Collins song "su-su-sudio." ah, you believe, you don't want to know others. Can I say ...... DO YOU WANTED !!!!!!!!!!!
