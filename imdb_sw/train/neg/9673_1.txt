"Plants are more subtle and evil of all forms of life", it explains that one dopey would be a victim in "Seed", a silly, flaccid model of "Animal Invasion", "Day Three", and about a thousand moovies . And why are seeds more dangerous than plants, someone can ask? Because, according to the dolt, "seeds can chase us". Yes, I can remember a horrible event when MooCow was just a calf, being expelled from school for seeds of hate dandylion ... Yes, right. Unfortunately, the "creation" in this small seed of Turkey looks like small Muppets, which rotate as well as the bad tumbleweeds, others that go on conditions. Not even the smallest ink of terrorism or anxiety found here. For left-out reasons, seed organisms are beaten with ultra-violet 50-volt lights, although they can walk around the afternoon, which has 1,000 times more than UV energy. As you can see, not many ideas are put in this cow. MooCow says going to garden leaves of weeds instead of losing your photosynthesis here. : = 8P
