This is one of those films that I remember being in power for years before anything happens w / it. I don't think it's terrible, but it's not very good either. Alec Baldwin was good, but the plot is a kind of flimsy better. Healing is very good in what you have been given, but again you are just as good as the script. Baldwin explaining this though I could swear it all, I thought reading somewhere or a lot of shoots is not bad but certainly has some potential there. Although his work on "30 Rock" is not appropriate for the mind and it should continue to work for a short time. I hope that this river uplifting to Seinfeld's beauty, but maybe not long. 9 years went. So if you want to see a film that you can't get a lot out of, but it won't hate this for you. I can't remember when the film was closed for a long time before it was finally opened & just on the DVD. It was good to see Alec Baldwin & Anthony Hopkins again together since they were better but not many people have seen "The Edge." Now take the best film for some real entertainment.
