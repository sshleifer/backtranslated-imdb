I was worried when I first saw Calvin Kline-esque ads, but I thought I would give you an opportunity. So I've watched it, and all I can say is bleh. This movie was very bad. It is rare that I hate this movie very much. Explore this flick to remind me of these amazing pictures in the "Altman" player, while the authors give their amazing ideas to producers. I would like to know who is the MTV producer who decided to be a Bronte video for an hour and a half (but this time Heathcliff is Heath and he is a rock star, and the name of Hindley is Hendrix) will be a good idea. <Br /> <br /> Even though it may not have been bad, if you didn't find any other feature of the film is too bad. The direction must be "you were limping, you love for me." I laughed loudly during all the "scenes" and was bored at all. The camera function was hit and reminded me constantly that I was watching a bad movie trying to try. My theory is that a sound man got tired of falling off the beach with a beer and his boom - all I could hear in half a party was the waves. And in other cases, I wish it all I could hear. And speaking out loud, what they did to the Muslims of mercy, the song "More" is totally unacceptable, then again, you are not guilty of what they did to Bronte. On the bright side, there was one recreation area - especially when Johnny Whitworth challenged Katherine Heigl's face - and if you could tell me what the area had more information of this story than your power.
