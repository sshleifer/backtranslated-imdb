Kurosawa really hit it on this. Every thought is allowed to fail. The concept is good but implementation is very bad. It is a fantasy air about this film that makes it an art film. Tokyo's impoverished poverty deserves better and more. Many of them have interesting stories to tell. A terrible movie.
