The only word I can think of describing this film is: normal. <br /> <br /> The line of the plot about Gary sinise trying to commit suicide is a premise of fraud and c'mon..iving as some sort of salingerist or recluse in the shaft to drive golf balls in the sea because it could not handle life community of golf profits? river me. I wish these were my problems. I enjoy Dylan Baker and Sinise but this film was exposed to bad choices or pay checks for Sinise. The place that Little Timmy Price gets wrong with words and another member of the club in front of his father during the tournament is so high that I am ashamed to look at it
