There is a lot of obvious hype associated with this film. Let's just say, however, the main reasons that anyone would look at would be Leo and Cate, who are not necessarily the best actors in this film. I don't say they're not good actors, I tell you they come to this film. Special effects were decent (and I will tell the filmmakers they did a good job to make the ship interesting to the eyes), but it even has several errors. For example, before the ship goes down, you can see a non-blue picture-screen behind your main characters. Do not do wrong, I LOVE the story of REAL Titanic, but I get this film to be scorned by the story. Editing was angry - there is no reason for any film to be more than 2/2 hours (except MAYBE biography), and text and screens were disconnected. I will say that music was probably better than I could predict (and not just "My Heart Will Continue" song either). There is one place that appears when the ship is sinking to music. That could be better than the film. As for all feelings, it was very lighter. I was more disturbed than sad when Jack died, which I know could not be what the director wanted. <br /> <br /> In the shell of the nut, I see it horrible that turned the beautiful story of Titanic to be the top-stick of the horn made.
