I really felt bad for the actors in this matter. Of course the high school secondary school competition can do a good job or at a very low level such as work. Pastors should have thought this would be their great opportunity to work in the film, certainly was not. In addition to the scary practice these stories were boring and a large part is predictable. The remote control did not even make any sense. Because the worst had a good premise in the pile. <br /> <br /> I am all in support of small budget films and offer new filmmakers a good opportunity, but this turkey is a waste of time and insults for the viewer. I just watched it because of the positive comments sent here. They should be planted by people connected with the film. You can convince people to look at this, but you can't deceive them by loving what they see. I / I gave 2 instead of 1 because the story of the box tried to be hot. Certainly failed, but tried. I put s s for the worst. Do you love yourself and smell when you go. I wish I had.
