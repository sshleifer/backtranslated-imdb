I will do this short and sweet .... this film was hit !!!!!! I looked at part 1 earlier today and I thought it was one of the biggest films, ever released 9 of 10 stars. This movie beat me to death and it was very different from the first, it had an ongoing plot with it. It was like a bad departure from one place or something. I love Walken, but I felt sorry for him here. I was very excited about Glenn Danzig to be in this film, but you can't talk to forget about it. There was a fully full of crappy actors and people who disliked such as Eric Roberts and Jennifer Beals. However, it was a breath of fresh air to see Ethan Embry, she is one of the funniest people in the world. This game will make you like the first little bit, so don't look at it because you feel yourself, being a fan of part 1. I'm waiting a few days before looking at part 3 and asking it better This trick. <br /> <br /> The last part of the movie and electricity was one of the most beautiful things shown on the film. Hurry or jump so if you can't finish the first part. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10 stars - this was bad!
