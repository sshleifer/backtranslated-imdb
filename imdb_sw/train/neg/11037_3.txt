I love the places where Jim becomes Greenman. It's good! When Jim gives a young person through the window, his face is very valuable. Then when he introduces the Prophet on behalf of his wife only to know that he has been Pee-Woman? Great writing and casting with the main actor makes it necessary to see. I'm trying to get some pictures from that part. I would like to use it as my avatar on the message board because I think Greenman is hilarious. What? Anyone knows where I can download Jim's photos as Greenman? Is there anyone who can guide me in the right direction to get the picture?
