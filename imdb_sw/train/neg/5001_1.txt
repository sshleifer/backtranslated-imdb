I do not know why I am talking about this stupid-pointing view I have watched a few events (a marathon cable broadcast when they offered 5 sessions for an array or something, I did not look at anything yet like three scenarios) if I was pregnant for months nine and almost go into work any day. Maybe I'm bored today :-) <br /> <br /> I feel sorry for Britney, I really do. The money and fame he seems to have very little sense of respect. He married Federline (even anyone can make a mistake) and before that "emerged" this awesome show on his daily life with him, where he shoves camcorder wherever he feels like, no matter whether it is in someone's face or in the shower as Federline standing there. He says about his sex life without leaving your thoughts, I don't care for my part, but I can't help him how he feels about it now when he is divorced. And yes, for him I'm embarrassed But I shouldn't be. He seems to live a good life, very poor yet. I don't want to overthrow life with him even if I could. Go through the road if you like.
