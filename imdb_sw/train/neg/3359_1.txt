They came to this story! At the end Nell is a hero and keeps the team to save all their asses from the House of Hill and a false group as well! They added heads pulled up, wire cutting faces, and the ceiling became a great hand! What is hell? I love the original film, I read the book and I love it! The reason why the original movie and the book is so great because it is so frightening without even showing the spirit. No year. There is no ceiling hand. It's just a ghost how ghosts can really kill someone. He can't kill us, he can't throw us on the room or jump a knife on our head. No. They can only drive us mad. Take off all our sense of security. Nell was a selfish woman. He wanted only good things for himself. Yes, he cared little for others, but not so much. David Self and Jan de Bont have taken this great story! I hate this remake of destruction!
