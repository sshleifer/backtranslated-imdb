Have you ever seen a full-blown film with long long shots? No? I, don't. Well, I've seen one in the "Spring in My City," and I must admit, now I know why people don't do that. This technique is "arty," sure, but it is definitely not suitable for public use. This technique is very bad because the viewer has no emotional link to the characters, and perhaps that may be all the purpose of the director. I do not know, I can read the mind, and I certainly do not know enough about the director to make judgment. But one thing about this film which is very obvious is his ignorance of anti-US. Like America, I am well aware of my country's involvement in the war in Korea, and I know that we were not always angels, but I will be destroyed if I take this version of how things happened. According to the blind fool, the Americans were not only in the root of the battle, we were the cause of war, and we almost just destroyed the country. Anything, Mr. Sir. And I think you would like to make this film at COMMUNIST KOREA if we did not intervene, right? Talk about forgetting your history. This is close to making Nazi being "good people" while turning the Allied forces into "bad". This film is historically non-historic and therefore not accurate that it is almost embarrassing to look. For someone who comes from a country that is widely allegedly intervened with the US, he certainly comes as a strong and powerful judgment.
