This in 1919 to 1933 Germany seemed as difficult as the capitol of the Czech WWII. Alas, it's a capitol of Czech and it's 2003, how pleasant. <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst movies of history in the near future. Röhm is greater than Adolf and seems to be good, Göring looks like 40 when he is only 23 and "Führer" always seems to look like 56. And buildings, people, even buildings have been young, sometimes. Especially in 1919 there were many new homes in Germany (WWI are not found in German cities!). No plaster beaten! Then Reichstagsbuilding. There has never been an urban canyon around this building, never. And this can be seen by all of you as a miracle: in 1933 the Brigade of Greater Berlin possesses many cars and engines, and even some mechanics, but no one has a hand pump. The last thing: What kind of PLAYMOBIL fortress was this in the last sequence? For me this was a kind of "Adolfures Adventures in Wonderland"
