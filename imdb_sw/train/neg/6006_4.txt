I did not agree with any theology in the left series, but yet I found the books coming and reading 8 of them 12. Good writing and interesting stories. However, I didn't have a very high expectations of the movie. There was no way any Hollywood could have taken a Christian series and produced a great movie budget. So it was done independently ... and just felt like I was watching a long TV show. It doesn't matter as a film; it had no "experience" of the film, if someone knows what I'm talking about. So the film suffered because of it, and the low budget, special effects were bad for me. Additionally, I feel that Gordon Currie was sad and embarrassed as Nicolie Carpathia. To read this book, my feelings for NC was that she had to be a very good person, amazing, wonderful and who spoke English with a close understanding of zero. So I thought of someone like Pierce Brosnan in the role. Instead, they found Clay Aiken's pencil's neck that looked like a new employee from Best Buy, and gave him a brilliant fake. So it lost a few stars to me there. The movie is not just a lobby when a great villain is not available or hears how it is required. It was okay, but there was nothing to write at home about. Some events - like one of the conversion events (they can't remember which one) - they were the real seat players for me. And some Christian rock music or whatever it was, certainly was not a place of some events, as did Kirk Cameron praying in the bathroom. In short, it wasn't a bad movie, but it didn't do it to me. Put it in the book, people, better.
