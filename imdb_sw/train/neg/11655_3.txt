I was shocked by this film. I thought that "Awesome Movie" though not a great movie was very nice and pleasant. "The 2 awesome scenario" on the other hand was horrible, not exciting, and sometimes it's stupid. <br /> <br /> The Exorcist / Amityville spoof was probably the best part of the movie. James Woods was good. Now, I will admit that I am in a bad situation since I haven't seen several movies that this happens differently from the first, where I was seeing it all. But bad comedy is still a bad comedy. Something that really hurt this movie is the time, which destroyed some of which could be a good joke. Exhibitions and jokes come out for a long time. Also, the joke continues to repeat again. For example, a talking bird. Ok was funny first and maybe even a second time. But it kept going back to the point of irritating. Usually among the wheelchair and Hanson (Chris Elliott) was amusing at first but continued to repeat and ended being stupid and even less. <br /> <br /> Some of the jokes even repeat from the first movie. For example, 'strengthening' I think you will call for Cindy (Anna Faris) was strange in the “Awesome Movie” because Cindy had given her a male sex for a long time, which actually had blue balls from hell and was funny when 'creamed' it. But this time it was almost no place and not funny. <br /> <br /> The bathroom with sexual excitement was more exciting and strengthening the first time around. The play of humor was very good and it was still not needed in the second film. Tori Spelling was angry and certainly did not have a place in this film. But I enjoyed the Shorty (Marlon Wayans) who in my opinion were the funniest behavior in the first film. The area with him and the pot plant is one of my favorites from the second film. Do not make a mistake, I love the Wayans family and their humor. That is why this film is awesome. . . they have more comic abilities than the endless joke.
