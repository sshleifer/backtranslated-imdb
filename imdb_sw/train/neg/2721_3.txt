I am a great fan of sci-fi 50s, but this is not one of my favorites. While the concept behind the movie was a natural car for the flick classic teeny bopci sci-fi, the partition director too much on it to carry the movie. Obviously he was working without money, because the whole movie is full of debates that continue and continue forever. I have never * seen a lot of time-killed on the film. <br /> <br /> There is probably less than 60 seconds of "blob pictures" on the entire film, and more of it are people involved in a lot of wrong-written, running-on conversations. It was fun to see Steve M. and Anita C. together, but a beautiful heaven ... how to beat can think anyone in their right mind will believe them as young?
