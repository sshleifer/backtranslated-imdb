Where to start? . . . I feel ... violate! That's right, it's gone! I spent 1.5hrs of my life, 1.5hrs that I could do something more important, if you look dry color, on this is called fear panic. <br /> <br /> Its not scary, not funny, its not big, no action, nothing ... <br /> <br /> Its predictable, awesome, sad ... br /> <br /> I might come a little hard here, but watch this movie and you will feel the same way ... or ... no, don't look at it ... unless you want to feel the violation too.
