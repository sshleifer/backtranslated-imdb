Dave goes through divorce and his thoughts are returning to his first love. "Wanders" maybe not a word. I should say he stops the old girl. He remembers the day when the relationship ended. The only dreaming system does not change hazy. He likes to remind their songs and places they liked. I'm not a consultant, but maybe this had something to do with a failed marriage? Dave goes to a support group and meets a half-year-old woman (also left) who, instead of being "offended" by her humility, begins to have her desire. What? How did I say Dave likes? Sometimes he describes himself in a third person. He can't move his hands when he walks, either. It's very strange. Also make a short story, Dave squares hunt Maria (old friend of gal) and kill him ... mistake ... I mean to deal with him. He does. Which was true. She believes him to be married, but she keeps half way around to meet him. He drives out his house to make sure that he alone, before "drop" on it. He has an unusual conversation with him that ends up sharing the Gospel of Christ in 10 or less words, and flying to a little girl. We enjoyed this film with the value of non-profit value. I'm still enjoying my wife and Dave's feelings .... "I heard another song of Dave & Mary!"
