About when they left this film on DVD. I know others say WB rush to release this film because of the movie Dreamgirls. But, how can you rush to the release of the films in your catalog since 1976. I have been disappointed with the release of this DVD film, no special feature, no sound 5.1 DD. come on the WB, you can do better then this. Sound and photo sounds on this movie require great help. It seems WB did not put too much time and attention to this film because it is a black movie and my own has the same sales. They could keep the CD which in a way that does not contain all the CD's original songs. <br /> <br /> I would like to recommend this DVD to purchase. Yes, because it is a classic film. But WB needs to go to add a more specific feature. Write notes from other group movies, Fifth War, or Experiments you could only see the performance, and the sound for all is too much, much better than this DVD.
