Apologizing to the movie is about anything! Rachel Griffiths should have a need for money. The film should be done on the lowest budget, because the lighting does not exist. I vowed if I ever saw Pete Postlesumthingor another one. I'd be happy to know if there are 1) plot or 2) script. My great regret I lost my time to look at this waste.
