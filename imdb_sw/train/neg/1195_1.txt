This is the worst movie I saw. I can't explain how wrong. I actually wanted to commit suicide several times through this furious experience just to have the end of pain. I recommend instead of seeing this film, you spread to acid then you will know at least part of the pain without all the scars. I had great expectations as I read back to the DVD, and at the beginning it added that Jesus was following me I was very excited ... then I wanted to kill myself. I mean twenty-three minutes of the introduction of many characters who refuse in the history of the movie ... JUST PAIN! Monkeys could do a good job of editing this waste. At least they would lose the stool and leave some trash. It would have been better to have not seen any fear. It was not that I had no joke, it was not just funny, they described themselves as twenty times. It seems, nothing is interesting unless you see it as a million times. Do not see this under any circumstances. People have inspected 'Manos Hands of Fate' as the worst movie of the world. I've seen it too and agree that it's bad ... but ALAS is just the worst. 'Fatty Drives Bus' is worse. This is worthy of all language types, but I can't write here we think I gave the whole question.
