What a terrible piece of garbage! Who are all the people who are concerned about how good this is? Yes, it is "arty"; and yes, it's "out", but .... that's not enough. This program is interesting and locked, as a real show but not so beaten slickly. <br /> <br /> People are within uninteresting; but if the characters do not have enough depth to feel compassion for them. If it is based on real people then I feel very sorry, very sorry for them. Violence (and some of it is very violent) seems to be angry and inappropriate. It is like a producer has a vision of Quenton Tarantino. It's not that I think so much about it, either. <br /> <br /> And oh yes: if I had neighbors like that, I would!
