I have no envy Barry Levinson, Rachel Weisz, Ben Stiller or Jack Black to make this film. It is, in one word, boring. Perhaps the most realistic reality, any Ben Stiller's role of loss or non-to-all makes this film just to forget. Even the appearance of Christopher Walken finished in a pleasant manner. I was shocked. I would like Ben Stiller's acting. I loved him in many of his films, last I saw before this was Duplex and Drew Barrymore and not bad. About Jack Black ... Well, far from the Great Honesty I've never seen him do a good thing. What about Rock School? Oops, it fears.
