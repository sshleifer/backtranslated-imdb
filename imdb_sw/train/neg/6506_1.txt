Unless you are a geeky film student who needs to see everything, this film will not only waste your time and money and a great desire, but will also make them more angry than faith. There is a good story to tell somewhere in the inside, but Hopkins decided to hide it and wipe it under a lot of enough sound video clips, making the viewer's patience run after a very short time. <br /> <br /> Why does a person like Hopkins chooses a very big, tough and unfamiliar project as its first script, the first and third score that can be used by anyones. Maybe he played it in his mind for so long that it was unknown as it was, even for himself. The results prove that he has insufficient experience or skills to achieve the desired results. Even the most incredible and lynch films, just the name of the non-uncoventional film film, had 90% more co-operation, 95% fewer characters and more than 99% of the stories. Sir Anthony focused on the stars, but unfortunately missed a few years. Please stick to action, in that department you are very big and no one should ask more from you, even yourself!
