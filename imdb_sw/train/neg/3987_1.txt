I went from a very small movie before it was finished, but I couldn't finish this waste. This was a big burden of racism trying to pass the film as legitimate since the "national birth". The characters were a bit more cut off with cards. I don't see how any actor will need his name to be associated with this film. Lee must have good things to do so to put garbage like this. I know that I and anyone who has a brain has better things to do .... like looking at the paint is dry. I would like someone to make a film about tribal relations that dealt with the real issue. There is much deeper to this issue the lack of a strict director like Lee.
