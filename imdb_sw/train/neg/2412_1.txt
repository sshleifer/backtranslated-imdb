This film is still another in a long line of no budget, no effort, no talent films on the video and given a photocopy immunization to give non-viewers to the video store. <br /> <br /> If you want to know what to watch this movie is like, grab a video camera with some color red color and film yourself and your friends walking around the neighboring night to grow and "attack" people. Congratulations, you've just made the "Hood of the Dead Dead"! Now see if the distribution company will give from you. I have seen a low budget, shot on video films showing talent from artists and artists or very little effort, but this doesn't. Avoid unless you are a true eyechist or misleading by inappropriate movies.
