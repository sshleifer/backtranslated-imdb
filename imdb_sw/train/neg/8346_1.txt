The head should be a leader. This uses 90% of the film to walk. He doesn't know what he wants, or what it is. Go through life carrying people identity for anything. You have no advantage, no money, nothing pretends to be someone else. No body could understand why he was pretending to be someone else. The only thing was clear in this film is that he loves his father and was a good child. But others were lost. It can be a director is a partner who would like to be someone else. But what he has to do is get a real job, because after his movie, I don't think he has a chance to act as a film producer.
