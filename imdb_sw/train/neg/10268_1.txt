Of course this is one of the worst films I have lost money! The plan is, erm sorry, do I say there was a plot? When the bright was when ..., the nope can not imagine one! The more specific effects that I had to hide under the bed cover was ..., the nope can't imagine one for it either. You knew who the murderer was right from the beginning. There is nothing shocking about the whole movie, in fact only two bits that were not interesting are when you saw a little sister, Misty, in swimming and when you saw Nurse Toppan take over. This film should be monitored to get an idea of ​​how not to make a terrible movie !!!
