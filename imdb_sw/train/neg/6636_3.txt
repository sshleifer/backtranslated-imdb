Some of the most beautiful natural performances I have ever seen. Which is probably not surprising due to the outgoing conversation, which was made by one of the remember characters. Add to it the cheap production values ​​and you have a movie that doesn't look like it on television. One does not have much hope from the Life film, especially this old, but this is almost unhealthy. Plot-wise, it is awesome, the clichéd romance of even the Harlequin type would consider under them. It is possible to guess how the rest of the film will go by simply watching several opening events. Surprise, the only character of the female who finds any view and the strange visitor takes the fall of love.
