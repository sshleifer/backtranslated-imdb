This film begins with a female wrapped in psychological torture. There is an adult woman in front, dead animals, dog dogs, a bladder female. All shot in gray color. It is suitable, but very little. Then we continue to see the boy of the BTK killer like now with his criminal history. The tension is quite psychologically and the killer's incidents go into the homes of its victims and talk to them for a long time and are creepy. Here we don't see a beautiful or beautiful picture, it looks like a shot with your home camera. It does not seem to be frightened, but through seeing a criminal involving his victims for a long time before killing them is common and unusual. What this movie does not have any game, in fact. There are some cases of cop every time, but no excitement in their search for a murderer. There is not much arc on this story. This can be a very psychological thriller, a study of madness. Unfortunately, the movie is filled with pictures of real killings. It spreads in every movie and comes suddenly from time to time. Sometimes you don't know it's coming and don't have enough time to look away. And that I must refuse. I am with the awesome low-budget movies but I can't tolerate the suffering of animals. Not needed, excessive, and comes without warning. I am glad that Lionsgate offers things that no one else does, but they should pass on this film or edit it out of the animal. Keep away from this litter.
