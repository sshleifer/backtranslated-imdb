I just watched it. He laughs, but nothing to write at home about. Jason Lee appeared as if he was happy. The (long) DVD gag reel has almost the only she fits the irreplaceable laughter. Selma Blair appeared striking at an hour, but again, his behavior was supposed to be a stick in the mud, so "well" I think? Jim Brolin was amazing amazing. (Married to Babs can not be a picnic.) The sound of the voice was hip, and eclectic. Larry Miller, who played with the father of Julia Stiles (for hilariously), in 10 things that I hate about you are funny here too. She is good, but the best feature of this film is made by Julia Stiles. I was able to spend two hours looking at her laundry, and I felt like I did.
