This is one of the worst changes in the music film made. The version of the Chorus Line version is amazing. This movie loses a score almost every way. Even cast it hard. Take Landers Audrey as Val. "Dance 10 Looks 3" is a song of Val. Val's story is that he is a good player but is 3 in the visible department. Yes, it gets a solution, but eventually she is a good player. What do brilliant traders do? They employ an actor who cannot play and is known for watching. The way to lose the boat. <br /> <br /> Then there is a choreography. I'm sure Michael Bennett was turning to his grave. Why didn't they use his choreography? In fact it cannot be improved on.
