A popular filmmaker from the producer Charles Band. In the last month of the Full Moon Band, he said that he could not make "real films" because he felt that small strokes and many creatures added a fantasy element that made the film very well - so people kill each other so true and unworthy. The good filosaph and the true shame that Band, after destroying the full studio of the Moon through tribal business activities had greatly reduced the benefits of home movies that began to do what the loved ones of Blockbuster wanted and therefore gave the creation and originality. The back team also worked on 'Delta Delta Die!' and 'Rite of Reproduction' - all similar to bland and Full Moon rates. Debbie Rochon is on top of the most common form here as a newbie for a group of dudes and dudettes who decide to create a story about 'murder club'. He - like one of course - does everything he can join and then panic sets because it was not a true story and silly Mrs. Rochon believed and now everyone will have to run around covered in blood and maybe kill or maybe not. The option is and about this film is yours ... it doesn't recommend but it's not so bad.
