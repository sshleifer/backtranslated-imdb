Well, I bought the blood trilogy of Zombie thinking it would be fun without gory fun. That's what, without fun. This film really does not mind, does not exist any plot or character development, or any kind of story. The basic problem with this movie is to kill and gore. Basically, every kill looks similar. ZOmbi drives someone off. Yes, that's okay, but you need some nature also kills. I mean that it is very blind, every kill looks the same, done in the same way. That's what killed me. I love the year, and that in this film is not worth anything. It was just boring. There is no storyline, a typical crash case often with a different person. I wanted to love this film too. I like to beat video videos of ... as Redneck Zombies. But I couldn't find a baby. This film has good points, but none of these are in the film. I understand that many "zombies" have been supported by floods and there were more than 100 zombies, which are so cold as to have many people involved and assisted in the world. But in general, this is a terrible film.
