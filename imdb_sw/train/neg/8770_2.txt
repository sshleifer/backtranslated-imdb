This film was the longest film and the record-breaking film was indeed had 30 actors After the DUSHMAN JAAN (2002) I think no one has guts to do something like that <br /> <br /> film as the head shows is the foundation of war Kargil but the problem is very large and romantic arrangements and the songs of many of them are boring It is a great freedom of movies like killing people with fiber, wondering what soldiers do? The direction of JP Dutta pales in front of the BORDER Music is equal to <br /> <br /> Out of the great effort Ajay Devgan stands long, Saif is very good in its part and also its first film and herbs, Abhishek's favorite Manoj Bajpai has Sanju's time lost, Suneil is the same Akshaye Khanna is doing her best to relax it Rani is good, Esha is resting right
