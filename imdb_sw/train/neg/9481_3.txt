James Bishop (Matt Stasi) is going to the center of "psychiatric psychiatric" for the work of medical housing with Dr McCort (Bruce Paynes). There, he knows that many local people are killed by 'Ripper', who takes their souls to the devil, in a popular worship by Dr McCort. This story is very strange and imbecile that it is impossible to write a summary. This conversation is ridiculous, especially when the character of Helen, the lover of James Bishop's blonde arrived in the reserve, that it is impossible for the author to have the courage to bring them into the screen. And what about the return of James to the hospital to bring the files of the dead patients? And cast, composed of actors of ham and actors? In fact, I don't know who or who is the worst in this film: screens, director or cast. The correct answer is all true. I saw this flick on cable television, and I wonder how the producer can spend money on the waste. This horror movie becomes very funny based on the absurdity of the plot. My vote is three. Headline (Brazil): 'Dem√¥nio' (`Devil ')
