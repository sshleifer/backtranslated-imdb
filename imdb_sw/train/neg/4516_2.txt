I bought this DVD set, eyes of appearance, and you want me not. The script is required to write again because it appears to be completely impaired and balanced in comparison with the book. Lighting is very bad, not very good, but if it was just that I could look at it. Script does not consider enough on the characters ... there is hardly the introduction of different characters to make tad difficult to distinguish who is (especially in flight - no idea who dies when). <br /> <For a long time I found that the key of a good film is to get the audience to care about the characters; if you don't have nothing. There was no focus on the characters - you never knew them - who they were, what they liked .. what made them do the things they do. The series is 5 hours long and divided into 6 pieces ... I beta are wondering what they did all the time if they didn't have more details of the characters â€” they put a lot of filling .... I will say at least all the time you use to watch the ground and stop their LOL flight (I mean we really need to see it again and again). I would like to give this top score only if we improve our ability of characters.
