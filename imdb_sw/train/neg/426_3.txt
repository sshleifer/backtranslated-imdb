Do not make a mistake, the movie is good, the shots are wonderful, and the material is wonderful. However, it was a great disappointment and I was really left out by what Disney has done. <br /> <br /> The World World World was all over and above. It was a trick. It had a general sense of equality and showed a complete cycle of life and death. There was a tragedy and victory, losing and getting. It was balanced. The Disney World Editor is not this. They tried to make it our Americans to talk about. They made it DRAMATIC. They mark the top of the music there to scare us. They did evil things. They did bad WALRUSES. They showed every encounter as negative. It tried to be concerned with success, but at the cost of equity lesson. The film was an hour and a half displayed negative with just 10 minutes of positive. <br /> <br /> I am to prevent international warning, but this was on a high political junk and environment. It's something else, I went to see it on the big screen, but I was desperate in the quality of the image. It seemed best on my TV home. <br /> <br /> If you want to see something like this and get the whole picture, get out and buy, lease, or borrow the BBC's World Planet series. It is the best lessons, the best sound, and (if you have Blu-Ray) the best quality of the image.
