You know when you're on the bus and someone decides to tell you the story of their life, and you sit there with a delightful smile on your face all the time you want to do is beating a fool and going away? Well I had the same feeling when I watched this film. Well, I decided to go and see Aprile, and I knew about Nanni Moretti's taste by pretending to be one star and alone from Caro Diario, but after half an hour of this recent phase from the memoirs I wanted to give Moretti allegations of all stripes. Caro Diario was amazing, odd, and at least other characters were able to find the word in the edge. In April, however, Moretti has a special right to negotiate, so that each hearing for an hour and a half is so well-known on how its politics are best, or is a quirky quote of popular culture that fits its concept at the moment. It also finds time for filing films that do not like, something that I thought was stored for lost people like me. Certainly in a position like him you think he could try and give a point on the movie a little more than this. By making a good film, one with some ideas and a decent structure, or maybe one that has never been completely out of its angry tone. And as she started to tell her newborn baby, I wanted to go and have an ordinary person, especially not the film director who was busy with a tacky music player. Sometimes a person who doesn't know he tries to tell you their story of life, give them a slap from me. Each blow will be a small victory in the fight against Morettiism.
