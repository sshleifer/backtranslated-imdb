TOM BROWN <br /> <br /> Ratio: 1.78: 1 <br /> <br /> Type of voice: Stereo <br /> late 19th century England, young Tom Brown (Alex Pettyfer) is used in a public school in Rugby where he has experience of the new headmaster reform (Stephen Fry) and stands for school, Flashman (Joseph Beattie). <br /> <br /> Already the subject of many changes to the screen - especially the version of Gordon Parry of 1951 - the old version of Thomas Hughes is available in the 21st century treatment, with respect to the image writer Ashley Pharoah (film director "where the heart") and director David Moore (THE FORSYTE SAGA). It is good enough, and it looks, but it is also a staid and evil, known only by the true performance of Fry as the new prince decided to cancel off more than the most "traditions of the school", and with the introduction of new stars possible in 14 Pettyfer age of years, a talented child with a variety of unsurpassed and beautiful charm that should take him all the way to Hollywood and more. Otherwise, this is a TV fodder of the UK, a variety of things proposed by the desire to fill the timetable with the 'prestige' of the product, even one disappearing like this. The UK 'Radio Times' newspaper described it as “very odd” and lifting the eyebrow on “all of the widespread and brutal and good, rakish villain sparking life out of the beautiful sweet young”. Okay.
