I think I have seen all the movies of Grisham now and in general they are very poor, except for Rainmaker, but this is bad is wonderful! where the behavior makes the stupid things that no one will do. He is a lawyer for Christ. Why when his children are lost does not provide Police. That's really because all the police hate lawyers so they just ignore and let them be attacked. When being arrested for murder they allow him to go free, he will be bound to the cell waiting for the bail hearing. Why you can draw your children around the world when you can easily save them at home. The police are not concerned to try to find a saved mental patient, they are not worried about questioning his daughter. <br /> <br /> To finish with ignorance ?? <br /> <br /> In summary, silence, untrue and full-time waste. ?? One of the worst films made.
