Modern Secret 2 is more apparent than 4 films, for there is not a lot of conspiracy, acting bad, very good and some cheesy joke. But. And this is great but there is a good actor, a good regular player, and a good start. The best actor Tim Curry, a good player is always an impressive pastor, a weird and disgusting hand who always makes a cringey but laughs with the right things. With a good start is the spoof of Excorsist. Awesome Movie Movie 2 is the main characters from the original and the host of new characters along the way are invited to stay night for the old creepy house, but will they live at night? This movie is not very good but if you bored you can also check it!
