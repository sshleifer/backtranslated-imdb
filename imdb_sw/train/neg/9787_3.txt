... but the problem of this production is that it is very far from good music. In fact, one can not always expect confident masters like Sondheim or Bernstein or Porter; but this piece of music makes even Andrew Lloyd Webber look like a witch. It is very bad and unknown (for one or two) and just after looking at it I don't remember one important voice - which is rather sad for someone who has learned other people from three listening. It is also a wonderful non-exhibition. It happens at a very large stage (one of the true ones feels those in the front columns that have broken their neck to see something happening 50 meters on the right or 100 meters on the left) and is not really worth it. While it is thought that one person is singing in action, that's just what you get - and the whole point of pain is empty. For me as the director of exciting games was difficult to watch. The truth remains, Cole Porter seems to have captured the French culture in its better works than these non-talent can come close. And I wonder how popular this music would be.
