Dolph Lundgren broods and eliminates its way through mysterious / awesome secrets that are not nearly as cold as the box would believe. He is really good here, but the story is a mess of pictures of the B-movie (detectives, revenge, tycoons, hookers, S & M) that seem to be built when they continued. The film takes a little in the second half but with the flick of Lundgren's most honorable, leasing SCORPION RED instead.
