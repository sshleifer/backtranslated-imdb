I chose this film to replace the bad choice of day television and go with my fatales thirst. In fact, it is better than daylight television .... although I don't know how much. It has its marks but after the first 20-30 minutes, good shows the pot and one comes to the conclusion that they are looking for a TV movie that was not too much time to do something that will share it together . In short, the Sci Fi kind of awesome movie. It has its points like the future is dirty, like "Crocodile player" demonstrated ..... of course, this is not "Bamba Player". Captain watches, kind of feels like actor Robert Forster, the kind of person who might want to be around. But unfortunately, instead, it may have felt like "Andromeda" badly repeating where the muscles of Employees have a poor copy of the intellectual "Aliens" attackers, historically the vampire willow more sex, and new Captain can also be like Jan-Michael Vincent around the "Island of Class" in "Splits Banana"; he just wearing uniforms and pieces; he has very little rights. They are all walking around their version of the castle inside a ship that looks very much like 'Eureka Maru' when they are fighting the class of 'people' involved with the world and are broken into different ethnic groups or different categories of evolution ....... Nietzcheans in "Andromeda". It can be a feature of redemption with Michael Ironside, but over time, one feels that he took part as a hoot! Perhaps he was delighted to do so, but it is not suitable for many movies. <br /> <br /> It's ..... "right". Similar to the way one can view the DVD immediately without locking it; if they look at the ads, they will probably change the channel. One can look at it immediately .......... but after a few hours, they don't know what made them look at all. <br /> <br /> For me, that was the fatale of women. ............ when he fought.
