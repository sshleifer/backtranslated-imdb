This movie did not exist with the Bible. It leaves Christ completely on the movie. It does not show the rapture or second coming of Christ. Let's alone talk about it. It does not provide from the scriptures. The end times are called the great tribulation. Movie does not even show bad times. The seven cups, seven buttons and seven trumpets of judgment are reserved for the second second of the sea that changes its structure. Fighting Christ was killed 3 1/2 years in distress and that's how the movie ended. The only place they got was the two prophets. Nor did they use the names of doubt because it would be so close to the truth of Scripture. The worst part I liked to be a good movie. I wanted to take people not saved. I feel that movies are bad. It's just a fake like everything the devil does. I hope that it is not suitable for the next film based on the left books. <br /> <br /> The second problem with the movie is just bad. Bad work, bad effects, bad plot and bad habits. I have seen the best events of Vice Miami.
