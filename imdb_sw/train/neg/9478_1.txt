If there was an Oscar Academy awarded an extraordinary award, this flick could win all. It has all the gods, good plot, very special effects and very good acting skills and of course in every role there is a celebrity star. Well, this could be the situation if the world was interrupted, but not. Rather it is the worst flick of fear ever made, not just the evil actors who seem to read the script from the teleprinter and dyslexia, but also very low on special effects. For example, the devil's clothing (which is a must-see-way), is something that most people have ever seen. Whenever I saw that the black red so called monster on the screens I couldn't hold my laugh back. And on things it looked like a funny creature was transported by a conveyor belt. Do not make the same mistake as I did. Looking at IMDB to see that the movie was released in 2003, it had less than five votes and imagine: - "Well, it's worth the shot, it can't be bad". <br /> <br /> Yes can. <Br /> <br /> I'm not going to lose more words on this film.
