Most of the French films that I have seen - and enjoy - they were more talk than action, but that's okay. I have seen it interesting, well-photographed with exciting actors. (However, one day I was wondering if Gerald Depardieu was in every French film made! It seemed like a way.) But it became a conversation, talk and talk more .... which is good for the celebration but not for the secret of murder. After a short time, I almost slept this night. True, the film was more to play with all the pictures provided in the same room. So, if you like to play, you should love this ... but I want a little more of the story of murder.
