Three stories have been told in this film, which seems to have been hit without this knowledge of a vignette film together. Creators speak three vignettes because they are all connected and deprived Martin Kove, although you can't see some of the topics with Kove. The first Vignette has sexy Vivian Schilling, a woman is afraid of everything under the sun (does Adrian Monk watch brave), with an evening of paranoia laced home alone. You will shout for Vivian by doing some stupid things. She spends most of her time on the night that shows her amazing features. But his film is worse if not more to give him a nail. The second Vignette is owned by Bill Paxton as he shows someone who lives from hell. His village citizen allows him to take full advantage, and Bill does so whenever he can. The last Vignette was as horrible as the fear of which death would take him at any time, such as his pal who motivated death in the olive. It is not very interesting, as the whole movie seems to be cut off with very little thought involved. Must be for fans of Paxton Bill.
