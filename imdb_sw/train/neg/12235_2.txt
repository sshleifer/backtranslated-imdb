If you want to know what kind of white people heard in 1974, this is the film for you. But you will have to listen to the many sounds of flappers and browsers, too (see my words on My Girl 1 for memory) look at his predecessor. But as the pastor prepares to put in the search of my mother's mother, my 2 girl made me look, with her head looking for a mother. Put another way, whatever I liked about My Girl 2 had nothing to do with my girl 2, but it relates to the protagonist who asks, as many agree, "who is my mother"? And if there are my mother's movies in the acting group, I'll be sure to make my own movie about it. <br /> <br /> People don't know. Movies should not have a list. My girl 2 (like My Girl 1) is ... without a list. Avoid it unless you are a perfect sample that is comforted by a series of small annoyances.
