This is probably the worst movie I saw in my life !! It was ridiculous there was no plot and special effects were ignorant! And I've never seen the worst act in my life! Just a good part about the movie was all hot people (especially Drew Fuller). I don't know what these people thought when they made this film !! I didn't even need to finish anything because you get to this point in the movie where all the boys sleep in bed. I mean it was like some kind of kiddy's sick and distorted sex! I would like to advise anyone who has heard of this film and was willing to see it just to forget about it and get another movie to watch! I was shocked! The whole movie was a perfect waste of time in my opinion.
