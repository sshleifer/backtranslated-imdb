That's the trouble I have with movies coming on television, when there is nothing else to look at. I somehow got into a very bad movie. But this was definitely visible. The idea of ​​being alone left on earth after the comet, then looking for zombies is almost making me laugh. And that's why I gave you this film 2, instead of 1. The story was stupid… but in that way it makes you (very stupid). I think I just watched it because the boy from Star Trek was a guest. I was surprised to see him as a little boy ... and was the only character of funny yet.
