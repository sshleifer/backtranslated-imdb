"The dream of the US" is officially closed, in my opinion, and "It's Pat!" for MOVIE WORST OF ALL TIME. Seven friends (odd similar to the K-Mart version of "Friends") gather in a coffee shop to listen to America's night, showing the pleasure of pirate. It's a host with a beard. That's the most exciting feature of his show. Chandler, Monica, Joey; Nor do they know, ignorant nurse / skilled listener is listening ... <br /> Crazy nurse continues to torture Ross and Rachel and ... wait, sorry again ... to make their fears live. These fears include such stunners as "voodoo" and have decreased by old women and teeth. Number / number. True. <br /> <br /> This movie was, in a word, rotten. Crazy Nurse Spree murderer is not inspired, nothing to do the viewer "fly," the last blow, and-again-voodoo? <br /> <br /> If you are not entirely guilty of your loved ones, rent "Go to the United States" with them. When you take care of your loved ones - even a little - go to your local Blockbuster, rent all copies of the "American Nightmare" and hide it on your freezer.
