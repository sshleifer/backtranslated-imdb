Swedish movie stages have passed a few years ago in something that is complicated by American movies like "Temperature" but with a small budget. This film follows the same drugs as "Tolerans Noll" and "Livvakterna". However, it is obvious that they are struggling to make a cool and hard film. The story has been shown earlier, the discussion feels fake and acting is very poor, especially from the main actor. The movie tries to draw a picture of hard-boiled military forces without a very sad and a female inquiry who completely lose with old problems but at the same time quite practical actions. Not very successful. <br /> <br /> The image of the blue image is no longer visible, and it has not been properly done on this image. Just very few scenes really look good. Also, the voice is very strange and it looks like many conversations are written later. <br /> <br /> The main technique of this movie is Stefan Sauk, although it is not suitable for the photographs of the SWAT team leader, has certain true lines. Also, music is very good.
