There is very little here about the wonderful book of Anne Rice here which is a trivial matter. Some characters - intense and awesome characters - do not make the screen completely, and those who make use of water are sure that there is no reason to be. Where is the relationship between Christophe and Marcel? Where is the matter between Marcel and Juliet? Why Dolly Rose looks completely, since her story has never been described? Where rape and redemption of Marie, whose great reputation (and decline) is that she can pass white - with her marriage to Richard? Why does the film end and beat Marcel into his father's hands? We do not know anything of Aglae than that she is a bitch who hates her husband; why no backstory to describe this hatred? <br /> <br /> For displays, there is no one that is better than chaos, though it is possible due to the lousy script. The best is that of the actress playing Richard - but Richard hayu on the screen enough to salvage the film. Worse is Jasmine Guy as Dolly Rose, though again, comes down to the actor and has nothing to do with what little she was given to work with. <br /> Everything, this is just awesome. I thought it would be impossible for any Anne Rice book to turn out to be worse than EXIT TO EDEN, but IN ALL WORK makes that aggressive seem like a key hit. What? What if Rice is such a slut that he will allow his best works to be such a junk on the screen?
