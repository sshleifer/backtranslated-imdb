Modern Movie 3 (2003) was a bad idea to start. The last film was a great effort. Keep close to this load, it's a classic comedy. When two parts were full of humor and cheap shots, at least it was delightful. There is nothing surprising about forced humor. Jokes, crops and visual eyes should be normal. Blowing the viewer on the head and the joke of fat is not cold. Humor in this film was faced with young vibeciles who will laugh at nothing. When faced with a high school crowd, any self-respecting effort was expelled from the window. The blows are not funny. I have looked at the comedies since 1998. They are dated. Michael Jackson's joke is not cool. What's the worst is the disgusting two that has been "artists" whose days were not present. The American cinema death has been slow. Movies like this are nails that are put into the coffin. What happened to real humor? I do not laugh loudly in movies for a long time. Many times of evil have broken the brain. Want a confirmation? Go to your mega video rental store and see what is on the shelf. This movie is bad. Don't believe hype. I would like to watch the Scary Movie 2 in the loop going on than to suffer for this bad comedy again! It doesn't matter (unless you have a few brain cells).
