This horror movie is very weak ... that's like this is the right movie I say. There is no horrible thing going on if the family takes a little German Shepard player. I had a German Shepard and a very good dog. I didn't get the idea of ​​getting one from this film though, but instead of comedy "K-9". That's all the other stories together though. This movie does not have a lot of feeling at all if the awesome scene ends and it seems to be happy. Also, we see a boy almost put his hand into a lawn farmer. That's about it. This father condemns something, however, if his family seems to be strange, somewhere they find if they hold the glass while they sleep, you can see as they are. All in the most horrible movie of fear even on television levels ... TVs are working out like "This House" is good and there is another movie of haunted houses about a woman with these wonderful creatures which are also good . This is especially quick.
