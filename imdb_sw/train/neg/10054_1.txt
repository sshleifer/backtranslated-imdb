I'm not alone in loving the first movie of Superman, a film that Richard Donner did well. I am also not alone in offending Superman 2 of Richard Lester ... which brings us to cut Richard Donner of the same film, sadly it is absolutely disgusting. The world of Superman is one where the suspension of unbelief is needed in severe measurements, but Superman 2 places things far too far. No matter who led Superman 2 because the script inspires the first farmer's mind. For there is no plot because the characters have a zero influence to act as they do, unlike the natural superman. For or without its power, Superman's power (or lack thereof) is done in a more reliable way. There is much to blame, so I won't bother. I criticize this film ... maybe slapstick in the version of Lester most suited to this moronic movie script. Super-Duper bad.
