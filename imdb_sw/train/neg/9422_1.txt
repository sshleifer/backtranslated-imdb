This film describes the experience of two men who hit (one of them Burt Reynolds), a boyfriend, and two tomatoes drag over a few hours a night in Miami. Story-story stories eventually bring all people together in one place and at the same time. The movie was entertaining gently, but the biggest problem is that everything happens at night and many scenes were literally clear-clear that it is impossible to see what is happening. In a few scenes you can actually see where they tried to “stretch” the process to develop to preserve the image. One didn't know how to make a camera camera. It is interesting that this film was released even!
