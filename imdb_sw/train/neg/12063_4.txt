The husband and wife of Bennie Fields and Blossom Seeley were the biggest stars in the vaudeville, but they made very few films. Like other artists of their age (George M. Cohan, Fanny Brice, Gertrude Lawrence) the most accessible film for Fields and Seeley is biopic about them, which are shown by other actors: 'Someone loves me', with Betty star Hutton and that Ralph Meeker, song song and dance. Inasawa, Fields and Seeley were so popular that the husband and wife of his fellow vice - actresses - Jesse Block and Sulfur Sully - came close to effectively making an identical act, being a "second team" and Seeley. However, stopping, there is a big difference in the life plans of couples. Seeley's farms lived in hotel centers, paying room service rates for each food they ate, and finally running for money. Block and Sully lived quietly with their investors wisely, living in good retirement. The first 30% of the most recent Vitaphone are taken by two pianist wearing spats. It seems that these two men had little value for their own name in 1930, though I had never heard of it. Finally, Fields and Seely run and start to do. They both have many horns, and they are very attractive. I was angry that all the musicians continue to make a move if they are going to dance, but they don't do it until even three of the three songs that make in this short. When they finally start freezing, the results were not interesting. I was glad to have this opportunity to see these two great actors make their act of baude. Now that I have seen, I understand why they were not stars in the music of the film. My estimation for this: just 4 out of 10, and I will keep with Block and Sully.
