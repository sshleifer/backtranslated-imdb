The terrible Hoofs are not just something of the 21st century. The way before the series of "Movie Secrets" there were a few examples of this type, especially in the 80s. Others like 'Elvira, Giza's Giza' increases more than that, but others like 'Saturday 14' and are unable to provide delivery. But out of all these types of films there is one very serious offender and that 'Transylvania 6-5000,' is a long-term loss for many reasons. <br /> Pros: The great Cast that makes it good. Some dopey humor is amusing. Documents, but the theme of the theme. Some of the beautiful Transylvanian areas. <br /> <br /> Material: Threadbare plot. More stimulating pacing. Many humor is not just cut. Monsters are given little to do with a little time screens. I thought this should be a spoof of monster movies? Ending information that the audience may be angry. <br /> <br /> Last thought: This is a comedy? If then why are the most amazing bits that are few and located in the middle? Fighting is supposed to raise us up, not our eyes and yawn, wanting to be over. I can't believe Anchor Bay released this junk fatigue. I will accept it not one of the worst films made, but it's not worth anyone's time or money even if you're a fan of any actors. See 'Transylvania Twist' instead. <br /> <br /> My rating: 2/5
