I was very excited about Margaret Atwood 'Robber''s novel, and I was surprised to see there was a film version. The woman closes the lover of the caterpillar for her own murder, and her friend, a former journalist, tries to cancel her name by looking at the female girlfriends dead. It is lucky that the script of the film has made Ms. Atwood's amazingly based on the story of these two men, the victims of the planned women .... Well, you have found me. If these people are mentioned in the book, and I am quite sure they have been created for the film, I will eat the dust cover of my hard copy. Apparently, three female characters of the novel do not have enough to carry the movie. Zenia's implementation was not interesting unless we saw it being done by someone, and one's life was covered. Roz, Charis, and Toni say their stories - to man. Because it is not important if someone does not listen. <br /> <br /> I liked the characters in the book. It's painful to see them pushing away from someone's story. I usually don't look for women's angles on the media, and I tried to enjoy the movie as it is. If I had not read the book, I would be very pleased with the film. So if you like a fighter and an old fighter, and you want to read more about them, you're out of luck. Read the novel, if you would like to enjoy the luscious smell and identity that came through the plot. It is the same plot: the movie broke, closed it, and sprayed it on men. It's like Zenia's revenge on Margaret Atwood.
