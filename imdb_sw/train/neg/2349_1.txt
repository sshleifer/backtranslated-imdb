There was a great film made by Steve Biko. Sadly this was not so. Denzel Washington - never more convenient for executives - can not quite show the great charisma that Biko had. The major events of Attenborough people are delicious. Soweto's murder was not like this, three beautiful lines of children (some doing paperwork!). And Biko died the film grows with farce. If the fight against discrimination was anything it was a fight of black people still somehow we all have to be introduced to the escape of a white man and his family. I'm sure Donald Woods was a good man and he would be the first to say that Biko was important when he wasn't. Penelope Wilton's judgment is a clean Hampshire and she looks quite unaware that she is South Africa completely. all the time. The Wood family dog ​​gets more lines than the black slave. Since the family runs out of one of the women I saw in the film - just one event about twelve black people in a great movie, the perfect concern "This is like a music sound." She was sure. This is generally a good film for good freedoms on the big black struggle. And in fact, South Africa needs liberalized colors as it needs a hole in the head.
