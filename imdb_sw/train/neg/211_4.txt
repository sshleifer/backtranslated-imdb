Hilariously definitely "drama" about a high school group (I think) kids who enjoy hip-hop non-stop, break play, graffiti and try to be dj in Roxy - or something. Be completely honest I was too tired to forget! Even people who love music agree with this film very much and - if the curves - failed to be damaged. We should find these children love and good. I've seen them ignore and stretch. What I really hated was Ramon. He makes graffiti on road trains and this looks good. Sorry? He loses public property that is not his start. Also these "good" children enter the city's electricity so they can hold a great dance party in the abandoned building. Uh hu. So we have to find a group of lawbreakers and lovers. I could forgive all if music was good but I can't stand hip hop. The songs were - the best - inappropriate and were not over! They are always playing! It came to the point that I was in a hurry to distribute through a number of endless music. (Cut music and film 30 minutes - maybe) There are a few numbers to think - to fight the subway dance, Santa's true number and the Roxy display of the weather. If you like hip hop here is your movie. But you are looking for a good game mixed in - neglect. Also this got the PG rating? There is an amazing amount of swearing in this.
