Baldwin has dropped so much to make such movies. Script, music, almost everything in this movie is a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Sound FX does not feel true, holds in many ways (technical gadgets etc.) Trying To make a film about things like this, at least try to get real and stop those sleeps of bleeps and beeps, because gadgets they do not make such a loud sound. Nature looks like the footsteps and these are not available, which makes the atmosphere like air. Turning it seems to be the same for a small budget budget (I'm sure it is a low-budget production), although it seems to be amateurish sometimes. Most characters seem to be empty and false, they did not prepare this movie very well. I would like to think it would be a better idea to make Baldwin speak Spanish than to make Spanish actors speak English, while we all know that they are the most vibrant and living language, that is why the performance of executives can suffer as a common language is used . I mean, eventually someone can realize how foolish it seems to be that the international actors say English with a bad feeling? It should be a long dead body in film production. The production team has ever heard heads? This movie will also be able to describe the European police as lazy and destructive, society as vulnerable and inadequate. I mean if the plot again goes like "Interpol can't make a jack, so let's call one America to bring this international union" or nothing. <br /> <br /> Sony Photo travels the same way as Columbia before it, just produce movies to hell. I would like to think of having a personal respect too. What? Buyers are required to buy a dirty title only because Sony places something good for a year? Maybe they should use the team as those who were doing Di Que Si - Say I Do. It is said in Spanish and Paz Vega and Santi Millan doing the best to keep the film. It looks and looks better! Come to Sony, wake up, reproduce, add more.
