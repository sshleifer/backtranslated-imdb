You need to watch this show once you have seen it all, the formula is the same in each section. Jim does his way through his means well but oppresses his wife, finally he finds that what he did is true for him, he stimulates his cheek and gives a gummy smile while looking for bashfully. Certainly the lines of the story are crippled and the formulaic that will take one moment now. <br /> <br /> The 'Valentines pay' time / $ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> every week pay has disappeared, then explains to him he lost on the casino. She screams and leaves the house crying as she has. Then Valentine's day comes back to the ticket and the ticket on the ball (so he explains the lost salary). He knows his mistakes 'and' normal 'Oh Jim, you are very good.' .. Another thing is the fact that the character of Jims depends on Homer Simpson who as a character of cartoons can get away from being fierce and ignorant, this time being tested by human beings do not work and Jim comes up as a jerk of personal pride. <br /> <br /> IMO The only reason that this is succeeding is because we are so many now for human and TV issues, these days you can make a show on someone who insulates the walls and you'd get the audience. 'Two and a half' men on the other hand are wonderful and hilarious.
