Since this image has been set to work on "clean entertainment" and since there is already a lot of views on it, I would like to address a matter related to the misuse of humor. We can see that Marlon Ways play a joker in this film. Indeed, as long as he is involved in the repair work, he has been working as a small-actor can change his usual outfit but he cannot change his physical and final changes that can be useful when necessary. Even so far from what I anticipated, I saw a very hidden image, pretending to disclose different aspects of child life for the offenses of a 40-year-old offender. And with the ultimate joy end. Why is it? Many factors have been confused, some of the chiefs are violence, sex and crime activities, which the story is very complicated and to some extent, they have no common sense: where Vanessa when the peace of her home is broken and her husband's life is fulfilled? In addition, diamonds are greater than Cullinan No.1 of the world! But the most serious link is the attempt to continue to make a small person like superman to show his weak points. And they call it. Medicine is valuable, hard and volatile; it cannot be cut by any other material but it only fails with the blood of the male goat. So it's not diamond but pieces of dirt.
