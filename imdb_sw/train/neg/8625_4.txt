In the impossible case that some directors who wish to read these comments, I would like to give advice (free of charge!), From the view of the viewer. If you want to make an incredible film, do it. If you want to make a spoof of an amazing film of adventure, continue. Don't try to do all at the same time, it doesn't work. For example, having a relief of "comic relief" attitude to kill and cut the head and follow up with a monkey shaking tree and dropping coconut over the cannibal head only lets you check if you had no IDEA movie type what you want to do. This is boring, meandering, cheap, exception .... you get the picture. Several good times and a few dirt tips from Kathy Shower (the way too prissy here) are not worth your trouble. There is a reason why everyone has forgotten about the existence of this film. (* 1/2)
