My favorite memory of this show and the band was when I was with a group of my friends who are NBB enemies and had a huge bonfire and we took a CD of their songs with a DVD movie and a group of pictures of band members and threw them into the fire dancing jig of fun around the burning objects when singing "Ding Dong The Witch Is Dead". That's the best thing about the show and this show is stupid and capitol God show this sucks. I love it very much. Remove the crappy car. You people exploit! You have completely destroyed the entire channel! There is nothing wrong or nothing but you need to get life, I mean, in fact, who makes a show of stupid and singer who can't even sing! You see a bad sound and they need to get life like hobo or something, except Roselina. He is very good. But yet, you men!
