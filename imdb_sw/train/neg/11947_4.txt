Interesting change from the first. there was more secret for this film then the first. Even when you have finished asking yourself what happened who was a murderer. There are some good parts through the movie, the first half begins slowly and then the last half grows. All of that movie enjoys. The story is 22 years after the events took place in the first film, Norman Bates out of the park and back to the Bates motel, but when a woman turns to claiming to be a real mother, things begin to deteriorate. Perkins enjoys again the old Norman and the last place was very good, he swang who played very hard.
