The film looks like if the director was forced to make this film with a group of terrorists. it should be called a crap of dino. nothing is good about this film. Even executives do not have a penny value. don't waste your time watching this film. The director should be shot at the head with the thought of creating such a bad film. I mean not embarrassing to look at the faces of people after seeing his movie? The dinocroc looks like it was done in a powerful point with a lot of cutting-and-setting. and his old story. man plays god. builds a creature. they run and enjoy eating people. and finally a beautiful girl and a boy in a sleeveless shirt comes and kills. bla bla .. u you will see a plot in the first 5 minutes of the movie
