As always, I do a dash of shade to see movies that I have not yet looked at in anticipation of Oscars. I had been eager to see this film as it seems to be the same on my journey. I can't really understand why this film has found the other buzz. No stories! A group of boys around Iraq. One day they are here against the bomb. Tomorrow they look around the country, and they themselves are not down and start taking the sniper fire. No waiting here they return to Bagdad. No stories of cooperation at all. The three main characters are the most important features that are just a picture. Since I mean, we have a good child who is afraid to die. We have a hard soldier who is real and wants just to return safely. And then we have a daredevil cowboy who does not follow the law but has a soft spot to the boy's old Iraqi boy trying to sell soldiers DVDs. What do you think will be done ??? Well, do you think a cowboy soldier who does not follow the law will get a good child injured by his rebellious ways? Why yes! What? Do you think the Iraqi child that a cowboy soldier has a soft spot to kill you and make him mad? Why yes! There is no story here. Script is young and predictable! The camera has shaken all over to make it look "very". And all of you who think this is a great picture of the war, go to the rental "Full Metal Jacket", "Deerhunter" or "Platoon". Don't waste time or money on this boring movie!
