This was a very interesting movie; I've got music to be effective for this. Photo Mario took in the village also did not have ignorance. However, I had three problems with this film. One is that the lights were so dark so sometimes it was hard to tell what was going on, but this could be just my copy. The second thing is that at first it is not very well explained and I still do not know what's going on there. The third problem is that I didn't understand the end, but it seems some people are doing. Of course there are also common problems of people who do stupid things, and male leadership is very 70s. All in all, you are not wanted but even even close to that favorite.
