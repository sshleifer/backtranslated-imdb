This, for lack of time, the movie is lousy. Where do I start ...... It seemed like a camera was being lost from camera to camera. Perhaps they had only one camera. It gives you the feeling of being volleyball. <br /> <br /> There is a bunch of events, of course, thrown without continuing. When they did 'split screen', it was amazing. Everything hit on the flat, it seemed to be worried. <br /> <br /> Tons of colors were off. These people need to learn how to balance the camera. This 'movie' is not done, and is not done well. <br /> <br /> Plan - You need to be a partner. If I was an SS agent, I would charge the producers. it looks like a brother of scores and radios and guns. Sutherland was in her '24' status - I can see this for free. Eva Longoria would have been better with a little bit, and much more to show. If the action of the action did not amount. <br /> <br /> I couldn't see a real plot, except Douglas boinking the President's wife. He never said why the soldiers were trying to kill the pres. I don't see the US President running for his life in the building of the building building, like a mouse on the maze. p-l-e-s-e. Hollywood is dead. This movie is a confirmation. I would like 'big screens'. For since I was a child. More than 'movies' like this and I will stop going. What's the Hollywood issue, made so many flicks, forget how to make a real movie? If I had a hall, I would like to run old movies. The one who has real actors, beautiful stories of the story - with beautiful pictures of the picture. <br /> <br /> This 'movie' is a dog. Don't waste your time or your money. I rate the 'movie' is zero! Douglas is not recommended for this role. I can look at his age, but his justice is a lot of wimp carry this.
