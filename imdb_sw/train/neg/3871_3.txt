I'm trying to have a great goal when I look at a small budget movie. I also use less weight for the production of self-budget and less against massive budget production. I look forward to almost innocent due to high budget production and their studio. So I use the strict criteria for the main studio radio. But this film was just dud. Period. The cluster was awesome. The main character, Mary Gordano (Alicia Silverstone), was not possible as a senior high school and an unresolved appetite. There was not enough depth in his character or acting that attracted him to his world. Also, to make this film more amazing, the lights on a certain screen did not impress you, especially in the store. Once again a desperate film that I could only give three points.
