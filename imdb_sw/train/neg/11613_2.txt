An awesome film with Frank Sinatra as Tony Rome. Here, he is associated with a dead woman under the sea. Rome takes a short time to find out what happened to a woman. Usually, it is a woman under the sea. His dictionary, Lainie Kazan's wife, recently raises his death on the floor. Richard Conte was sick with a friend of Rome. When the local owner is killed, the blame falls to Rome and attracts them to follow the area. That's bad how this picture is as dependent on the location of the track to take action. <br /> <br /> Raquel Welch plays beautifully with his neck. His work leads to a great demand. Martin Gabel is a rehabilitator who his son tries to evict. <br /> <br /> By the end of the film, you do not know why the girl was killed. Don't worry about asking.
