More movies I can easily sit, even if it's not like the film. I am the kind of person who knows the good film even if I don't like genre. This is the first movie I couldn't stand looking. Cat in the hat is the worst movie I saw - and I saw many films. Acting is the same (Myers is good as a cat, it's just that he is really angry). Silly song songs are boring and interesting, even for children in the audience. The program pushes and continues, and the audience should suffer through poor dialogue. The "envy" words of parents are disgusting, not pleasant (I remember bad ideas about the garden hole compared to, well, the kind of people call "ho"). Although the film was very small, it seemed to last for it. Don't waste your time. I know young children who hated this film. If children cannot stand up, I don't know how any adults can. I would like to erase more about this film but I don't even feel like losing time again writing these comments about it. I WANT IT! So, in short, do not use 90 minutes of your life to look at this! Check out the beautiful movie! <br /> <br /> star 1/10 - the lowest review I gave to the movie.
