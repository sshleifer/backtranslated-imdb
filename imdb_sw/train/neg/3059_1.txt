In fact I recently got a chance to rent this and check out Santa Claus overcomes the marine. Although children were more in SCCTM, I would say that Santa Claus was the worst movie. As a Spanish work in Spanish 5 we all had to look at it. I'll tell you, usually when we look at the movie we all talk and we eat food, but not for this film. Everyone sat there jaw looking for Mr. Bad Pitch to go next. Can Merlin help Santa Claus?! or did his robot robot come and save that day? I would like to recommend leasing because it is a big part of the garbage that I have seen and love it for. : D
