When William Shater can make me an exciting in whatever is seen, (and I especially love him like Denny Crane in Boston Legal), well, this show is about glitz and playing girls and screaming and jumping up and down. > <br /> You don't have any Millionaire skills, no Make or No Designs. <br /> <br /> This view is all about play and stupid things to fill in time. <br /> <br /> I looked at it just to watch it. I watched it for 45 minutes, then I had to turn it off. The best part was William Shatner playing in action. She is hoot !!! unfortunately, this show can not do. It has been given
