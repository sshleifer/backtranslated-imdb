There are no providers here but I've been a fan since the Dead Waking started but the last series, which only 3 have been up to date is bad. Stories are not the same as the original idea of ​​the series. I got these 3 in a series of series series. As a BBC licensor, after the show I wrote a BBC complaint to pass my desire. I am wondering that the Trevor Eve caliber actors and Sue Johnstone did not reject the story lines. These vendors have had these characters for 8 seasons, a few can see that they have lost all direction. It is a good job is the last series or second series you can start with a team to explore the death of the Christmas Father! Paul Bentley, West Yorkshire, England.
