Nicole Eggert was listed as a star of this, despite Micheal Dorn & Stacey Keach being a much bigger star than she. This is basically a bit of spin on the film "Alien Earth Earth". Eggert has a girl who feels sympathetic to an alien expulsion by the military and takes a runaway creature in a very hiding place. A bit of deception and discrimination, all of the unwanted sex includes all along the way. The video is facing small pieces of paste with enough jokes about the image display. I was very fond of Star Trek jokes when Micheal Dorn was taken and found a real death scene. It was clear that Stacey Keach would have to be taken by the film had a weak end, it would be nice to show what kind of guest talent was passed through Eggert.
