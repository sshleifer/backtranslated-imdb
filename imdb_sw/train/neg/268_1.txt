Cultural differences can not overcome easily, loyalty should win, but everywhere the team comes to receive any doubt and start ordering people almost as they are their elected leaders. Of course real fans will say they are known as gods. People who meet them should be surprised by their technology and accuse them of magic and so on. 3 Background background: no.

As children show, they can make a bridge, but anyone who has little knowledge of human behavior and language cannot hold even the first 1 seasons of the season, as I did. I really wanted to believe that I had seen a good sci-fi show, otherwise I would like to close and clean my computer for the first five minutes!
