Well, at least my sports sports team did, lol. So I remember looking at Grease since I was a little girl, when it was never my music or story, it still makes very little space in my heart since it's still very fun to watch. I heard bad things about Grease 2 and that's why I have never decided to look, but my partner said that not all the bad and my friend agreed, so I decided to shoot, but I called and just laughed. First off the plot is stolen completely from the first and not clever, not just mentioning the same characters, but with different names and executives. Tell me, How did the Pink and T-Birds women live years after the previous left group? Not to mention the creator of the face of the enemy's circle, gee, what is similar to the guys in the first film and also the T-Birds were just ignorant and anxious. Another year in Rydell and music and play did not stop. But when a new student who is Sandy's cousin comes into the area, she is a love that was made by a pink woman, Stephanie. But you must stick to a code where Pink Women just should be connected to T-Birds, so a new student, decides to teach as a T-Bird to win his heart. So he is dressed as a cyclist of the rebels who can climb well and defeat bad bicycles for easy cutting of T-Bird corals. But will she tell Stephanie who she is true or will she learn herself? Yes, know for yourself. The grate of 2 looks like a TV show of some kind of non-working. The group did not open it as the first Grease did, without mentioning the return of the French was a little and unreliable, because I thought that she had graduated from Rydell, but apparently did not. These songs were not very interesting; I am glad that Michelle was able to boast very quickly, but perhaps because she is the only one with the talent in this unseen sequel, I would not recommend you too much of this film, unless you want to, but I warned you, this is an awesome attempt to make a lot of money from popular music. <br /> <br /> 2/10
