Goodnight, Mister Tom begins in a very unlikely village in southern England where the sun always seems to shine. Before we had a great idea about the time we hear the radio announcement of World War II declaration. Recently a steam train brings the children of refugees from London and while little William is busy with excitement, Tom's surprise (who you know just will have a heart of gold) our story begins. And> What is the load of a sentimental claptrap. In fact it is just an old odd husband of the husband. Are not new stories written? As I suggested there is no time to feel a village and not more in London except an unusual ambulance to walk around. And indeed no hint of fear of Blitz as a citizen of London file to gently in the air-raid shelter. Even when the school man is said to have been killed, he is later resurrected. I saw a 'Goodnight, Mr. Tom' motivated and obviously by John Thaw's highlighting a picture of Ronnie Barker of two Ronnies in his mouth making a priority for his country. My wife enjoyed this movie for all the reasons I did not like and check the other monitors who I seem to be for a few of the same. <br /> <br />
