I have been known to sleep during the film, but this is usually due to a combination of things including, very tired, being warm and beautifully on the sette and being just eating too much. However, in this case I slept because the film was garbage. The development of the plot was repeated. Regularly decreases and stretching. Things seemed to happen, but without explanation of what made them or why. I agree, I would have lost part of the film, but I looked at most of them and everything seemed to have happened personally without any real thing else. I don't know to recommend this film completely.
