This movie begins with a casual burial ... and it strongly emphasizes the common sense of funeral that I lost interest within 5 minutes of watching, and began to fly scenes. it seems to me who has made this film facing the amount of adherence in a permanent, incomprehensible thing other than death and destruction. well, I'm not one of the dark kids from Southpark, I want a movie that within 10 minutes gets me well in an interesting story, I will not look and watch 10 minutes without anything but preparation of funerals. maybe he would enjoy this "movie".
