I chose this DVD on Dollar Store. The DVD was on 2 rack of $ 1, but since it was Michael Madsen in it, I thought that since I had never seen the film, I bought it yet. <br /> <br /> I must say that I didn't have a 't like a movie. The movie played more like a document or religious advertising than anything else. I found that the player's use of flashbacks did not add to my story line. I would like to look at the line of the story in historical order. I will not give away as one of the other consultants, but it might be a short time before I would look at this film again. Who knows, since it was the first film of Michael Madsen's film, perhaps it could be worth memory in a certain future day.
