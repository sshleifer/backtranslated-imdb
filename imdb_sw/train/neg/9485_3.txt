Because some have gone to shorten the counsel, I would like to mention several points about this film. There might be destroyers here; I don't care to treat them out. <br /> <br /> - Given the low budget film, the design of the creature was quite good. It is actually seeing a horror movie of the direct video that has never been a bad CGI. Unfortunately the quality of the digital film is completely grainy in places, and it looks more in the white-open hall of storage. <br /> <br /> - Ridiculous lighting design pulse part of this film, say no difference in the passage of time. I understand the director may be trying to compare dementia, but in order for this to achieve the timely flow of the required time to start. Like-it, it seems only amateurish. <br /> <br /> - Plot twists were many but often predictable. I had no doubt in my mind of the identification of stone vendors, nor of the fact that some sort of badly-wrecking development could have reached the end. <br /> <br /> - This can be seen as a drawing, but the characters in this film honestly fail to employ any kind of common sense. First of all, the regulatory commission will be on a mental health center that has announced that unilaterally announced the arrest of the heart of patients and all characters. Why would a great psychologist be able to do independence? Why is it not a plot of action made by these amazing features, or of its introduction to its extraordinary religious choice? What background? What should keep us about anyone in this? And most importantly, who in their real minds will enter into the establishment of a place, look at everything that was so horrible, and then conclude that it is still a good place to follow a shelter? This film did not respect its enough characters to give their minds the advantage of doubt. Under / below: See Wicker Man instead.
