William Lustig's tracking for "Maniac" proves that, without the impressive effects of Tom Savini and the influence of Spinell's influence, "Maniac" will never be a beaten ritual that did. "Vigilante" has been misrepresented, with a simple-minded script that describes everything for you and predicts on each side, and also a normal display with all actors. By looking at the meaning of the "deja vu" this film gave me, Lustig had watched "Death Death" several times before doing it! (* 1/2)
