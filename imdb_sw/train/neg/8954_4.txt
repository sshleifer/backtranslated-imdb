I had great hope for this movie, because I enjoyed the book very much. However, I don't think I could understand the background of the movie if I had never read the book. The film is a good attempt to show a lack of enthusiasm for people who are trying to break the bonds of government's powerful government, but the book shows more suffering. Government-destroying government officials have a good, close and prestigious life, while ordinary people are struggling to find a clear demand for life. Perhaps most people feel this way towards their leaders and rulers regardless of whether they are actually oppressed or depressed. Dystopia of Orwell looks like it could be in many places in our modern world. It has been several years since I have read the book, but someone hears the references to Big Brother, Politics, and Newspeak from time to time with dialogue and regular conversation. Perhaps most people using these words do not know where words came from. I strongly recommend reading a book.
