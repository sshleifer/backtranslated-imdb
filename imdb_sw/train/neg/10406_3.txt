Warning: This assessment has small damage. The first authors of the authors were not based on official ideas. I am a great fan of the first movie and the first two sequels are very good direct video fare. Shock 4: Legends Starting, however, is a very red movie. Where is the heck is Graboids ??? Because of the lack of Graboids for the first 90 minutes I am sure that the intervention in this series thinks that it is "behavioral research". Unfortunately there is no one interesting feature on the film except for Billy Drago's character who has been given too few lines, too much to do and at the very shortest time of the screen. What saved 2 and 3 movies was the presence of Michael Gross as Burt Gummer. Whenever you didn't have any action on the screen you can make sure that the Gummer Burt will be interesting to listen too and / or check. However, in this film Pato plays Hiram Gummer a good and interesting alternative. At the nearest time when Graboids (Dirt Dragons in this film) are on the screen they look good but that's the same as it gets. I was surprised when I saw that 4 Tutsis were listed for 101 minutes long. Very good directly on the video. But after watching it I am sure that this film is very good 15 minutes. There is a long-term harmony of discussion that is boring and does not have any more plot. What? Was there a rush to get this film? I don't think, a lot of time you would have and you should be used on the script. I thought I had wiped the gold mine when I saw the 4 breast bound for sale with .... Breast! Fortunately I thought, paying # 4 to get # 1 free of charge. Well after looking at the return 4 I like to think I paid for the original and I got this mess for free, I can't imagine paying a single dime for Breast 4. For fans of the series is best to forget that Breach 4: Legend When it starts even there. <br /> <br /> Tasks 4: Legend begins 3 out of 10 levels.
