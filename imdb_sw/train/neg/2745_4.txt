Squeamish Luke Benward 11 years old (like Billy "Worm Boy" Forrester) goes to a new city. In his new school, the little Benward is taken by other boys. They put worms in his thermos. Get his gag reflex under control, Benward hits a bug on the charge by Hicks Adam (like Joe Guire). Benward likes he can eat 10 worms one day - without returning! Tall, misled Hallie Kate Eisenberg (as Erika "Erk" Tansy) uses her dive skills to help Benward. The former director and author of SCTV Bob Dolman promised, "No germs were destroyed when making this film." In a related statement, the SCTV star Andrea Martin has a lovely place. "How to eat worm worms" is freely according to the famous Thomas Rockwell novel. Infants before the adult should enjoy the film. **** How to eat Worms Fried (8/25/06) Bob Dolman ~ Luke Benward, Adam Hicks, Hallie Kate Eisenberg, Alexander Gould
