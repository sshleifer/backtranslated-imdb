What's an odd movie. There is no agreement made for "Special effects of Hollywood" or entertainment. No back music, not special effects or enhanced sounds. The face of the face is often covered with heavy beard and the Spanish language is the most wonderful monotoniki that looks similar to the middle of the war or talking around the fire of the fire. <br /> <br /> I am kind of watching these movies (section 1 and 2) as an educational experience, not really going to have fun. For too long and in the wrong places. But I find that I am not able to develop any plot, I don't think that his education is. It is also difficult to see any stories from the film discussion - it would be a good idea to read a little bit of history so that you can understand the circumstances that are happening, because for some reason the director did not see fit to inform the audience why the band Che was surrounded by the way they did - because there seems to be skulking groups around the wood for any reason and getting shot. <br /> <br /> I would like to give this film more of the stars to somehow generate more sympathy with me and develop the depth of character, but somehow all the characters were still visitors to me at the end. The star finds it in reality and demonstrates the problems of the guerrilla war.
