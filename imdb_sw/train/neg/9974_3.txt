I agree I have taken this a few times on the US Network. There's just something about, well, very ridiculous of this flick that makes me look at it anytime. Yes, you are correct about small steps, which only seven years old can love, etc. But I can't help feel sympathy for some actors. Then again, a few of these participants have registered for even more angry sequel.
