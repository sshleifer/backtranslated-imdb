After being a great fan of ten minutes of 'Stella Street' TV, I waited for this film with excitement and expectation. Unfortunately I had felt very sad. I was shocked in a way that almost every gags and one-page were directly raised from TV shows, and a little enthusiastic and comic time, as if the participants told them once, and could not be and worry to tell them again. I bought my copy on the DVD and heard that I was split with my hard money to look at the same joke again. <br /> <br /> * SPOILERS * The film program begins with Stella Street (usually English street in Surrey), gradually becoming people 'most popular people from action and screen forty years ago, including Michael Caine, Al Pacino, Jack Nicholson and Rolling Stones. All who celebrate the street are taken out of all their luck to the fraudsters of the area, and are forced to live like tramps and ordinary people of work. There are some good moments, but in general, authors can take an interesting idea and make it boring. * End of the session * * I think this was a mistake. His simulation was not fun, and it seemed like his characters were included in the story just to give him something to do. <br /> <br /> If you weren't a fan of Stella Street events, you can find this recreational film. But if you're a fan, I think you can walk away to hear a little cheated. 4/10
