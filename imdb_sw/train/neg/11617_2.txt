This film "Joshua" is very worried, and useless. It really makes me wonder if there are people who will enjoy watching it. Without the story it is about the young man's reaction to his born sister, and that's just the tip of the ice. During this film the observer is engaged in some of the most disadvantaged children. In addition to the injury of the injury, at the end of this movie there is no real effect except the destruction of the clean evil by the hands of a little child, who removed the entire adult group. There is no redemption, no rights used, and a whole group of adults who are not smart enough to see what surrounds them. In fact, I didn't enjoy seeing this film. It was very competitive. Even for those who can enjoy awesome movies, this film can be very much. Despite the fact that this movie was well done, the story itself is so horrible that watching it was the same as waiting for 90 minutes in the waiting room of the dentist in anticipation of dental pain pain.
