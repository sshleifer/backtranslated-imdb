My wife and I like to rent private / sci-fi movies and look at our friends for laughing. We saw this in fullmoondirect.com and we decided to add it to our netflix list. Now, when I say this movie is bad, I mean in a good way. Everything about it, acting, camera function, story, dress, is only cheezy and low budget but that's what makes it very good. I think that in one area executives seemed like they were going to that place. I really hope that anyone who made this film was not bad when they did it because if they were, then that would just be sad. If you would like to watch only the horrible movie movies to make it so I recommend this.
