Okay, you have: <br /> <br /> Penelope Keith as Miss Herringbone-Tweed, B.B.E. (Backbone of Britain.) He was killed in the first place - that's true, people; This show does not spine! Peter O'Toole as Ol 'Colonel Cricket from the First War and now Lord of Manor's favorite. Joanna Lumley as a woman Manor-manor, 20 years younger than Colonel and 20 years ago his head but still glamourous (Brit spelling, not mine) enough to have a toy boy side. In fact, they have full knowledge and consent of Col. Cricket (they come even for Christmas!) However, she cares for enough cricket that has said the boy's old boy (it's gal!) <br /> <br /> David McCallum said as a boy-toy, even as glamorous without sure if he squeezes. Pilcher could not come with any cover for him in the story, so he gave him a hush-circus job on the Circus. And finally: <br /> <br /> Susan Hampshire as Miss Polonia Teacups, Mr. Honorable School of Honorable Girls Board, serving tea in her office with a deep dash, good advice for life in the outside world just before graduation. His best advice: "I've just been to Nancherrow (Home's Stately's Home) once. I thought it was very good, somehow, not part of the real world." Indeed, we can't say they didn't warn you. Ah, Susan's time, your behavior would be running the whole show. They don't write 'em like that again. To lose us, not yours. <br /> <br /> So - to cast and put like this, you have the preparation of "Brideshead Revisited", right? <br /> <br /> Wrong! They took these 1-dimensional tasks to help because they paid well. After all, acting is one of the oldest works of the temp (there is another name!) <br /> <br /> The first warning sign: lots and lots. They surround you by shooting out - "hey, it's just the sun!" The second sign of the warning: The leading woman is crying loudly. In nature, his eyes are moist. That is the law of romance novels: The Leader of the Leadership is "the eyes of the eyes." Now, the Great Woman is known as LL <br /> <br /> The third sign of the warning: LL actually has a star in her eyes when she likes. Still, I will only give Emily Mortimer a reward for having done the same care in her eyes (I wonder. They used the address?) <br /> <br /> And finally, the fourth sign of warning: no female character character is "Bi" He either "Miss" or "Lady." When everything was said and done, I still can't tell who was looking for and why. I couldn't even tell you what it said and done. Conclusion: They all live through World War II without anything that is totally wrong for them. Well, lastly, LL finds that he has lost his parents in Japanese prison camps and sis sis baby comes to the catatonic home. At the same time (there is always "at the same time,") the little boy LL had to crush (when, I don't know) he comes home from a tough area during the war and is found living on the street with Lady of Manor (he must be on the street as SHE will find him there .) All affected war faced by restoring the Nancherrow (SOMEBODY should be "whisked away" SOME HOME in these love stories!)
