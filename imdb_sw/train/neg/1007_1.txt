I found it very difficult to watch this after 5 minutes of film. I was able to finish the stomach of 45-50 minutes before wiping it with disgusting and watching Monster House instead (which, by the way, is very happy). The story has huge holes in it. The plot line is very high and rides, acting is bad, especially from Justin TImberlake who should consider why he is good (look at daft and sing as castrato). Morgan Freeman appeared to be very worried, especially when he did play on rock music because no apparent half way through the film after him and Timberlake meet. Freeman and Timberlake characters seem to have some kind of father / son relationship or something that is not obvious at all without the fact; although Freeman's behavior seems to have nothing but contempt for the stupid and stupid behavior of Timberlake, he never down draws out all of the help to reveal him completely. A strange suspension of unbelief by providing any loan with a line of the story, which is very strange and beaten in all proportion. Do not look at this film, it's a waste of time.
