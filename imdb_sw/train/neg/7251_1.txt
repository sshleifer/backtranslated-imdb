Great west I hear you all say! The first brilliant efforts! I really don't know what film you watched but must be different from what I saw. Western west or really good movies of any kind has characters that you can believe and this film does not exist! Acting was poor to say the least and I was not worried about any characters, making the whole film useless. The story was too big for the creators and maybe they should try their hand to make a direct trash of the TV's budget as you see in those apps "FACT OR FICTION" on sci-fi. Please, if you are looking for a good film, west or even an hour and a half of enjoyable, please see elsewhere.
