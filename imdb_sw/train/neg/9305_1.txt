I and a friend rented this movie because it seemed very good. But we were wrong. The first acting .... wow ... was the worst, the effects were also bad, it seemed like a religious religious film made. The plan was good, but it would have been done. What destroyed many movies were artists. The main boy was the worst actress ... it's a shame I even call an actor ... Only one thing about this movie was so terrible it was so .... so if you want a good laugh look .... but more so. .. stay away from this. I often love the movies of B and B, but this ... I don't know how it was used even to put on the video ... this is the worst I saw.
