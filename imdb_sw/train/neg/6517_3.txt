I went to the screening of this movie and when you had a short time that made me laugh, you had a big mistake. For the first time you volunteer to be a delightful experience of a real life divorce trying to find love in LA. What causes inside is trouble, narcissistic, and dislike through the life history of the film director and professional life. Jokes dresses fast and you find yourself suddenly no matter how this person starts to develop. Weakness is that the director at the same time appears to be very serious and guilty and then expects to be concerned.
