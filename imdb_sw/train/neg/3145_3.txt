I don't know how they relate to them, but I'm sure that Lost and Delirious is a remake of this movie (or story that is based). Good reputation, and even some events and sets seem to be very similar, okay. Lost & Delirious is really the best movie, so check one instead. <br /> <br /> This goes very slowly, but it's a 60-year-old French movie, which is expected in fashion. He explained in the view of one of the girls describing the school. The editing of posts and current events is a little confused first, especially since the sound from every intervention (ie, hearing by hearing when now and vice versa). Also, "girls" are young to think that they are in boarding school. Finally, it is not much development of the character even to notify the film.
