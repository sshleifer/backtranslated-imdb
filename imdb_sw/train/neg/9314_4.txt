Well ... in general, this film was very good, and essentially it's a terrible movie that lived to be more comedy. I lost this movie last night when I and my friends went to the blockbuster to watch a scary movie. This is definitely not what we were looking for, but it was a sense of humor. Actors in this film (especially Brandon) are fake that are funny. And especially the Tracy girl when she is in the planting room to tell the clown go away. They show almost no feelings and are very obvious that they do. And also when the clown looking through the main object of the black box and stimulates Mark, they don't even have to fear even though the clown took him and started to attack him. And seriously, would you just want to consider if you were dismissed? I would like to be sprinting for my life! (Although anyone can get out because he has about 300 lbs.) Not to mention that the harm is not good, if every player throws the head of Susan in the forest, then whenever he throws his head in the room with Denise and Tracy every time Denise shakes his head again. Also as in the original woman's opinion, the beginning makes absolutely no sense and I don't even see why it was included in the film. So, this film took place in 2003? Music made it sound like done in the 1980s, and the camera-ing (?) Does not even have a professional look. Half the time, it looks like a camera can not even stay stable when it thinks that. In general, I'd say I enjoyed the movie. I can't recommend you even if you are trying to find something that stimulates you, but if you are looking for something maybe to play or laugh, I would like to suggest for sure.
