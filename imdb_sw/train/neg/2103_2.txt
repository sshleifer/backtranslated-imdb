Bela Lugosi is a bad smoker who sends a bride or orchids on their wedding day, steals the body in its fake counterfeit and takes home to its midget assistant to remove gland juice to keep Bela's wife forever. The second level of actors who play explorers are trying to solve a bad, horrible mystery. Bela Lugosi climbs well, but you can tell him he needs money. This film is very bad, and many of the participants would be better connected to waiting tables, but the plot is very strange. Tell anyone what is happening in it and they have a lot of laugh and need to see the film. I have got a DVD in a discount 2 shop for Â£ 1, which I think is the correct accurate calculation, any one more for this without having their mind.
