In the third entry of the Phantasm series, Mike and Reggie continue to follow the tall, assisted by the 9-year-old happy, G.I. Jane and the spirit of the deceased brother of Mike (died in the original Phantasm). Number 3 is a sequel instead of despair, since the comedy and black comedy is less less inspired and exciting as it was in Phantasm II. I felt that feeling was just put on apathy for Reggie as a lover and his talent as a standout player. Humor in the previous film was more dry and abused, which fits a story like this better. Also, the settings are not as macabre here, with the constant presence of the Long (Agnus Schrim) is not obvious? There is still a lot of gore but not half as satisfactory at this time. By the way, beware of the sharp cutting version as it shows the striking killings. The entire series of Phantasm is the success of Don Coscarelli, who wrote and led 4 squares so far? that is the fifth in production. The first is the semi-cult worship, the second is the feast of fear and the violence and others can easily skipped. A. Michael Baldwin returns as Mike, although James LeGros demonstrated his best behavior in Phantasm II.
