When I started watching this film last night on Cinemax, I was surprised that it was done. Hate tips, in my opinion, was one of the best youth films for years. This prequel had some non-natural things. (Sebastian's father was married to wealth, then why does he have a rich aunt on a big island?) Then I have found today that it was not intended to be a new film, but instead of a television series, Manchester Prep. After hearing it, it meant to me that it was not the same as the film, such as Buffy Vampire Slayer is different in the form of TV. <br /> <br /> I think Roger Kumble most likely added the end to this movie was, after the series was not taken by Fox. It looks just like something that will happen very quickly (Sebastian being a male of Katharyn) and I don't know just where to go to the next place, as it was not leading to the 1999 movie (which the last new is directed towards.) > One thing I did not like is that it recommended Sebastian and his father were married in property, which is not usually well seen in this new york area, and Katharyn's mother was just an adult version, it didn't seem like a woman's position, who gives a man is not of his social class. <br /> <br /> If this prequel is the same lame. But I would like to be interested in seeing where this has gone as a series.
