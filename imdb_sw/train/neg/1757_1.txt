Do not make a mistake, Dan Jansen was a great skater of speed. If there was one who deserved his gold medal in the Olympic Games was Dan. But how easy it is that Bill Corcoran has made such a bad film about Dan Jansen's fantastic story, because Dan Jansen's true story is true! Especially when you look at this film through the eyes of everything of the games is appropriate, the way Matt Keeslar and other characters are trying, their techniques, the rounds of the speed, it's the same! <br /> <br /> Shame on you, Bill Corcoran, Dan Jansen deserves the best, the best!
