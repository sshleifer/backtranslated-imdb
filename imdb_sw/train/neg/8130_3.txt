When examining the caves and his wife, the doctor is hit by a potato that causes other traumatic effects ... from that small story of par-man-becomes-being. The people of Bat lived Life And Night faced with its unsuspecting story which is sharply planning and lacking in pacing. The plan does not appear to go anywhere and the movie does not provide details of what is happening, or even a satisfactory conclusion to all. Release is very similar in their exhibition. I still give them a number of films for its haunting theme and beautiful places to hide. Stan Winston's decision of the late is also very good, but it is not very available here. Missed space. Certainly one of the little creatures avoids there. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of ****
