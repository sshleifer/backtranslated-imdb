The auditor from Poland must be a woman, because it finds "Young Catherine" to be a good and accurate film. Nothing can be more from the truth. As a Russian historian who has been training for many years, I did away with the YC for almost every side, and especially the proper political model of him as a master who had led Russia to a dominant direction. Truth? Only brought to St. Petersburg became a wife and mother, and discovered that she had "securities" and dvoriane, boyars, and the only army to survive. As long as he did not challenge them he was able / allowed to incorporate his cultural preferences (filling the Hermitage and the treasure of art, etc.). There are many evidence that it was not "good," but in this area of ​​modern evidence of the revisionism evidence was very unknown. YC is just a dress game, a bit of fluff from Ted Turner which, like "Peter the Great" in 1986, is another example of how bad Russia is shown in the West.
