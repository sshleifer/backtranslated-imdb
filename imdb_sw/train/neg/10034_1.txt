If there is one film that is very bad this year - it's a TASHAN promo first released the signals that the film will be boring Dhoom 2 style film, and also I knew only the first would be a bad film maybe because of the film Yashraj Or maybe see cheesy play But The film gave me a shock, it was so bad Dhoom 2 and what I expected the first introduction of Saif who is amazing So Saif-Kareena meets, Kareena is fake and then Anil Kapoor oh god, what does she do in an amazing film? What? What is the role? What does he do? His first part is the same but then his action reappears and prevails. Then came Akshay who gave the beautiful scenes, but the film became worse and with all the past things during childhood, overdose of the childhood scenes of Rajnikant's childhood and all of the boring events are in the next line / br> <br / > Vijay Krishna Acharya would have 3 more leading movies, if this film has worked, that's a yashraj strategy, just no money nothing so Vijay is adding to their list of crap film manufacturers Music (Vishal Shekhar) is common <br> /> <br /> Exhibition Akshay Kumar comes in the film as a star of fresh air, actually offers some time to engage Saif Ali Khan irritating, Kareena is very bad Anil Kapoor hams violently and damages the show even more rest
