This was a waste of time. Risk: If you look at you will be tempted to lose your DVD out of the wall and lift it to the window. > <br amateur amateur::::::::: a narrow line of plot; wooden displays; Lucy Lawless was standing for fraud. Very bad story, absolutely unreliable characters. Two worst concepts in film and t.v. are: (1) twine bad, (2) amnesia. There are no twins. <br /> <br /> Plan "moving"? Significantly simplistic and obvious - like looking down the train down the track in the middle of the day on the farm. It doesn't even solve properly. Evil is not punished for the original crime. Please, please - don't look at this even if it's free and your only choice is to go to the synagogue.
