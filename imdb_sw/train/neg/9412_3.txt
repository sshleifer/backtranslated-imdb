This film was a screens as part of the Sydney Movie Mardi Film Festival. I had no hope of film as someone else chose me. <br /> <br /> I really like films that take time to develop, films that enable the characters to open and let the story go. It's still good. But this film though it was very simple. <br /> <br /> Loans must go to two chief executives. There was a feeling of tension between them as two very different people, causing the truth, coming together in a very unusual way. There was a time of compassion and sadness as we learned more about them. <br /> <br /> I also liked to put it on the beaten path. It was claustrophobic and monochrome and added to the friendship of the film and enhanced the perversion of the characters. <br /> <br /> I don't know the end. What was the whole point?
