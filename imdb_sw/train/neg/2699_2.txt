I have not read one comment on the IMDb of this movie which says how the Jewish character in this movie was up and down as a little child like a gun shown in his face and skinhead racist when the movie leading a black character appears in a sharp under a barrel of a gun. I don't know how anyone can see this as an account of the university life balance. I agree that universities are not the foundation for tolerance as they should have a header if Singleton did not make its characters like many pictures. Over the face he tries to show the character of Ice Cube as a bad person, to make Remy be a pale skin color. But who graduates at the end of the epilogue of the liberation of the movie? It seems Singleton says white if he can't fail (I didn't say mercy!) And a black fellow student or just can take a pale skin color. Many people who have been oppressed by other race people do not return to great injustice. Neither women who have been raped immediately turn to superstition, which is shown more like worship than life. Is it true for sure?
