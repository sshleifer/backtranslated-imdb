Maddy (Debbie Rochon) is a tough woman who is worried who gets more than she has when she goes to a pool and a good worker. When his friends and friends boldly say they belong to the 'Killing Club,' Maddy takes it seriously and goes straight to 'Level 3' by stirring a woman's brain into a parking garage (by cutting her car!) . But does Maddy also give a plastic mask and kill other group members or have another lost person? <br /> <br /> The program of this film (formerly called MAKE 'EM BLEED) does not contain pregnancy, full of holes and spirals completely without control before amazingly, out of the left-field lost end. Some discussions are very interesting. I had no problem with Rochon's performance, but giving us a hand was a concern. However, I was able to sit through this release of the full Moon. There's a lot of skin and blood and it's a perfect type of flick to stay around with a group of your friends and choose off. Terror fans can also enjoy watos from Brinke Stevens and Lloyd Kaufman (as Debbie parents) and Julie Strain (the first victim). <br /> <br /> Score: 4 out of 10
