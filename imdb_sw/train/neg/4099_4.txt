Mulva is put into sugar for Teen Ape. When he wakes up it is more hot (partly played by Debbie Rochon in this chapter), and out of revenge for those who have made a mistake. If the lower head and the art box means this is actually to eliminate the "Kill Bill" films, but this is a Chris Seaver film, it's not enough satire (and I spend the last time freely) I would like to say this is better than the first film, but I am really told that I had drunk my ass when I saw the previous film that I could not even separate the two at this time on time. But I must have enjoyed since I bought a good one (see when I was broken I love them, for missing a good word, full film and full of trick) There are a few laughs at a short time (very few) but I remember Bonejack being funnier though. Well at least for an hour, it's about the quickest why it's worth. <br /> <br /> My bridge: D + <br /> <br /> Extra DVD: Sound comment by Director Chris Seaver, actor Debbie Rochon, and Lbp group; Second notes by Seaver; 31 minutes Performing feature; Lloyd Kaufman's 6 minutes of low-budget pictures; Artificial secrets of 2 minutes of business; gallery still; Trailer Promo; and tractors for: Mulva "," Egg's Salad Efforts, "Fiilthy McNasty" 1, 2, & 3; "Feral Man", "Bonesetter", "Midnight Skater", "Demon Summer" & "Splatter Rampage Wrestling "
