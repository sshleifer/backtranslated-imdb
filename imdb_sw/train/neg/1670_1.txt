The cluster of the film is a spooky: the woman gets pregnant while kissing and the visitor in the bar. But once the movie starts, the awesome opening area shows that this is a type of C of Sci-Fi TV movie. It's a great Trek Star and a small X file, but more than anything else is boring. <br /> <br /> When the movie moves in everything expected and cliche. It seemed more like a 2 parter in a rough series of Sci-Fi TV. No doubts and no fun, but not for lack. Many of the predictable battles between the main characters. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time.
