I have given this film a rating of about 2 stars as I personally appear in the 42 and 43 minutes of the film .... the road to the road in Russia. In this area the director of the movie gave me an eternal line - "Dollars 50. Drinking and Talking", but I felt that a Polish colleague could talk about the most impressive Russian than I could, so I refused to take this to the point. I built a little like this was my first experience of the film .... and who knows ... these verses could end there with lines such as "I will come back" and "Good Brother To Me, I Don't Know To Give Damn". I would have said that one verse then my name will appear in the Rancid aluminum credit as 'heavy 1' instead of Ryszard Janikowski's name. As you go, I count myself fortunate that my name is not connected to this film. Even though I spent a whole day on the set, in South South Wales of Barry Island, nobody can tell me what the true story was. The traders and the woman of the table agreed that they had a lot to swear and deception in it ... things could be worse if I had been naked in the most horrible films .... <br /> <br /> Stillâ€¦ .. On the good side .... I've talked about Rhys Ifans during one break. I did not know who he was, as "Notting Hill" has never been released, and is not selected to be Welsh. He made a misunderstanding about what a huge pitch of Barry Island was since my childhood visit in 70s and 80s. It was only when Keith Allen showed that I realized that I was in the quality of production ........
