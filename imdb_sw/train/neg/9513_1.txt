I tried to watch this film three times differently. The night I hired. I got 20 minutes with hope it would be better if I rested at night. Look at the next 15 days, close to the stupid vomiting ... It was not stupid yet sometimes it's a fun movie to watch but this film was just pretending to the capital S (if you know what I mean to the world we live in). And finally the third day I looked at one hour of dumb and I didn't enjoy it at once! Not one. What? This script got light. Oh boy! 0-0 - One is for followers ... they deserve at least something for all their hard work.
