This was probably the worst attempt in the film of Zombie I had ever been unfortunate to see. Horror, terrible, terrible. Any reviews available on this site are open to either films of the film, family of filmmakers, or a friend of the film manufacturer. Does this film capture? Let's count the way ... <br /> <br /> Plan? We die. Discussion? Inrocious. I can't affect the effects / gore, if I understand that this is a small budget. But there was even one zombie that was not the most severe? C'mon! And for the film set by Rhode Island, why did the car play the Massachusetts plate? Proceed, find some. The girl plays when the soldier "stresses". Please, do not put your old girl or sister buddy on your films. This was a bad movie full of evil people, and it has no business even mentioning Romero on the lid. Sometimes when you decide to make a film, don't do it.
