Thank you for killing franchise with this turkey, John Carpenter and Tommy Lee Wallace. This film takes too many levels. The first VAMPIRES was fun, but this low budget rejead makes me nike. <br /> <br /> Jon Bon Jovi (Kevin Bacon poor man) drives around Mexico with a house of surfboard hidden room holding his vampire to kill the band of Antonio Banderas guitar case in DESPERADO. He takes some of the "hunters" with disabilities along the way (including a girl who is infected with a girl who takes the medicine without turning into a vampire), and decided to stop a female vampire that is not available and so we can take care of her efforts (walking in the sun to steal The Black Cross and make worship to allow him to do so). If you have seen the first VAMPIRES, you have ever seen this, and you have done better. John Carpenter is responsible for many bad films recently. In fact, I think he's gone too far and can't make another terrible session. The only film of wisdom he has made since LIVE (1987) is VAMPIRES. Anything else is completing the completion, up to GHOSTS OF MARS for low cost of low cost ... and now this desired celluloid. Where more of the greats like ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13, HALLOWEEN (1), RETURN TO NEW YORK AND THING? Karemala strikes Wallace shows that he cannot write his way out of a paper bag and his paper-in a full script of yawns, sighing and restoring from nature. Did I say I hated every character in the movie? There was no single character in the entire film. How does that happen? This film has nothing to recommend. Even the DVD presentation is good; The list seems to be bad. <br /> <br /> By comparison, JASON X: "THE 13TH CENTURY IN SPACE" was the hub. Now that's how you do good and (re) strengthen franchise, women and spiders, as well as create a list of exciting DVDs.
