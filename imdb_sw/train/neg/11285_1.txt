I read James Hawes' book. It was very good, not good, but fun. Without reading a book I would have had little idea that was going on, and it was still a stretch and that knowledge. Everything / part of this film is bad in ways that I am not able to describe. Half of the caught fish could make the best film and match matches and lips of mouth / splash! Never before or since the film did not feel angry. The breasts of the captives came near, but they did not even reach the depth of the total frustration of which this fake did. Since losing 90 minutes of my life witnessed this tragedy for human species I now can not even see any book with James Hawes without hearing anger. This is the depth of hatred I have with this piece of sh * t. No, that's right. I would like to apologize for anything to make you in comparison with the other evil that is the Rumini Aluminum. <br /> <br /> It's clear with cancer only in the world of movies.
