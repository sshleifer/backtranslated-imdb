I think that "Gunslinger" was not as god-rough as many movies that "The Secret of Theater Science 3000" shows, but west is not just Roger Corman. To show Rose Hood (Beverly Garland) that sheriff in the Old West town after her husband sheriff is killed and have to fight with baddies, the movie is a good predictable. John Ireland is a new hub of Rose, working secretly to Allison Hayes (yes, a woman of 50 feet). Also seen for a short time is a regular Corman star partner Dick Miller as a mailman (Miller today star in the movie Joe Dante) <br /> <br /> I would like to claim that maybe you want to watch "MST3K" version enjoy this movie. They had a good time with them.
