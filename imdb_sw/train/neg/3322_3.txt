Unfortunately for me, the first movie of Busby Berkeley I saw was the "42th Address." Then I expected all of his things to be good. I realized that it was not a case of trial, even here, and my all-time actor of favorite classic James Cagney. Oh, the music numbers at the end are amazing as always, but the story is like most of the others and it is to hold it altogether. They seem to always involve shouting, unhappy, unhappy producers. In this film, it is Cagney who screams over the things often that he gives me a head after a while and his character is thin .... fast! Even the songs here are anywhere near the "42" class, songs you can ask for years and years - decades, I must say. The songs on this film do not remember. No, this is one of the original Cagney movies - and Berkeley films - I don't like it and I was desperate and when I looked.
