This film is just boring. Trying to record some of the effects borrowed from the creative director like Jeunet on "Am√©lie Poulain", but it's very much. The discussion is very bad, some of the worst I have ever heard, Guillaume Canet cannot convince (I have never seen him very persuasive), his father in the movie has very badly, the story is dumb, the latter is .. it's stupid. I think I don't like many movies since "le pacte des loups" (brother of wolves) from Christophe Gans (and I watch / see about 80-100 movies for a year), but at least that movie had action and lots of executives. I never had a comment here (just tested), and when I saw the logo and comments, I thought I wrote something down. I think we won't have trouble selling DVDs that we have been given: it's not such a bad movie in our collection (big) !!! <br /> <br /> I am interested in (I watch SF, west, sports game, comedies, silents, horror, fantasy ... movies!), but this film was very awesome and I felt like I lost the hour one and a half.
