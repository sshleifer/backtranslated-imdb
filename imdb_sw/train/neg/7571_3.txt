Woman (Miriam Hopkins as Virginia) dismisses Man (Joel McCrea as Kenneth) to father (Charles Winninger as B.J.). The woman wants to get someone to invest the mother of the deceased mother in the business venture of the father; but, the father is a bad reputation for losing money on plans caused by hair. No one knows the least, but the true developers of evil appear as the best friends of the Man to steal his fortune. Players do not play drunk well. It is known as the first appearance of Broderick Crawford - like gopher "Hunk"; most of the run lines, Mr. Crawford gets under the floor by Mr. McCrea. The woman is looking for a man (4/28/37) John G. Blystone ~ Miriam Hopkins, Joel McCrea, Charles Winninger, Broderick Crawford
