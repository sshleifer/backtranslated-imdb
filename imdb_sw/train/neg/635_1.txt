Luise Rainer received Oscar for her performance in Good World. Unfortunately, his role required no. She did not say very much and looks color in the film. Luise's character was a slave and he was married to Paul Muni's character (he did a wonderful job for his performance). To keep ancient Asia, all participants were not Asia, but they had great influence in their roles. I hope that Paul Muni received Oscar for his performance, because Luise must have received Oscar for. You must be a successful executive, one of the first steps through. This looks like something that Hollywood does often. Al Pacino has played Italy and Cuba. I felt Luise's performance as an offender, and when he died, he had no change in expression from any previous events. He stayed the same in all the films; he just changed his exhibition or feeling perhaps twice. If his brilliant act was cunning, I think I didn't see.
