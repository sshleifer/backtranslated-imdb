For my life I can't know why anyone would make a film like this. The program is exhausted, acting is bad, the language is often bad and often the word "F" seems like a lack of dialogue was so widespread "let's get lost in" F "for a good measure, so the US government wants to hear '. Gossett was particularly foul and appeared to enjoy its part. Forget this c__p, tax 'Shrek' and good laugh.
