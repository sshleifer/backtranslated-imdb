This was shown as part of the Edinburgh International Festival of 59, although for the best reasons left for the authorities. It seems much to be the fact that it is the first Thai language film, made by actors and Thai staff, but directed by the west. You do not need to worry to be honest, if this film is lighter, unknown, it does not. Why hint in something, why hide ideas in secret, why quickly pleads the impression, when you can hammer home with a terrible voice, shots shots and on top scenes> Nothing left to mind as repeated again Spurrier director sends out non-end clich√©s. No hinting, no guessing, all over the screens, no need to use our imagination. It's wondering when the bit 'awesome' comes? No you, because the voice sounds will get more and more, standing for crescendo of ominously. Hell, I do words to describe how this is bad. Is it any wonder if an emerging demon is real or imagined? Why tariffs himself - in fact it's a snake, and yes it is actually right to crotch it, and there is blood splattering everywhere. is a wonderful, unpleasant film for several reasons. It should be a horrible film, but it is not appropriate - sticks are kept open. It can be a powerful attack on the nearby side of Thailand, but the director has a good, very good style when showing young people without pubescent. Perhaps it was a distinction like humanity-taking westerner who planted seeds of doubt in my head. Or maybe anything was just pants. It is unnecessary to work, uncomfortable, repeat, hackneyed - all candidates for better information, but evil seems to be more accurate and honest. All have been seen previously, perhaps better, consistently and more ideas, rarely a little thought or taste. Sorry. Difficult under each calculation. Really strong.
