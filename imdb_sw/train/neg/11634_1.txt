I saw this film at the Edmonton Film Festival, and Dr Uwe Boll is attending. <br /> <br /> The movie is, just put, very, very bad. And no, not usually Be Boll "very bad is really entertainment" way, but it's just bad. The plan involves a person who leads a bad life (because of past criminal record, apparently), cannot get a job, and for a good wife of 900 dollars. avian influenza virus. Al Qaeda also has designs to steal small items, and the following is less than two hours of sexual violence and quite uncertain. The job is bad (except for Dave Foley, who is really trying, despite all), the joke was not on the children being shot in the chest with slow motion, and people get poo. It should be satire, but I don't know what. Think about the "Bird!", but it's made by the South Park creators, and without any joke.
