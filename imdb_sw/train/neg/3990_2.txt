The jungle is made very well, directed, and comes as it is believed. Wesley Snipes was wrong for leading and there was no chemistry between him and Annabella Sciorra. Although there are many talents in this film, it will disappear because the items have been slightly lower than decorative stacks. Also, instead of discriminating discriminatory discrimination because of bad and stupid reasons, Pastor Lee chooses to speak out as a flag in a manner of stretching and offensive. I did it through many films but I couldn't finish it, and that, for me, rarely happens.
