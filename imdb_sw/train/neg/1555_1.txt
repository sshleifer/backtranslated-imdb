When I decided to watch the BARBARIANS, and the stars of the twin body members, Peter and Paul Paul, I thought it could not be bad because the film was led by Ruggero Deodato, who has a reputation for creating strong movies but also made interesting movies. In fact, WOMEN is a wonderful movie of action / movie that seeks to be another CONAN THE BARBARIAN, and fails every level. Looking for the same film. Other events were smoothly but sound and schintzy, checking the "disco" look of clothes and hair people are adorned with just useless, even the lowest flick budget like this. <br /> Richard Lynch looks like an old woman with dull hair and clothing. He should be shocked but comes as a buffoon. And it is wonderful to see Eva LaRue Callahan, one of MY CHILDREN 's children, in her first movie, going around with a bikini of skimpy fur. I'm sure she wants this fall disappear from the face of the world! The so-called Kiubabi twins are the same as the brave and muscular heroes but it is impossible to build the proper importance of their acting because their roles are, like everything else in this mess, the worst pregnancy. The only way the film is trying to differentiate directly from the other is because one leaf is wearing a dye with a duck, while the twine looks at its muscle. I'm not kidding! Don't ask who is who. Deodato should be willing to accept this film. And her despair is perfectly reflected in this flick. It's just bad.
