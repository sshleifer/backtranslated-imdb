To share this (which should not be) the lowest Spanish exploitation (tame completely I can add) looks good, but hu? I would say the words again 'huh?'. Really the word 'huh?' it will go through your mind a lot. There is no meaning, nor has it tried too. I do not know whether it is a great cry or shadow, but there is no rejection of how it feels strange, strange and word-sensitive. Unconditional sequence is tied (like a bad opening that involves a young girl, a cat's death and a fire) on a few stories involving photographer Mario (played by John Caffari, who is a dead player for Mario Nintendo Why is that?) That her partner's home home and meet a young woman (who reflects Patty Shepard) who asks her to bring her to a photography, where in this remote mountain area, there are other witches. Look at the structure of the non-constructed compound and enter into what is the piece of the atmosphere of the atmosphere and increases easily. Raul Artigot leads a few non-standard performances and good passages, but in many places it seems uncommon and unacceptable as his writing. Ramon Sempere of the movie film attracts a wealthy environment when we get good ideas and leave us when we fly. However there are some places where it was very dark to see what was going on. Fernando Garcia Morcillo's anger attack and the collapse of the mixture mixes very well with a strong stable condition is designed. Guidelines have potential, but there is also a strong group (choosing to become a VÃ­ctor Israel) for secondary performances. <br /> <br /> Reduce a bit through interest, but this reset (which seems to continue to continue) lets you view up to its closing.
