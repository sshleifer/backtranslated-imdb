If he wanted to be right, he would have to choose some Frisco locals and not the NY participants who do not know anything about Sucka Free (not Suker Free). I've lived in SF all my life, and people here don't talk or act like those executives did. Everything was being done, and the only cat I saw from Bay was JT Bigga Figga and his little cameo as the author. There is no shock that he was alone in the film who was wearing really like a cat out here (ie his jersey of the Warriors). Not once I saw anyone wearing a Giant or any 9 gear; instead he put them in some SF or Oakland efforts that cannot be sold here. HP does not have bowling pipes, black gangbangers and Asia wear head or wristbands with African or Chinese Olympic team, nor do any gangster Chinese wear Yao Ming Jersey and try with black sounds while shooting hoops. Additionally, while it is now the largest yuppie community that has attacked Mission, all that was shown was the white dude and the "private" of Western West Boriqua. This is not New York! Puerto Ricans here are a few and middle, and Latinos in the Mission are very, very different from ONE displayed here, who of course from NY. Also, HP is not the only neighborhood in the City. A proper indication would show the interactions between HP installed on their own hood and against Fillmore, Sunnydale, Lakeview, etc.. This film could be better if Lee did more homework and had the best storyline to work with.
