Movie is very bad. Just bad. The string of bad movies from sound does not end! They should be out of claims to make such movies as bad (or not.) <br /> <br /> Problem appears to have direct directors. This film has 2 good actors who have shown the past that they are able to provide good performance ... but they were led so badly. Poor script doesn't help either. <br /> <br /> This movie has a lot of time to worry and the worst editing in the first half. For example: <br /> <br /> After his first great concert, Ajay Devgan, meets Om Puri (who fled 30 years ago and talked again) and all Om Puri see their friendship with Salman !!! What a burden of skin. Great. Do not mention the sound of the sound of the baad. Anything happened to Shankar Ehsaan Loy? Ajay Devgun is a general miscast to show rockstar. <br /> <br /> Only the saving grace is a beautiful exhibition in the second half. Ajay shines as his character shows his black side. Salman is also a drug addict. <br /> <br /> Watch it maybe just for half an hour.
