I must agree with the very first comment: this movie comes very, very hard. Despite having a huge B-hit list, the cover of this film (for those who do not see in Comedy Out during the week that is likely to be just this film will get) tries to blame Dangerfield but in fact it's just a reward for everyone who was a player from 80 years. Randy Quaid? See. Ed Begley, Jr? See. Lisa Simpson's voice? Now he can say that the Scope of Maximum Maximum was not just his awesome flick: double look. And many, many others. The worst thing about this flick is that it was written very much with the joke told already. Nothing about this movie out of its existence is funny. It's better to see a dry color. That is definitely-to-video-down-of-barrel stuff that still believes in an old video adage: throwing the old-time star on the lid and you will get the money off the lease. Focusing on video rental days are changing, consider this one of the last examples of setting out the desired. The only use of this film is if you have trouble sleeping. It will find you there.
