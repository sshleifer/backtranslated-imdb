This may be a gay partner of Gone and Wind given by its epic part, but instead has focused on itself to become a huge chain of empty events which nothing happened. The characters are unique and have no other development in the story (in fact no stories either) than looking for each other and kissing. It is embarrassing that an interesting interesting proposal to have almost no conversation at all in the film than to make any effort in exploring the psychology of its characters with respect, and to achieve a real resonance feeling. On top of that, it pretends to be a film "art" by using the worst of the snobbery of the movie. But however, if one can identify and ban him, I think it is good.
