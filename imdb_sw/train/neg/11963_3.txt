I love Billy Crystal, and I thought it would be fun to enjoy this film, since I know she loved Alan King and they could be together. I thought I saw all of Billy's movies but I didn't remember this, and now I know why. It is full of clichés with a sense of deception; you can smell every area that comes (and go!). Billy don't even have too many times. She is very busy trying to cry fake tears or show her angst for how her father has caused her bad. Alan King himself is very good, as below to have extra in movies. But it is unfortunate that Billy just happens to visit his father as a serious health crisis takes place, etc. etc. Or that two doctors who work can just close their habits for a month near LA. And when the end comes, the boy, comes quickly! As soon as the authors realized that they had built themselves on the corner and the only way out was to make the area of ​​death. Many break the heart and a handful of good humor.
