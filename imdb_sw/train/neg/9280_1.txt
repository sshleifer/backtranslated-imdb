honestly, I don't know what funnier, remake this awesome, or comment on this board. The brilliant review was with me in tears, that's very interesting. However, this film is among the worst movies, and certainly under the barrel for sequels. The name "Omen" on the head made me stop and look at this morning on HBO, but it is being beaten by the face with three others, especially natural. There is a good time for the session, but I like it very much a boy who catches fire from juggler on the right mind! good times! This film is a series of Omen what "Movie Scary" is for a whole variety. Avoid unless you are looking for a good laugh.
