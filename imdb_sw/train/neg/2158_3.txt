I can see why now why Robin Hood has fallen fast. The first part of it is probably the worst thing the BBC has provided. The opening events were as sharp, meaningful and intellectual as the two monkeys fight, Robin Hood was not characterized, and the sword fight was just laughable. The worst part of that part was Robin Hood with a necklace of the cattle at the beginning of the period - how many people wear weight in the 12th century? Nothing. The series has been upgraded since then, but this first part quickly put people 's hope down, and is basically a bunch of cr * p. The great British hero has despised them. <br /> <br /> "Do You Do This?" I don't want, sure, unless the BBC will begin to understand it is a wise investment. 3/10
