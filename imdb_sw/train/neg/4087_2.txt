I often talk a little about the plot in the first part of my review but in this film there really isn't much to talk. Just mish-mash of other FAR sword & magic epics. Lack of widespread cooperation such as banning. Even the great pastor refuses to wear other clothes, then run it boring good if he pretty much has a little chest of a young boy. Lucio Fulci was blowing down the barrel here and shows. <br /> <br /> My Bridge: D-<br /> <br /> Additional DVDs: Posters & Stills; Lucio Fulci Bio; by the US & International trailer displays! The extra bonus is over too
