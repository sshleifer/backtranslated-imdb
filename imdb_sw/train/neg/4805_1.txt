I liked Adrianne Curry before this show. I thought he was good on the Top Model and was very happy when he won. I also liked Chris Knight, he looked like a good man. But this just shows me to make a SICK! I was very angry at both what happened on the show. I don't care they were different, I know the age can't stand between love. But Adrianne, you have been together for SEVEN MONTH. It was not amazing everything that had no suggestions. And I don't see an appeal to force someone to marry before they are ready. If it means, then why not just enjoy the company of each other and love each other, and let it be normal? Turning the wedding ring into the ball and the sequence was not quite desirable, it is quite clear that Chris loves you, or without the ring. And Chris, embarrassed on you to break and recommend him! Have you been through two failed marriages, how could you run into one because you just hit the column? I hope this relationship lasts, but I feel that the marriage ran away for all the wrong reasons. Maybe now they can take a breath and find the right reasons to get married from within marriage.
