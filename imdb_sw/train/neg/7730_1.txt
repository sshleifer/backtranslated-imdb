Besides many style, flash, and glitter, this French music can not talk. Tunes are repeating, predictable, and interesting. Stories are not recommended, as are many characters. People come into song and dance, without motivation or reason. Most of the cast wear vigs and bad hair, and the sets seem closed locked. To be honest, this video version of the restored version has been strengthened before the end, so no matter what effect it had. Indeed embarrassment, having so many talented talents for the last effort. Shows, I think, where to track (in this case, for a great classic, "Umbrella") often goes hary. One cannot restore it, repeats it again.
