I do not know if the painter looks to ask questions about abortion, and make sure that the woman should be allowed to become pregnant if Satan is the father, but it draws and continues. Ron Perlman is laughable. The child is the look of the look, basically the baby's head is placed on it. You can very see the material on Satan's clothing. What a mess. This session is about five minutes of story and 55 minutes running. Very, very bad. And the latter is just ridiculous. After learning his child is dead, do you? Satan destroys an abortion clinic and kills everyone in big, blood, gory, violence? NO! He puts his head down and comes out of the room. Horror.
