This movie (very) low budget compares to the great classic "Silent Night Deadly Night", as it is called Flick Slasher. First I would say that I think even "Silent Night Part 2" is better than this (that one was filled with natural flashbacks for more than half of the movie). "The evil of Christmas" tries to get psychologically by introducing the main character as a dirty person, (a strong word), slow (very slow). He is angry with people who have not found the true meaning of Christmas and in the workplace he cannot stand up how the production is made by lack of quality and love. Wearing as Santa finally keeps killing the killings. Also a strong word, since only 3 people are killed without the real need of special effects. No tension, no thrills, no gore, no cast. One exception is: Jeffrey DeMunn is in it. He is known to play aside Tom Hanks as one of the patrons in the classic "Green Mile". It must still be in the present day for ever accepting responsibility. In fact he is the only one who can act, his role of helping is better than the main lead. (which is also not bad, but if you are hidden with a little support, not good either.). And what about that wonderful end? (you should see, believe). "The evil of Christmas" is very bad, nothing happens and the art is misleading. This is not a slasher. You want to see a real Christmas slasher, see all the greatest time: "Night Night, Night Night".
