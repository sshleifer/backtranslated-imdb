Although it is not as bad as the game settings and the movie, this hunk of crud is not much better. <br /> <br /> Boll seems to have a pathological ability to admit that it doesn't make a good movie. One of these days he will lose money and stop making the world with his bombs. Acting was small, the conversation seemed like they were reading TelePrompTers and 'little' were seen in anything. <br /> <br /> Like all films of Uwe Boll, this should not exist. <br /> <br /> It's simple and easy. <br /> <br /> Just like Uwe Boll himself should not exist. > _>
