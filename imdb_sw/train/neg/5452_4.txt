In addition to the film go, this seems enough. Characters of entertainment, good conversation, interesting story enough. I would like very much if I was not very angry when looking for a disrespectful show shows the city regulated. <br /> <br /> Glasgow. In Scotland. However every character is English (safe for Sean's partner, who is Dutch). Scotts' accents are only heard in short-term jobs and responsibilities. As a Scottish woman (and as a viewer who likes her film "real life" a little more than a real life) I don't think it would really have hurt to use any of the non-Scottish talented actors ... or at least they found English that they could move along a priority of respect! An unnecessary attempt to use the word "wee" rarely had nothing and continue to do wrong.
