This leading movie of Gadget Investigation is very serious. The story is very weak, and there is a small step.For characters it is given nothing to do.the movie is entertaining gently, but it really doesn't go anywhere and it doesn't mean to watch but it is unique and there is no nearby TV show The animated from 80'.it is not a movie that bears to view again, at least in my mind.it is just 74 minutes including features, so I think that's a good thing. As with the television show, the characters do not root here. Show, you want the Gadget's reviewer to save the day, but there is, who cares so much, however, that is my opinion to me the Auditor Update Gadget Document is 3/10 despair
