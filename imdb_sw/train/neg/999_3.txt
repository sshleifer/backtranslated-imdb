I saw 'Decline' last night at the Stockholm Film Festival and it was one big desire. Discouraged because the story was strong, the prospect of seeing Rosario Dawson in a small adjacent movie was exciting and, being a fan (apparently pervy, I did not!) Of 'rape / revenge' of 70 flicks, I had a need to say curious very much watching this movie out. My conclusion: let's stick to the elite! Yes, the storyline has potential but the conversation is flat, participants do not know. Even Dawson is empty. Some would argue that it is an accurate reflection of the university world in the United States, that the lack of characters serves all the purpose and jazz but it only makes the whole movie not known. Like the event where Dawson gets raped: it faces a lot! I did not expect anything 'irreplaceable' but still, do we not think to feel his sympathy? We don't. Not for a minute, she was disabled all the way ;-) And I read that the picture was amazing. Well, it's really good but no breaking ground. I must admit that the observation at the festival was not so good so maybe I lost something here but at the end of the film, I couldn't help thinking 'I feel like looking at' Inferno 'again. lol. More seriously, the first place in the club was shot very well with all but I had a strong sense of watching the longest and most of the area in the revived bar near the American-Canada border in Lynch's' Twin Peaks - Fire Walk and I ... 'red lights and blue colorless, music bass heavy, normal damage / bad condition ... No, I couldn't just enter this film. Very bad.
