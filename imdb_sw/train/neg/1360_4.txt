Good efforts are a summary of this film. A good film of sixty years but has never felt any success. Maggie Smith gave a good performance that was good enough but not good if she could give, other participants were awesome! Show clearly. It was not very funny and so it didn't really think its music if it was not very strange and it was not strange. The only kind that reached a satisfactory level was love. The Target audience was not hit by the film sent to a non-combustible message. A very basic plot and very basic story was not given or worked properly and people were left in confusion because the film was not good and who the target audience was. However, Maggie was very good and the story of the same time. <br /> <br /> 4.
