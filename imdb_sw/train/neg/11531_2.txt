This plan is careful, taking into account the most unintentional and unreasonable decisions of adults in every fertility decision. Children are much better than charm and delivery of lines but if I say, the whole plot depends on everyone to become full characters, and therefore in this case, make more sense from their actions (and at the same time being the only way to describe actions boys' mistrust in general). Why do beautiful boys boys use a baby from the beach? What? How did the child get to the beach and at the same time account for the final search area? Why are two boys unable to have information instead of at the same time the baby is missing no one is making a fig tree around them with food and diapers and a continuous shock and really everywhere you looked? There is no just right to ask the audience to believe this. Asking to believe it will make a case (even an informal set) is also straightforward to open.
