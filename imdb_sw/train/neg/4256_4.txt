Realistic rise is a step up to the issue of what the original film was in the story and in special effects. Jason Scott Lee It's as good as a vampire hunter who strives to count himself (remember him, he was from a movie dragon, The Bruce Lee Story. ') Jason London is funny like Luke, a child who helps a woman who loves to come from stealing the body of Dracula from on the slab. Diane Neal It is good if a woman steals Dracula's body to get treatment for her dying partner, and Stephen Billington is as good as Dracula herself. Providing better performance than Gerard Butler calculated in the original film. Roy Scheider surrounds all the others in the film, and does a good job as a mentor of Jason Scott Lee. This is the second sequel in trilogy, and they are far from a good start. It is on the air as the last film will close the series out of good memory.
