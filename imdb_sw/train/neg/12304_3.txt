I watched this film last week and I had the biggest laugh I had for a long time. The film program is pretty dumb and convoluted in a very bad way. Only with the found anywhere on the film is Corey Savier's amazing abs. Alexandra Paul (I think that's his name) is as bad as the preacher's wife who has a history of depression. Ted McKenzie is perfect and its character is above all. And if the fact that you think he is having sex with his child is not enough, they give us unwanted sax every time! Finally and at the end of this film are quite common and also interesting. I mean who hell wants to carry a con baby who tried to make you think he was your son and that you had a good relationship with him!
