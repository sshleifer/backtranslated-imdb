I was so excited about Bilal's novel writing when it came out, and I was surprised when I saw the trailer of this film, and even more so when I saw that Bilal had led himself. The film, however, was a huge stop. The features are not close to the beauty of the rich and the beauty of the original drawings, and the story is unknown. Bilal seems to have chosen to focus on more esoteric issues of the novel picture, and does not work very well, either. <br /> <br /> The most enjoyable part of the original photo novel was the relationship of hate and friendship between Nikopol and Horus. Both of them were out of their time and the right place, they were forced along with the situation. Above all, they were funny and pleasant. Not so here. Nikopol has no character recognition, and Horus is a glorious thing that he just wants to get. Although the film is French, Horus should not be! We've seen films we enjoyed, but we didn't recommend everyone, for some reason or another. I will not recommend Immortel to anyone, but perhaps as a warning not to violate your talent and resources. Bilal is the author of the story, but obviously not the master of all kinds of seeing.
