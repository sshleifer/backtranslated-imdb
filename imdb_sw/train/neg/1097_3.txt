I know that the US Army has been destroyed in 1971, but this film was not wonderful. It was supposed to be a training camp not a SS war on the Sven Hassell report. The author must be a real opponent of the Army. The psychologist Sergeant who continued to clap the people was in the prison cell, and the top Black army was supposed to be planned too. These men were traveling out of the country, the course of receiving course was undoubtedly surprised when all the unemployed employers who were unable to attend were from, and the investigation would continue. The area that hit it was the single electrocution. Farrell, a barrack lawyer, would have a teacher on a barrel for illegal orders (torture of POWs against the Geneva Convention), a real attack on a person who joined, sexual abuse and making an unlawful officer. Intead he walks away. After this, the discipline goes under the level of madhouse and the film becomes unknown. I don't know how it ended, I went to sleep.
