This movie was done well with the rush. I realize that money for any film is hard to come. However if the plot had any kind of original substance one could see that it had the necessary money, this was not so with the movies if this is not necessarily own and does not focus on existing ones. The program of this movie has been done and made better I can add, often before. There is no reason to make a film that does not have a chance to compete with others. I was told by my computer that I need less than ten lines to present my opinion so the following lines are just a cow filling space. In my opinion there is nothing to say anything about this film. what I have said is much and if you have lost enough time to read this review, rather than to God do not waste too much time to watch this film. The only thing for this is that you are the kind of person who likes to watch crappy movies that are played on the women's entertainment network at 2:00 am in the case that you continue to see.
