Yes, well, I had an error about leaving my Saturday night to watch this strange little, but still very long, movie. It seems he didn't have the main character of stealing two hours of my life. Here is an antihero epitome in 'No Error.' We have this jerk, so desperate, so walking, so selfish, without surprising and unseen that it was very difficult to pass back to the most beautiful human attraction of the top-and-coming son, Jaemin, except that: physical attraction. He demands otherwise, it is love. But after looking at this, it's like Charles Manson's love because you draw a beard. (Certainly, he is not bad, but he still has no real characteristics of redemption.) I can never pass the reason for Jaemin's last stalks. It has never been shown, just told, that Jaemin likes Sumin. Perhaps it is a cultural phenomenon that climbed over my head: hell / shouting = love love in Seoul. It should be, because a little more than half of the film is one of the other spreads and the last part spinning back and returning to the point I thought this was turning into a comedy screwball. I waited for a tiger called "baby" to appear. Okay, so Sumin does two things when going to school, so far it is very good for someone trying to improve. But after his first flavor of the stalker attraction, he gives his day work to some kind of prostitution ring. When? Okay, well, as mentioned earlier, the quarrel cannot stop because of a change of work / job and throwing it into a group of other angry characters you get one movie caused by the incredible events that seem to happen without being built. Movie based, not 100% awesome, but you can do well with outdoor gay movies.
