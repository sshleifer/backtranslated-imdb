This film had many promises. I was very happy with this film. Finally, it was more interesting, more bitter. Acting acting made a gamut from the real, true, flat (angel, wife and daughter) for more-animated character Casper. I felt that the discussion was just an attempt to transfer information to viewers rather than real people trying to talk. Beware of the "bug" area. It is very good for the ability of the listeners to think things. In protecting the area, though, has had a great laughter of the whole movie. I had read that they spent a lot of money to travel to different parts of the country. The worst did not use. I didn't feel like I was sent to foreign places. Anyone can import images of Coliseum stocks in Rome. However, finishing with a positive note, I thought the sets were very good. I liked the graphics that were displayed on the computer to decide. It is my opinion (and that's all) that if SCHMALTZ something would be too low and because ACTION would be too high, this film would be good.
