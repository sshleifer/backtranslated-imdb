When I was young, I thought the first film was very good in childhood, so I decided to see the follower. This is an example of why some films should not have sequels, because the first film is normal, and it is. Ariel and Eric are now married with girls who were not allowed out of the house because they are worried about Ursula's sister (a man who was cleverly conceived from one film), Morgana when he came to her. When the child comes out he asks the sister of Ursula to take her to be a mermaid, as her mother was. This makes Ariel back to the sea to find him. Those artists sound good, it's just a story that can be thought a little more. Enough!
