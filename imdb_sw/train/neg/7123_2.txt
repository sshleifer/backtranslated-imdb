Welcome to the bad story of the soul and one's dream. This story of fear finds a newly married husband (John Hudson) and wife (Peggy Weber) when they were beaten by the memory of his ex-wife and the skulls found in their empty houses and a lily pond. Does the man try to drive his worried car? Or is it to learn the challenge of the Mickey garden (Alex Nicol) who cares about the foundation of the house since the death of the old housewife? This low-flick fear of fear has a line of stories that lets you participate in all the way through. Special effects are even worse in 1958. I swear sometimes the skull sounds like it must be in Godzilla's movie. Also in the cast as Snow Pastor is characteristic actor Russ Conway. By the way ... the gardener (Nicol) is a film director. You can find this as a part of the Monsterfest of AMC.
