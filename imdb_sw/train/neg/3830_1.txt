I don't know why I take time to explore this time-consuming movie. If you hold for a long time in the hope of a satisfactory conclusion? good, bad, or strange? not. Finally it emerges after the hard, formulaic, discussion of prediction and action. Internal hard-pressed events you think if the camera has checked out one more millimeter you would like to see klieg lights. Hair, hair, and sets are worn, closed, and non-clean. What? Should we imagine ordinary people living as early as the 20th century Arizona? Other specialist studies for Sam Peckinpah are insulting to Peckinpah: at least the director made his violence in a chaotic atmosphere and chaos. The MEN's HARD Gore is free from cross-cutting timber and fingers. Huh ?! I can believe Heston thought he could do something valuable with this film. (He gets a gun on his toes.) But Coburn? I can never guess why he enrolled for this efficiency. Want to see the film about the end of the West as we know, the end of the West as we know it? See SHOOTIST or UNFORGIVEN again. The last women are the shock of the Western army.
