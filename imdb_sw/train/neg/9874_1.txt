A good book about the fox and his family who does what they do. be stealing from the fields and killing the prey. until three farmers decide that they have found a good fox and try in different ways to have a "problem" problem. They are actually "out of chaos" every time and when the trio is camping out in the fox pit family to commit murder against three land farmers. The very short film, is more than the worst pastimes of American cinema movies especially the sea movies. They also have George clooney as Mr Fox will add to insults and manage to miss the point of absolute story altogether. So they give them. They make a lot of money and destroy one of the children of Roald Dahl.
