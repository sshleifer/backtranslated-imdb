This is the version that even the author hated, because it is schmaltzy. They gave the 'end of joy' and changed many conversations, and it was a great bunch of saccharine. The 'action manager' is quite good, I believe he started the role, but everyone falls into that style of 40 years that is really just emerging. One major feature - music. This has one of the best recorded records, and it is important to search in a record store. Overall I think 1989 Spalding Gray / Eric Stoltz / Penelope Miller version is much better.
