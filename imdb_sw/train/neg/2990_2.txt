Ohhh man! Now this is what I'm talking about! In addition to the horrible / surprising scary it might have been true in his own class. The real Gem! First, the film was not original in English. That's the same because the dubbing sound was unique! Here is my favorite part of the discussion (and there is much more than this came out)? "I feel better, I just thirst for your blood!" And what game! Here is a play to play again with the cooperation between the military and scientists? Scene 1? Scientist: "You can't do it? It will be a disaster!" - Military Officer: "That's just science fiction" (then continues to cause a full disaster as the scientist predicted). <br /> <br /> Scene 2 ?? Scientist: "If you do so many people will die !!!" - Military Officer: "you don't know what you're talking about." (he does so many people die) <br /> <br /> Scene 3 ?? Scientist: "Don't do that? It will kill everyone!" - The Army Officer: "That is free" (then continues killing everyone) <br /> <br /> View 4, 5, 6, 7 (you get an idea). Is it not enough? there were a few incidents that emerged as an instant classic! In one area, the army has 10 men talking to the gun for two armed men. Leader cries, "Go get" em! " with all the men of the 10th army, one at a time, stop their guns and fight the fists of those two opponents! Casual classic! <br /> <br /> And don't worry. No precautions for omitted details! This film had a sound of 80 hip / upbeat sounds of sound / synth sounds to put a sense! Do you believe me? I am aware of these reviews may have other criminals, but there are so many in this epic in fact I was blowing the face. This modern caliber comes only ten times! Realistic film experience! The masterpiece! Wow!
