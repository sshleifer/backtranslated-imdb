This movie was so bad! It was awesome! It was bad! I can't stress enough! Acting, leading, story, characters and everything about it is bad! It was so corny and clich√©d. Do not show with a lid, or a line of the tag "Demolition" is not something to laugh. "Are you breastfeeding" to beat me! It was a concern. \ T the evil, angry and young go to the cabin in the middle of the trees and clown which sing the nursery lectures kill them in a strange and fake way. it's losing your money and time too! I hurried forward through many movies because it was so terrible, I wanted to see how every bad actor died, and it wasn't worth it! Testing: not eligible for one.
