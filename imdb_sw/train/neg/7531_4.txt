That is, of course, a movie about many sorrows. Therefore, it should motivate viewers and make them feel sensitive to the main characters. However, his beautiful style after the situation makes it almost impossible to understand. The camera always takes from one location to another, from a personal to second-to-crisis, creating a choppy, non-mixed effect. Many characters seem to have an empty life, which is not made, has been done with their professional promises. (It also includes trust that a person who has only been given a death sentence, would be very happy to have sex with a woman who has met.). Story story (if there is a story story) it's hard to follow. In general, the overall effect is rather despair. Despite all of this, acting in general is good and some cases are very strong.
