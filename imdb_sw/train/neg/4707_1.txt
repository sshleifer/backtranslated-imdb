This OMG was a great experience of my life watching this. I could even finish what happens to Nick. Their best thing on Nick boy is Drake and Josh and that's about going away. Children's songs are exciting kinda and so children. My little sister wanted to watch the show because she likes anything that comes to Disney or nick size but after completing this view she said "one of the worst shows I have seen so boring." My little brother really fell asleep me. In short as your old 3yrs without brain activity you will enjoy this show otherwise change the channel now.
