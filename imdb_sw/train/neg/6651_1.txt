This is the worst movie I saw all year round. First, I will say that acting was very good, and for each cast. This was considered to be very serious, and in this case it was successful. With the same gesture, the story refers to the self-wannabe, who does not have clueless, a fictitious liar, whose source of self-esteem occurs in pairs of leather skins. This was worse than watching the fall of the car.
