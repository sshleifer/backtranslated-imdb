It is a disappointment for the SA film industry! I have seen the best films of SA. The comments I have read about the stories of hijack, by saying it is a tenth of ten are terrible. The film rating should not be dependent on .., "OH, MOVIE GIVING THE SPIRIT. We have the ability to make good movies. Do not condemn the film industry on what people say how they think the hijack stories are. The best country I love will give 9 out of 10. Guided by Darryl, a good actor and two older actors, regardless of where. Hijack's stories, I will give 1 out of 10. they will give you a high score.
