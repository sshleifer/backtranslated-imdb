It was my idea that movies are needed for plots, or other ways to take care of the story line or something going on. This film showed me that it shouldn't be anything like that. I could only include it like that. But, IMD wants me to have more lines. It was very good. not forcing for a bit. The way the characters talk in the film makes you think it must be done on the day's issue, but there is no time for it and I am absolutely sure it all happens at an hour. If you are looking for fun, then buy a glass of milk and see how you can drink before hitting. It would be the best use of your time. When you can't come back again. Jurassic Park 3 was removed away from this movie.
