Here is still another story of European blasphemy that they are hitting the religion of their country. (These artists are not trusted.) Here we see the brutal cruelty of Catholics and / or Catholic Catholics (and I am not Catholic). It really won the Academy Award for foreign film. That's probably because the story made Catholics and religious beliefs generally be very simple. One of the main characters is a priest and he cares more about food than anything else. He is shown as nothing but idiot. It is not surprising that the world-led university loves this movie. Also, there is a fool who hits a guy who rejects his religion so that he can marry one of the four daughters mentioned in the story. Women turn to mislead a student of the "seminar" (who says he learned for six years but says he is agnostic!). I mean, how is this film disrespectful? !!! This is an embarrassing example of another bigotry of world development of film business, worldwide (not just Hollywood).
