clothing, conversation, historical accuracy is terrible. For example, - Stacey Dash and location embed. The blow was right (as I could say), but that kind of half broke the man's neck. Mrs Dash is left hanging at the end of the string without any harm until the string was shot. This kind of non-prohibition, killed them at the end of the decline. And before entering the bank (by flashback), they stop the street with a embrace group - and their bandannas hide their faces - which would be obvious to people on the street. The worst layout - which is the battery pack under the shirt and it is obvious, a piece of "long journey" shows them riding together, then blocking the film. I loved the fact that they set the area with horses taking a trick - it seemed to be an example. The whole movie rose.
