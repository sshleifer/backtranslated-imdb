I sat down to watch a document about Puerto Rico, and I looked at one of them. When I go to Puerto Rico, I can't see 50% living in poverty. When I see people struggling, they become Haitians, Dominican Territories, or Cuba who have recently arrived on the island. Nothing like spanglish ... or you say Spanish, or you don't have .... and from what I heard ... you don't. Pedro Albizo Campos is not MLK to me. MLK was a good man. Campos is a good person for those who want independence that is 1%. For others he like loco as Osama bin Laden. The people of Puertoric who want independence are a group of fools. If you want any confirmation for you all of you to explore the self-esteemed to see Cuba, Haiti, Dominican Republic, Bahamas, all South America and Central, and Mexico. His wonderful works to them. This document is not about Puerto Rico, this document was about the Nuyoric and their struggle. It is a person whose complaints of Africa was on the show ... it was supposed to be about Puerto Rico ... not Africa. Denzel will do just one time for you. Finishing ... for all unidentified people who think we need green cards to come to the United States, and we want to learn how the prime minister is running things, this is not a good document about Puertorican culture. Tell your children to concentrate on Geography, and History History. <br /> <br /> *** Update *** <br /> <br /> Bocabonita ... "doc. was about the Nuyoricans. He developed it as much as we all feel. Should be known ... "yo soy nuyorican ... lunch ... can not speak Spanish." WE NEED TO USE RICO RICO, RICAN, BORICUA, OR HOW TO WORK IN THE INFORMATION AND TRAINING HISTORICAL HISTORICAL HISTORICAL. God don't play in the island.
