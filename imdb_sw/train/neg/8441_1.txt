This movie was long and awesome. It is surprising that it was chosen by Cannes, although it likes it. Point is that as opposed to other Dutch stars of arty as Kerkhof and Kruishoop, Guernsey feels totally empty. However you don't have any quality of movies. The opening of the long term does not mean the depth of the cinema, it's just a long shot. Stories were not interesting and the characters had problems that I did not recognize and at all. The characters did not shine under his leadership and seemed to have lost time. Leopold tried, but he was not the talent I expected. Where is Kerkhof and Kruishoop? In fact they made waves in Dutch movies. Leopold made just another attempt.
