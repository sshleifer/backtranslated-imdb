Error ... this film was hit. LOT. <br /> <br /> I have read some other reviews. It seems there are many people who think anything that Woody Allen writes or star is good for direct ... But no, they just exploit him. Unlimited destruction. All characters are very different (not mention rather stupid). The plot is ... I think it should be wonderful. Sure about that. Mr. Allen's character is ... Woody Allen, on any other film you saw of it. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Woody Allen, go see this film. If you are less than 50, don't bother. (If you are a fan of Woody Allen AND you are less than 50 ... well, you're atypical I don't know what to say.)
