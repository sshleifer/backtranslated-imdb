I watched this film when Joe Bob Briggs hosted a trust on TNT. Even he could not make this film relaxing. The only reason I looked at the end was because I teach video production and I wanted to make sure that my students did nothing wrong ... but it took all my intestinal nerves to stay that way. It's like looking at your grandmother like with a 15-year-old boy ... very bad. If you have taken a real film, put it in thin colors, then you look at it, it will be more fun. Hard. See this film on the bin of the bargin on the S-Mart, go back to it as a rattlesnake.
