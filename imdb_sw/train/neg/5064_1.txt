I don't believe they did this film. Not enough. The first film was the same. But there was no need for a good, certainly not after a series of television that was already sequel for the first film. This film feels like a soap opera. Writing is very bad, it's quite simple. The joke is not accessible, acting is flat, it is shot like soap, there is no direction. The first film had a good feeling behind it. Each character had a small arc. It was so easy but somehow it worked and I could see the features of the film. But this time around, there is no line of co-operation. The characters are a little fraud and nothing interesting is happening. One good thing: a Brazilian boy who plays Axel Daeseleire's son is well healed. That was one of the creative achievements on this film. Hear that they have already played a second series of TV series 'Team Spirit 2' but please God, don't let them do a third element of the feature ...
