That's the worst films I saw in all my life. Acting is poor and story story is almost incomprehensible. If you love any rocks or any ship for that matter it is not worth it. For special effects film does not. All the film workers were probably on the boat out of the sea more serious than on the studio and when some men were "beaten" (if you could even call it) their results could not be completely. Guns are more quiet than dumb. How this film can have only two awards sets good questions for the human mind. Well so about it. This suggestion is probably more enjoyable than reading than the film is watching. If someone thinks to look at it or buy it I would like to advise you on it for obvious reasons. I have said that it includes a spoiler. If the fact that some people are hit by a gun is run is a project to give. I think it's because it's the only part of the film.
