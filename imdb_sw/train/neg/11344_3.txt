I had no trouble with Cinderella 2 and Jungle Book 2, but this is probably more serious than all the names. First of all, I did not like the animation, Saturday-morning-cartoon, just worse in certain scenes. I liked some characters, namely Thunderbolt and Patch, but other characters, like Cruella were mediocre. Cruella was really a village in nature, but lost its quality in good. What he said he had nothing to write at home and his animation was bad. Also his colleague Lars was a cord to be loyal to you, and Roger seemed to have quit smoking one night. The sound of the sound was good, especially Barry Bostwick as Thunderbolt, except Jodi Benson, the impulse of my own. There was a good time, but the whole plot seemed to be closed for me, and very interesting for the extended television period. All in all, a very large sequel more memorable than 60 Disney movies with Jungle Book. Sorry, I can only give this 3/10, not just my cup of tea. Bethany Cox
