I see many people liked this film. For me this was a movie released the right to write 101 and failed class. From the time of Lindsey Price videographer shows until the last film possible. I kept watching to see if it would go anywhere. First we have a widow who was a widow. The # 1 TV shows / TVs often kill the mother of the mother if the child is a girl, or the boy's son so one father can get swoon on his dead wife and appear completely out of his care for the children. Starting from My Children 3 to Blood 2 1/2. These movies are usually dramas and comedies are television shows. Cliché # 2 When a pushy woman has a video camera in her hand she will have a big part in the film. And you will always find a solution or even if that person is the head of the air <br /> Cliché # 3 If a person is sick it should be a Latino. And it must be illegal. Apparently no Latino legal and illegal writers, unless there is an element of the IRA involved. Climate # 4 Latino must be taught in its native country. In this case he was a Profesor who made 200 a month. And Latino's highly educated must do if he has no brain in his head now and let the head of the head take it. <br /> <br /> Cliché # 5 Crime the man who did the truth was not a crime but an accident. But because in this case she has lost all the meaning she had when she had crossed the assistant now doing as idiot blithering and now has put her own daughter at risk to take her with the effort without fruit until the side of the kide kick. <br/> <br /> Cliché # 6 A man can never run on a hoodlum running from a crime, but some poor little cute baby. This is because the parents of the child should play a large part of the film, and because the person who was killed by a child accident may have interaction between parents. My name is one movie which one soldier is not vet angry and they get paired up with rookie. Even if they are investigators who should be the most skilled warriors in the Police Force. Sev7n and Copy Copy and Law and Order come to mind immediately. And vet even though the gruff out has the heart of gold. <br /> <br/> Cliché # 8 Let's go around some of the Soap Stars jobs. Now I would like Lindsey Price. But Susan Haskell IMO can not do its way out of the paper bag and when she uses it to Live One Life as Marty came from right to left every time she opened her mouth. It uses to give me a marine patient. He can be tied to the best land now, but he still can't do it. <br /> <br /> Movies can be more comprehensive if not filled with clichés. I don't think the movie should be expensive or brain to be good. But this was very bad. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER **** Now I don't want to destroy the end. Oh heck I will do it because I feel that it will be legitimate for humanity so that someone will be lost when they won't come back to watch this movie. It involves Cliche # 6 and # 7. Unless a person has never seen a movie before they see what has come. The father even makes the dumber fault run away from the fighters at the end and is shot by an old man, who suddenly breaks down. You would think he thought that the poor boy was innocent of every movie and gave him wrong. When she was not. Now for a little girl whose father brought with him. I think what happens to him? Times up, he ended up living with a family whose child was killed by his father !! Come! You all know that it will happen, because he is a child instead! That's why he did not go and live with Lindey Price. <br /> <br /> This movie was hate as I was concerned. Because there were so many ways this movie could explore and drop but it said to take a shaded shadow. The 2 stars are for 2 stars, the little girl, who I thought was very good with Lindsey Price whose character was angry but did what she could. My advice takes the opposite of deleting your head with it instead of looking at this
