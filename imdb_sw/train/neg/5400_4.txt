This is just a short of fest full gore fest based story Stephen King. Two authors of the text, one of whom was (Miguel Ferrer) and one who was unsuccessful (Julie Entwisle), begin to believe that a common killer (Michael H. Moss) can be a vampire. Alien than the odd is a modern modern modern shepherd has no natural way, but through Cessna black wants his victims. The real Gore gets gruesome as the film approaches its stupid end. Remember that Mr. Mr. had nothing to do with this film. I admit it's a little scary at the wee hour of the night.
