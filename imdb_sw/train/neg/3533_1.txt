Let this film be used as a death death for the "great misleading" film produced out of the 1990s. Ron Howard used the differences in good things. However, in REVOLVER, the director Guy Ritchie (known in a certain cycle as "Mr. Madonna"), uses the Soze motif in many ways. Jason Statham (a very skeptical head of the hair) like Jack Green (known as both "Mr. Green.") He can also or cannot be a Mr. breaker. Or, maybe Mr. Gold is a spirit of anger that can be members of the world. I'm not quite sure, but I really don't care. REVOLVER is one of the preliminary illustrations of the movie I was angry for so long. Witness structure of broken time, reduced to the pain of the pain, into the inside-monologues, and the most active sequence of animation. This "everything and sink kitchen" leading fashion makes the work of Quentin Tarantino looking sedate. The smoke of movies and mirrors only leads me to believe that Ritchie was like bored talking about this story as I looked at. The film has been filled during the revelation that deserves to be scary but comes only as information to Mr. Green. I wanted to love Green as I often enjoy Stratham as a character who is two steps in front of everyone else. Here, however, he struggles as a reader to revise the University of English Book. His lack of wit is similar to the lack of prevention shown by his nemesis, Macha (Ray Liotta). Free <br /> <br /> No redemption features for REVOLVER. It is still another film of faux pas from Ritchie and can even out of its worst remake of SWEPT AWAY as its bad film yet.
