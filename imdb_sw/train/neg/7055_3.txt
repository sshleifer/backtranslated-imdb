lets start by saying that "JWWAN DIAMOND" is just a terrible movie. I agree with the last person who said "I was not happy". lol. The joke was just awesome. Exhibitions were average. Something went wrong with the film. Emraan absolutely deserved something better. All CELINA JAITLEY made clear. Hrishitta bhatt was the same. Emraan hashmi was similar. MANN (EMRAAN HASHMI) is a desperate person who wants to be popular. So, she uses RADHA and pretends to love her, because her father is a music director and can help her become famous (for, the father obeys everything his daughter says). One day, MANN and her friends go to GOA to have fun. There meets ROMA (CELINA JAITLEY) and falls completely to her look and tries to play with BLA BLA BLA. That night, ROMA can't open the door in her room, and MANN decides to help her. Seeing that it can't also, Rome asks you to ask for help. When she has gone, MANN can open the door and she decides to come in and sit on her bed BLA BLA BLA. ROMA comes with those who stand one night. However, in one night-standing Rome likes to love him. That morning, they see underground (MAHESH) who see it all. Don loves ROMA and could not stand what he saw. He commands them to marry, and to fear, MANN obeys the command and the Roman Merry. Then, their story of marriage has been in the newspaper. MANN future knows that she likes ROMA after making video music together. Now bound between love and popularity. BLA BLA BLA. <br /> <br /> The movie is awesome. These songs "SIN NEIN NEIN NE NE" is a fantastic version of the remix is ​​much better. "DIL DIWANA" is also great. Title title is also amazing. GUYS, FIND TO SEE YOUR KNOWLEDGE.
