This is a really bad film. What they have done is considered a TV show, which has never been focusing on young children and giving the treatment of George Lucas (ie the destruction of wiping by appealing to a small audience). The TV show of Thunderbirds was not exactly the brain of the exhibition, in fact it was a good formulaic, but it was always enjoyable to watch (especially when the models were struck) and the sound released was not so bad. This is facing a bad cast and evil act (with special differences of Sophia Myles as Lady Penelope & Ron Cook as Parker, who seem to be the only members planned to have a clue about how their characters should play) & after this efficiency I can not allow Traffic employees directly. <br /> <br /> The whole part of Thunderbirds was that it was about the whole Tracy family and how they worked as a team, preventing disaster or saving those involved in disasters. Avoid this waste as a blow. <br /> <br /> I just gave him out of 10 because the zero rating was not served.
