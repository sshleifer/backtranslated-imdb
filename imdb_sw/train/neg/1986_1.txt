You must agree with another reviewer. This should be a movie of WORST, just let the western I've ever seen. The worst act, a conversation that was thoughtless and pathetic (safe only because it is 1800 years), and oh, have I said a battery pack shown back behind one of the characters? I was waiting for a boom girl to fall in the middle of the area. And the end? A few things I can say is that it was the same as the rest of the filmâ€¦ very awesome. And yes, there was every time of the book from walking slowly on the dirt road to taste "let's remember when it" strikes when someone dies. Luckily I found this on free TV. Don't waste your time.
