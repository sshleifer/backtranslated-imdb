Bonfires of Vanities is a film fired in the flop. I can't remember any film that has tried to be very hard, stimulating and important, but it has failed very much for each board. It resembles a comic stand who does not get a laugh, but can not leave the action. The film is very tempting, with every attempt of laughter being caused by a visible thud. The despair of the film shows is to promptly sympathize with all those involved. The film reaches the sound of just two laughs. Once it is in front of Geraldo Rivera with a proud, arrogant and proud journalist television - which is just amazing because she doesn't know she plays herself. Another feature that deserves to laugh is the last of the "great film" of the film, where the judge who participated with Morgan Freeman gives a speech of sanctification on what values ​​are ("what your mother taught you!"). The breath of this time is insulting to the point of being extraordinary. However, one must admit it is a good effort. It has a good, if well-beaten, a group of actors, who are trying to make characters out of thin cardboard caricatures. The film looks professional and small movies enjoys that director Brian DePalma just loves it, if not very good. But the film, which seems to be seeking to be a high definition of values ​​and modern values, does not give up the rate of cartoon. Satire requires fashion. Farce needs energy. Even the sitcom requires time. But the best Bonfires can reluctant to despair. At the end, you don't want to laugh, just want to stop.
