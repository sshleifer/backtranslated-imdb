Remake of H.B. Halicki's seven-year film tracking is just awesome. With the Destruction Point, has gone into Second Seconds 60 represents a quintessential film after film. Remake takes nature and puts it on its head. When Halicki gave us 75% of the car following and 25% of the drama game, in GISS 2000 we get a 25% car and 75 minutes follow. Cage as a good man, saves his brother, kissing the girl. MTV has changed, tits and ass. Save your money, the original tax. At least Halicki did not see his child (he wrote, reproduced, directed, and selected in the '74' film) canceled in this manner.
