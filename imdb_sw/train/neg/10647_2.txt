The last Tarzan film talking about Johnny Weissmuller (looking for an amazing age after "Tarzan and Huntress") is bad, despite all the trivia man can add to make it better. It is obvious that RKO attempted to lose a lot of Weissmuller, shooting in a beautiful environment in MÃ©xico, and the top star of the country (Andrea Palma) and a famous movie star winner Gabriel Figueroa, bringing an elegant actor Dimitri Tiomkin to make a mark. Although it may be costly to hide pictures out of the country, it seems to be more expensive than any RKO film in a series, using the advantages of Acapulco beaches and real pyramids like Aquatania, and with an attractive decoration for all events related to the temple of God Balu (mainly outside, built on steep rocks.) Kurt Neumann should stay as a director, instead of Robert Florey, who gives very little speed. Neumann had done a good job with "Tarzan and Amazons", "Tarzan and the Lady of the Leopard" and "Tarzan and Huntress", and finished his work to lead the classic "The Fly" year before his death; when Florey became a television director, after the work of several amazing films. If the player seems tired, chimp play Cheeta is not as good as others, but the worst character is Benji, the obnoxious mailman who will sing the bad songs (which has the Caribbean air, in an area that must be Africa and shoot in Mexico!) Boring and deciding for bad taste , it was sad for Tarzan Weissmuller.
