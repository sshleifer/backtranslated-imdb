Kris Kristofferson, at its peak of gold in the mid-70's, finds himself capable of squeezing on the screen with the La Streisand ego with a humorous and delicate female store. <br /> <br /> No characters are really loving; I was just happy when Ferrari's Kristofferson was flying over that hill and fell. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a good film on rock rock and rock, try _The Buddy Holly Story_ (made almost a year and a half after this dreck).
