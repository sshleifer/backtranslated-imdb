Geez! This is one of those movies that you think you were experiencing but was not. I mean, you didn't give a string on it but somehow came to your mind. <br /> <br /> Be honest and short; this is one of the worst, most impressive, and stupid. I can't say anything good about this piece because there is good follow-up that you can say you have done by professional filmmakers. <br /> <br /> Death events are terrible, bloody, stupid. This program is good to consider that you have published "Popcorn" from 1991. To do things worse, this is not a very bad film that is good. It's just bad. Molly Ringwald tried to do better but not enough.
