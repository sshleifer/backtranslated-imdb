This was one of the brightest movies we watched in the last few months and the predictable plot and the worst act (especially from supportive characters). Interview with Hugh Laurie on DVD was more realistic than the film itself ... Hugh Laurie will definitely put a lot of effort in learning how to play the dance Samba but the scope of his character is only needed to dive into the end of the pool. The movie depends on the appearance of a beautiful girl and good music but these is not enough to make a good entertainment. If you have never seen Rio, or within the UK bank, this film is for you. 2 out of 10.
