Fans of very loud hold the Mard of Amitabh Bachan at the very top but I think it's very overrated. Manmohan Desai collaborated before the movie like Suhaag, Parvarish, Amar Akbar Anthony, Naseeb, Desh Premee and Coolie and I saw all who loved so much I had a great prospect before looking at Mard and I was desperate. My main gripe on Mard is that it feels like Amar Akbar Anthony part 2, maybe Mr Desai lost his mind, after all he was using the same formula for years and years. 1. Firstly the other members of the cast are retrieved from AAA, for example a police inspector who brings Amar, a Muslim who brings Akbar, Nirupa Roy and a few more. 2. In AAA Nirupa Roy loses his eyes, Mard loses his voice 3. In AAA there is a popular song (Shirdi those sai fathers) well Mard we have Amitabh singing Maa Sherawali. After seeing AAA for more than 1000 times I saw that immediately. My other gripe is that some of these situations seem to be worried, the real Manmohan Desai left your brain on a movie type but with Mard I thought he went too far. My last Gripe is that compared to the old movie songs of Manmohan Desai I've found songs instead of despair. I know it has many fans who swear to them but I didn't like it a bit. It really hurts me to write these reviews because I am a big fan and I love his movies since I was a child.
