Although this was the production of-to-TV, there is no excuse for the lower rock results of the finished product. This DID film has a budget and had a department of repair, therefore, if you make a film about a real life story, and actually put a "true story" in the head, it is not appropriate to put forward a try and catch some truth? First of all, this movie is thrown out. These pastors are a day-to-day television soap, or in the life of the life of the Life Center, and not in a real life / criminal group. Everything about them, from their exhibitions in their way, just screamed 90-generation mall-alt-rock-listening. What about the script? Two words describe - stupid and insulting, and again it is also 90ish sounding. I don't think Clyde Barrow literally said "I'm out here." It's like a "New Children's Block for Block Women" when they met and decided to make a "klick" around Bonnie and Clyde, you know, one that will be quite rad and rockin '. Well, this sticker does not even rank on rad and rockin 'scale. Everything that might be wrong with any kind of film is wrong here, from giving and acting with editing and music. Everything is so badâ€¦ and what it feels that the parties involved in this sensory Turkey is the courage to put a "true story" in the head. Certainly not a true story, but even worse, not even entertaining as far as flick popcorn no matter what is accepted for its own terms. As I said in my head, it's just the most frightening of the words, each level considered. Believe me on this, or look at your own risk.
