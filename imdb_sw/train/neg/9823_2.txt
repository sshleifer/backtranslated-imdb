There is an interesting discussion in this film. What? Being a moral person is good, or do you need something else? The movie is preaching that without God's guidance, that a good moral man is not enough. There is a earlier line in the film, "You and I can look at someone with good character, but they both know he will go to hell." <br /> <br /> When I am not a Christian, talk about this during the movie period was amazing, but not through the planned film. I left the movie with a strong feeling that being good good * is * enough. Discussions and discussions presented were very favorable, so that they could push themselves to their own ignorance. Preference can be a great thing, especially when it is not included in the minds of the ignorant and uneducated. As George Carlin's behavior in Dogma said: "The hook when they are younger". <br /> <br /> The basic premise is one interesting too. A Bible scientist from the 1890s tries to publish a book that says that values ​​without God are the same, as moral values ​​are. Do you tell the child just to steal? Or do you tell him not to steal because God did not tell him? (not the problem of bringing that child to steal because, well, how would he feel if his marbles were stolen?) <br /> <br /> Author, Carlisle, wants his school recommendations to help sell the book (spreading the world). However, it requires unity of unity, and one of the scholars opposes it. He brings up, in a very interesting discussion earlier in the film about ethics and values ​​vs the argument of God's words. In order to prove his point, he produces a temporary machine (to keep the film just to work the plot, which I enjoy), and to send Carlisle in 2002 to see where the doctrine of morality without God will lead us. If it should be obvious, he has his opinion, and has been changed by what he sees, and has restrained during his return (because he is returning, not really a weapon, this is a movie movie after all). <br /> <br /> If the movie is a movie itself, it's slow and very inappropriate. What was not * required in this film, is that it produces two “bad guys” who want to try to identify who Carlisle is, even not harm anyone, has committed a crime, or anything. What is wrong with the movie just to show Carlisle's view, showing his view of this "sin world", and bring him back to a new perspective? Also, there are a few points in the movie that assure me that I am not a Christian, or at least someone who says "It's God or nothing". Three near the end of the cinema instead of harming me .. first, when the two "bad" corner Carlisle before the fly, Carlisle does only * the true point of contempt. He fakes as his time-fly is coming to Jesus, and makes it "evil" (who is also Christians btw, oddly enough), think they just missed the rapture. Second, after Carlisle's return, he finds a young man where he thought at the beginning of the movie about stealing (but not mentioning God, the child put marble and running), and tells him this when stealing is wrong because God commands . As Carlin's calcium above, disgusting children in religion is faux-pas in my book. <br /> <br /> And last, epilogue. Another awesome way. Carlisle asks the inventor how in the future can go, and says he does not know. -how, he's like 2030 or so. In all movies, Carlise says that he felt the end of the world is coming, because the world is full of sin and the name of God. The horrible methods have been used for thousands of years. You would think in these mentioned times, the church would be light too. <br /> <br /> Happy to see this film. When I was sure before that ethical beauty was enough, now I really know. It is worth checking if you are not a Christian, proving how happy you are to be as ignorant as people in this film.
