What were they thinking of "Cannes"? One of the most offensive films, of all time. Every detail of this film, no matter how unreasonable was shown. If I had to look at him wearing these boots once more I think I would like to scream. If the action of this film was to show how Rosetta's life was shaken, then it was covered within the first fifteen minutes of the movie and then those features should be running. But no, we had to see many images of repeated cuts. The whole thing is filled with the invisible and unfeeling characters. They deserved the problem that was Rosetta. And imagine me passing "Tumbleweeds" to see the film on-hyped film of boredom. It was like watching grass growing, just that's more exciting.
