Disney has done again. The company that made "Mr. Magoo" and "George of the Jungle" has made another film that is not identical to the cartoon that has been built, and it is not worth no natural spirit. "Inspector Car" was one of my cartoons that I liked when I was younger, and for his movie there could be a dream to be discussed at the time. Now that the film is, I'm very discouraged, even angry. We all have characters. Your own gadget has gadgets that have made such a habit of a fun cartoon of nature (with special effects accompanying them), and even has a preview of the original Gadget, but now has more potential and is expected to solve a crime while Penny and Brain just look. Penny does not have a bit to do; when he played a major role in the cartoon, discovered the crime and finished it, and occasionally get captured by MAD agents, now he is just introduced and then forget, though he at least sneak at the Claw base. <br /> <Claw is a film version of Dr Claw, who was a very sinful man, who was wearing a shelf and sitting on his seat, his face was hidden from view, as he hit a cat and managed a range of crimes. Now he is just a man with a claw in hand, and there is no secret behind the character. <br /> <br /> Brain and Cat Mad are in the film, but not so much. The little pieces of cartoon were not saved in this violation. Popular words "Wowsers!" was changed by secret to "Wowser", and Gadgetmobile's Gadget now looks different and speaks. <br /> <br /> There is a product delivery even everywhere. Why "Yahoo!" was announced by sign? Why Gadgetmobile has buttons for M & M or Skittles? <br /> <br /> The cartoon fans will love it, others can get a movie down par, and all the time it is said and done, this movie is another attempt to make some quick bucks from another old show.
