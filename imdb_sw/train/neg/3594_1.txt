This is not a terrible film, but the sex movies of boring. Very bad movie, in order to be avoided by any awesome fan. There is no plot, malicious and fun acting. If you just look at the trailer you will know enough ... It is a shame that something is available on VHS or video when there are many good movies available. If you like Vampires try Hammer Productions or Gothic Italy from Mario Bava and Antonio Margheriti instead. That's masterpieces if you compare this with this garbage. Testing = even "1" is very much! And I believe, I am not alone with this opinion.
