This can be made for hell, but it was more serious films that I have seen in years, The best thing about the whole DVD will be the case !!! I am surprised that people took time to do something to have garbage and still spend money too, I'm glad I just rent. I think the real fans of this film probably should be concerned with Gothic taking care of it without taking any CGI or other effects to it, I hope Alex Chandon learned a lesson about lighting and SFX to make the best film in the future, that is, if he still has a job. <br /> <br /> Details for these buyers are very sad, don't know !!!!!
