I wonder what people who gave this 10 saws in which I am not. This film has a hard time following and / or sitting on a plot. If someone tells you it is comedy, uninhabited, it is 98% odd and 2% of comedy. All characters turn to good performance, which cannot be denied, however it seems like you have lost something somewhere. He does not know if the original script was good and was supposed to be edited or what. This was capable, and instead it was true. I love the hour and half I have invested in this film back, but the video rental section does not return to time. Save your money and see something else.
