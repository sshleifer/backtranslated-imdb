There is no speck of entertainment in all this film. There is no single, exciting, or interesting place in this film. Announces itself as fear, then continues to emerge comedy. He doesn't even know humor. Nor does he try to fear. That you don't have to be tired of this film, you would be one of the world's most vulnerable people. If you like this film even BIT LITTLE than you don't have what you look at all. I have had a very difficult time trying to try to understand what vendors tried to accomplish with this. It's not funny, awesome, terrible, or exciting. So it had to be an event? Because it was not even amazing. <br /> <br /> Please do it personally and don't see this film. Life is very precious to lose 90 minutes of this watch.
