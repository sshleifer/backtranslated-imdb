Two days after seeing this thing, I still have bitterness in appearance. It is very bad, you should ask yourself how anyone can write this, even less to allow you to be free to the general public. The beaten work, the leading man who looks like he sleeps, and Alison Eastwood is happy himself. The action is a sign of a low-budget decision, which means it is very serious. Poor? Well, if you were 6 years old, then you could write this movie. Simple, idealistic, and simply quite clear.
