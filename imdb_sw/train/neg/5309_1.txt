I saw a movie one night on the cable and did not believe it was bad. I often enjoy bad movies, but this was so powerful that it was not even entertaining. Some of the highlights of this film include amazing music that continues to play every time of the film, special effects of damage (when someone is shot by a laser gun turns neon green and quickly disappears), and a disgusting task. Acting, in fact, is what I feel stealing the show. I did not recognize any of the actors in the film, and I hope I have never seen anyone. In general, I recommend hiring this movie (if you can find, I can imagine a video shop to carry this waste) just so you can learn to appreciate the quality film after seeing this garbage.
