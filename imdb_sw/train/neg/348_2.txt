This film is a Sean Connery car to refuse and forget. The exhibition is generally a crappy mainly with Capshaw, Fishburne, and a regular Ed Ed Harris. Connery seems to be like Harvard Academic. The movie completely gets bad if it goes along. It is the third secret of the level that becomes highly derived from time decreases. The movie squanders help the best cast. George Plimpton also returns in a small role to add other bonds to Connery as they discuss the death penalty. Violence and pepper spray is a third / thriller which is a cheat for a high degree. Scripting and direction are very poor. Charisma and glass of Connery are just the beauty of the film. Helper, Scissors, and Ridiculous. 2/10 Avoid.
