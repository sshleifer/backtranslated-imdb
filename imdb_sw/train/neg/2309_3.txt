I have high tolerance for strange animals, but in fact some film goes, a strange way - so far that makes your brain hurt. This is the film. Trying to understand or even explain it is impossible and I think the film understands well when using drugs - it is impossible. The movie begins with a beautiful Japanese animation involving cat. However, out of blue, tons of distorted and often frightening things - make me ask if I lose something in translation. However, even if this is the case, why did we need to be given to the magic craft images involving honoring a clever woman, defending, puking, flames of fire, etc.. All of this seemed to be so bad and interesting. Oddly, and I don't know why, others see this as a work of genius. I just don't get it.
