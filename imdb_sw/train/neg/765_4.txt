What were they thinking about? Over the past few years Columbo has tried new things and turned away from the most successful form but this film makes it more. This film is very different from any Columbo film but the difference is not good for the film. The main thing that really makes this film different from any Columbo movie is the fact that there is no murder being done. The entire cluster of this movie is quite different and puts Columbo character in a completely different environment. Also the total is quite different from the 'modern'. Director Alan J. Levi Lebu made other Columbo movies in the past, all of which were acceptable for the usual form. It also makes an unfamiliar choice that took the lead to this movie. The Columbo actor also feels quite different, perhaps because of the reasons placed in different circumstances and conditions, when he helps his nephew after his grandmother disappears after the wedding. The absence of beauty and trademark of the beautiful Columbo beauty also does not do so with a good look or enjoyment. All of the honesty, the film is not so bad but the movie will begin to be more and more ridiculous to its story as it goes. It's stupid like a kidnap-thriller written by a story that becomes more and more possible. It also makes the most possible and unknown film. This is a very small entry to Columbo's entry which also does not invite its audience in any way. It also does not give too much support that supporters are not more talented around. In spite of the fact that his behavior has been placed in a completely different way with the movie being hit in a completely different fashion, Peter Falk still keeps well and his presence still saves this film. What? Can you just imagine how this film would have without it? It would be very bad and says a cheap film I can tell you. Normal colonization of Columbo, which can be described as an attempt to turn out of the normal form. <br /> <br /> 4/10
