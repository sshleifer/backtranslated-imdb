This should be one of the Swedish movies that have been destroyed. <br /> <br /> It is embarrassing that such a bad script was allowed to be a movie and is shown on the movie as soon as the year 2006. It should not be clear. I can't understand why many well-known artists even thought the idea was seen even in a film like this. If I had any respect for other actors known in the film before seeing the film, it went to the point now. I have heard that there will be a film on this track and I can't understand how it is possible.
