Every Christmas night I make my children suffer yet another display of Wonderful Life. I also enjoyed Santa. Then pray for me. I agree. I love schmaltzy movies. I love them too, as well as, but as with many things, different types are good. Would the Christmas Season be without an annual movie of ka-ching ka-ching of Santa in all its exhibitions, from Edmund Gwenn to Billy Bob Thornton? Fred Claus cannot forget anyone forget Bedford Falls, but I don't believe the Christmas film should reach the iconic status to succeed. "Fred" is the best movie of holiday holidays, with adequate humor to adults and enough charm for children. My wife and I laughed, even if humor was open and Vince was just Vince. Paul Giamatti was a top Santa player, which helped a lot. It's not a great flick, and should not be a necessary view for everyone's Christmas traditions. But my wife and daughter we enjoyed why, a holmaltz holiday with a small dash of ingredients. There is nothing wrong with that.
