What? Are we talking about that movie? This movie is totally ridiculous, the plot is disgusting and completely without logic. It is directly to the DVD / TV-movie including all the essential ingredients of the horror of the film: Dealing with the perpetrators have been doing, step-by-step from unfamiliar conspiracy, GIRL SHOWING HER T (why, god, why?), people are unacceptable to things like they would like in real life. I will not bother with the details, it will take all night. Well, just the same: If two people were killed before you as you walked on the street, one of the victims died with your hands, his blood came from your wound around your head, it would be your first concern to be; "Oh, he came out of the world and the last thing he saw was my angry face!" My thoughts go to Harvey and his lost work.
