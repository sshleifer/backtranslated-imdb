Okay, I totally love Ben Stiller, though I am a shadow about Jennifer Aniston. I don't think this girl can do at least. Every movie or sitcom I have seen in him is very difficult to pass his fake work. It looks like he's standing there just reading the truth on the script. This movie had only one thing about it, and that Ben Bener was in it. This plan is used by abuse is ridiculous. How many films have this type of plot? Can we say "Power of the State?" It's not just that the plot is old, but the result is predictable, it's boring. I knew everything would happen before I did. It was a bearing, but the Stiller watch is always fun!
