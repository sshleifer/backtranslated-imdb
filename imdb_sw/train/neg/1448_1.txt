After growing up in Texas, and less than 15 miles from what was Gilley, I can tell you that this film is nausea. Many of the Texans do not live like this film shows. The program is weak, and fake accents are amusing, and tightening the stereotypical image that all Texans are drinking beer, honky-tonkin ', rednecks. The accents of the fake fiction of Texas is what it raises me for me. True, there are some Texas twang for many accents of Texans, but these people destroy it. You can't find someone from New Jersey and Ohio to make Texas accents. It doesn't just work. John Travolta should be connected to the disco-play or 50s. Debra Winger was more convincing as a Wonderful Girl than she is like Texan.
