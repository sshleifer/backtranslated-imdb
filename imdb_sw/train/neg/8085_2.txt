Oh hilarity! Oh happy! Another film which is very bad is good! Or, so I thought. In fact, this lacks a "very bad phase" phase and may, sadly, directly to "it would be very bad, but they wiped it out and made it clear." <br /> <br /> To start its way too long. Cut half an hour and may last longer. Then put it in interesting squares like "a person who is busy with the mission to save the Earth, because he has all the food and he will be rich if the message will fail!". Duh! Or "chat room" device has been seen in the Dark Star. Guess what .... such as in Star Star, the bomb has malfunction ..... hmmmm. Add to the dash of "we can not do our way out of kindergarten" and you have a short solar disorder. <br /> <br /> Light help should have a state of Jack Palance (or Jack Pants, as we called him in this flick), whose special purpose in the film is to run the child next to the desert and call the father of the child to pick him up. ... finally. Between driving and phone calls, Jack provides an unlicensed car with laers and a lot of cackles, but it contributes a little bit to the story, as it is. In short, he is the best of the film. My prize for "A Release-Accurate Line Release" goes to Charlton Heston, who, when meeting his first son for the first time for years, says his son looks a little "without shape". when he himself stood there and his stomach found on his waist and with a great need for Captain Kirk Corset. It is also interesting is the worst man of the henchman, who has a white white hairstyle that continues to make me think of Andy Warhol, for some reason. <br /> <br /> Apart from these hilarities, there is little to recommend this movie. The latter is a sequence published from (but with a pity than a short) last sequence from 2001. <br /> Tips to enjoy this movie more, if you are not enough to look at it, as I did: <br /> <br /> 1. Whenever a bomb speaks, think it is called Tarquin (I believe, it works!) <br /> <br /> 2. Any time Chuck Heston is on the screen and on talking, before removing it by writing a line from the Apes Planet as well as " Get your dirty paws off me! ‚Äù or similar. Whenever the female direction is expected to emphasize (this is a lot of time) you expect hope for the hope that she will have an aneurism and will soon die. Time impossible "The ship has broken again" events, you expect that the boys / technicians will hit the Scotty Forest as "You can change the laws of physics!" or other trophies. <br /> <br /> Other than that, do what it takes to get you through this. I ended up half of the way and woke up to realize that I had nothing, not a conspiracy (laughable though it) has continued. So don't worry about making out for a few, you can't miss anything.
