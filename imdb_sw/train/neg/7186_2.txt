Sorry for all fans, but this is an inappropriate movie. Acting is bad, even timber, has-hypes something shocking earlier, and it doesn't work exactly. I think there was waiting at the end, but just ended up being maddeningly combining. What? What is hell? Dude who was killing everyone was one of the hunters? Try again. <br /> <br /> It is not natural, and not as good as direct slasher. And that says something. I think anyone who made the castings, anyone who wrote the script, and anyone who thinks of the concept should be expelled and deleted without privacy. Don't look at this movie. If someone puts this on the ceremony, disconnect the disc out of the window and put it on a good film of fear, like the gentleness of the Lamb or shine.
