This film is an idiotic experiment in some kind of exciting actions. The trip to Las Vegas is attacked by a group of white garbage operators. They drive them out into the desert and then steal all the valuable things. The program is constantly changing. One minute they look to capture the rich daughter of the ranchers, the next looking for a team to collect the value of $ 90,000. The conversation is awesome. <br /> <br /> Please don't watch this film.
