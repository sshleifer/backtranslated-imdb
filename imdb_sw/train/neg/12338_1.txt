I saw this film earlier in the playground, when I was about 10 years old. Even then 'humor' was speaking gently to my young mind. <br /> <br /> In the past, whenever I see Ed Begley Jr. or jeff Goldblum I would like to bite and start feeling uncomfortable and even a little sad. Until I was reminded of the existence of this film today, I did not know why I felt so. It seems I blocked my memory of this film still my bad feelings against two criminals remained. Apparently I forgot that I saw this film but sadly sad for the pieces of my soul that had been stolen, and without EATEN and the creators of this non-human work. <br /> <br /> I've never been trying to try as an adult. I think that as part of the healing process that I should probably look in to deal with this fear of childhood that I might * really * put it behind me. Some regression and / or hypnosis therapy may not be a bad idea either.
