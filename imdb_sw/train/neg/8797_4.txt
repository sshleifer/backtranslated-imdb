Never the last frenzy of the clever visual irone is not necessary to create an engaging film. The "Blonde Wig" of half of the movie has not been removed perhaps because of the very fun for its creators. Wong Faye half (with very play, like Karen Carpenter looking, Faye Wong) has more appeal. All links, however, the story of the girl-meets-the-story boy takes the back seat for the art of art. The handling of the character is different. Feelings don't exist. For music lovers, Wong Faye's "Mung Jung Yun" (the Cantonese cranberry version of smash hit "Dreams") is used effectively in Chungking Express. Faye Wong also wrote a language version of Mandarin called "Zhen Tuo." They are all on CD, although only "Mung Jung Yun" is found on the official audio sound.
