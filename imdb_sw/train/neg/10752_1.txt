This film was awesome. From the blurb that made me decide to love the Phantom (why is this called?) I expected something of arty and thought to beautiful pictures. It had interesting pictures but often they seemed to be good and they didn't know it. In fact they seemed like they had been put in filling time. Finally the effect did not have a list. I believe the movie meant to be a sky, but it wasn't. The lack of unity of unity did not help things. You could say it was strange, but I think it was not alive and any situation. The main character seemed to be tense but the plot did not appeal to me by keeping his status. Without looking at the list, I don't realize that you see the main character as a child. Film has very few moments of time, place or character. It is not brutal but gender-based (several) seemed to be more meaningful and confused. It was only when I saw the qualities that I found behind the hair was meant to have a partner. This film has failed to do what is shocking (a dream-related mother of Lulu) seems to be boring. Open the nails to really make more sense, as it reflected the emotional state of Lulu. I'm not going to be wrong with actors if I'm not much to work. I don't know if the lack of environment or flow in the film is because of the inability or because it was self-fatal but the end result was bad. <br /> <br /> I can't worry about talking about it again.
