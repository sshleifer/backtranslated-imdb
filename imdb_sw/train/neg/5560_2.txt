It seems just run really to create, any movie offered by Dolph Lundgren is bad! I don't know whether it is the fact that the story of the story is full of holes, or that Dolph is a very bad actor. There is no spoiler here, It seems to abandon the pushing and hitting and catching and touching something in this movie. In my opinion it is surprising that some of these projects get a capital project to gain power and in the theater.
