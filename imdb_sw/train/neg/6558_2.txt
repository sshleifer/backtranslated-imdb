We organized five movies for the New Year's weekend and we looked at this first. All I can say is that there was no chance to go but after watching this. It was useless and unusual. The secret of Harvey Keitel should be easy to write - just make two words out of three words. Andie McDowell is an amazing good in character list, but the movie does nothing else to recommend.
