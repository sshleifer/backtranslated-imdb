Elmo's fire has no life after the university all the time (for most of us ordinary people however). Why were the trash made? Who can relate to this? Who lives like these characters? I feel real to the participants involved with this awesome script. There are some talented actors in this "film" that has done a good job elsewhere. It should be just one joke to them on the set. <br /> <br /> I found this "film" to despise my mind. The only happiness I have received from this is the hope that Sir John Hughes had a good laugh when he saw this observation of the same year of his release of the Food Release Club. Do not make the same mistake I made for this look because you like 80 films.
