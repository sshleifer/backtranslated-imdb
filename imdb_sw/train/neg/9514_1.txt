Please, let me have these films that teach us that crime is fun and just. Couple who with a vacuum script and a great desire to be Farrelly or a brother Coen, with a survival of yet another group of ordinary high school people make Dawson Creek-brand teen perfect bangst with the voice of GenXYZ that woefully tries to make the movie "feel "cool and, we have a very great satire and pain. <br /> <br /> This even even below 'Ferris Bueller' ... I would like to look at the change of traffic light. Only one event comes out as anywhere near the entry value: when Betty Masked girls meet friend Richard Nixon Masked. It's time to surreal. For yet. <br /> <br /> But for all others, I'd like to have a toothache. At least I can use Benzocaine (tm) to stop the pain.
