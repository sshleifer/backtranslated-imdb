This movie is very slow and does not plot. It gives the life of the boat's boat. One of the elders is true in his attempt to find a job. There may be some social definitions here, but, they are offered as no one has built for the light of mercy. I don't understand why it was 7.8 when I decided to look at it. I looked at the whole thing and created hope for the great benefit of redemption. No luck. IMD estimates have always been a good match for my taste. Anything above 6.5 was worth checking. My wife says Javier Barem won't look good in this film. He is not my type, so, my agreement doesn't mean much. Sigh. I give 1.
