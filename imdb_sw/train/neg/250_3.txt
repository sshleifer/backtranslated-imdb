After seeing three other versions of the same film, I am afraid of this is very weak, especially because of Scott's poor performance and leadership. All his feelings are so bland makes it difficult to participate in the film. Alistair Sim demonstrated the best role. While Scrooge had its meaning, you don't mean Scott says a discussion and great trust and while having his metamorphosis he is equal to failure. I can't imagine any characters in this film that match those from the Alistair Sim version. Even the music version (and actually Muppets) takes this is best implemented. Very disappointed.
