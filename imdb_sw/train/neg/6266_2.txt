It looks like anyone can make a film today. It's like you need both a camera, a group of people being your cast and staff, script, and a little money and walla you have a movie. The problem is that talent is not part of this equality and often these low-budget films are becoming duds. Video store shelves are full of these films. These are not the smell of guilt, however, is the destruction of cellulodi which is better forgotten. Troma's entertainment is known for making a trash film, but most of their films are b gold gold. However, some of the films that they left did not have anything to do with some, like 'Last weekend,' didn't deserve any type of release. Pros: Members sent are doing better with lousy equipment. Some of the non-voluntary hilarity. It goes at a good speed (For 81 minutes). Cons: inappropriate text, which includes putrid talks and hollow holes. It has slowed down, especially the events of the night and the last, which you can not do at all. It does not make sense of mind. It's been bad. Very cheap effects. Total lack of behavioral development and does not care for anyone. This is supposed to be a terrible film, but it is not in the area and not a little frightening. No interesting or exciting happens. Due to unwanted padding. Last thought: I never expected this to be a certain gem forgotten, but I never thought it would be bad. I do not know if it is a very bad film made, but it's a definite crisis. Troma should allow this film to decay rather than open it. Do not make the mistake I made and let your curiosity get better. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1/5
