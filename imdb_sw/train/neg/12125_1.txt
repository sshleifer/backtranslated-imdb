Why do people who do not know at some point in the past were like to feel the need to try to define that time to others? Put Woodstock with a civil war with Apollo new-landing and Titanic sink and you have got as a real flick as opera this opera soap is quite well known with less life trash. What are the children who were too young to go to Woodstock and who failed to form a school grade to do? "I will show you these old things, I will put my own film and prove that you don't know nuttin about your topic still making money!" Well, we already know that. One thing to watch this film for me was to give me little insight into thinking under the mirror. Sometimes I see a slut on a bar that looks like Diane Lane, I'm running another way. It is abuse of children to allow parents to think of children who are worthless. It is the abuse of the audience only by the stick of Woodstock and a new insert in the flick as that ipso facto means film shows 1969.
