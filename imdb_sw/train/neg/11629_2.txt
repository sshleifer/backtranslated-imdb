** SPOILERS ** KHAMOSH can't be quite, it doesn't have a conspiracy, and basically just made it look like stars. The most insistent part of the movie was when Shabana Azmi is in the shower and then we see her TV playing the PSYCHO shower area. This modern users believe that the behavior of Naseeruddin Shah has a good memory to remember where some shots were chased and how many! SPAILER *** INSTRUCTIONS *** It is a little humorous (just a little) at the beginning to hear the director and cast members to throw insults to each other and hear Shabana Azmi amazing, " Oh sh-t! " <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie of barsaaaaaaaaad! / Rating: ** out of ********** (2 out of 10)
