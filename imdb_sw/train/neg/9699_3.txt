Despite what many others thought about the first movie, I liked it very much. However. How to count it in one word: This movie is (and here comes the word): CRAP! But let's look at the section in part: Here's a plot: Finally the old queen has been removed from her fortress, but her successor: White snow has other kinds of problems: Army-Jester, father of his son, is lost, being super, spliss, goes violently, fighting his gray hair and selling royal children for red and full hair. In desperate Snow white seeks the help of Bubi (Otto Walkees), who must first have six other girlfriends and then try to get the royal children or at least try to get the name of Rumpelstiltskin. The whole plot seems written in the weekend, where the authors were very drunk but were just under pressure from the label to write the screenplay. Yes, there is a good joke. Even for fans of the first place, or for any other fan actors, it's not worth buying DVD. Believe me. The only thing, that at least the kind of saving the movie from the perfect trouble, is the performances of some actors. That's why I gave 3/10 points. Sadly, the script is so bad that no characters or all can connect can create a bad story. For example, at one point, even crosses into our reality, and sadly. However, many of the main actors in this film: Otto Waalkes, Ralf Schmitz, Martin Schneider, Nina Hagen, Cosma Shiva Hagen, (especially funny): RÃ¼diger Hoffmann as a mirror, Helge Schneider and many more but sadly all these stimulants can not bring this very bad script to live. It is probably treated for other hardcore fans but for ordinary movie travelers or currently DVD students or buyers should not make money. <br /> <br /> I even regret renting a movie.
