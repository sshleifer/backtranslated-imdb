I have finished watching the guinea pig - the experimental experiment. I tell you that this film, though it has a very good FX, the best I expected, was not a good movie. I honestly can't say that I enjoyed this movie completely. It is indeed the best way to be a traumatic, real, miserable, torture of suffering, but I have seen it is very bad (and not as I expected). And I have also seen that the torturers were very bitter, while speaking and screaming trying to hear hard all the time, even more devastating (and I'm sure there are other people out who would agree with me on that). Now I have seen pig pigs 1,2,3,5 and the best among those in my opinion is the pig of Guinea 2 - Flowers of the body and blood. I don't know a lot about the experiments of Devils, except the Fx General, the nature of the girl, tries to frighten people, generally I give 4 stars because of FX cos which is amazing.
