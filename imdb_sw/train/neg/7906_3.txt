Not hit Korman as he was very scared at Carol Burnett's show. He was also good at playing secondary characters in Mel Brooks ("High Anxiety" comes to mind). He, however, is not a person who can carry a film in the role of cheat. This is especially a "Gremlins" knockoff, following the tradition of movies such as "Critters" and "Ghoulies". It is not a very good knockoff, including "Ghoulies", but with a lighter voice so if it is not close to darkness as the movie has found. In fact, this is very lighter and itself, and unfortunately many jokes end up flat fall. Although I have given 3 to score, this is because there is a movie that is worse than "Gremlin" knockoff. If you are looking for the Mystery Science Secret 3000 you know who I am talking about ... "Hobgoblins" with beauty. He has a little boy who gets a little critter somewhere under the ground (I have seen this film just once ago, so I don't remember everything in a clear way) and begins to be friendly enough. However, this creature becomes fast and friendly and actually produced and that's a movie. More than the refusal in the joke department, and also the blind seeing Korman play the role of the bad brothers. Better to fly this, but you can call it out with kicks.
