Someone had a great idea: let's have Misty Mundae himself, a R-rated version of Lara Croft - a two-shot rifle not only for skimpy dress, but also up. It was really a great idea. The problem is that people who were with it could not come up with any kind of script or budget support. Therefore, we find a "film" that fails to reach the middle height by voting in many places (often in slow motion), and seems to be completely beaten into the garage. Misty Mundae's appeal is still clear: he is pretty good and has a girl-second beauty. Yet his two coalition here, who lives with a long lesbian area, do not have close to his league. If "Mummy Raider" was presented as a Youtube video, I would like a high standard, but if the "film" used for DVD use cannot get more than 1/2 * * out of 4.
