This is at least the third remake of this movie so that if you look at it, it means a deja vu, don't be surprised. All that they did changed the story of the story and told the difference but the difference was not important. And it's not better because the plot is wrong to start. It never works. And as its predecessors, acting it is mediocre. The program has a final end that will surprise anyone who has never seen the film before but the end does not match the story. If this movie ended ten minutes earlier, it would have worked and been very satisfying and I would have thought it was more important. But here's a spoiler and that ultimately the crime pays for the criminals have not been treated. I didn't like this message caused by the movie.
