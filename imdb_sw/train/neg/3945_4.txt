My name is Humidity is a low-budget film describing the original story of humble Blaise. Not that the movie is awesome, not just what I was expecting or hope. While I have been aware of Blaise's character of the years, I do not know more of the comic pieces or the novels of the picture, so I get into this film as an external object. That may be part of my stress. I expected more action and more comedy. The film is dominated by conversations. I think I looked for something with a little value of camp. If so, my name is Upole is the worst movie of death. There are very few, at any time, when "light". Acting, at least from Alexandra Staden, is accepted but no better. As others said, he seems to be very weak to be fully trusted in the role of the head. What events in my name are Upole is one of the weakest symbols. I have never bought in the assumption that this woman could handle the band of trainers. I hope that Quentin Tarantino is going ahead and makes rumored a great film of the budget according to the gentle behavior of Blaise. I believe that the concept has a lot of potential and I would love to look at it.
