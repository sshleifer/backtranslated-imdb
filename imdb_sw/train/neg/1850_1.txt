Director Ron Atkins is faithful to fraud. This low-budget film writes a few days in the life of Harry Russo (John Giancaspro, who also wrote), the seed of the seed who gets a Rubberneck doll from his girlfriend. He starts taking orders from the doll to take a large amount of drugs, rape and kill, not always in the same order. What begins as a film-to-wall film, well stays the same, but it gets a lot of times very quickly. I'm getting more involved in the verification of verification. It's hard to forget just once though. Kinda like Tom Green has ever made a terrible film. <br /> <br /> My Bridge: F <br /> <br /> Candy Eye: Laurie Farwell gets fully nude; Jasmin Putnam shows the tits and forest <br /> <br /> The eye of an ANTI eye: seeing John dressed quite often
