If I must give a score of this film to a large extent, then I must give a score of less than 3/10. <br /> <br /> But it was entertainment, and there are good things to say about the movie. Psychologist James Bishop is given to the Holy Andrews Hospital for his wife, and has left with the intention of "changing the world" <br /> <br /> Since the beginning of the movie you know that the hospital it is really bad, but James thinks he can make a difference and doesn't know this evil. The story builds well, you know all the time that there is truth in what the patients are saying about some evil, and they are wondering when and how James will discover this. Also during the break comes, James is in a way protected by evil, and you feel the trouble even "fight" to be completed. Add a beautiful innocent girl who comes to the worst time with other horrible features, and you get a picture. <br /> <br /> Building of character is really beauty, it is explained to many people who are killed, some of them "don't know". </> <br /> The film puts an unpleasant scene, this is also done well. There are secrets that have been revealed - in an acceptable way. The main character, James is very trustworthy - a story about a student willing to start working is good in this environment. What is killing this movie is: * Of course the special effects - the modern version of "The 9th layout from the outer space" - bad (bad animal looks like a red scarecrow) * Some bad acting or perhaps very few take time to delete) - Main characters sometimes do wrong, and sometimes it's good. * Sounds are sometimes very cheap. I continued to think "I could make a film like this with my video camera at home" in all films.
