I am from Dallas / Fort Worth and lived in Arlington for a few years. This film was far from making it look like Arlington. I saw the mountains behind one place! Texas has no hills. I think that happens when a movie that should be in Texas is closed in Canada. Judgment is also very serious. They should have found administrators from Texas to play the part. There are many practitioners who want from Texas in Hollywood. The movie is really sad though, because it is a true story. I pray that the killer is found and convicted. One good thing is that the bc of his death, now we have Alert Alert to help find children who do not hurry immediately after being closed.
