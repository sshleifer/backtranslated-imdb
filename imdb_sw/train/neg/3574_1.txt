I can't finish this film. I decided after what I said was my choice for the worst attempts in the sex opinion award: the area that also Zadora, at the picnic, stands between two boys who wanted him. One (good boy) asks him to see his mistakes. The other (bad boy) asks if he would like a dog dog, which he takes care of. At the stairs level. I hope I don't have anything to say he returns, and takes a hot dog, with a smile. Just pathetic.
