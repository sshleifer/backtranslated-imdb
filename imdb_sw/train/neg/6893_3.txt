I had great hope for this movie. Monologue of the theater is beautiful and Nic Balthazar is a very interesting person, with a lot of knowledge and skills when it comes to movies. I am a fan of many Belgian films, but this film is bad. It is not possible for 34 practitioners who are actively working on young people. "Language games" were hideous and high. Nothing about this film seemed real to me. The latter was also the way of deus ex machina to me. I am very disappointed and I think I lost my hour and half of my life.
