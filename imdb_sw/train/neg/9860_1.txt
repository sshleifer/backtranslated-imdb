I often enjoy this film. It shoots the style of the document, but acting and text is just bad. Acting is tough and hard and writing is so clich√©, but not at all in a good way. As of this writing, I wonder it's on 5.2 / 10 on IMD. I am sure that many of these votes should come from the relatives of people in the film. I think if it is, you can manage some laughs, as it is common to see your relatives / friends making a movie. Well, somehow, I think this gives hope to all writers, managers, executives, etc., because if they can do that, you can do it. Although perhaps it should not be.
