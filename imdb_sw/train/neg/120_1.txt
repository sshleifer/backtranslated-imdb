When I saw the picture of this movie first, I saw an actor who was playing the role of Lucille Ball. Rachel York's commentary on Lucy is very serious. Lucille Ball was a wonderful partner with good talent. Thinking about stories like Lucille Ball shown how she was in the film is awesome. I can't believe from all actors around the world who can play Lucy better, producers decided to find Rachel York. He can be a good actor in other roles but playing the role of Lucille Ball is hard. It's hard to find someone who can resemble Lucille Ball, but at least find the same person in the show and talent. If you have seen a photo of York's Lucy at the I love Lucy as a chocolate factory or warvetavegamin, there is nothing similar in any way-express, voice, or movement. <br /> <br /> To the top, Danny Pino play Desi Arnaz is awesome. Pino is not suitable to play like Ricky. She is small and quick, her impulse, and once again, her acting impossible. Although Fred and Ethel were not right, they were not as bad as Lucy and Ricky's characters. Overall, the most frightening of stories and stories are told badly. If people want to understand the realities of the life of Lucille Ball, I suggest watching A & E Biography of Lucy and Desi, read a book from Lucille Ball himself, or PBS 'American Masters: Finding Lucy. If you want to see docudrama, "Before Laughter" will be the best choice. The release of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in "Pre-Laughter" is much better than this. Of course, one feature is displayed instead of something.
