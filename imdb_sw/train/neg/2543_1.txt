talking about your financial ruin. im just wondering why Michael could star in Turkey as a movie ..Michael is a great actor especially in a movie where he plays someone dies with cancer. if he pretends himself to his child to see immediately ascending .. Michael is a very talented actor .. why then did he do it? I looked at it and I thought it was dumb .. I think one time in their work they have a crappy film. Especially "The Fanya" I did not understand that it was one, and I felt its best performance was in the "Pacific Heights", its character got me out. and I enjoyed "Entry". . one was so Hilarious !!! and was just a retired for the role of "Batman". and I loved "Night Shift" and I love "Johnny Dangerously" too .. it's very bad some of them end up making movies lousy.
