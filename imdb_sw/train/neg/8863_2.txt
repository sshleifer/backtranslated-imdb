Crying II (1985) was full 180 from the first film. When the first film was camping and interesting. The second thing was full of cheesy. Production values ​​on this are very positive and acting are angry. Brother's waschirwoman waswolf from one place he wants to know what happened to his sis. "Location" from the first film was made again. An open-looking woman goes with bro '(Reb Brown) to the old country (Romania) to reveal the secret of her sister's death / change / death of her sister. Christopher Lee looks and loses now and then as a kind of sage / manual for two. Sybil Danning and its two great properties are seen as Stirba, waswolf chief of Romania. It also suffers from the bad face of the morning, ewww! <br /> <br /> bad movie. There is nothing good about this stinker. I am surprised Philippe Mora inspired this picture because she is often a good film manufacturer. The film is so dark that you need a flashlight to look at it (no, not the content but the films of the film itself). To move around the movie off you will get lousy performance "punk" from Damn wannabe "Babel". Maybe if you hit on several extra bucks they could get a real deal instead of copying. <br /> <br /> Better to avoid unless you want or lost the remote and you are too lazy to change the channel.
