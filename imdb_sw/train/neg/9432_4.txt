"Unhinged" is one of the most amazing small film, slasher forgotten from the golden age type. It is difficult to write a reasonable review of this film just because of the fact that the film is unique. It's a conspiracy - three young women when they are going to a rock concert to get a car accident and complete the beat on the home of an old woman's girl with her spinster girl. Very quickly, women are aware of something not right when they hear a wonderful breath and noise from the attic. In addition, the mother and daughter seem to have an extraordinary relationship, since they are fighting very hard at home in the evening. The old mother may even call her daughter adultery and slut and accuse her to tell the boys at night to sleep with them. Half of the film's way, when one girl finally decides to walk further to get help, murder begins. <br /> <br /> In addition to acting, this film is under the barrel. None of the three young girls can act, especially the girl's "leading". It is difficult to hear them delivering their lines in a single voice, a wooden voice in the film. Mother and daughter are best, but not so much. The film is also lighter in the place and in fact, it pulls. The murder is bad, but there is nothing that we have not seen before. However, as mentioned here, the film gets points for surprising and amazing. It comes entirely from the left field and has the same value of shock if you finish the classic camp "Sleepaway Camp." Unfortunately, the rest of the film brings and is faced with a serious and stimulating acting, provoking. The only visible, attractive and dark house, an attractive lighting gives the film a good film, but it quickly flies when one of the characters tries to act. It can be valuable if you can strengthen it to the end, but I tell you it's better off just for the last 10 minutes. 4 out of 10
