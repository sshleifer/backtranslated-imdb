Watching "Speak Easily" is painful for fans of Buster Keaton. Seeing this wonderful writer, actor, comic, director, and ignorant man being dealt with this shameful spectacle is like seeing Picasso used as a stopping fabric, or perhaps more like seeing a very beautiful Camembert made by whey and remed solids in Cheez-Whiz . Keaton is injured as Professor Post, whose greatest vocabulary is one thing that stops him from saying, "Tell me about rabbits, George." (Post would say something like, "Please give me information about the situation of small animals in the Leporidae family command Lagomorpha, a kind master, who I believe is mainly addressed to 'epithet' George '.") When Keaton created its characters, they can be a state meaningless but not foolish. They were quick lessons and became masters of their world. Not by the post, who never stops whispering and who is no longer controlling his fate than the gun of the gun with Titanic. And when the original Keaton characters had a beautiful and innocent naivet√©, Post comes as much as a feel of a sexual gender that if she had ever been physically resurrected, she would put an ice bag on the swelling and seek medical help. It is a short time, a time of redemption, such as Keaton's attempts to eliminate Thema Todd or vidish or his opinion of appropriate clothing for the Greek drum, but not just to bear the whole film to see it. If you are a fan of bad movies, alcoholism and look "Speak easily" with friends, the "Mystery of Science Sciences 3000". But moreover, stick to the silents. Let them be 100% of what Buster Keaton remembers for.
