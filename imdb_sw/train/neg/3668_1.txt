This film is very bad, you are about to feel dirty with it. Actually, there is a strong feeling of relief when it is over, the aid that you can now set the region in rewinder and RUSH behind the video rental store before corrupting your entire video collection. I screamed when we lost it that looked like a film that William Hurt could "call" in its performance. I meant that she could not be trying too much. But look and see, in a large number of events in this film, Bill Hurt is actually on PHONE! Our understanding of this feeling was the only pleasure we got from this unpleasant mess. The movie and editing are wrong and transferred, the story is chaotic, and the sound is not recommended to be heard. There is a slight resemblance to "Falling Down", but the film had a line of distraction with bold, beautiful text and acting, and a merging voice. The "dirty person" is just a kind of lost trap of the European tourist trap, and it looks like it is like driving on an unusual road that is unknown in an unknown country where it speaks a language with enough rain after a night fall when windshield continues to move around. You get a picture? Don't find this.
