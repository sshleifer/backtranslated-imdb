There are some good shots in this film, it catches some of the themes with a very good light, in fact the movie looks better. <br /> <br /> But basically the most made for TV film, and though it has a lot of deviation and turns into a plot, which continues to look quite attractive, no subtitles and development of the plot development is opened in Spanish, so not speakers speakers will be left a little lost. <br /> <I was like Xmas's gift, as it is the family's attitude to work through the actor's films we get talented, and Matthew Mconaughey was just amazing in "Time to Kill", and "The Newton Boys" so I announced I wanted to see more of his work. Even though it says on the DVD box it is Matthew Mconaughey's film and uses this as a marketing technique, it has a few lines and it is on the screen for not a minute at the end of the film, he is basically and totally unimportant The screen while being up, so die the fan of zeal, we associate not worth it from that view. The stars of the film though, Patrick McGaw is very good and very easy for the eye, and his character is very nice and kind and caring, a true boy of the boy, could be well written in ROM com . So with true Mcconaughey's loyalty which I have seen, I would recommend, "Time to kill", "Children of Newton" "Frailty", "How to lose a Guy in 10 Days", "Edtv" and "Amistad" and also avoid it " Greater than Life "and" Angels in Outfield "unless you feel like a children's film or have children around like these are not the sign of his talent, but it's very scary films for children, and MM is not more true to be an auxiliary artist and just a few as lines any. <br /> <br /> About Scorpion Springit's not a bad film but also not stealing either.
