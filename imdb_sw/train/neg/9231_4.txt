I got into this film I think it would be the second authors, but the left feeling had dropped. Humor was weak and the characters are flat. That's not to say it was all bad, the idea of ​​dating dating in a vegetable shop was considered a fertile resource, but the director led to focusing on cliche'd "safe shop-mother-and-pop from the evil company". I felt that he had already been stuck with a friend of friendship, he could come up with a more unpopular movie. Now, doing the right of the film, I am from the Rochester area and have loved the way Webster showed. In fact, Kevin Smith's best (of authors) honored him here was giving props to his city. Webster, NY is Checkout what Red Bank, NJ is for authors. The director wisely gave us a list of Nick Tahou. Believe me, even if things do Rochester, the desired dish is on the list. I was lucky to see this film in Little Rochester so that everyone knew when the city's visitors came and thanked them.
