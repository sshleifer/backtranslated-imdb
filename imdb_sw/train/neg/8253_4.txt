The movie had a cute opening, I really believed I was in one of the best romantic comedies I saw when ... there was something "foreign" on how the movie was founded, actually really abstract and mystical. But then the line of the story began to be more and untrue. Saying that the end is the CORNY and PREDICTABLE would almost be down ... The most common end of the romance where everything goes to every 'beautiful' character. The area in which the main character knows that he has committed an offense and dismisses his "woman's dream" only to acknowledge her love for him in front of a compassionate crowd. Come. In the end, 'good' boys', 'bad guys' lose ... You get pictures. WASTE of an interesting movie.
