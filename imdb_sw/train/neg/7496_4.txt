It is difficult to put the words that are the closest to me with this film. But I'm going to try: <br /> <br /> Any other word was banned, sex events were uncomfortable, drugs were widespread and play was unusual, if it wasn't angry with Americans-Americans. <br /> <br> I say that acting was bad, because Leguizamo, Sorvino, Brody, Espisito et. al, did well. But ... almost every character in the film I despised. Not since Bonfire's inappropriate I didn't like every character on the screen.
