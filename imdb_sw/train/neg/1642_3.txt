For months before the release of this film it was seen in all media, so I patiently waited for the release of the video to see what was related. After I ended I needed to apologize to my partner for owning a VCR for an hour and a half to watch this terrible movie. It depends on the failure because it is a well-designed movie and character about non-reliable characters. With the exception of the possibility of Amanda Peet (the only one who can be redeemed is that she is Amanda Peet) you can't stand any of them. The film depends on its conversation which is sophomoric, moronic, and abnormal. The only interesting character is Eric, who shows the only member of the group of dead friends. At the end of the end, planned to cut the three main characters, instead encourages the kind of hatred towards Peet. All in all, just hire if you're desperate or have a dark feeling of humor.
