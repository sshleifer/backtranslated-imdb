My partner & I found this movie to be very sandy. It started well, but it soon became extraordinary & ridiculous. Many of the actors were poor, except a little girl, Abbie, who was very real. In addition, talks were predictable and crippled - especially Gideon, an angel. Also, without giving anything, when one of the characters has trouble, he almost seems not a yeast. At first we thought it was 'shock', but we found that it was just a bad script. We love all Hallmark movies and their heart-stirring stories, but this film does not give you a chance to be one. There are so many - don't waste your time with this awesome movie.
