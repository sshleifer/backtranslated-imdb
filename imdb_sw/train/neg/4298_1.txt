It is very happy, far-set and finally interesting ("horse, oh, my God, horse!"). It's an exciting thing at times, but it has one of the worst texts written in a terrible movie. See how in the last 10 minutes everyone "magically" does what the plot requires "resolution" to happen. Bland exhibition and guide, usually balanced with Richard Lynch. The video transfer is a real job of the hack, forbid scenes in half and make the movie even more difficult to understand. 0 among 4 stars.
