I thought maybe an emerging film including Peter O'Toole, Susannah York, Michael Craig & Harry Andrews could be worth watching. Alas, I was wrong. Saying the arrogance of pride from beginning to end with O'Toole and York are very controversial. I looked at it twice and I still do not know what it was about. I feel O'Toole plays Laird's Scottish castle who has trouble drinking and likes to play childhood games with her sister (York). He also observes. But apart from that, I think your is as good as mine. <br /> <br /> The film does not have anything to redeem. I can only assume the cast and the director had been tortured in making this dreary, thoughtless, attractive. It is definitely a waste of time to give the talent to the director. It seems.
