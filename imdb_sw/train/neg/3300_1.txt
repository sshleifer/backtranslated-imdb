It is typical for Swedish films of this kind. Strange that acting was soooo bad, often these actors offer a good show. Searching was not done well, it enabled you to expect something (I will not tell you). Leadership behavior was bad ... I don't know where they find him. Otherwise, you stop off with this and go "Den Tredje VÃ¥gen" instead, this step of swedish is first.
