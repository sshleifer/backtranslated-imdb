Some journalists and their military forces are trying to tell the truth about the tragedy of the zombies, despite the 'media regime'. The film preparation does not understand that George Romero's zombie movie just worked because he put his politics under most of his films ("Dead World"). This satire is on a trick like a brick to the face or a shot on the head is more than this situation. Is it a strife or a trick to see a military boy marrying for death and destruction? What? Anything includes on various ads that are mentioned by the film? Don't. In addition, acting is a bad array, characters can not be seen, and a conspiracy plot. Add all this and you have the worst movie zombie since, "C.H.U.D. 2" has raised the head of the skin. <br /> <br /> My bridge: D
