The turgid speed of this movie gives us any trouble that can provide. There was no real doubt. Many of the characters were lazy. Irish chest priest was as crippled as love. The intention is misleading. The girl who chose to give film animation may be better. The central conflict of the main character did not open. This movie is not quite available. It's like an awesome exercise with someone who didn't want to go to the exercise that day but did it.
