Half Past Dead, star Steven Seagal in the main role was hit B-hit. Half Past Dead 2 is just one direct-video, movie action and no loss but without the ability to win something. It is less entertaining than the first: in all fields. But it's even better to look at. If you like movies or just a look at the popcorn session; if you also like to watch the old WWE stars on the screen or even if you like to watch sequels, even if they are directly or not. Kurupt did a good job, Bill Goldberg was below the average, I thought it didn't work. Kurupt is a good player, I say. Others worked, but there was nothing surprising, nothing was off. Technical details, well, production made by Sony cannot be good. Movie reviews were a tragedy but the general trend was accepted. Anything, just look if you want. If you look, you can't lose anything. But if you don't ... well, you can't lose either.
