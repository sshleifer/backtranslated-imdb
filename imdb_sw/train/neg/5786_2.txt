When you look at this now and hear all the language here, it is this amazing rated "PG," but that's a rating system of 1970 for you. Peter Falk announces the name of the Lord free six times for the first ten minutes alone in this film! However, few people think that anger is, and certainly not people who make movies or people who "do it". Send a message of how this film could be: Falk, Peter Boyle, Allen Garfield, Warren Oates, Gena Rowlands and Paul Sorvino are not actors who can't find "Music Sounds." <br /> <br /> I love heist movies, and many films and director William Friedkin, but this script does not give and has just a very limited way of "Sleazy '70s" feel, eyes and audibly. For those who liked Falk in the "Columbo" of the television we must come as a shock to hear him using abuse as he did in the film. This is far from the case alone.
