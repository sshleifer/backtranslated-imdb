I was paid to see this film on the playground. <br /> <br /> It would have a level 1, but the combat events between robots are the same, and there is a surprise. I know that some movies have a greater budget than others. I have no problem with that. Unfortunately, false science movies can be much more on a small budget for obvious reasons. But, one way this film fails is that almost every piece of each item seems to be cheesy and cheaper. I mean, couldn't they do it "look" well? Another main reason for this movie is awesome is acting If I watched the movie now and knew what to expect, I could just be happy because of cheese, but at the time, I expected a good film and I didn't know about how terrible it would end. <br /> <br /> Thanks, experience was more than 85 minutes.
