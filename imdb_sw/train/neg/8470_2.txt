I am looking at most of the films (or at least they are trying to be) and this should be bad if not the second worst movie I ever made myself try to stay. I did not quite know the depth of Masacism until I rent this piece of moldy cheese covered in the reproduction used in latex. I am a Jew of Julian Jews, but this is worse than I could trust him. On the other hand the story was pledged and I was surprised ... for the first and a half minutes when loans were made and I have never seen the pain that was seen as the first hand. Perhaps there are viewers out there who have enjoyed this and can point me in the right direction, but again I know of those viewers who understand if they don't remember, especially when we had to turn off the video, and that's not just a look at us (we had to make one discrepancy clear). If it had been on the remake, I'd like to give you a long opportunity if they had more than 1% original inserted into it. It's just that.
