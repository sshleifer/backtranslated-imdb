In general I don't care too much about violence in the film, or a large amount of philosophy, model or psychology. All this is very good and I and the film brings much of the above to us. There are more beautiful pictures of the lake and nature, the beautiful landscape of the characters, the best direction. This film can vote as a good film. However, it has been destroyed for two reasons and both reasons for making this film very disgusting. First of all there is violence against biodiversity to make this film. It's not the abuse of the film, I'm talking about the violence of REAL. This violence alone can be correct if it is not the same two reasons; The message of the film was not only to advertise on the directors against the relationship of women. Not all of us have no real change with women. (In men's flow). But the conclusion of the film is all damaged. Our "heroine" finally dies, (right here if I remember correctly I saw these years of films and is angry with me, now the boy is out with a new movie witch I certainly won't look) and now seems more obvious as a certain type of demonic nature, naturally growing on it, especially its sex. Of course it is the director who "kills" the heroine women. Women should die, especially if men are attracted to their sex. That seems to be the final conclusion. ** The end of the spoiler * <br /> <br /> Well, well that all that is possible will be good and I if the director could have his own opinion. But using the big picture, the recording of brutal cruelty to living beings, just say men may be afraid of women, and men are cruel to women. That's not enough. I knew when I got this film could reach critical critics for "philosophy, east and artistic" and any way. But this film is quite bad.
