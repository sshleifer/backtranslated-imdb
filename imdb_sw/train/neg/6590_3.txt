The review I read for this film was very respectable and I decided to explore. BAD IDEA! This is another movie about the soul out of revenge against group friends. The story is stupid, combining two parts Ringu with one place Prom Night, spraying I know what you did last Summer, adding a small dash to Single White Female - now mixed until completely nonsensical. There is nothing new in this program, and looking at the photos I grew up and loved was no entertainment at this time. This movie emerges and from a very long time, and I immediately realized all that I realized was still not very meaningful. The characters go from a human to the psychologist to the eyes of the eyes. Speaking to the perpetrators, they are all the favorite lovers - an arrogant lawyer of pride, a proud actor, a baseball star, a video of a voyeur, a bitter girl, a chick of tranquility, a very beautiful girl, a freakin camp. and I didn't care about any of them. Perhaps the best writer could work on the film, there were good events in it, but generally this film was a mess. I must also mention some of the 'video tape' which would IMPOSSIBLE shoot. <br /> <br /> This movie is not the worst fear of Asia which should give away, but it is still very serious. If you just want to see the creepy pictures in the dark, or just want to scream for some of the above acting, or just want to cry "you are stupid!" on the screen of the film, or just want to have another Asian fear flick on your sleeve when someone asks you how many you have said - this film is for you. Those looking for a good plot look elsewhere.
