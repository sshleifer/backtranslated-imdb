The only thing that put me to vomiting after seeing this film was the fact that these are just actors and not a freak show which usually appears on the TV show. This is also the main reason that fans of TV show do not like movies, but not the only reason. This movie has an entertaining value such as getting a source of roots. It is approaching the depth of the filmmaking film, and then it gets even more. I can't waste your time explaining this film in more detail; It is worth mentioning that I have compassion for the people of the poor cameras who had to be tortured by looking at c ** p for the first time.
