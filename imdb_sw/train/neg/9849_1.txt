This is one of the worst films I have ever seen! It's bad, even at the standard Movie Movie level. The plan is a romantic destruction, and the names known in this film are being featured in characters, uncertain. I don't know how the director could keep this film excuse together - it's bad. Filled as 'Psychological Psychiatric Thriller' - certainly it is scared. There is nothing interesting about it. And it can make you psychological damage! The secrets of the opening of the original were made that promise - to establish as much as the spirit is only a part of the brain, but the perfect shambles followed the location of the car accident is more than a belief. Regardless of how hard you try, you can't take care of little about the characters. There are many ideas that have been published that the film is best to connect words from Chinese philosophers, and when the movie would make you go to the Advice! I've bought more than 300 movies on DVD, and this is the first time I get my money. STEER CLEAR.
