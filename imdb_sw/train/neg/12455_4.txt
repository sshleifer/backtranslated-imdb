I remember watching this at a time when I was 7 years old. I was a great reader of the comic book at that time, and anything related to superheroes was very expected. The end result, however, had emerged. I was aware of the stories of "Emma Peel" Diana Prince, as soon as they finished and Diana was restored to its Amazonian form. However, there were very little steps that I was bored in many films. The last costume was an interesting idea, but it has been seen more like a cheerleader than a superhero. <br /> <br /> I saw the movie again in my old age. It didn't have much improvement. Cathy Lee Crosby was more aware, thanks to That is wonderful, but her acting was not the best. The script had a few good ideas, like Amazon's pride, and a noble man in Ricardo Montalban, but it did not come along and was still boring. <br /> <br /> I think they should build back the best stories, and create a show at the most epic peak. It was so much like a spy bland film, crossed with a superhero story written by someone who had never seen a comic book. Amazon's features were exciting, but they needed to be extended. The video has succeeded to force producers to return to the drawing board and come with something more reliable, like a small camp with a small budget. The budget was also very good here, and superheroes did not come cheap. <br /> <br /> It would be nice to have a movie available on DVD, if it is a historical and historical document. Even Superman 4 is available, and has nothing on this film (except Chris Reeve and Gene Hackman). It is important to see for curiosity and with little wind and attention to future versions.
