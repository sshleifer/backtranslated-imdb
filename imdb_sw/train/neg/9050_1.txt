I saw this film in full in the 1960s and 70s, that's bad, and could be the successor of the "Faces of Death" series in the 80s and 90s. To consider the condition of the so-called "driver education" these days, this it should be desirable to watch everyone preparing to learn to drive. When you see the death of violence in the violence and all its fear, surely (if you have any understanding) to get a truer perspective on the roles required to run safely, what is one instant of concern or not listening at the wheel can do. I worked for Bell in 70 and 80 years, and one time I was assigned to do a security class. I saw this film in the company library, showed during the session, the number of people got physical and had to leave the room! Amazingly, many of them later said "I never knew the car accident could be so bad!" This film, and the other, "ASPHALT RED", is actually the truth in its more explicit form. I can never forget, I would like to get a copy while my children were attending "ed driver" in high school!
