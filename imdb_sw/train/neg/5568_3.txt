Dolph Lundgren stars as a former striker / striker looking for a kinky area of ​​Boston to find out who killed his brother, who was well thought of in the community, yet on the way he learns how his brother enjoyed the kinky sex and that the serial killer is blame. Dolph Lundgren is very good in this film, in fact the basis of its performance here, someone will forget the rise of Lundgren for popularly active work responsibilities. He said the material gives Lundgren anything to work and, in fact, Lundgren has been completely dried up on the dreary which is predictable and incomprehensible. Co-Star Danielle Brett is also good, in fact the film works best when it surrounds the chemistry of Lundgren and Brett, in fact the film took time to explore their film film would be very good. However, the movie is insufficient, the action does not exist, the plot does not get enough search (BS boring very close to Lundgren's employer's employer) and the film is not worthy of course. Once again, Lundgren is a really good (if it is founder Danielle Brett) but the film only emerges from one sequence to the next, which makes this movie very sad. If anything else, it shows how Lundgren emerged, as an actor. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 Between 4 (Poor)
