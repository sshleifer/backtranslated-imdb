I liked this film. It was not because of sexual incidents, because it destroyed the image of Artemisia Abaschi. This movie is not really good about him and his art. It shows one piece of art that made (Judith Beheading Holofernese) but shows that he is entering as a witness in a rape case when he did not paint the first of his first Judith year after the attempt. I don't know if you have understood this from the film, maybe not, Tassi was not a good character. He struck Artemis. It was not love, it was rape. He did not claim to accept false accusations of rape to prevent him from suffering when he was persecuted. According to the alleged rape he continued to claim that he had no physical knowledge of Artemisia (aka had sex with him) when he says to the frequent "It is true". I encourage you all to go out and find out about real Artemisia and see what she is really about. Don't know all your skills on this false film. I encourage you to do some research, Artemisia actually has an interesting story behind it and the work of amazing art. Don't see movies, but know the true story of Artemisia.
