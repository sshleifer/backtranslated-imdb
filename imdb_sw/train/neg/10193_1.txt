With this film, Bunuel cheats the viewer with all the power of the film while explaining clearly in the film that his work is one 'enough'. Obviously, it isn't. For one reason, many cases 'hit with a good' position are set-ups (when the poor goat 'correctly' comes from the rock, you can see gun smoke on the right side of the screen!). For another, hiding one important information: Hurdes people were the way they were for a special reason which is just demonstrated in the film. That's goitre, a disease caused by lack of iodine (salt). This goitre is the reason for their cretinism and had just Bunuel took time to do his research (heck, as he watched 'cretinism' in the medical dictionary he could get 'goitre') he might have the end of telling the truth about these people , without doubt). Instead, with his film, he always judges, speaking about them as 'cretins', from time to time, playing the stage, setting up the creation of a concert, all of which is unacceptable to the document document that says to work for the purpose of all power. Bunuel speaks all the time in this film, not allowing one word for people giving birth. He speaks for them and, however, he judges them. This piece is bad for its roots, for its ideology and it is a real shame seems to be a good film.
