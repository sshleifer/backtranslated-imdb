This should be a good film ... Meryl Streep and Jack Nicholson have mixed as two newspaper authors. Mike Nichols pointing. Uh. It is a dull light! Unknown and predictable! Slow and uninstall! It is a cookie player who meets a girl, a girl gets a girl, a boy has a thing, a girl leaves a boy's story. Now this is the original concept! After strengthening for two hours (it was just two? It felt like six.) I didn't know whether it was comedy, romance, catastrophe or opera soap. It was done in 1986. I am sure we have all done sixteen things so that we can forget. I hope the damage to the reputation of Streep et al is beginning to heal and that the emulsion on the master is about to die. It's not a bad picture. That is not very good.
