If you are under 6 or 7 years old, then you will enjoy this movie. My little daughter joins the TV while watching. As an adult, I can't stand! I'm all on the sequels .... when they have a good story. But this does not exist anywhere near the level. Please forgive me by moving what follows the whole film of the child, but when you have to stay around every day when your children love so much, you will understand why. My daughter could watch this film on a single day only if we allowed it. I have given this movie 4 out of 10 only for the fact that it continues to be accepted by my little.
