IN USING IN THE WORK ... IN OFFICE IN THE WORK FOR THE WORKING WORK !! All in All Eyes can be inserted in one word .... Amateurish. This film tries to be different from many films and films of 'Blair Witch' .... it doesn't work .... it just ends up looking and hearing if someone has a cheap video camera, van and decided to make a film. The story does not contain details, the protagonist was not given a real push (and it looks like a girl wearing a powerful suit compared to five girls) and there is no verbal abuse ... just a voice of screaming and blowing. The whole film takes place in the van which means a decent environment is out of question. Five girls are doing better with what they have been given but generally they get like awesome artists ... although with the material provided it is difficult to judge if they can actually ... use the whole movie to scream, blow squealing and beat .... so much that half time it's hard to do what the camera said is so bad it's hard to tell who spoke. This video happens as a passionate video of violence but in fact it is only five girls in van shouting ... that actually calculates the whole movie ..... we then reach the end after what appears as 5 hours of right and regular hours. All five girls still live ... and one finger. Just a finger (get ... finger .... LOL) is for poor hard-working harders and perhaps lost their voices (and their pride) after making this bad film. Do not condemn this for the poster .... you will stop.
