This is a very bad movie about a scientist who builds a teleporter device and gets very hard when he uses an automotive machine. Simple work done before jumping with others. Not only can it be deleted, but it can also have people with the power to touch. What is silent about this film is that we are expected to believe where this person works against him. He would make millions for an institution that works, but the head of the institution tries to destroy its teleporter every step of the way. Finally the proposed person chooses three people without reason and then follows those who have offended him.
