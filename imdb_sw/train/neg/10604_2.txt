At this time the hero from the first film has become a man and this time he uses combos of fist and feet against all the world soldiers and the computer that has gone awry and is designed to take the world. I am sure it is the Second Team, which convinced everyone that Jean-Claude Van Damme was no longer reliable in providing a possible action. Yet it was this which destroyed his faithfulness forever. When the Universal Soldier: Return is not as slow as the Double or Quest Team, it is still very serious, without the style and the original flair and no star connecting. This end is only done for children who enjoy professional competition. As I look back, even a series of steps was exciting and so this movie is dud useless. In other words another striker in the meeting of Van Damme's meeting. Over / within * 4 (bad)
