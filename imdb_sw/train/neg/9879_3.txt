After watching the film, I was very surprised to see the highest rate on IMDb. <br /> <br /> 'Author Author Fox' is a mix of classic children's lovers, showing a soft story, slick protagonist Mr. Fox (or 'Foxy') trying one last person to steal from Boggins, Bunce and Bean . That's true, one short, one fat, lean, or going on. I don't know where to start my opposition. Well, m in my late teens and was not a fan of Roald Dahl, but I love her material well, I have read a few books like a child and I have seen Matilda and Charlie and Chocolate Factory regularly. This film, however, tries to the audience. What is the goal of children? Adults? I'm still sure! Many 'jokes' would give birth to a baby, especially if Mr. Fox visits a lawyer for example, or complains about being poor. Also, the audience (I think) children should feel sympathy and behaviors and kill chickens. I am for food chain, but you can see Mr. Fox under their neck! Surely that is too little? And also, plot ... well, it's kind of stirring. I just stayed with hope that it was better, but instead I was more angry with Mr Fox and his son Ash to make stupid decisions. <br /> <br /> Humor, meanwhile, falls flat. I only laughed once or twice, although I tried a joke quiz. I think its part is that the acting voice is so flat and untreated. Sound executives do not have a sense of time of comic, rather than the aim of deception of humor that works with certain mediums. George Clooney aims to show Mr. Fox as charming and thin, but his voice does not behave. Meryl Streep does not show any feelings, I did not even know that Bill Murray had a role until finally counted, and Ash, twelve years old in the fox years, looked like he was almost 30. <br /> <br /> stop motion, but the visual style really hit me a little bit. The characters are long, spindly and lack of any design of the design. They move to very little water and often the animation is jerky and amazing. There is also a difference between 'mixed' to feel, if the 2D elements are added regularly and unsuccessfully. The characters look directly on the camera and talk; it was very bad. There was one or two times when Kylie looked at the camera, she had no move and she had eyes with eyes. It really pulled me out. <br /> <br /> Good Mr. Fox had great potential. People still seem to love - see comments. Maybe it wasn't just me.
