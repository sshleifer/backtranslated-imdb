One is wondering why this picture has been made completely: such a plan is not possible if it is not stupid, the characters (who have had the experience of fighting the small sand, were very impressed), its end cannot be closed and it is impossible to understand (perhaps after several views but you should have The odds of that, the idea that you have read the book so that you fully understand what it is about) and acting is bad. It was a basic idea to show that the creators of the French film could do as much as Americans in the genre which includes "Seven" and "The stability of the sheep"? If so, it is a total failure. It was a success however (and has a form of worship-state as the first film of French murder) and, apparently, looks like a good export product. Wonderful.
