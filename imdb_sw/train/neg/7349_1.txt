Polyester was the first John Water Water film I saw, and I must say that it was also the "worst" movie I have seen so far. <br /> <br /> The "talent" water group included a few people who I'm sure worked for food, and I have been willing to say a line Waters wrote. Everything about the movie is awesome, acting, camera, edit, and story about a woman played with a 300 lb of transvestite Divine was absolutely amazing. It says, we must recommend this film because it is very funny, and you can't believe the hip that happens to poor Francine. His son suckles sores and hits women's feet unexpectedly at a food store. His daughter is too slut in the city. Her husband is a pitch of a pornographic picture player who does everything in his power to embarrass and humiliate the poor Francine. Francine's only friend plays with Edith Massey, perhaps the worst actors. Edith looks and looks like she reads a line on a cue card and has never seen a script before imaging the movie. With all of Francine's work, the water cooks the amazing side of Hollywood and everyone (the rest) lives in the future.
