This version can be found on your dollar store on DVD. Published is not great, neither is it sound, but if you have $ 1.00 and 90 or so a delivery minute, you will get the value of your money (which doesn't say bad votes). Anna Neagle is very steam like Nanette. Any of his wardrobe may be back then, not in this film. The majority of good actors are seen in this film (Helen Broderick, Zasu Pitts, Even Arden), but the devices fall very well with their talents. However, it is amazing to see how these successful artists write more text. Music numbers (there are actually only two) are very bad. To clear the label did not feel compelled to earn money in the original music "No, No, Nanette". Why it's important, the DVD can be $ 1.00. It is very important to say only you have seen.
