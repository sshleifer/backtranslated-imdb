This film is not funny - the disappearance of a great star, who seem to be caught so by their own courage that they forget. The only time to shine is John Cleese as a hotel manager who likes to wear - you almost fall out of your seat with laughter without help when he plays for Donna Summer's "Bad Girls" while wearing high heels, mink coat and dainty hat. Rest: KEEP IT!
