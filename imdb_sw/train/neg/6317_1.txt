I don't know what dimwit from San Francisco come up with this plot plot, but it seems they need to remove any drugs they take and put their analysts on dangerous risks - now. Yes, this is a good story, if you look at the sequence of the visitor in the "Life of Brian" as shown. <br /> <br /> This film is a little more than the left pipedream. With the US and USSR they left nuclear weapons, the result would be to remove the only real barrier that prevented them from participating in the war. Corruption as Korea, Vietnam and other war at the time, were the "war of the agent" they fought to keep them stronger from direct cooperation. This film makes me reflect on how true it was when a group of high school children will go hungry for nuclear spread. If someone could say "Mr. President, other children of Drastic High does not eat!" and Ronald Reagan would answer "My God! I would like to fix my defense policy!" Right. <br /> <br /> Like this film? Isn't it better if the Soviet Union had fallen because they could not support their building weapons ... waiting, that happened!
