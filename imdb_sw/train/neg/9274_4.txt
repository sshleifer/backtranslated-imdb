This end is the total rehash of the first film. Movie is completely useless. Basically it takes every sceanrio of the first film and leads it to Omen IV except the antichrist at this time. Even the end of the same way to the first! Music is very busy and intervenes, and because its excellent copy of Omen I, it is very predictable. It's not a bad movie, not very much, there are so many movies out there, this was not quite sure in the making. Omen remake since 2006 is even worse, even more than this, so I think it has that. If someone said your gun's head and you should choose to look at this issue or the resurrection of 2006, I think I would like to choose this.
