This is not a video, but just because it came in 1994 when they were probably tired of anything in the UK. It is 75% of the Boogeyman refund, and it would have been banned for the same reason - anything that was. I was worried when I thought that Annie (Kelly Galindo) might be different Lacey, but she was a problem with a psychic vision of boogeyman similar to one in the first film. Fans will see immediately that they are not one person. After seeing the killings in the bathroom, and also seeing the address also, Annie, her psychiatric doctor and a psychologist who is very similar to the boy in the cheap romance novels and butter, head home , and, sure, it's one bathroom. 24 hours later the murder occurs as he explained. Of course, we do not know who this powerful woman is or why she was killed. <br /> <br /> Then change the films of the Boogeyman story and additional images that we haven't seen in nature. In particular, this is shown differently from nature. Sadly, some good events were broken, but 90% of that is there. Why reset this film? Did they get the picture on the trash? What was the purpose? We do not know and, despite being an astronaut telling Annie he is healed, we all know bogeyman will never die.
