I think that young people involved in making "Necromancy" (aka "Witching" with a group of other names) should feel a bit strange to be on a set of horror movie and someone who: relaxed by John Houseman in the production of proletarian play ("The Cradle Will Rock "); they feared people in thinking that foreigners were invading ("World War"); and guided by watching the largest star of all time ("Citizen Kane"). And now Orson Welles had a star in the flick of the third level about the devil's worship. <br /> <br /> There is basically no creativity about this movie. Shortage of impurities, but back music confirms the truth. Even if the film could not be predictable, it was not worth seeing. The lowest Welles were dropped. Fortunately, over the last thirteen years of his life, he wrote the "Bugs Bunny Superstar" document (about Warner Bros 1940 cartoons) and hosted the document "The One Who Sees Tomorrow" (about Nostradamus). I recommend the two, but not this. Just avoid. <br /> <br /> Also stars Pamela Franklin and Michael Ontkean.
