The script of this TV soap is very bad even even A. Hopkins at some point had to play as a circus game student to bring life into his dead character script. I don't know if this is the purpose of the director, but Ciano's Hopkins did not reflect anything except vanity, fear and lack of self-esteem. Ciano really was all but then, why do you make a film about him? Mussolini was more interesting, and his way down was as close to reality. Edda Mussolini was clearly ignorant (not because of Sarandon, but because of the unsatisfactory script), when he had to be the main character of this family festival. Watch it only if you like opera's Venetian Soap.
