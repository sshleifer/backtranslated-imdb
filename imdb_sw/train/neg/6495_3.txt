I hit this movie on the features of what the trailer showed, and actually Sir Anthony Hopkins. <br /> <br /> If Jackson Pollack cooperated with David Lynch, and Timothy Leary to make the film, this will end the result. I don't think I've seen such a movie that has made the LSD trip seen as part of Sesame Street. It is a group of pieces of setting where characters come in and out of reality, or reality, and the film is not available until nothing is up to the last 5 minutes, where suddenly becomes meaningful. I wrote a bad review on my blog review review which basically gives everything away, and I can't do it here. It is a good part of the movie, and a voice written by Sir Anthony Hopkins, and let me say this, if there is one aspect of redemption on this film, it's music. Fully suited. Some discussions are good, and they are quite bad at the same time. I enjoyed the parts of this film, I did the truth, and as soon as you got to its end, you will actually realize what is going on. It is unfortunate that you should pass 2 hours of things to get to the key point, which eliminates the effect of the entire movie. I give 3 out of 10 for the simple fact that the real problem with this film is not working, it's everything.
