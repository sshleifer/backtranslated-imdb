One of the worst films ever. It's not funny, poor movies of cinema movies, acting badly. Sadly, many ancient actors are known to be able to walk, not only to act. Young girl Nancy Young can not act. Awesome direction. Facing bad TV movies. Often the weak jaw falls flat. Even the film's not suitable mind. Somehow they should leave the wedding to happen but there is no logic behind their actions. The decline is making my wife stop looking but I suffered in that way. Older men are supposed to do if they are young and horny, but it comes as a pathetic rather than funny. How did they get the money to do so?
