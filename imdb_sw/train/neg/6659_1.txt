At the first of the 3 seasons the Unfaithful Parents were as tasty as hard, sweet and sweet candy. Now it's as tasty as Pepto-Bismol. And unfortunately Pepto-Bismol is what you will need after watching the most recent periods, where all the sweetness has been changed by insults and violence cause no laugh. Cosmo, once one of Nick's most interesting characters, has come into an uninhabited cretin that has a Family Guy group not even knowing. Timmy has been a jerkwad of pride of which Bart Simpson could beat snot out of (and given a snottiness of Timmy, which could take a lot of vote). And the poor Wanda ... the real tenant who has been affected by her husband and generation, is now called "nag" to care for the welfare of others. Cosmo's creativity causes pain for each other but has never been punished for it, nor has he learned any lessons. That is a very good amount of Butch Hartman's view towards children: they are destinations, net and not very sharp. Thank God this toon of the string has been removed, with the partner of Butch Hartman, Danny Phantom. Gardens at least received what they deserve - unlike Cosmo.
