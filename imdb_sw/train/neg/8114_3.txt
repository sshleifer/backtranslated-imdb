... especially because Ju-on 2 considers himself a minimal value of FORTY of actual material taken directly from the first Saturday - and when you think that the player runs only for 76 minutes, the value of the film. Ho-hum. I found it very irritating - if the audience didn't remember the same things! - not to mention that bad, to have to look again again. Well, that aside from complaints, the Ju-on 2 line is that you have to describe many unanswered questions from the first movie, which in fact, more than 36 minutes, does not make it far too far to do any kind of original story of trust. There is, however, some of the most horrific events that show how the film can be good, it would have time to develop; and some questions raised by nature - some, but not all - stolen. In conclusion - if you liked the original original movie and want to see more progress on the story, go to it - but just remember to keep your remote control supported by your finger on the fast-forward button for forty minutes.
