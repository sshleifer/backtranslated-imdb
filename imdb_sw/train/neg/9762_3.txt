Alan Alda comprises the author of "Sports Illustrated" author George Plimpton, who was once invited to join the Detroit Lions football team as a member of honor. Instead of wan, an inappropriate game is very surprised by fantasy. Director Alex March takes an interesting news on this material, striking it with a style of text (with an optical definition of the eyes) and still giving a touch story of Capraesque whimsy; yet, to bring the flashlight of the movies in the up-up this, turns the main story to be jumble. Alda's smug, uncertainty performance is another disability, although support is filled with real life athletes (and very interesting Lauren Hutton as Alda's partner - how to fantasy?). * 1/2 from ****
