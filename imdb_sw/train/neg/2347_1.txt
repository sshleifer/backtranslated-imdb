First, I would say that I am a big fan of Ashley Judd; that's why I was eager to investigate this, his first role. There is no argument that his talent appears with his excellent performance. I think I can also see how professional critics liked the content of storytelling. However, I would like to think that movies are meant to please us and that's where this movie fails. For half a half, I found myself thinking, "How long should we look at the girl's shop, standing next to a privately owned store, reloading the item?" Then, I thought, maybe this is one of those movies where the director tries to look at the audience in an uncomfortable situation before defeating them with a powerful event. No such luck. The movie continues is a bland, boring, unventful story all the way to the end. I say this because I am an action-junkie. I love all kinds of movies, especially romantic comedies. But I hope to have fun. Add to the fact that movies and sound quality are similar to the bad movies of your neighbor's home. Stand up! I just didn't get the way a person likes this film. Value of zero-entertainment. 114 minutes beyond my life. <br /> <br />
