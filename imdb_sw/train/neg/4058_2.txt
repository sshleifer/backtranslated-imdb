From the beginning, you know how this film will end. It is completely filled with your ordinary member of the NRA even though this film. I give 2 out of 10, just because of William Benton's acting. I can't believe people voted 6+ for this film. It is so pleasing to a 'particular view' (once thief ...). People are not born wrong. And they were not born good. They are born with a pure slate. It is a community, parents and education that makes them. And if they take the wrong side, somewhere down the line, surely it will not be a US penalty system that makes them stuck! Otherwise, try this film as a blow. I bet that you have good things to do with your time than to lose on this piece. <br /> <br />
