I watch LOTS of bad films, LOTS !!!!!! It's a kind of hobby, really. Almost every Saturday nite a group of friends with me to watch garbage from around the world - ALL. Turkish movies super hero, vampire flicks from Brazil, Italy cinema transplant movies, Kevin Costner film, ALL (except maybe Helen add) but Ihave never saw film WORST than THEODORE REX. Never. And it's not so bad in the way of Ed Wood kinda - it's just SUCKS. Now this film was popular in Hollywood when it was made because Whoopi withdrew protection and made it clear to journalists and any other person who would have heard that he beat this CRAP = he tried to leave his contract, he shouted, however they poured his oil cloth into this skin of strong leather futuristic cop uniform which is ghastly see, yikes !!!! And you can only see him strong when taking - do everything but watch the camera for his agent so that he can cry for him. Dinosaur has three facial expressions and script's awesome third-grade class can work best like promised cookies.
