Wow. Just bad. I was a fan of the original movie, and I found it to part 2, 3 had to improve. 4,5 and the dead of Freddy were very bad. But there is nothing as bad as Freddy's Nightmares. Freddy works as Rod Serlingesq's series of anthology series. I can accept how Freddy was a punchline after another, but at least in the movie Freddy's film took a movie, but here they were so badly, they seemed like a high school production series of fear. Poor actors, if you really want to call yourself after making this show was obviously paid for. I am sure this was a stopping point for two types of actors. Children just start on the Hollywood level, a new brand of intention to take any part that might stop having to take a porn job that was released last week, or the frozen actors on their way down the Hollywood level intended to take any part that they had to take to work The same porn that was released last week. Half a half expected Dana Plato for a guest star, but he had already died at this time it was being produced. <br /> <br /> Defining the Nancy line in the original Elm St, "What you are trying to sleep this night."
