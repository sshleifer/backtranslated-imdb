About twenty minutes on this film, I was exhausted. Quite simply, these characters were slow. From time to time, something that enjoys it will happen, but things are back again. Fortunately, my patience was finally found, and the end of this film was not so bad. However, he did not have the right to justify staying through the first nine minutes. So, I would like to say that the film was common in general, and considering all the talents in cast, I would call this to be disappointed.
