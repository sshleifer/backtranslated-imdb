I have seen a beautiful movie of the young people of my time, this takes a cake. More comedy than fear, "Full Moon High" puts "c" in the cheese-fest. The quality of the stars in this film is not bad. The only way made is only to send down the descent. Adam Arkin plays Tony, a 50-year-old American football player who concludes not to aging because of a badwolf bite in Transylvania. The offensive part of the movie was a violin player. He drove everyone! Ed McMahon has his ultra-conservative father who met his ultimate shot. Adam Alan's dad who appears to be not on his game. After all these years Tony seems to be far away from the attack, and then he will have a chance to catch in his situation. More laughter than shed blood, this film is just beginning in the 80 years, "Teen Wolf" was an improvement from this! 1 star out of 5.
