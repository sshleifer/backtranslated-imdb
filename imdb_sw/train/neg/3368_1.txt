For filmmakers who have never heard the book (Shirley Jackson's "The Haunting of Hill House") and have never seen Robert Wise's 1963 production and Julie Harris, this remake will appear to be very bad. <br /> <br /> For those that we have, it is only apparent. Bad acting (Neeson was thinking about?), the goofy computer additions, and further with Jackson's story of this penalty. <Br /> <br /> Are you graceful and rented the original movie. It still causes efficiency without special effects of hokey. Acting is a professional and reliable. <br /> <br /> For readers of the book, from 1963 follows very closely.
