What was written on the poster is: "At birth he was given 6 years to live ... In 34 takes a trip to life." Ami is a native of America who has suffered from Muscle Dystrophy disease at the age of one. When he was 34, after the love of a 22-year-old who cared, he did not go well, he decided to come to America to a doctor who said he would be only 6 years old. He wanted to show the doctor that he is still alive, and weighs 39 pounds. Why? I think your is as good as mine, even I have seen this film. It is clear that it is the courage to live all the time he can move it to his left finger, but why has he got so angry with a doctor who discovered his disease 34 years ago? Her doctor told her mother that according to medical history, people with her illness would not live long. What? What does he show on the door of the old doctor? Why follow an old doctor here in America is a trip to his life? There are many things that we may have about the life of Ami: How can they make these drawings with one finger movement? What? How can he go through everyday life at all times according to others? How did he live his doctor's prediction? How does he react emotionally when other people look at him as looking at a strange creature? The movie told us no of it. Instead, the filmmaker found van and set up a journey to allow Ami to be shown at his old doctor's door to show him still alive. I thought it was joke.
