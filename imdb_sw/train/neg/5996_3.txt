Thunderbirds (2004) Director: Jonathan Frakes <br /> <br /> Star: Bill Paxton, Ben Kingsley, Brabe Corbet <br /> <br /> 5 ?? 4? 3? 2? 1! Thunderbirds is GO! <br /> <br /> And so start Thunderbirds, my favorite childhood mine. When I heard that they would make a movie of Thunderbirds, I was happy. I couldn't wait to see Thunderbird 2 wailing to save people, while Thunderbird 4 could dive into ?? get the idea. I couldn't just wait. Then came in August 2004, when the movie was released finally. Critics put it, but I wanted to go. After all, as long as the heart was in one place, that's all that was important to me. So, I sat in the playground, the only boy in a crowd of 50 people? Everyone else was more than thirty and less than ten. Are you most likely to experience the theater that I have ever had? <br /> <br /> Movie (which aims to be prequel) considers Alan Tracy (Brady Corbet), the least of Tracy's family. He uses his days as he wants to save people like his whole family, but he is very young. One day, finally gets a chance when the Hood (Ben Kingsley) traps his family on Thunderbird 5 (space station). This involves having a supporters of the hood and rescuing his family for a while before the hood can steal all the money from the British Bank. I don't believe, the plot looks like a regular part of Thunderbirds as you read it on paper. Once it gets the film? What a mess we have our hands. First of all, the film was set aside for children, as was the original show. However, Gerry Anderson treated us as adults, and gave us plots that were developed for children. This, on the other hand, slows down the plot as it tries to pretend to be a franchise charge for Spy Kids. The final product is a movie that tries to appeal to fans of the Children's Thunderbirds series and children, when they are completely lost. The joke of evil, picture sounds, and stupid antics that no one gets amusing is on this movie, and I am certain that Jonathan Frakes wishes he could lead this. <br /> <br /> Over everyone, everyone gave a strong performance, taking into account the script which all were given. Ben Kingsley was unique as The Hood, playing a very good part. My only complaint about the characters is about the people of Hood, who have been reduced to a few from the old Looney Tunes cartoons, trembling on, surprisingly enough, children take them easily. <br /> <br /> What's amazing about this movie is that when I was watching movies, I was surprised. But when the lights were over, I realized that the movie was so bad, I had $ 8, and the two hours of my time had left. Pleasure of guilt? Maybe. However, Thunderbirds are a mess to forget. Instead of "going" great, I will need to give you away from this movie. If all the movies would have been like the first ten minutes, it would have been an incredible film for Thunderbirds. However, we get a film that just dies-hard fans of Thunderbirds (if you would like to watch your childhood broken into pieces) or very tired you should be concerned. My rating of Thunderbirds is 1 Â½ star.
