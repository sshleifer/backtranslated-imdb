A strong and unknown “new” colon that sees a man-in-mac attending the wedding of his nephew, just to his bride disappeared on the wedding night. Columbo explores ... <br /> <br /> And that's up to it: without discrimination plot and surprising handled by a flat script, given that it is written by Robert Van Scoyk, who wrote a fun story Columbo "Killing Down Glass" in the heyday detective; not even the murder of speaking and the vast amount of skills given to Columbo and the script writer is a decrease in anxiety through photos taken at the wedding, which includes everyone who was present! Wanting all the qualities of Columbo possible, I thought I was looking at a section of Hill Street Blues. Hate for the history of the series, and with a safe-opera style acting style. Things to avoid too much.
