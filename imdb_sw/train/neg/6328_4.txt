Why does this film fall WELL under standards? Finally, the answer lies in a poor, humorless lesson. Travolta's small / moderate look (for looking at black color I must say, even with a big mullet) and both output have done very well as two young men wearing 'but they have decreased by a few of New York who want to open their nightclub. Other than that, all the film is just boring. It is enough that it is not worth knowing what is happening at the top of the film at any level. Kelly Preston definitely removes the sexual appeal and sex dancing with her husband that Travolta is one of the fun of a small film. Charles Martin Smith is very happy to look like KGB hardists "Bob Smith". Personally, I think movies would be better if the plot was slightly modified so that the settings would not change from NY to 'Indian boundaries, Nebraska' (located in the Soviet Union?) - you will understand if you see the film ... It seems, this film was made in 1986 to be ready The release of 1987. I think Paramount is standing on the release of the movie until January 1989 because of the unsuspecting plot. It was reported that they found it "impossible". However, this 6,000,000 dollar film earned 163,000 dollars of damages as it was released only in places like Texas and Colorado before directing to the video. This is a commitment to the overall quality of BAD's film.
