This was said about death and critics when honestly not great. Indeed, "CHAOS" and "EVERYONE" is the same movie, just with the difference in doubt. But I found "CHAOS" more enjoyable because it was kinda fast paced as a silly film "Swordfish." Because this film is more widely known for this reason it was released in the country and "Chaos" was broadcast around the world for films and foreign movies, but it has not yet found a distributor in the UK and the United States. lots of films for ordinary films like DOG DAY AFTERNOON and other films of Spike Lee, but that doesn't mean that it's a good film to watch. See if there is nothing else on the T.V, but maybe you'll be bored after a while.
