This is the worst dog visible. The novel and H. Rider Haggard is very entertaining and great. The useless filmmakers do not follow it closely. Good novels are not sacred and making free offerings are like me if someone has a personal opinion. If a person who can do it is to change things and choose them for unpleasant and watery clich√©s you should be connected to nature. If they did that this film would have been at least twice good even for the worst actors and if it was done inside the studio and beds made by cards. Build no thought at all just tired. This should be purchased or monitored only by Victoriano novel collectors made in the movie. <br /> <br /> Just a taste, and not a spoiler I think, do those who have read a novel to understand what was done and what you can expect if you decide to watch this on TV or - God can't - lose money to buy this. Gagool old witch of baddie in the book and another predecessor of Gollum has turned into a beautiful gal!
