but none of them. Probably the "great release of the release" which I have seen in my life. Certainly worse for this year. There is no point in commenting on the plot, cast or act. The problem is more than all that. It dwells in the folly of the kind of anger (not the kind of funny) of everything that happens on the screen. I don't know why I gave 2/10 instead of 1/10. Probably, because of Steven Martini. He tried the truth. Less down - 95 minutes washed toilet with several brain cells. Avoid at any cost.
