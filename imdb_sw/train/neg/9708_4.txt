The staff of the theater get an old film film, they decide to show it during the night of the dead night of the dead, thinking it is an old reel preview. Unfortunately, in fact it is an experimental control of the former Nazi intelligence which allows viewers to be a target of non-intelligent zombies. <br /> <br /> I can't understand hatred for this movie. It is a low-budget self-production and many camps, but not "1.1" here on IMD. It's very fun. It is clear that filmmakers have the knowledge and love of the old horror movies, and they have created entertainment tax for those who have been drawn by references and rituals in various forms. It feels like things like the Dead Day of the Dead (in many ways, very similar), Evil 2 and the Dark Army, and others. <br /> <br /> I loved the definition of how zombies, though really are hypnotized in thinking they are zombies, really have the physical features of the dead-wonderful, perhaps, but I am aware of the efforts by the authors to explain it. The annual effects were good for the budget, acting was good, and the story was entertaining. <br /> <br /> I liked it.
