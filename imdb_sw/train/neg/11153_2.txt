Another in a long line of flicks conducted by people who think that knowing how to make a camera is the same as telling a story. Within 15 minutes, the entire premise is installed in just a few lines, so there is no secret, which takes the whole part of the doubt. Only a half-player player is killed 10 minutes on the film, so we are left with stupid characters running around stupid things. Low budget films cannot afford special effects, so CGI parts are not interesting, but are at least a legitimate attempt. The suit of creation is awesome, as it appears when it falls on the road, and the director continues to emphasize the eyes, which is not even the red color shown on the mirror. These discussions are normal and not updated, and some lines remind visitors or Terminator. The sequence of the final stage takes place at the police station, also stopping from the Terminator, and everyone is hidden in one glass set that the Darkwolf is not recommended. At the end, the girl calls the hero "Good guardian", but gets all her allies, the original Protector, and at least three other citizens, not mentioning several soldiers, all were killed without getting a good shot, despite weapons of ammunition and small gun. But here is the truth of the evil: They could kill the animal after the start of credit when he was playing the player when he hit his red eyes. Instead, they caught him?
