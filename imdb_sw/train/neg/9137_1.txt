What can I say, this is a piece of brilliant films that should win Oscar. The text should be stored securely in safe storage. It should be looked at for all secondary school students around the world. Sam Mraovich is a professional, perhaps a good author / director / producer / pastor / trainer / child of walmart ever ever to give the world of movies and his art. Where do I start with this? Each millisecond of Ben and Arthur was completely breathing! And Mraovich as Arthur, wow, he is interesting I'm surprised he didn't go to Mr. Universe. I couldn't join me during the nude area. I lent my brother this movie and called me on the phone saying how Arthur's area had made them homosexuals. I really help them, because of this film and it is a very good study in endurance. Why just yesterday I made a church and wrote "to Sam and Arthur" in its breathing ashes. <br /> <br /> The movie is the best thing about this film. When the Fed-Ex plane took it in the middle of the Vermont palm, I cried! Why, I never knew that they had palms in Vermont or that people could travel on Fed-Ex flights before this film. It opened my eyes to a new place of possibilities. This film encourages the registration of Sam Mraovich, Acting, Leading, Creating, Preparing, Producing, Production and Real Estate Production. I just want to say, "Thank you, Mr. Mraovich. Thank you for bringing this creation into the world. We can't pay you again."
