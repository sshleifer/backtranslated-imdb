Good casting cannot strengthen this common story of a murdered secretary by her boyfriend. In fact there are more questions than answers in this one story of romance and murder; and just because it is given to the prosecution, no these questions will answer. This is the kind of fee that asks "Mothers, Hater" of America. As shown, it is the story of a innocent woman who just happens to be "taken" in a partner with a married lawyer, with a good reputation. Is it possible that if he had no time for his boyfriend and had a relationship with a married woman, any murderous event, that had been avoided? When you look at this, don't worry about going to the fridge, you can't miss anything.
