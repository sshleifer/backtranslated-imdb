but Thomas Ian Griffith doesn't just polish that great man working, he was given this 5+ years ago. Some lines of humor can be closed when doing so is not just a step, but comedy. And you can get KC from Katia Koslovska however? The character of Plummer was corny, he would be better at the toon of Bullwinkle. Of course, if the action of the flicks will show skin - I'd like to see the same time between the female / male, otherwise do not show any.
