Something that really gets me about this movie (ie, something about this movie makes me physically) is that someone really paid to get paid. There is absolutely no purpose for this film. Not afraid, not considered, not suitable for entertainment, not good. It is a sleeping pill made by cyanide. The DVD trial compares with Blair Witch, Bad Dead, and other decent movies, and wanting to despair of the movie film. Not like any other film made; it's far, worse. Claims of "amazing surprises you will never forget" is equal to one ton of horse droppings. Please don't waste your time looking at this piece of rubbish, because it can make you dirty. The person who wrote this film should be deleted by authors of the Creation, and never allowed the film again. Because if he thought this was a valuable film to do, maybe they have nothing to offer in the future. Star zero. May Grod be merciful soul of any unfortunate person to see this. I'm going to vomit now.
