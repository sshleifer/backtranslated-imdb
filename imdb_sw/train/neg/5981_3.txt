I have seen this film (especially because Brady Corbet is located), and I must say that I am not happy. Of course, computer graphics were amazing, but the story line you need to touch a little. Also, I think this film would have made it better and more curses and blood, including the PG-13 tested. It will certainly attract many people to see -> young people. What is also more attractive to young people (especially teenage girls), will be very close to Brady Corbet on the Thunderbirds poster! Though the film had low points, I saw it yet and I think it's okay!
