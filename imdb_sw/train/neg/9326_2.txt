I and a group of friends are making horrible videos to laugh at, hope I have led to terrible money but also laughing. S.I.C.K. is one of the most awesome movie that we have rented. The plan has been completed, they all take your friends into the forests and never return to something so old. The goriest part of the movie looks like you are visiting a local village shop except a little dirty and bleeding powder. And if anyone has ever been afraid of this movie whenever they should be connected to Cartoon Network for all their lives, it's pathetic. The good news of the cinema is that two girls in it are hot fires, one is better and the other is seen naked during the movie. Another good feature is that this film is bad when you laugh until you cry. I do not like to look at the scary act or rent these awesome videos, not available but I see the amount of these efforts people put into it and still come from very badly and are expensive to hire. Cutting on someone's deficit I would like to recommend. <br /> <br /> If your rental / offer you laugh I will give 8.5.
