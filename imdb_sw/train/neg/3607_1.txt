I am starting this review with a great spoiler about this film. Do not read more ... here comes, show your eyes! The main heroine, a girl who always lives in other slasher films, is killed here. There, I saved you only 79 minutes of your life. <br /> <br /> This is one of the cheapest movies that have been stuck together in the '80's' era of slasher. With killing the heroine away, this is just junk down. <br /> <br /> All priests and college students get a bad rap here. They are typical as linked, social people have many internal problems to deal with what appears to be a college campus life ... and college students come out more. <br /> <br /> "Splatter University" is just a gunk set in your VCR when there is nothing better to do, although I recommend watching your head cleaner tape, which will be more entertaining. <br /> <br /> This was rated (R) with physical strength, gore, dirt, female feminine, and sexual memories. <br /> <br />
