This is the worst movies I have seen, and I have seen quite a few movies. It is considered as an art film, but it's a piece of garbage. It is one kind of redemption is playing a good cucumber, but that can't create a Sally Potter tax of a self-feeling. The program of this movie does not exist, and I make sure you start laughing and end. Especially where he begins to sing. It is completely true.
