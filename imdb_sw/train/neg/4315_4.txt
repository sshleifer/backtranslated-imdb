The only good thing about this year's celebration is the players. Even though the ceremony itself was very good it was still boring. I think it's a lot of time to look at the new director and producers of show, who can come up with something quite real. It is very obvious that they tried to make a more 'hip' show and attracted to a limited audience this year by allowing Beyonce to do and allow P. Diddy and Prince to present a group. Also allowing Chris Rock to be a referee was attempting to reconstruct the ceremony and make it more attractive. Nothing worked. <br /> <br /> Of course, Chris Rock is a good boy but he was not a good representative. I have only seen him as a boy who has spoken every time and between different groups. His presence was not as 'big' as for Billy's Crystal. <br /> <br /> Also give out the award was pretty dumb time. It is not to allow everyone to come to action but also to give some prize in the center of the reminder was very clear. However, I can't remember having more satisfaction with the winners of the prize. None of the movies awarded prizes as a few years ago was the case. What? That means that it was a good year for movies and many competitors of the competition? I don't think so. I think many movies have been saved for 20 years since now, except "Millions of Children" and "The Passion of Christ" perhaps. I certainly do not agree with one award that was awarded this year, for example Caleb Deschanel should win the best movies, not that I don't like Robert Richardson's work, he did a wonderful job for many of Oliver Stone's work but I feel that Deschanel deserved the most rewarding way. Also I'd like to see Jim Miller and Paul Rubell win for the best editing by John Debney for the best music. But oh well, no Academy Awards can please everyone of course, I understand it. There will always be people complaining about the winners. It was also amazing to see that many award winners were more concerned than the elect and winners. Did the Prince tell any of the names of his name immediately? And was the feeling of Sean Penn of humor? Al Pacino and Jeremy "I hope they missed" Irons were the best speakers of the night. <br /> <br /> Total show to forget too much but for good winners. <br /> <br /> 4/10
