The movie and acting is not bad and Jay Hernandez does a good job playing Calito Brigante but the movie lacks it is assumed to be prequel for the hit movie. The creators of this prequel did not look at the original way of Carlito or at least they didn't care about continuing. This movie is a prequel which means the original movie has set up our history for us and this movie should end up where the original begins or at least leads on it. None of the close friends of Carlito from nature seen in this film, are not even known. Luis Guzman, Pachanga in nature, is in movies but has a completely different character. Beginning took place in 1975 and prequel takes place in 1969-70. Considering this movie takes place less than 5 years earlier, do you not think one of the long-term friends of Carlito could appear? In the beginning, Carlito started out in jail after spending 5 years in prison. That's just a few months between the end of prequel and the original start! *** Semi Spoiler *** We know from the beginning of the original, Carlito has spent 5 years in prison so when prequel gives us this fun of Hollywood ending up with insults to the original fans. What happens Gail? It is a lack of continuity that made this film go straight to the release of video.
