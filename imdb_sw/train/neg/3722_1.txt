I remember forced (yes - literally FORCED) to see this film with a Southern Baptist preacher when I was a child, and yet I liked his awfulness. Prepared to scare the poor suck to be "saved." The only thing that "saved me" was the fact that it finally ended and I could go and have a REAL lifestyle. See the picture on this film in Sarah Diamond's book "Christian Politics." FASCINATING. And it's really interesting than the movie!
