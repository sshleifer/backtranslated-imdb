The plan was seen as promised. Be honest I did not watch the entire film. After an hour on the movie I needed to make a decision. What? This movie should look up until it concludes? The answer was clear NO! It was not the fact that the human body could not receive the rise of different species without refusing. Nor is the premise that he was chased by the secret secret authorities for the man / wolf plant. It was because the movie was written badly, it had no sense and I did not understand several sequences of dreams and wolves and buffalo. As he ran to the zoo with a dog pack and left them in front of the zoo gate saying "If you can't run and the big dog will not leave the venue" you continued to run through my tired mind. Close yourself while skipping this film. I can prove if you are looking forward to staying in a slack jawed if I was wondering why anyone loses money, time, energy and efforts to make this hateful anger on American movies.
