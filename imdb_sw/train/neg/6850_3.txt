As a girl, Hinako moved away from her small village to Tokyo, leaving her two best friends, Fumiya and Science. She comes back as a young woman, she was surprised to see that she died when she was a young man. He is reunited with Fumiya and they are afraid to know that Sayori is amazing that he is resurrected on the island of Shikoku. Oh boy. I lost this because I love the fear of Asia and I think Chiaki Kuriyama a good actress. Unfortunately, if I needed to explain Shikoku in one word, it would be "fruity." This film is silly, boring, wrong movies, without thinking, and beyond, unscary. Kuriyama has short-term screens like a revised planet, and its character is given little to work with.
