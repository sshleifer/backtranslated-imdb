Where to start ... If this movie was a dark comedy, I would say it was FANNN-TASTIC! Unfortunately for me, and anyone else having free time and buck's spare (the intention that I paid for, I got from Wal-Mart), this film meant to be exciting. The only THRILL I was looking at Kirkland's shadow of Anne Wilkes from the forest area of ​​Misery without snow. If you want to laugh good, on Friday night with other friends, then I recommend this film very much. But if you want to look at something at least half of respect, then don't bother. <br /> <br /> I for one enjoy the crappy film, the worst in most cases. But Wow ... I mean WOW !! The only person in the entire film that did not stretch was a little boy, played by Vincent Berry. The only reason I give 3 stars is because it gave me something to do.
