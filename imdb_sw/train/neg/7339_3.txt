Maya is a woman without any interest. He just loves his life and wonders, why he does not feel fulfilled. This can be an interesting topic. That will require a good story, a good environment and a good discussion. It doesn't have any of these. This movie is completely boring. There are only lengths and no climaxes.To remove only is Shahrukh Khan. But though I am a big fan of his, I couldn't stand this film. Even can't make this movie go away. The movie is not as bad as "Emperor King" and if you're a fan house fan or if it is slow, you can perhaps like it. It's not funny, not interesting, not infected. My suggestions: Don't look at it.
