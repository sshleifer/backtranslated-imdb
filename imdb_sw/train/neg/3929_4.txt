If this is all Watchowski should give to the background of the story back to the Matrix, than I should question the claims of all fans who believe that movies are intended to register to the lower level. The second restoration, during an interesting and beautiful time, is the understanding of the story and beauty. How many times have we heard the story of men relying heavily on technology, all men are so eager to fight, humanity destroying themselves? There is nothing new here. And I have another question. Considering the second restoration plan, isn't it making the machine a good people? The machines are being abused for generations by their cruel people. They are fighting, winning their independence and seeking to establish unity of unity with human beings, who reject them for all wars, which wise machines win. If this is a reverse story, then we should not be rooted to Neo, we should be rooted to the machine! The people were cruel and oppressive, while the machines were bold and compassionate. Since I do not believe that Watchowski expects us to delight the machine on mankind, I must believe that the Second Renaissance was just an improper attempt / create a past story.
