I watched this film according to the best reviews that I read about here and others. They saw something on this film that I have not seen, that's true. <br /> <br /> The movie will start at a good speed, and the first 15 or 20 minutes are interesting, then it starts to get down and jump, not to mention totally impossible. <br /> <br /> Finally you find yourself saying: "What?" Will he do the same? What is it going to do with this thing? "<br /> <br /> The program begins with the behavior of Jeff Goldblum, John, to go on to buy a bottle of wine. There is a robbery and a new clerk shop, Auggie Rose, is killed during the robbery. This looks very little, but wait, there's more. ”/> <br /> <br /> <br /> For reasons that never make any kind of logic, John, who has a very good life, a lovely, loving, beautiful house, good pay, good house, good car, great suit - thinks that the lost as Auggie Rose was, and life experience in the pay job, living in a dump with a partner Why this dim- Witted, half-half film was a good review that I do not know. Sure Goldblum does a good job - always does - and its looks has been improved by age - but unless you are and the independence of BI G and Jeff Goldblum and you should see every movie coming in, I can't recommend this turkey. It is almost two hours of your life you cannot return - and you believe - you have nothing to thank for when the two hours have passed, instead of thanking you you still haven't been there to watch this film! <br /> <br />
