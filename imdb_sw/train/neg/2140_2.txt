Assassin Hauser Assistant (John Cusak) is accusing the Mid-East minister of oil, whose name appears to be Omar Sharif (Neikov), in Turaqistan which is driven by US interests. Hauser puts it as a business producer to allow him to go to Omar. <br /> <br /> Sometimes satire may be overdone becomes more annoying. Here it makes a lot of: government, politics, music, war, people who are not usually accepted by the community, and I mentioned "war." And, that's what we have here - a desperate movie that has limits on a very bad dream that brings life. I still ask myself why I went on to the DVD. Also, there are many Cusak families in this which John Cusak looks embarrassed with the family just being there, or is that just me? <br /> It was that the movie of John Cusak, when little offbeat, was, last, rather good. Not here. Believe that John Cusak had a hand in writing and producing this mess. Do what you want. There is so much going on a fire-directed film, bombs, and shouting that you can't think of it or was it? Probably. It takes too long to set up a hit, which has largely forgotten up to the last 15 minutes. At the same time we have an unreasonable banter among all in cast. And, chemistry between John Cusak and Marisa Tormei? I don't think so, but you know: boy? something of a girl ???? and they needed something to take more time. Yes, why they were supposed to, (be guilty and angry) the Duff exhibition, and Kingsley were good. But, when I saw the character of Dan Aykroyd, at the beginning of the show, I sat on the toilet to take a dump, I knew all parts of the show would go to the tank too. I was not wrong. I am sure some will sing the praises of this effort, but if the rose is still rose by any other name, too, it's a ?????????? <br /> <br /> I now Remember why I went on to the DVD. I was hoping that the story would have to some degree of level and save itself. It has never been. <br /> <br /> Violence: Yes. Sex: No Hate: No. Language: Yes.
