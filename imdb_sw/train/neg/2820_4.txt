I don't know a lot about Tobe Hooper, or why it gets its name in the head, but maybe it shouldn't have trouble. If another advertiser is mentioned, there is not enough fear or reception to bring fans of any kind. The program is not connected, the Sade system is free, and most of the acting are so-so. Englund was doing a good job with the weak material, and Zoe Trilling has less low, but it's not enough to carry this film. This is the tape. Bridge: F
