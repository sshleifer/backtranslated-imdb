A note to George Litman, and others: The Secret of Science's Secret 3000 riff is "I don't think so, * breeder *". <br /> <br /> My favorite riff is "Why do you look at it as"? ", easily with complete deficit. that, and "certainly did not!" above all, I would say we should give credit to MST3K employees to try to mock this television movie. you really can't make fun of the conversation; Bill S was a good sports player. On the other hand, this production is too bad even to refuse. A small secondary school drama club can do well. <br /> <br /> I would like to buy a book and read 'Hamlet'.
