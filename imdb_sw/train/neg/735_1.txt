Five-year-old Michael sees his mother being taken by the death of his father, "The Highwayman," who later commits suicide. "20 years later" Mike (Gordon Currie, 4 years old from PUPPET MASTER 4 and 5) invites seven friends at home with his grandfather with "their own fears" at Halloween night. Morty, a big wooden doll that lived in the bed of the evening with the hand of India, becomes the spirit of a dead father and killed by using their phobias. The characters are thrown out of the window, swallowed into the toilet, eaten by the mouse, beaten, etc.. Morfy death into the father and tree, around and makes stupid desires. After looking for a girl and getting into a cardboard box, the characters stay at home, doing fun, joking and having sex. The death plan is good and Betsy Palmer (Mrs. Voorhees from the previous Friday 13TH) is astounding as a grandmother, but this is more important and more complicated than original and full of false crimes. , bad actors, dead-characters, repeating images to return and return to the work of a defective camera. With two few characters (Indian and half-black girl) are the first to die. BLAH!
