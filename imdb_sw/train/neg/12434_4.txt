In 1987, John Hughes wrote and directed 'Birds, Trains and Cars', which was a hilarious comedy and poignant ?? the best thing he did. Ten years on him reduced the recycling 'Home alone' in this second sequel, which is not connected to other films but also is uninspired and sadistic. Four more? That's true, four! And one of them is a girl! Congratulations, Hughes, by introducing this revolutionary series! ?? is chosen by metal seats, connected to orange and covered with colors, ha ha haaaaaaaa ha, when the little child is younger than Culkin. You think that the departure of all important players from the first two films stop Hughes from fossilising old routines, but just surprise is that even even turned to 'Home Alone 4.
