The original film directed by D.W. Griffith; has a happy King (Arthur V. Johnson) and his Queen (Marion Leonard) - but, be patient! When the king comes out of that place, his Queen makes music with the king (Henry B. Walthall). When the King loves his lovers, he decides to pledge the Edge of Edgar Allen. It is difficult to believe lovers cannot hear those who are planning against them; although actors are trying to look at the noise (lovers) and calm (concrete mixers). The set makes the "Covered Room" looks very much. The exhibition is the same, and the story is easy to follow. Search Room (9/2/09) D.W. Griffith ~ Arthur V. Johnson, Henry B. Walthall, Marion Leonard
