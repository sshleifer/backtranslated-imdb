With my knowledge, the sand of the Largo was a prominent Belgian delegate (he did not read) telling the adventures of playboy, a kind of James Bond without a spy life! So, when I chose a movie for a 5-year-old child, I took it because the child was already a big fan of James Bond! But, after the brilliant opening, I got a lot of doubts: when American movies are beginning to start an amazing start, here, there is no point to the sex zone ?? Then, the story is very difficult and financial measures? I thought I lost a child. But, surprisingly, she had suffered from Largo, and more than James Bond! <br /> <br /> What is the best translation of Tomer Sisley? The tough relationship Largo has with his father? Many boxes of friends who are bad people are bad friends? Honk-Kong's foreign locations, Yougoslavia? Dunno, but he cares so much about Largo ("Will he wake up?") And we enjoyed our time.
