I must tell you right ahead, I am certainly not an authority on sound movies and I just found a few. However, if you have never seen one, do not start with this! I am very pleased with those I have seen even to this, but I can only stand this. I must also tell you before that I could not finish this film - it was a disappointment. Why was it so angry? There is a character called 'Rambha' in the film. He says more than Jar-Jar Binks - which I never believed would be possible. He is # @ ^! # Annoying !! He spoke with a falsetto voice and I think it meant to be a comic aid. Instead, he just dropped on my nerves and asked him to die ... slowly! His voice, his character and his ignorance - was not found to be confined and dominated everywhere he had - and needed to die! <br /> <br /> 2. The heroes had an amazing ability to shoot the AK-47 shoot easily. I am not a child - there was a place where a number of unarmed young men took a small army of boys with these weapons of attack! And, from time to time, they avoided taking one shot and clapping! This has led to Stallone's action in "Rambo II" to watch! The film was too high, in your face and intense - it made my brain bleed! It was like the film was made by people under the influence of meth !! Crazy camera pieces, music without action, action, action ... this film is open for someone who can't take a film and plot and wants almost 100% <br /> <br /> action. The main and practical and incentives mean zero ... nothing! Maybe if you are the most severe action and the fan of the sound you can stand for this film, but I can see why it is on the list of less than 100 IMDb's. Wow ... this film is bad and very bad!
