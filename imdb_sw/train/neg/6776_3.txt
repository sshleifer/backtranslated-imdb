I wanted to love this film. How could I love it? Cary Grant, Jayne Mansfield, Stanley Donen; All icons in their own way. However, the fall of the train that Suzy Parker had destroyed all my experience. His acting was so astonishing that I sat there and my jaw is dependent, and I do not believe my eyes or ears. I could do it through one look, that's how to hide he's here. Cary? Best and very good form. Jayne? It is interesting, interesting, and seems to have a ball. Supportive support works well, and the city of San Francisco is being taken into all its wonderful beauty, retro <br /> <br /> Then you see Suzy Parker trying to say his lines with wood, damage, weakness that just fails to believe. Who told this creature can ACT? Oy VEY, people.
