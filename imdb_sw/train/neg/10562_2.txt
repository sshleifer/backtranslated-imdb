This low-budget video comedy of success succeeds only in the low budget. The discussion is very difficult, following events are similar to boring, and most of the screens appear to be reserved for a series of attack and explosion in the parking lot during the last minute of the film (the last minute of the handkerchief) at the beginning of the area is certainly destroyed and destroy the spoils of the film - no urine here without purpose). The entire film reminds those who regularly came from the Rodger Corman studio when giving them a few bucks and cameras for the first time - but without Corman's discipline it would impose.
