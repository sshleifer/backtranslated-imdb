Everything about this film was awesome. Starting with this film was smoothly and I found it impossible to undergo a great tragedy for the gangster film ever. The voice of the voice was like one of the very wrong desires of the stick. It had this music through the entire film and began to get quite irritating. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT INFLICT WITH THIS DISASTER YOU WILL BE HURT
