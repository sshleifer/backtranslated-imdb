Any movie that has nude's Karen Allen events and I'm still bored I walk out, that's stinker! Karen is in Paris, becoming a friend of a beautiful French woman who has recently been sexually active. In fact she is married, ("But, cheri, why should that be a problem?") Can it be an interesting affinity of cultures (you believe or not.) Only. I went out. Maybe the movie got better after leaving; but it would have found a better LOT to start a rotten start. My advice, if you find yourself in this, run, don't walk, for leave. Save your time and energy. Certainly you spend your money. It's a disgraceful production company did not save its money.
