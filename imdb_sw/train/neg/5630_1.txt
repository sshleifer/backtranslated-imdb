The only reason I watched the movie to the end was "hope" to see something interesting. The movie is very bad and the girl's performance is really, very bad, honestly, I don't criticize the movie or expert but you just need a common sense to realize that this work is very bad. The first thing that came to my mind as soon as he started talking is: "He has a relationship with Willem Dafoe and agreed to help him with screens and appear in his film since he is a good director". .. surprise, surprise, the next day after watching the film I got on the web that Giada Colagrande is his wife. Bad stories and bad performance.
