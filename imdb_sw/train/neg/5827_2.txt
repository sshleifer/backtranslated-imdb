Do not get the opinion of other critics that this film is a reflection of the Japanese industry's whaling industry (which, morally, is not worse than the American meat industry or Scottish haggis pimples), it says it is a pride of pride, kind The top-its-own-back guff that gets modern art bad name. That said, there are amazing pictures, but there are amazing pictures on the bus's bus if you are using your thoughts, so that's not the reason to go and see this evil. What happens in the film happens very slowly and often accompanied by a voice that sounds like a cat made, and then, just when you think it is finished, it starts again. I saw it in a cinema movie in Rome that was hired at the weekend to show Barney's films, which is a good and wise way to restore what was in the age of dirty people. brigade, but if small items and Bardo fans were young adults were all honest, everyone could be more happy if they showed just one of the porno!
