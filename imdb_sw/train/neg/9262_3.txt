On the idea of ​​Omen 4 was good. It is good to see that the devil's child can be a girl. In fact, sometimes, as in the mouth, when the girls or men are the devil is very good. But in Omen 4, it falls. Delia does not make me think she can be a child of the devil, instead she is a child with issues. Issues that are perhaps only professional, but then the priest can help. She does not look scary or devil. Instead, it looks sulky and moody. <br /> <br /> This film was likely to have been made by the same people who had made the last three films that could work. But instead of insulting him really make a series of one of the most beautiful trilogies, as done for a special TV movie. <br /> <br /> At most levels it reduces. It is looking for cheap, acting is a hammer and the effects are common to the TV show. The characters do not bring any mercy, and you cannot send them. I recently checked it again after someone brought it for me for Christmas, and it has caused horror. If you are thinking about looking at this, then I would suggest you don't. Look at one of the others, or see the Exorcist, or see the Good Son. Don't waste your time on this drivel!
