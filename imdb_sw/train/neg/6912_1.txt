The only reason I gave 1 out of 10 is because the choice of zero out of 10 was not allowed. This was a great waste of time I had endured. For 75 minutes, you are dealt with the work of WORST (and I do not mean to be in a good way either, as in KILLER NERD with a serious act of act) and a plot that is not just ignorance but also does not really do with murder. Because I even rent this piece is because it has murder in the head. That said, there was only one murder in the whole movie and it was very good to it. You spend a lot of time watching children talking and doing yard work than nothing. Speaking of children, little boyfriends may be the youngest child actor since bob from house to cemetery. What? I said it's a shot on the video too? If you want to give us more money and more than an hour of your life, then in all respects check. But if you like your hard work and time, then go as far as possible.
