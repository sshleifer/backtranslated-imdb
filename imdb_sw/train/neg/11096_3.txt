I had great optimism for this film, because I thought NYEFU, SHAVEN (the first element of Kerrigan) was a horror, a low-budget film that I had seen. <br /> <br /> But a lot of CLAIRE DOLAN is completely useless and flat. The view after the event is randomly incorporated into the mix, without many ideas for details or behavior. Do you try to escape from being a prostitute or not? It's hard to say. Why did he take the trick at the airport if he wants to avoid that life? Why doesn't he take the approach when he needs money in Seattle? Why should we see him wearing his hair with the same color? Why does Claire accept johns and not others? The film manufacturer does not seem to know. It feels like everything is happening (although I understand this was not a case) and the filmmakers just made a camera on it as they did after the observation I saw, Kerrigan defended his lack of storytelling by judging the film's details conservative politics. It seemed like a rhetoric that he learned. I think it's a striker. It is saddened that the film manufacturer is as exciting as NYEA, SHAVEN will continue to make films as well and then protect it from exhausting "political" cliches.
