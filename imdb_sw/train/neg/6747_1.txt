Wow ... do not say about making this film, I can't say much. The access box on a local video should be all said ... anything except 6 characters / executives who are lost on the Right set and decide to hit the movie! The work was not budgeted, but were able to afford the stars and good actors! Style on the nearest substance makes its mark here, except many of those class failures do not forget that there is a plot that needs to go somewhere when they read this script. After only 4 or 5 is assassinated by a wounded killer and a bed of confusion in the killing club that the dumb says is a true club that can join (only if he can get a lot of girl in the car), you want to clap your hands with something nearby more to remind you never to be more excited about the best films like this. I feel bad for people who bought this film and can't find anyone to take their hands off. Another example of what was caused by an increased number of video recordings without the thought of putting in the most important things. Give us away if you used this.
