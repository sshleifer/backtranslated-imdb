Something worthless is being done for a television film that is looking for a very script of insects. Ants secretly converts into sandy killers near the hotel. I think it's from a hotel hotel because the sewage from the hotel's hotel comes directly from the bed bed. There is no concern in this film and not dangerous. Looking at a group of sores that caused their victims is not too scared. <br /> <br /> Part of the Businessmen's Stuff of the hero is very close. He is told that a health inspector that ants cannot be a hero. It should be a secret virus. After the auditor says this, the hero takes his bulldozer and destroys a large ant colony. This faces millions of sores and traps for people in the hotel. Overall, this is a very crippled film. I don't understand why it was given to the DVD when most of the most valuable movies. I think only the release of the DVD is that Suzanne Summers has been shown on the film. This is a movie to avoid.
