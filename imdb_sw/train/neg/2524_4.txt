Head: Robot Jox (1990) Director: Stuart Gordon Offer: Gary Graham, Anne Marie Johnson, Paul Koslo <br /> <br /> Review: Stuart Gordon who we often collaborate with many awesome films such as Re-Animator, From More, Dagon and Castle Freak, took a small detour here and made a little flick. I emphasize the word "little" since this is a very low budget, and there is its main weakness. <br /> <br /> Stories happen later. The world that has great power (that according to this film is America and Russia) dominates their differences not to fight the perfect war on the earth ... but to fight the gladiator war with big robots. Our heroes Achilles must go up against the evil fighter of the Russian robot named Alexander. Lots of cheap animation cause. Well, the idea is amazing I think. The major nations are facing national conflict with big robots? An interesting and single column that could be addressed properly if the appropriate budget was available. Unfortunately what could be a fun movie end up being a shame to the most beautiful director. <br /> <br /> I like the child I loved this movie, and I think if you want any pleasure from out of this film, I will force you to restore a little child of the mode so that you have fun with it. I showed this film to my friends and if the movie continued with my friends where "what hell is a piece of franco?" And I like this film is sci-fi and one of my favorite Stuart Gordon directors? "But if the movie continued in the corny area I almost felt like stopping and not having them through the suffering. So, because I love this film as a child, and there is still a little feeling involved and watching it but everyone else just wanted to get it." /> <br /> I realized that the movies are 'T really good. Leaving the first.The movie is about big robots blowing out of each other. And to achieve this in a reliable way you should use some of the best effective effects of But, unfortunately this is a small movie, from a small company (Empire Pictures, which lost it after making this film!) The only impact helps us to throw and laugh. it seems unlocked or partially. in the film and even enjoy great robots blowing out of each other. There are certain instances when robots are fighting the coldest, and they make me "that's why I loved the movie's load!" But everyone knows with them, the crappy effect will remove you out of that protective throat you have tried to hide. With access, the return to you in recognizing this film does not only exist on its basis. It loses something of some sort of a little misleading about the movie. This movie is essentially a movie for children. You know, big robots cheat? Stand animation animation? Hello? But these movie discussions had a lot of sexual and violent documentation. So I kept asking myself this children's movie or not? After a while I just came to the conclusion that this was basically a children's movie with an adult feeling, which really is not a good mix. <br /> <br /> So for those who do not feel that some naive charm as a child watch two robots fight and if you do not have nostalgic connections to this movie (like me) well Id will show you clearly from this. Gordons is a good director, but this film he did, didn't do it to me. Well, at least not now that I am an adult. <br /> <br /> Rating: 2 out of 5
