I don't know if I'm talking about those who wrote this bad video or director ... "Devil Hunter" is certainly one wonderful movie of "horror". <br /> <br /> The program is a sufficient shade gray film like "Cannibal Ferox" and "Cut and Run." Chick finds trophies in the 'jungle' and 'tribe' of 'savages.' Jungle looks more like a garden somewhere in Mexico. The tribe is like a group of hippies who move around the Halloween City party dress for ethnic clothing. With various savages in race from white to Asian and black and linen. I think Franco has just taken anyone who looks even a little ethnicity for this reason to lose. To make things worse, this film has a low level, no real risk and much unwanted penis. It's not fun. I can find something I like in just about any Italian or Euro-garbage film; this dropped only short. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10 children, children.
