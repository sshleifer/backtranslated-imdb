After looking at KHAKEE I felt I would look at another beautiful movie but sadly the film is shocking and actually strives to establish Aryeman After his father Keshu is a producer of it. The different meat and films made at that time, I wonder what film he was talking about on <br /> <br /> The film is actually a typical film of Masala and loads of comedy, romance, everything jumbled action / / <br /> Convenience where children pick up the family, is one part of the funniest ever, Imagine children grab the family of Dawood <br /> Last is the perfect jumble mumble and sudden change of character <br /> <br /> RKS offers its weak films up to date , except some of the events of Bachchan film generates something / it is trying to give all its space, doing its best, though it is not much better though it fights its face too much time ak have a stimulating and makes a look of a strange look while smoking H is dubbing is also not good at another time / <br /> Akshay is there for several minutes and just repeats its action with hams <br /> <br /> Aryeman looks so uncomfortable, trying very hard but destroying some of the events / <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Others are right
