This is not surprising, if it's done by the film. I tried because star Richard Dreyfus and Jeff Goldblum, two good actors, and because the plot of the plot - the leader of the attack is almost delivered from the mental institution - apparently promising. The movie is billed as comedy, sorta. What we have is the endless series of shots - you should forgive the pun - of people in dimly lit and elegant, like some surreal, inside, shooting each other - in the head, stomach, kneecap, foot, heart (no part of anatomy is avoided , it seems) when giving an unfamiliar and unhealthy discussion, some of which should, of course, be concerned in modern modernization. The Goldblum talk of the entire movie can be identical to 3x5 cards, and wearing one face of the face - sardonic grin - throughout. Ellen Barkin and Gregory Hines are doing their best. Burt Reynolds does a cameo. Credit List Rob Reiner and Joey Bishop, but somehow I forgot (a good argument on their side). Anything is cold, odd, mechanical and destructive; The successor, I suspect, in the form of 'Pulp Fiction', 'Fargo' and 'Birth of Death'. If you loved those, perhaps you would like this.
