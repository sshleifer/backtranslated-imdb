This movie seems to have been made by someone who has good ideas but also did not make the film before and did not think that the script should be replaced or even interesting. When I saw this film, I saw it with John's candy and thought, for a lie, that it would be hilarious. Instead, there was a stupid plan on mind control and often flat, unwanted. And, above, Candy brought some of the worst lines I ever heard of then. Therefore, despite the idea of ​​being hit by a fantastic story of interest, we have been left with an amateur and non-fiction film that may be stupid for ordinary adults, although young people will have a few laughs. It's a real shame - it would be better. I mean, with Eugene Levy, Joe Flaherty and John Pipi must be wonderful.
