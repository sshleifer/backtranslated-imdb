This half-movie movie of Italy begins very much like a movie's soft porn movie and turns into a mystery that has fewer boundaries of disappearance to be good, and the fact is only limited makes this film instead of being recognized by my taste. The only thing to look at is the many boobs that spread to the film. The story has a boy at the beginning of the movie attracting girls to his fortress where he continues to take them to his shaft, to go berserk and seems to kill them. They show dirt, but they have not really shown murder for this action in the film. Then the boy gets a good red head on the party and keeps doing with him and marrying her. He has something with red heads you see as his ex-partner Evelyn's wife was also one, also died under circumstances that have not been the business of the audience. After a lot of negotiations start to take place involving snakes, foxes and so on. At this point it is easy to identify who is responsible for the murder and what it does then you have an end of nonsensical where everything stands not very well. This movie did not work for me, it left me with many questions and the last third of the film had no boobs of the first two-thirds of the film. The death of Evelyn's death would have helped the film to have some kind of finish with Evelyn rising from the grave. In fact the head is not entirely false as he did the kind of leaving the grave, not under his own power. Gore is very light for a large part if there is a fox area and the last area with a little blood too. I thought for the most part this movie was tad light.
