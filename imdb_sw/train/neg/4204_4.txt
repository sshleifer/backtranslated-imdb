David Arquette is a young man with home security alarm / / <br /> trader taken under the wing of Stanley Tucci. Arquette is a / and <br /> boy of gold, scoring a great sale on his first call - for widow Kate <br /> <br /> Capshaw and her son dopey Ryan Reynolds. Things are going to become something good for Arquette, she appears in advertising to a security company <br /> <br /> and falls in love with Capshaw. <br /> <br /> Then Tucci with his right hand woman Mary McCormack allow him / her <br /> to a little secret - sometimes he enters their customers' homes / them <br /> to be afraid of them and find their neighbors buy security systems from the company. Arquette decides not to get <br /> <br /> to share, taking Capshaw to meet his family, and through life <br /> <br /> with a goofy smile on his face. Then a man breaks the house of Capshaw and kills him and his son. Arquette accuses Tucci, and sets a series of traps, causing the gun to his boss's head as Tucci asks for his rights. <br /> <br /> According to action, "Alarmist" is not opened properly. Scenes <br /> <br /> where Arquette takes Capshaw to meet her parents They also do not have a line / line <br /> and a Capshaw character playing, washed and tells <br /> <br /> sex stories to the mother of Arquette Michael Learned. Other <br /> <br /> than these events, Capshaw does not give much to do, but she <br /> <br /> does a lot and a little given. <br /> <br /> Stanley Tucci, looking like Terry O'Quinn, is a clash like <br /> <br /> owner of a security company. He is a rock who does not know the truth <br /> <br /> Moral values ​​of morality. However, when he returns to the cloud of <br /> <br /> after Arquette rob him, he is hilarious. Mary </> <br /> McCormack seems to have been hit by a great responsibility, but <br /> <br /> she stands next to agree with Tucci. Ryan Reynolds <br /> <br /> is too old to play a little boy, but it's funny, especially <br /> <br /> telling you a clear sex story for Arquette. <br /> <br /> Screenplay comes from romantic comedy with dark comedy also <br /> <br /> soon. Capshaw encounters with parents are not completely closed, <br /> <br /> unless you give him the reason to get out of the city so that someone can get out of his house. Capshaw and Reynolds are in the film just <br /> <br /> giving Arquette the reason for revenge on Tucci. Arquette, who has proved to be a good actor, is bad here. It is based on the completed button that has gained through those AT&T ads, and not enough presence to create this <br /> <br /> short film. True, Reynolds can be the best <br /> <br /> choice in the role. Dunsky's direction is good, nothing will win Oscar soon. <br /> <br /> The jazzy text of Christophe Beck remembers the films of this film <br /> <br /> the movie tries to be, and is more interesting about it. <br /> <br /> With the definitions, the failure of the Arquette as the leadership and quality of script <br /> <br /> The quality of schizophrenic drives the film. I don't recommend. <br /> <br /> This has been rated (R) for physical abuse, gun violence, some of the year, <br /> <br /> violent violence, female female violence, sexual content, severe sex <br /> <br /> records, and adult situations.
