Born again is a small part of one season. It deals with the issue of rebirth and not just flying. I have never been great about regeneration and that could be part of my attention towards this section. It does not explain the case of Tooms which continues to go well from the previous period. But it ends up there. Where it is unfortunate because it is done at the beginning of the section. I think it is a pity that a dead boy would choose a new birth in a girl's unrelated body. And she waits until the girl returns eight to start revenge. There is even a huge lack of Mulder & Scully's conversation of jealousy to keep that part. If you're signed in to regeneration, maybe this section is on your location. If not, then at least you can learn what bradycardia is.
