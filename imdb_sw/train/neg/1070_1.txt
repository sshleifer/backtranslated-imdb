I have seen bad movies (Austin Power - The Spy Who Shagged Me, Batman Forever), but this film is very bad, so it's BORING, that I got almost half way and I can't focus on others. Huruma. Excellent talents such as Kenneth Branagh, Embeth Davitz and Robert Duvall and the story of John Grisham, what caused it? Branagh is a full-time lawyer who has one night with Davitz. His father (Duvall) is a psychopath who hung his cat, etc., etc., so Branagh has sent him for innocence, and he runs quickly. Somehow (I didn't know how) Robert Downey jr, Daryl Hannah, Famke Janssen and Tom Berenger were all confused in a story that might be slower than it was. I wanted to do this, and, to be a great fan of Grisham, I read all about this movie with me (stupid) I expected something interesting. This is a film of the WORST film that I have seen so far and I would like to earn my money. * from *****.
