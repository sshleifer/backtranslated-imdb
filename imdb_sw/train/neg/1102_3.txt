First, I must admit that all the movies I have seen with this director saw me anonymously and so might have missed points. My Czech is not bad but, after sitting through its two films, I would not have tried to learn. Samotari is very cold. The way is also cool. It's about ten different lines of stories that wear and out together. That is not very common in the city size of Prague (tiny, real.) The main characters are between 20 and 30. The best character is the little girl of the Balkans. His feelings are worthy of the migrants here every day of the damn. That's about it. Characteristics only. Everyone makes their own life hell alone. How can I feel sympathetic and inadequate like that? Perhaps there are interesting bits and Japanese tourists but I need another kind of film? If you like sound music, watch this film. If you want to laugh at other people's ignorance, watch this film. If you like dry and dry humor, see the original Jarmusch is not imitating. And under any circumstances see the film Ondricek, Septej (Whisper.) That is unless you like to enjoy personal discrimination.
