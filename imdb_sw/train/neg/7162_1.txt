This film takes what can be a good idea, a 2000 year old witch who was mummified and completely destroyed. Nora and Jim are alcoholics who go to Ireland to dry up. They are going to stay with Nan and his uncle. The uncle has discovered a 2000-year-old magician stored in peat. He raises and takes the form of Nora. He cannot be killed normally, (more is compassion). Nora, however, does a way to do it. <br /> <br /> This is a movie of the Gothic fear made at an affordable price. It is enough confusion. I need to ask why anyone could make a bad film. I am tempted to learn the envy to make it disappear. <br /> <br /> FIND IN ALL EVERYTHING
