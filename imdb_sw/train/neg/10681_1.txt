Unfortunately, having a lot of "my" lists, and a good list of "b" participants agree to make this film, but they did, and so they took me to watch it. I never heard of this film, but there was Cuba Gooding Jr. certainly on the DVD cover, and James Woods back how could it be bad? By the very word! This movie begins k.m. it is spinning and turns, then puts the egg. The end was very weak, it was as if the author was called by his 4-year-old son sitting to the type of writer and he lost the end. How amazing to a movie called "the last game" to have such a poor. These are the types of movies that can move the "list" characters on the "b" list quickly. I hope Cuba Gooding JR, and James Woods do not have this attitude.
