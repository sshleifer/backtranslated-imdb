When a person gives a regular film, remake is always bad against the original. Also, there is a chance that remake is very different for that it is just anonymous to the audience. Well, the 1973 TV series of "Double Indemnity" contains pictures of similarities and talks as before 1944. The main difference is that the remake looks just does not quite energy. Fred MacMurray was as good as a transfer insurance agent, hosting a Walter Neff insurance in the original; Richard Crenna looks just a world-tired and tired. Edward G. Robinson brought great humanitarian power to his role as MacMurray Barton Keys; Lee J. Cobb, a good actor, looks almost tired with the case. Samantha Eggar is exactly the same as Phyllis Dietrichson emerged, who struck back; when Barbara Stanwyck was very good in this role of evil, the egg is wise and respectful and looks just out of place. Robert Webber, in the role of Richard Gaines as the master of Robinson Norton, and John Fiedler replaced the Hall Hall as an important witness, bringing life to the movie. In particular, Webber refers to the role of Norton well in the 1970s. However, after starting the movie, the whole thing is a kind of lies there, without any life or electricity. This is one film that should never be made again.
