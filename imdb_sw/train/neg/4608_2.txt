I bought this DVD because it has an internal and ratings ratings said; "It was tested R for violence and sexuality, magic and language". which is precisely, IMO, should say; "Tested R for violence, sex, magic and language" <br /> <br /> the word "sex" should come after "comma", not "and" because of the big difference in its meaning. I think many people who have watched this film will agree with me that sex and parts of weakness are missing. My first impression when I look at the scope is that I will have to look at something like a "open" film. that's why I felt desperate. The story-wise, was so-so, after all who care so much about the story if the good car was in it. I know I'm not. Of course, this is just my opinion. Joseph
