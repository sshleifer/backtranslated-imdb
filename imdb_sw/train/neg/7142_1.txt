That is by far the film of the WORST I've ever seen. I was expecting to expect a cheesy movie but at least some pictures / racing car. I found it. The racing area is the lowest budget which took them to make it look like cars "go faster" In one place Mercedes SLR goes from more than 200 to 0 in 4 seconds just as it rotates in circles. His only evil. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a real movie about cars, check out a quick and angry series. They can be a little cheesy, but better 100x than this movie can ever hope to be. Better still just look bad 3000, the best movie movie ever made I think.
