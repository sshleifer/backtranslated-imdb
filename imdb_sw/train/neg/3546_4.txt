Businessmen ahead - continue to your attention. <br /> <br /> My main problem with this movie is that Harry learns the identification of three third-party writers - easily - continues to finish on their needs. Then any place with his wife has been arrested, he decides to remove his classic car to explode (with money in it), which makes us take a good leap of logic. Well, so he wanted to keep his thing with Cini out of the public eye due to his wife's involvement with the DA campaign. This I can see, but why not employ a person to beat a small scale around, or even kill them once he would decide that there was no real evidence (eg, Cini's body?) This was a very good first 2/3 movie. After that, it is a kind of distant falls.
