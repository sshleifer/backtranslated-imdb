I saw this film in the preliminary release of the Gumba Artist in Beverly Hills. If I remember, film producers and director were attending, maybe considering our responses. Many events caused by laughter from the audience, which would have been good if it was a comedy, but it had to be a terrible film. <br /> <br /> If the audience was not afraid, it seems that the authors of the film were. They delayed the release of more than a year. From curiosity I saw it again to see if they would cut it again; as much as I could say, they were not. It was the same, only one-year-old movie. It is about to be "very bad, good," but it is slow and stimulating.
