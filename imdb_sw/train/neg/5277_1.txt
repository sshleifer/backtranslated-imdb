I discovered this on Showtime tonight and I wondered how the film with such an interesting power might turn out to be very bad. IS YOUR EXAMPLE? star Brandon Davis as senior senior high school Chris Hughes, geek who inherited the succession of porn empire left by his biological parents. Although the premise looks like a film can be very fun, it has been damaged by the inept entry of the first-time director Andy Fickman, clich√©d and predictable screenplay, and act which is even worse to the direct levels to the video. Even the usual Charlie Talbert returns to an amazing performance as a good friend. Ali Landry is the only good place for this blind and dislikes. 1/10
