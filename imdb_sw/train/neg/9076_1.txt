Certainly this was the stupidest, worse, the most horrible film I saw for some time. I was tempted to disconnect the VCR, but, as in the fascination look at the car accident, I actually found HATEABLE in every imaginary way and slugged it through to the end. I'm not a good person who looks at the comingic image of sexual antics on the screen. House of Animals, Porky's, There Is Something About Mary, all the movies of America's Pie, and even notorious Freddy Got Fingered I have been very happy about their unusual words. The sponge bath of Mamie Van Doren is seen more horrible and geriatric naked since The Shining. It was well-adjusted and shot, and the most horrible exhibitions from Devon Sawa and Jason Schwartzman, the film ended, without the benefit of doing it right away. The sole aim of the film is as an example of how to make an outdoor picture. O, and it will also be used as a lawn fertilizer.
