First, this film is not "exciting." Not "promoting, taut." It could be so according to the script, but the direction of small speed makes it hard to get into. <br /> <br /> The plot itself is very interesting and ingenious. Unfortunately, we just get a sense of * how * ingenious after the picture is over. Who will leave us with more than two hours of a long series of music and music play on them punctuated with some of the action events that will not grab the viewer, and the "cunning vixen" scenes that incorporate a little more open mind. I would like this to be the fastest excited box. It would be the best film. Instead, Spike Lee made a plod through the end.
