Tim (Gary Daniels) wants very much to get into a major television report. When the job he requested for going to hury, he is expelled. Her beautiful but empty girl (Elizabeth Hurley) says sayonara, too. When he got home, Tim began to find his home with an uninvited visitor (Christopher Lloyd) from Mars planet! Calling Brother Martin, Tim soon tries to help his new friend return to life on earth. However, Martin gets into trouble wherever he goes, from the bathroom to the laundry and more. Lizzie's lovely (Daryl Hannah) finally gets the opportunity to make time with Tim but the course of true love does not run in this case, either. Soon everyone in the TV mentions Tim, hoping stories about a true visitor. What should a person do? For those who loved the old television show name, and Bill Bixby and Ray Walston, this film is not suitable to integrate fashion boots. In fact, of course it is bad, without conspiracy and depending on the specific effects that should fall flat, too. Daniels are the same as ground land but Lloyd is just as bad as a stranger, destroying a storm. Some of the cast are enough, such as clothing, set, and production details. Even if your children see the cover and ask for this film, convince them to take something else in the video store. Make sure, children and adults will get this great movie, so choose A Night in the Museum or the World round for 80 days instead.
