This is an interesting treatment of a subject that is quite controversial, (read only some comments on this film). It seems, you may like it or hate it and it seems that many people are making a difference according to those who believe that the tribulation and the end times will occur as shown on the film. <br /> <br /> Typically, the film - and sequels - were made for $ 1.30 each. Production ethics are down to the "Program 9 From Out" and acting on the same level as "Glen or Glenda", (my apology to Ed Wood). Setting aside religious messages, the story is awesome as it comes. Add to even the smallest ideas that the story could actually be close to something that might happen later and become more severe. <br /> <br /> This movie, and its columns, doesn't try to bring the reason why the stress occurred when you did it. "Left" and "Code of Omega" tried to get everything "Thief" made and describe all politics and operating in the Middle East lead. The real effect was "Mwizi" worked better in the horrible part of the film, rather than a thin self-trying to explain what is happening in the Middle East at the same time. <br /> <br /> Politics and watch this film, and its sequels, why it is - awesome stories. So that they are afraid of stories told, in an indirect way, and God makes them more afraid. If it makes you think about the subject, it has done its work - even if you do not believe.
