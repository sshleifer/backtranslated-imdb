Another violence and anger from Paul Verhoeven. Verhoeven is a puzzle: it is difficult to tell him if he takes his bad influences, and is interested in sardonic or works in full. He is also seen without the knowledge of the fact that all the brilliant images of the world (and this has some of the best) can not hide injustice for stories, dialogue and performance. Kevin Bacon has a corrupt scientist who has found out and uses himself to drive himself into bankruptcy. Bacon usually is a good actor who regularly shows his black side (`River Wild ') in an attempt to put an end to his young appearance; due to the material, however, bacon is not nearly enough to compel to force. The other minister is Elizabeth Shue and Josh Brolin, or who have not given enough talent to make a strong impression and who, when forced to negotiate, become ashamed of themselves. The period is the study of impartiality and unbelief should be stopped.
