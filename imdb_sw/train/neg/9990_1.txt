After watching this film at SciFi station, I can only conclude that this film was made by a group of lovers who have never seen a film in their lives. Film is an endless chain of incredible events, or "fun" as a friend read on my shoulder tells me. The plan was not suitable to comment, but the plane carrying a football player falls in the Yeti area. Before the movie is over, we are taken with the latest starred stars, yetis engaging in the flight run before 50 meters, while pulling the man's feet and beating with him, a woman killing a rabbit for 30 meters with a net, yeti living a few shot and ruined without the obvious effects, it shines on the rock to hold the human shoe, but it jumps again, and the whole collection of extraordinary events. Basically, if you are on Saturday for the purpose of describing the bad films of the original SciFi, avoid this film as a blow. Or if my friend is reading on my shoulder he says: "It's the best movie I've ever seen." Which my right friend says: "It's just a techno music that can be better."
