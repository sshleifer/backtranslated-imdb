It has its reputation; Morvern Callar is all the qualities and desires. He is enigmatic, so original. Is it his way of dealing with the pain of the lost person that makes it so far away and cannot be accepted? Or is it if a reviewer called him a revolution? Of course I would like to call him without work. Morvern is completely restrained. Losing his partner, not thinking of informing the family or spending the money he gave for funeral, he emerges freely on a trip to Spain. He seems so without anything caused by human desire. The only thing that enables the audience to see a human side is a close friend who takes vacation with him. Although at the end his friend is ignored and Morvern has nothing to do with humanity. He may also have committed suicide. <br /> <br /> With managing to make Spain appear as bad and bland as UK shots of the director were superb, lighting and color made a remarkable film. It is really shameful movie does nothing in it ongoing with interest. It's 90 minutes more but it feels too long. They can make Morvern seem to be interesting to grab your attention but do nothing and only he separates you from you to a place where you care about characters or films.
