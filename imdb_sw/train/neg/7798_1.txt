This review is based on the video given the name of Shock-o-Rama released in an unprecedented world in 2002. Is it wrong? It's bad, what '1' represents the IMDb level - but it's worse than that. It is good to think that the original version of the German language can improve things - the dubbing of the English comedic is not quite good - but in fact, this is one of the worst movies of any kind that you see. The zombies in the film are slow and normal than at all, and they don't seem to be able to talk or think about anything other than their upcoming meal. However, they are also intelligent enough to do the work of chaos and bad enough to know that western bags about genitalia will undoubtedly increase the dinner table dinner. The death of George Romero's death put a zombie nation that has been maintained social cohesion; here, zombies are nothing more than an empty coat for false ideas of director Andreas Schnaas. Exactly without redeeming the social value, and even worse, they do not have quite entertaining, Zombie '90 is a bad joke on anyone who loses money.
