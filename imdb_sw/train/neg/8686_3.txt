I suggest this as a "spoiler" just because of some of my content content content, not to the content itself. When I read the comments it is clear that those Republicans somehow tolerate the show, but despise it, while democracy seems to enjoy it in what is called reality. One reader (so it seems) really shows that he believes that these events did or could have happened when Bush was at school school. But about the content as I see, trying to feel, it's that a group that made this series should really be Bush victims. The last time I saw, s02e03, showed that the program must be together for a long time before McCain became a perimeter of the selection; because, all former front fighters have been seen. Something else that took my attention, was the use of adding buttons. I thought that the series should be done in Europe is certainly not in the United States, because I do not know any US house that has not been built in bonds, and it is possible in the house of artists. <br /> <br> If I look at the show, I am engaging in it, I am surprised to see what should be the great desire of the authors to do anything to destroy our President. Certainly there are problems like many of the Americans will agree, but that is not the reason for having a strong hatred in public exhibitions that have been seen around the world. Maybe this situation is installed by this show and the Internet, so that if Obama or Hillary entered, they would continue to produce and make it a kind of "humor" on them? <br /> <br /> Only one more comment on comment comments. Although there was some sort of change in elections back in 2000, according to the author, he was sure that there would be a completely different president. Wow, thinking of his side. In addition to 911 events, I believe it was standing when Clinton was president, and I can't see if Gore was President whatever it would be very different.
