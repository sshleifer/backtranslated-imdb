This film is about British prisoners of war from World War I to escape from the camp in Germany. I get a sad "sad-horse" sad. This lesson would be exciting, insistent and adrenaline opened, but the "Wooden Horse" is told very clearly. It is a collection of clear and bad events, without suspension and exciting. The first half clearly states how the prisoners of war formed a hole, but these events are clear, and they are not clear with the close bonds of making me. The last half of the film is even worse, they just go from one place to another without a cat and a mouse. And the characters can talk a little and have more action in the action film! I am disappointed with the "Wooden Horse", lost the possibility of being a great film.
