But, it lets you face ... tend to have a few nostalgic concerns from me. <br /> <br /> The show is just a great series that is allowed to have a few hiccups. I get a new season, and just go through them if I have 2 days to live. I like the idea of ​​closing, but it was the end of the season season that will describe the following: <br /> <br /> Dr.Cox should not be bald for a few more events, the only details I can think of is the change of events or had to shoot the beginning. <br /> <br /> and that my friends, why cox hell is bald. <br /> <br /> All routes, show is awesome ... bring the 7th season.
