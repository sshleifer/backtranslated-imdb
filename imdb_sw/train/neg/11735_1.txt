This movie loved me because all the main characters or characters have a low priority. I have lived in Iowa for 29 years and I know that people don't have a sense of south here. This film is about a person who makes meth and I don't know the real plot or what the film thinks is close. It has some of the use of good drugs and it is very scary to see these people using meth as it was sugar. I lost my brother and meth and this movie makes me sick for my stomach because it pleases the medicine. The movie makes it seem cool using drugs but I was happy at the end when the guy almost did it in the government line. I also know that many women who get rape rape do not want to do their partner on the next day. The movie is just wrong in all directions. I would like to recommend "Diaries of Basketball" if I would like to comment on the film about drugs.
