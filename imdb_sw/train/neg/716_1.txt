This movie is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. There is absolutely no story story, the gags are just for a long time and nothing else makes this movie appear. In the whole movie Fredi (oh my god is a wonderful name. Ha ha) did not ask himself about how he came from the plane to the center of the world. There are a lot of stupid and improper characters who names should hear funny. k.m. : Gandalf is called Almghandi, Sam is called Pupsi ... and so on. I could not be thrilled immediately during the entire movie. Gags looked like they were made by people who IQ are negative. When you laugh when someone's coat is closed on the door (this happens 5 times) then this movie is probably for you. Another interesting feature: They are trying to guess the code for the closed door (don't ask why — you never ask “why” in this film) and the word word is (ha ha): elephant. So if you have done these models you can love this film. For everyone: Go to Youtube and watch "Lord of weeds": it's a lot, more fun.
