Maybe, maybe I'm just running bad with Hindi movies soon. I asked a video player for Apharan (Prakash Jha) but to be a new release, he was not there yet. So I needed to stay for this. It was a Hindi stupid movie that I saw (and I have seen quite a few). No wonder BOllywood is a stock of laugh around the world! If IMD had a minimum, I would give Garam Masala to -10. I remember seeing a TV show about the jazzy premiere given to release in Mumbai. All the natural cables and their sideys showed. For some strange reason, people expect good things from Piyadarashan. I don't like Hulchul, Hungama, or other films. Hulchul, perhaps translated from Tamil or Telugu, came as a very loud voice, in your face that again it had no more meaning than on the Flick of the sound. This latest CXXP piece showed that this person does not have BRAINS. Who made him a director, even a voice director there? <br /> <br /> However, for the film now. What begins as a sexual violence changes into a feminist hunting for women. Two businessmen who make a newspaper share the apartment (not like No Entry where dudes 2 works for a newsletter and share office? Jezuz Christ, now copying their own stories!) Well anyways, there are some cooking or chef who tries to help one of dodos in his quest for multi-lateral love (aka multi-tasking + multi-timing). What happened last, I don't know. I ended it in the middle. Junk of ignorance. I can't believe they even let it go. And how sad to get into their own dirt! To what listeners did - an illiterate Indian people (700 Mil for the last count) or NRI's heeled well aligned Phoren? Such a method does not matter. Any group has any clue that makes a good film and perhaps deserves such a good thing. It is a short review because there is nothing to write about but an ordinary bag of F-grade trash. Sounds should change its name to Hollywood. And yes, this review is better than the movie itself.
