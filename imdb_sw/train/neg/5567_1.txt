Well, I took this film because of the director ... has made the flicks interesting in the past (if you haven't seen Waxork missing a fun journey). However, I was concerned about this film from the beginning but I decided to drink and watch it. It's bad. Very bad. If you haven't seen the film and don't worry the vendors read ahead. First of all, say the old 'You can't judge the book for the lid' applies here. This flick box seems to be Jill's a long-haired stone and highlights. Behind the box has a good shot of red-leather jill and other shots. The description makes you want to rent a movie because INI Good. You begin to look at it and suddenly you see that the movie takes place (of course) in 1977. Jill is a general dog who is not a girl on the lid. The movie is not quite predicting if you think ... and that's not a good thing. Employees are doing a lot of stupid things without any motivation guide ... it's a shameful look. 10 minutes before the end of the movie Dolph and another woman has sex without good reason. Also, what to have Dolph killed another woman in the cold blood that he had helped. Anthony Hickox director should see the stinker when he was reading the script. It would have been put into a new millennium grass and made half of the intellectual minded. To put it in 70 years is useless and unworthy. Avoid!
