They sell it as a terrible movie, it should be exciting, but I have found it funny (comedy?, I don't think so), I cut the whole movie I think was because of ignorance and conspiracy work. I don't blame the executives, I think they were not very good, but O.K. I think Cillian is very good "bad man" I loved her acting in Batman Beggins, and Rachel McAdams .. whoa! he is beauty, and a good actor too, but let's try to have a little goal here, story mm mm ... direction mm mm ... is not a lot of doubt in fact it's a very interesting movie, but there's one good tho thing, it's a movie short, only one hour and 30 minutes (ON THAT IS LIKE MINUTES 10 IN WATER!) <br /> <br /> I don't know why this film is rated high, and in rotten tomatoes, even higher, what is bad for good, wise and rejecting the goal?
