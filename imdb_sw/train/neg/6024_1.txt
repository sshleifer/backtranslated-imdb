I watched 30 minutes on this film before I finally got sick to get bludgeoned on the head with this movie. Sounds, a voice called 'plot', and every actor. It's like they all think it's the main part of the movie and shout "NOTICE ME!" again and again. A bad boy has his bad music going on and says that it causes bad things â€” like, if you don't. A good person does things with courage and respect only if you don't know he was a good person. And oh master, the airplane. "MY FATHER TO USE! OH YOU MAKE MY GOD! YOU CANNOT USE IN HIS AUTHORIZATION OR GO TO THE BALL OR ANYONE, HE CAN USE!" (Well, I know, his clothes were still, but honestly, he woke up and started to panic before he had time to look at the damn seat he had entered.) <br /> <br /> As a religious girl, I want to apologize to the world for this film was published. <br /> <br /> And I want again 30 minutes.
