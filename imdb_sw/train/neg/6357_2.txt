I am very disappointed. This film has left me feeling in my time and mind. Here was a film of Woody Allen which is no longer known: the top class Manhattanites are discussing whether they will be deceiving their partners. I have seen, I've seen these characters already, I've had a story story from you ten times already. Where does your creation go? You need to open your eyes and look around you. The world has changed dramatically since Annie Hall - and you need to change with it. <br /> <br /> There are more interesting and amazing events that you can use your type of angst and neuroticism - why not try it out instead of retrieving the old slopes again and again. He / she heard that Woody Allen has a new emerging project, does nothing to me - because now I look forward to his old position: a couple who are increasingly enduring and end up cheating. Depressed with the same old age. If Woody wants to win his fans back, then he understands that our sense of humor and intelligence should be exciting - not insulting.
