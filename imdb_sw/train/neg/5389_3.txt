If you have seen other movies like this, maybe it's better. The Omega Man comes to mind. In the studio label, they avoided calling, without unnecessary, a large technofest budget that shows movies of this. Additionally, establishing with the premise was better: four people who do not mean for us are trying to avoid the disease caused by infectious disease. What's wrong is everything else! I am exhausted with a constant, indifferent, wimpy, inefficient, arrogant characters in the movie. It describes everyone in the film at some point. I hired them, and I found myself playing on TV regularly, "no, don't do it!", "Why are you stupid", "look!", Nketera. The lack of realistic development of character is evident on the inner half. Movie should give you a strong personal relationship with at least some of the characters so you can identify what is happening to them. This does not. Also, there may be a long time, more involving the end of the film as well.
