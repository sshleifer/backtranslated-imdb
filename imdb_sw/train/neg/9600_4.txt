Wonderful but often political work of exploitation without real stories, but it benefits from its interesting spectacular actress and a few of the beautiful, make-up effects. Daniella is a beautiful girl with twenty something, carrying the sadness of being raped at the age of 13. Night and nightmare practice leads to continuing to believe her is the regeneration of a grandfather who said to bewolf. He kills his father-in-law during the night and takes you to the hospital. He re-emerges, however, and destroys more men during the flight to police investigators, doctors and relatives. It is all good to watch and listen too (too loud), but the lack of conspiracy and continuous irritation is very fast. Fortunately, the leading woman Annik Borel is rarely wearing clothes and she fills the time of attraction to play near the fire. The film is too long, too wonderful and also cannot forget. The greatest surprise comes at the end, when suddenly and out of blue, director Rino Di Silvestro tries to make us believe that his movie was the basis of true truth. It's true...
