This may be a powerful candidate for "Flick quite bad". Perhaps without the presence of John Hurt, it can be tolerated as a child film. However, the introduction of all this effort, is that John Hurt, one of the many actors of the screens, is reduced himself in this .... I gave only two points because Mr. Hurt demonstrated ... from fast enough. In addition to all others, it is, just, terrible. Janine Turner, as good as she could be, can not do her soul. And the leading actor is, for all purposes and purposes, AWFUL. If you can prevent this shame, please do so. It's very bad, it's almost HURTS.
