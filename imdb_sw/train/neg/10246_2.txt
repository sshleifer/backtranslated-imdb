The end of the world is an unpredictable movie, since it should be on the total destruction of the world. The main character is the type of scientist, I don't know what kind. He has two functions in the government (?) The center is protected by four security people. His first job is monitoring the transfer to and from the position (although this actually looks more like a hobby does when not working at work # 2). Job # 2 needs to put on a protective suit and go to the dark room ... at least that's the best I can do. It seems a "plant" is not a top secret, as a scientist brings his wife there. He relies on (they go to dinner) when he recognizes the message from the position: World Destruction Great, from time to time. He says something about it being the first message from the position he has ever been able to understand; his wife tells him they will go late for the dinner party. So they leave and go to the party (!!!). Soon afterwards he finds that China has had a great earthquake. From there, the film goes ... anywhere! Yes, Christopher Lee is in it, but that's not very good. Besides, Lee gives enough performance on the line of his appearance in Howling II. This movie is boring, but it has stupid stuff that you might want to suffer at once if you like Christopher Lee or Z-grade sci-fi. Further, there are lots of lots of world stocks being destroyed.
