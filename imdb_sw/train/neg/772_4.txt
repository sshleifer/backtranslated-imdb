This movie is not as good as all the movies of Christ I have seen. And I am so surprised that in this story Pilate wants to finish Jesus, when the Scriptures (with other movies) say differently. There was no more important issue: Resurrection. There is no movie leaving this very important part: the faith of all Christians is in this event. As Paul says in one of his letters "If Christ is not raised from the dead, our faith is useless". The most amazing event for me in this movie had seen the roads of palm trees used when Jesus entered Jerusalem. Finally, and contrary to my Jewish notary, Jesus was not a story. And in fact, he was also of JEW. There are many documents (reference and secular) that prove the existence of this wonderful man (or I must say, God be a man) that really has changed mankind. I advise him (since he is a historian) to read about Flavius ​​Josephus, a wise Jewish advocate of the century.
