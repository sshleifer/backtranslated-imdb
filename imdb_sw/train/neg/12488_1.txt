0.5 / 10. This movie has nothing good about it. Acting is among the worst I have seen, what is really amazing that everyone is bad, not a few here and there, everybody. The direction is joke, the low budget is quite obvious, the score is bad, I can say the movie was adjusted, with the brutal brutality will be the most accurate words. It combines serial killings, voodoo cards and tarot. Fool. Fool. Fool. It is not afraid at all, the special effects are the lustful desire. very bad. Writing was very bad. Movies are looking for cheap, and tend to sometimes, and the camera function is bad. Again, what exactly does the film do is all actors wrong. Cheesy.
