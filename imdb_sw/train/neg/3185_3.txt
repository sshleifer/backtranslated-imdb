This movie was closed by MST3K and for good reason. First of all because it is a movie "cop" played by Joe Don Baker, who we all know is about good practices like Michael Jackson is a western singer. The most common films of the coping software grab their heads wrong, the bar of the bar, the local children in the bullet out, the worst actors, the lame police officers, the worst actors, the revenge, the goons The last, and of course, acting badly. Don't view this without the MST3K folder.
