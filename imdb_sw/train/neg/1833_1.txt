Please, someone standing Ben Stiller from working in every movie. Write a label, hell, write your inner congressman even. I've found more laughter to go to the funeral then I look at any Flick of Stiller. Jack Black tries to do something about the comedy on the dog's disappearance, and Christopher Walken, perhaps on the great actors of his generation, looks just a shame to be there. It is still his unwilling person, but now even with someone serving him out, it proves that he is a way to be inserted as a comic. It is not surprising why this film has played badly, and it was available for movie cinema after just a few weeks. I warn you, and you must warn your friends, Do not look at this flick, it's just bad, very bad Gothika (self, I could never think I would say that), 9 bad plan, worse Ishtar, worse then Child Gold. Please Hollywood, unfortunately allow Ben Stiller in your movies, he is not funny, he is a good actor of god, and he brings others down with him. The next film was ranked 1 because there were no negative marks allowed, so when the board says one, I will give you Zero.
