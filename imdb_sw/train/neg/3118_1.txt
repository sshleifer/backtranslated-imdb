I felt that the movie was dry ... very despair no plot .. in waiting for something happened and nothing withered like a bone .. wast of money .. One of the Robins Williams bad film. The DVD because it seems to be an example of a movie that doesn't work well in movies is out as tax before the year is more ... This is one you don't want to see or say why I spent my money on that! More for that new movie there were only 8 people looking at it .... This was on Friday at 9:50 show. I also heard that it requires more excitement or something that prevents us. When the characters were spoken in the movie the sound was also too low to hear what they said.
