It was a line of identity "in the traditional American Pie" which cheats in this movie. I found it a piece of junk in the style of Jackass, with a great difference that compared to this Jackass Movie looks like Kane of Citizen. This game has misled me that I gave it to other movies and 1 out of 10, because now I can't go under that. This makes many bad movies look like movies. I was completely shattered after 45 minutes, and that's something that I'm not very few to do. But it was very clear, ignorant, incompatible and unacceptable. Can't believe some people really pay this for 10 out of 10. What did your parents do? Give your head when you were just a child? Or is it the first movie you saw, so you have nothing to compare with? Are you still a virgin and are you milk that you think? Something must be wrong, at least. My advice: keep open for this. Even if you are a mood for a simple movie that does not need to think, choose something else, or you will certainly break yourself.
