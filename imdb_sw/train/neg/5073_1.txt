The Palme Tree viewer tries to remove it as a story of story and story, and then start on the animation. I had to know what it means. The main character, Palme, is a good example of the whole movie problem. One minute, Palme is a humble hero looking for himself, the next psychological and unhealthy psychologist. <br /> <br /> As all the characters in the film, Palme is not defined. You have no button and characters even though Shatta has found several fan girls. It seems that the author was more interested in banning all the drama and controversy that he could enter into this film than actually examining the 'human impulse and his behavior. <br /> <br /> New, unfamiliar story lines have been brought in the last fifteen minutes of the movie. The author was required to strengthen his story. Perhaps he was trying to be an epic, but it was just a lot of news for the movie two hours. However I can not help but I wonder if a plot with dimensions and many characters would be more suitable for a TV series or novel image. In the five minutes of the film, I could just not tolerate a great lack of quality again and start laughing how they came from characters, relationships, and the whole plot. I touched my friend and began to lose too, as did the guy sitting behind us. We tried hard to control ourselves, but we can't take the awesome quality of this film. <br /> <br /> On the bright side, the animation is amazing and the audience will find themselves playing beautiful backgrounds and beautiful designs. Animation almost leads them; when you do not worry about the characters, tells you how to feel.
