(aka: BLOOD CASTLE or SCREAM OF DEMON) It ​​is a driving feature, a VELVET VAMPIRE. The Spanish and Italian collaboration in which a series of women in the village is killed almost at the same time the local name called Yanos Dalmar appears as a horse, riding with his 'eating' dog. The city / city of the city has already accused him of being behind all and wants his fortress burned. The murder started first around the old Count Yanos brothers, Numbers Igor Dalmar was burning and killed in a laboratory accident. Then Ivanna woman (Erna Schuer) who Igor recruited before her death to help her in her experiments shows up. Yanos agrees to hire him instead of his brother and together they seek ways of regeneration of dead cells. Yanos wants to bring the corpse of Igor back to life. But Igor is still alive (though he has been burned) and he kills and kills women in the village. We see his wrapped face in different parts of the film, so we know he is still alive, and doing the whole thing very little. Igor meets the other end of the fire when he comes to fight with Yanos on Ivanna, and flames falling on the same bed that Igor reminds about, and meet another, end of the end of the burned. The Retromedia DVD is taken from the VHS source and looks completely grainy and bad. Other than the trailer even scratchier, no extra bonus is included. Although it has a beautiful Spanish house and at least good, I have found it boring and predictable, without an exciting or secret, nothing. Over 3 out of 10.
