I had to write a review of this film after reading other comments and saying that this is the best movie of Sidney Poitier. Poitier had just returned from a ten-year break in the film work and he is clearly creaky here. 11 of its films are mentioned in Wikipedia and are not included in this. 5 of its films are on the AFI's 100 most interesting films, again, not with this. Berenger and Poitier, the rube and the modern city seek to hunt the psychopath dangerous before crossing until Canada. Some attempts to play on this film have failed and Berenger and Poitier bonding were cringeworthy and awkward (not helped by a completely bland script). Kirstie Alley (as hostage) was not used, and almost completely ignored when she was on the screen. Another suspension attempt is made, for example when you are trying to try and I think who among the 5 men on a fishing trip is a murderer (both criminal offenders). I understand that this is all the appeal for many fans out there. I thought who it was and I was not trying hard. <br /> <br /> If you're a Berenger fan, check out Sniper (1993), you can even see Billy Zane hitting his things. It's better. All in all I would like to give Shoot to kill 3/10. It's not a role, and it's just the same for me.
