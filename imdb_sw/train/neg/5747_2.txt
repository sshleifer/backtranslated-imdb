I love Movies Zombie and I love amateur production. And the Meat Market 2 is very promising with a good respect for Fulci's Classic "Zombi". So I waited back and waited to attract them. Okay, some makeups are good for no movie budget and other actors (vampirelady and cook) really stand, but maybe nothing. <br /> <br /> I could not expect a new Romero here but there is no single sequence in a whole movie that has even a bit of doubt or value of shock. The director certainly knows how to eliminate the skin's skin and attractive eating habits, but now (after two parts) it is time to learn something more. <br /> In MeatMarket2 Gore lectures and bearing - for me is not enough - sorry. ** /> ​​<br /> ** out of *****
