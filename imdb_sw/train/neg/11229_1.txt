They made me look at this school and it was terrible. The movie has expired. These events are confused because truth is linked to lies to make the story more interesting. Teachers talked about it as a cure but in fact it was a very interesting experience. I have read that very few people who are seen in this are actors, but many of them do what they do in the film in real life. Also, very often the story becomes humble and lose. I do not like how some ways are written and you want to be more meaningful to them. Although, it is written to be educational, funny, suspenseful, and hip, It became boring, dry, off-fetched, and old. I hope no one takes the time to watch this film because you would be too good to see.
