The opening shot was the best thing about this film, because it gave you hope that you would see an independent, independent independent film. Don't open that opening by filling my hopes. As the "film" continued through slow, plodding, my thoughts were different in relation to this "film": Is there a lot of butter in my popcorn? Did the executives have to pay the director to this "film"? Did I get my ticket certified on the Box Box? Yes, dear reader. I saw this film in the Theater! This is the only discrimination I will make on watching the movie at the Movie Theater, because at home you can wipe it. Was there any code of redemption? Peter Lemongelli as a common throat "nerd" had his time, especially in dog hat. Other than that "film" came out to try to be a comedy, for a family festival for spiritual uplifter. It was successful with no limits. Oh, and a partner was quite real. His performance is the only comedy I got.
