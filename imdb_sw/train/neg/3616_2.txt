If you just look at the cover of this film, it's cool. You are. The movie itself has made me sleepy. It was slow, it had little violence and misuse of doubts. Acting was a low-food and plot material, when it would be cool for a different film, not shown here. They even kill the visible character only in the whole film! I give them 2 out of 10 because the only thing that was good was the last piece at the end. Other than that, you may want to save yourself from this film.
