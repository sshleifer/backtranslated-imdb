(Light traders, maybe.) It is usually a Diane Keaton fan, I tried to look at this night. I had to open it before the second hour because I found myself unkind to the daughter or mother. They both met as caring for the little ones, and the daughter also adds to the anxiety, the disrespect and the uncomfortable for the mix. When the daughter died, the only thing I thought was, "Of course we should not look at her again." Keaton did a good job of moving to her amazing and wailing condition, but it was too far for me at that time. I was just not happy, so I stopped looking. If you want me to take care of the protagonist, you need to find me caring about quick characters - if it's around the clock and I don't care, it's too late. <br /> <br /> Help cast in fact and to play well - I felt for them! * - and the best friend of the gay was amazing, but even together, he did not have enough to carry the film to me.
