I found it very interesting about this film - I saw the perfect way of 4 hours of road, how strange it is. For films about two very powerful men - Castro and Che, involved in the political struggle of the violence, it is almost entirely without emotional fire. Exhibition between Benicio Del Toro and Demian Bichir (better for second voice actor, and very loud voice) have no drama or depth and basically comes to Castro telling Che: go here, go there, do this and that, without The definition of impact or using this point will open. Still there is an actor in the striker who has the ability to play Castro - Joaquim de Almeida, but has gone away for a small part in the second half. Without a tension or ambition that could burn these men and their supporters, the film becomes a long epic film on the bearded men, whiskers riding through various forests screaming and shooting without any purpose or end. The comments I have read about the work of director Steven Soderbergh when ignoring practitioners almost entirely. (One actually spent more time talking about the digital film camera of Soderbergh than conspiracy or executives or the fact that it is entirely in Spanish language with English.) This is an unusual, odd thing to do since Soderbergh was The only gun employed on the film and b) is not the most active job, and is not recognized by JFK's Oliver Stone in black and white cutting camera function when Che visit New York. If you think of the Reds directed by Andrew McLaglen instead of Warren Beatty, you would get an idea of ​​the little skill of this film.
