I am so surprised that this film gets a chance like this! I haven't seen such a bad film for years.Omg this was a very bad movie. Splatter, not enough to describe non-compulsory events (almost funny) of blood). If you didn't like hostel2 or Wolf Creek or Halloween (2007) .. this is 10 times more. Story reminds me RL Stine goosebumpsps !! <br /> <br /> I can't tell him about acting since the script was awesome. (why should I write 10lines? I have never understood this.) <br /> <br /> == Here comes the destroyers == <br /> <br /> Stories are about murderers at all times in the metro. We are talking about thousands of murders and no one gets information. The people are really lost. And there is a good man who tries to solve a mystery (well no secret for us because we know from the beginning bad man) and as usual no one believes! what a surprise! Finally he puts the player's clothes and the death of the killer to kill!
