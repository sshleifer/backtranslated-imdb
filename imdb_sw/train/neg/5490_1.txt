When I was a boy we always had babysat, and we always used to borrow film or see the film in the cinema. This is one of the movies we watched. This is one of the stupid films that I've seen, I think it could be a Walt Disney film! Martian has fallen to the earth, becoming a human being, becoming a human friend, and trying everything he can to return home. But he is concerned with the wonders of the world. The only positive comments I can give is the choice of actors, Return to Christopher Lloyd later, as Jeff Daniels of Martian, Uncle Martin, Dumb and Dumber as Tim O'Hara, Elizabeth Hurley as Brace Channing and Daryl Hannah as Lizzie. But far from it is full of crap. Poor!
