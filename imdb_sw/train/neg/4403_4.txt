Whatever is suitable for the film, it is wrong research. If others said, the movie shows Iranian inhabitants speak in Arabic, rather than Persian. That's enough to lose loyalty to anyone who has limited knowledge of the area or country. The situation can not be more distinct and real. <br /> <br /> Other errors error: train seems to work in Afghanistan, while Afghanistan has no rail. Turkish ambassador wearing Fez (red hat), while Fez was banned by Turkey before the time the movie was installed. Turkish Turkish daughter is really wearing as Indian, and Indian music music is playing back in many scenes. I think the representatives of the film said they showed a foreign woman, and sari was the one who decided to make her a foreigner.
