Tony Scott leads the awesome games that fit interesting even non-sports fan. And others say baseball is a dead game ... bath ... also slows down. Well well! Outwardly he seems to be a broken businessman (Robert De Niro) while in it is a psychological fan of San Francisco Giants. Together comes a new slugger (Wesley Snipes) and a chosen saver from bombs. Our traders beat the patience of murder when cutting hard hardwood falls into the worst job in his work with Giants are afraid to decline with him. De Niro is a human fear. Snipes looks very natural as a war ball. Also good at cast is: still Ellen Barkin is attractive, John Leguizamo, Benicio Del Toro and Patti D'Arbanville. You are a free agent ... to enjoy. Violence and strong language are expected and you get your money.
