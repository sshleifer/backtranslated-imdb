This is one of the worst films I have ever seen. The only positive thing I can say is the worst that seems to be good. First, there is no plot. Vendors seem to be reading cue cards and doing extraordinary things. Such as being expelled by the dead but still want to go out and find their friends. Also zombies were bad, no where almost as happy as any work of Romero, who gets s plug in the movie. And the dumbest part of all were kept to show the light of the video game in order order. If we can't find the video game is about shooting zombies. Also, every 20 times how to know how to use the weapon directly and hit the target without even aiming a gun. And the way people die is stupid. It's like coming out of ammo so stand around waiting to jump up. And when the horn in front of the house walk out of ammo instead of shooting open door, So dumb. <br /> <br /> VERDICT FINAL: If any of these actors appear in another film, then they have been a blessing and second chance. Of course the worst film I have seen in years. Movie B's cinemax is the best.
