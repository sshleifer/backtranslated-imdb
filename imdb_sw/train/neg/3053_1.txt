Wow. Who has ever said that Edward D. Wood Jr never influenced anyone? The dump of this ass is a complete case for sure; it makes "Years of Violence" looks like "Casablanca"! "Santa Claus" also makes a flashback of Keith Richards looks like my first nightclub. I have had nightclubs, you know, lift and shoot, which will not come close to the visceral fear that Santa Claus opened from the soil that appears to be pure to me. However, I can think of other parties where this film can go well. Also, if you are looking for a perfect example of Santa-Satan's concept on the VHS tape, do not see it again. Don't watch this film, as I was notified MST3K version is now available. Move on Satan, here is "Santa Claus".
