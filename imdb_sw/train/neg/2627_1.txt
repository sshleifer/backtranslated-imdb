This bomb is a 'one explosion' after another, with no sense of humor. True, pyrotechnics to extreme. The fact is not one of his powerful points. I offer 1 out of 10. I would like to make it zero but that option was not allowed. Sorry, but Lithgow and Sutherland deserve better responsibilities. But sometimes we all need to have money. And I'm still boasting that Tim Burton's horse on Mars. Nicholson was a hero enough to admit that it was Turkey. But if that was Turkey, this film then is not a gizzard. I wish I could say, "Give me my money". You can call the bet I would like. But that's trouble with payment services, type of registration.
