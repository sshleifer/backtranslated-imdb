This movie made it one of my top 10 movies. There was no ongoing moment when there was no war with one monster or another. There was no chance of any character development, they were very busy running from one sword to fight another. I had no emotional attraction (except for the big bad machine that wanted to destroy) <br /> <br /> Events were stolen from other movies, LOTR, Star Wars and Matrix. The image of the spirit at the end was stolen from the last Star Wars and Yoda, Obee One and Vader. <br /> <br />> The first machine was the same as the Frodo attacked by spiders in the Return of Kings. (Elijah Wood is a victim in both films) and waiting ...... detects (hurt) his victim and beat ..... hello hello ??? The entire machine against human themes was Matrix .. or Terminator ..... There are more examples but why waste time? And what will someone tell me about Nazi? Are you here? There was a line of youth stories running for the conclusion of the youth. The movie could not decide whether it is a children's movie or an adult movie and it was not much of either. It is very bad. The real desire to say at least. Save your money.
