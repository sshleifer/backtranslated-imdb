This movie is not suitable for children to be good and to have a better perspective, as a family movie should, and this cannot be considered a family because it has some things that children should not see. It's not the best video of the ABC Family if you ask me. If there was a little sex image on the film, then maybe it would be better. Hollywood does not do anything to make the film better by adding sex. Surely there is no reason for them. At least this is a TV movie. I don't want to lose my money on this trash by leasing. If you have other things to do other than watch this movie, please go with them.
