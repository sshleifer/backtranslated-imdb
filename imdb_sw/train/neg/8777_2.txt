Okay, I struggled to put aside the fact that in selling EVP as a real movie was basically sleeping from getting-go. I thought that hell, I don't believe in hurricanes but I still loved Dracula so I could live with this. However, even for those who accept the movie does not like much. It has been done efficiently and implemented, but it did not touch you at all. There are several times of "jumping", and I just watched them and I think "yes, I didn't expect you" without jumping for a bit. <br /> <br /> Also the resolution is not recommended. If the power behind this is the ability to do things that seem to be, then why does hell need to use agent? Further, the last explanation was wonderful. In fact they put there as part of "giving the film's credibility to claim it is a real thing", but by doing it it needs to be at first. But they can't put it at first because then it gives them a long distance ... hold it at the end just make it as a big stick.
