I don't like to comment on a good film but when it comes to bad films, I gotta come hard on it. Speaking of Vivah, this, Sooraj Badjatya, seems to have been completely lost. After the success of Hum Aapke Hain Kaun, he thought he could earn money and video of cheesy weddings. Vivah is so cheesy that Badjatyas have taken Johars and Chopras back. There was no one time during the movie where I can say 'Oh! at least this thing is good '. Aloknath does the father's job, Shahid kapoor looks fat and sharukhed, Amrita rao is another tragedy by adding bad sets of look, beautiful clothes, hackneyed stories, grandmother's mother, working hard, natural music, cheap voice . Now the striker, I warn you that if it happens on all his other movies, after a movie of disaster events takes notes of happiness.
