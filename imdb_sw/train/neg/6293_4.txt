I enjoyed seeing this film early and I think I thought it would be boring and wondered how they could improve on the 1984 version of the Bachelor Party played by Tom Hanks, which I thought was good ... I was right ... In all honesty I thought it would be better. Certainly there was a surprising short but it was not just to touch the mark with me ... Acting was similar to the story of a very good story follows nature but I think it would be better ... This movie would like to be for young and young heart; full of female bodies, alcohol and sex ... It just run to the size of the movie the party of the mill which has been made regularly. 4/10 is my vote for this.
