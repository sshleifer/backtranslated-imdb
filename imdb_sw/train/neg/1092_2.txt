Well, I think the good news about the opus of William Winckler of 2001, "D-Double Provider," is that it manages to connect the three mechanics of Russ Meyer's animal - Kitten Natividad, Haji and Raven de la Croix - in one picture. (I can only assume that Lorna Maitland, Tura Satan and Babette Bardot were working last week ... or maybe they could see a copy of the script earlier!) Bad news, though there are many), is that this film - if it can be called however, after being shot directly on the video - it is perfect pregnancy, abortion, outdoor and external damage, absolutely disgusting, and one of the worst images I've ever seen. Look again for the film's superhero lighting! This program, as it is, is concerned with the Kitten to gain power after blowing a rare cockazilla plant in South America to heal its breast cancer, and later fight with a trio of bikini-backed players in a bad LAO that every blind boob shock The fall falls completely (you should forgive the words) flat, that there is a real ZERO weakness in the film all the time (except the old kitten pictures in his heyday), and that some of the shaving cream and machete paper are total total FX specific. The Meyer gals here is a little long in the tooth / saggy in the chest, put it to the mercy, though Sheri Dawn Thomas, like a girl bikini Ooga Boobies (!), Can, you, stand well. Why have I given these children, unfunny, to defeat the shame of movie star 2 instead of 1? To be a series: Joe Bob Briggs. His commentary on the special features of the DVD I look at is quite hilarious, especially when it gives out almost 100 exhibitions of the word "chest" from 1,000+ on its "List of Canonical Hooters". That person is a national treasure, and can improve this skeet of disc for faster conditions!
