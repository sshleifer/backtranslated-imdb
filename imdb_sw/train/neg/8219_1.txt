I am the kind of person who goes twice a horrible part when I pick up the film, so I took five in the eyes of the eyes, I was angry with this film and I think there was no story line and no point you could enjoy, it made my skin crawl thinking that people they want to watch films that encourage violence to their hell was a low budget and very garbage! I think I could do better. I think it is the worst film I've ever seen in my life and you should be disturbed to see the actors were the garbage camera was bad picture was bad and the sound was not high, I think it was a bit like a player who had made a project and didn't work all the time it was evil .
