After waiting for the end, I must say I would like to join the entire series in the first place. The last part was everything over the last seven years. Everything is damaged. The trip was 23 years, but captain Janeway is able to reduce ... then say, just seven years. Why seven? Why not just one? Or nothing? Why not avoid the whole adventure? Traders died all the time of the trip. Why does he want to save seven of only nine? Some do not count or what? Part of the concern when employees explain that getting home is not the most important thing for them. As they say, "The journey is more important than the destination". Unbelievable. And in the last area is surrounded by other Federal and World ships are in sight. There is nothing about landing, returning to normal life. It is absolutely wrong.
