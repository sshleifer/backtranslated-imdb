First of all, this is a small movie budget, so my expectations were very low. I think most people look at the info for this movie just wanted bloodfest, and essentially it all. ? There is no. It is basically to see but in China and the whole hell of the worst. Sent? No, period. Special effects? Certainly in my opinion ... There were cutaways and blood is not always possible because of the amount, splatter, color, texture, etc. .. I believe the purpose of this movie was supposed to be a film of cruelty, shock. Now it had great potential on the big budget but the poor scripting, the poor talk, the worst acting, seemed like video camcorder shots, and just plain "Gore," made this film really bad. There are suitable movies to take advantage of some reviews, even "standard movies" are suitable for opportunities (blood channels for example are the most recent I have seen in appropriate reviews), but this was very bad . I hope that people who focus on this movie read my opinion and decide against it. <br /> <br /> I am all with brutality and shock, but the total realistic and very bad act makes a bad experience. Save your time / money and possibly something else, you will not be discouraged.
