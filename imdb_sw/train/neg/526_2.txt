Almost like to stimulate the look like it was reading, the evening is a failure to gorgeously ... until Meryl Streep goes in and gently shows its other members thrown how to do this kind of stuff. Vanessa Redgrave is very surprising in her position as Ann and Claire Danes are dying. Maybe if Vanessa and Claire had changed the roles we could see an invention in Ann who had taken her to an unknown world of story and we could think that Ann was really dead. <br /> <br /> I was hoping to add to Michael Cunningham on credit writing would remove the jumpy story but not. It gave me a head.
