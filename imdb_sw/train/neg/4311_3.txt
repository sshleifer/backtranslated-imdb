I watched this film when I was a young man full of hormone and it was like a sexy film like I ever saw â€” or I was seeing it. It may not be a great movie. I think it's not. I don't remember much about it, tell you the truth. I just remember the sex chemistry between Crosby and Biehn. No woman in any movie has ever made me like an unbelievably sexy girl made in this movie. I have not seen since the first time I got it on television in 70 years and I think I would like to see it again since I am sure it is my hormones that are unpleasant and I have been jaded more than years. However, when I think back to the swimming area I can still remember how they felt back then. He added later: After looking at the film again, I realized it was dangerous to go home again. What was happening now is very good. Old-age woman still working for me, not as it was once, maybe because I'm no longer 12 years old. The old woman is now younger than me. Also, the amateurish of the whole thing is not aware of my twelve-year-old mind. Values: Sometimes it's better not to repeat again.
