This show is one of the worst displays of ALL TIME! absolutely no original joke and they always last year. as in 2009 they finally say something about Michael Vick's actions. All members used are people who wanted to be on the SNL but they had to go down to the bottom of the TV, a young mad hour of the magic effects of the magazine is not funny to start, told and frightened John Stewart want the bees. so if you have any problem tell me the love of id to hear the views of three people who watch this show. family relatives put it well "Osama bin Ladin was hiding the only place nobody could watch, cast on television. There is no reason anyone to watch the show.
