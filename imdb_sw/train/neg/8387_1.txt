This was the worst movie I had ever seen in the movie. It was a collection of printed materials. People get hit in the head is not funny. People fleeing is not funny. After the third time the guy ran into the balls even the smallest member of the audience did not laugh again. It was too tired. I went with my younger sister. He laughs loudly to the King of the Hill but this film is provoking him. I am not surprised. The story is very good. The midget thief stole a big diamond in what was so easy in Hollywood history. Then he hides with the family pretending to be a child. I know it seems exciting but that's the whole story. Speak two lines for 1.5 hours and you will get a picture There was a predictable joke. I felt pulled after I saw this. I had no expectations and I was desperate. I wish Keenan would employ other dignitaries to write a joke and / or its next script. This was worse than Chick White if possible. I have seen secondary games that were excellent, and cheaper. There was nothing positive about this film. I don't like my entertainment to lie down.
