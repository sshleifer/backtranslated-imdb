Why have I lost my money on this last day of Sundance? I want to restore again ... Can I return my $ 16? As I watched this film I kept waiting for something to happen, nothing happened. The only way I knew even what was supposed to be was by reading a plot, which was not like a film. why did the director join their cam's hand and then jump out? It was not very artistic. Why did the director show Lulu putting her nails for fifteen minutes? Why is it when the executives tried to say they said if they were reading? Or was it? I felt like Phantom's love had no story, and I felt I felt like my friends' favorite entertainment videos than this film.
