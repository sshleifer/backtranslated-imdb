Seeing the screener of this before last year's awards, they did not know why they gave out after the ballot ended, but nothing, perhaps for exposure, at least, but the movie was convoluted mess. Indeed, some parts were interesting for the black humor, but no characters felt quite real to me. No one I could connect, and I think it's where it failed me. Indeed, the plot is surprising and very attacking towards Scientology, WOW! What's the main idea ... let's see if it's not already treated until the point of vanity. Any problem feels fake, from lighting, throwing, screenplay to the terrible tragic effects (which should be deliberately, I can tell, and so everyone else can laugh with you though). Anyways, I hope that it is done by selling DVD at least, I don't want a project that most people put in a lot of effort in a total lack of understanding. But it reduces any way. Boring tripe at that.
