This is not exciting and normal as the DVD box claim. In fact I love the wrong movies and wierd, but this is just really lighter! That is one hour of being beaten with money, jumping Baby Born sharks and rape! I think this motive with this amateur sleaze, it was making That-bad-movies is good, but it fails. It's just bad! Few features are the same, but are generally aggressive. If you would like an amateur splatter like this (The only way is best) I would like to recommend Andreas Schnass' Shit 2 and 3.
