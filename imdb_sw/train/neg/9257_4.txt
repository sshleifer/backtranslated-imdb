If you're expecting something new, you have chosen an inappropriate film. Who can imagine that the film is the most common voting of the original predecessors can be good. Maybe the producer and maybe the director but certainly not bad when they did this. This whole movie is like making a great DVD of the first 3 movies, but changing characters. BHHAAAAD.
