"They Are Among Us" is a poor science fiction better. Small buttons contain less than this film. The holes of the plot are many. Visitors who somehow came to the world on the meteorology and have been hidden among us for over 100 years, but they need plastic surgery to make them seem to be human. In their guest status they claim to have external bones (that's why they need plastic surgery) but when you see them they have teeth and fingers. The heroine's father "lost" after the closure of the Blue Project, but it was an F-16 attempt. And keep on going. If you want to see an alien invasion film, select "Partial Body Attack", and see how well done.
