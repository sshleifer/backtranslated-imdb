I have never heard of this, and then I saw someone with a deadly lens, which I would like to hear but I did not see. Connery's presence drove me to buy, and not good. It wants to be a kind of cross between Dr Strangelove and Mash, but it's not just an amazing thing, except to get the name of General Wombat (?) Funny. It comes as a thriller of flat 70 to last ten minutes, when it gets life. There are many, many scenes scenes in Whitehouse between the president and his assistants who do not work. It's almost like cutting the first time was very long, and the first half was adjusted to reach the story of the compensation of the nuclear bomb and the suicide bombing, which I think is meant to be played to laugh, but again, not that it is funny . The lottery area is ideal but the label items look like cheap TV. I couldn't trust the person involved with Key Largo, Crossfire and Elmer Gantry. Just laughing: Connery gives us his wig before he keeps his hat and jumping out of the plane. It never says never say again as a cell.
