I couldn't give this film a bad score or a bad review for two reasons: Robin Williams and Toni Collete. The film is likely to be exciting and there are some minor side effects that are dependent on psychology which was something that the film could have been a little less. Robin Williams plays Gabriel Noon, during the night's deejay story that surrounds personal affairs: his loved one goes out and Gabriel has something that looks like a barrier to the story. One day she gets and reads a story written by a 14-year-old boy named Pete Boland (Rory Culkin). Pete tells the story of his life and the abuse he suffered by the hands of his parents. She lives with her mother and social worker, Donna Boland (Toni Collette). Gabriel is interested in starting a friendship with Pete, but things seem strange when Gabriel tries to meet him and finds the possibility that Pete Boland can't even exist. I can't enter in detail because I don't want to destroy the film, but I will tell you this: it's quite possible. An exciting situation for telling stories and good performances from Robin Williams and Toni Collette, who I thought was an important film feature. Collette does not have one question of many talented and more talented artists. His ability to hit into the psyche and the personality of the characters he shows is very clear and I hope to see him win the Oscar (hell, I think he can pull to get a Good Assistant Assistant for this if the script was a little better). The film begins as a psychological thriller, but one to predict it. If you want to know the film and end up, then see the film otherwise I would like to hire another known desire called "Hide and Search".
