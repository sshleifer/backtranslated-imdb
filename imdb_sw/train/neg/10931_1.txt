I went to see this film for low expectations, and make sure it would be a good piece of fluff. Sadly, it was not. I could hardly sit through the film without wanting to walk out. I went with my two children (aged 10 and 13) and even kept asking, "How long?" After the end, I continued to ask who would accept this script. Even the faithful Fred Willard could not save the trite conversation, the joke of the situation, and the banal plot. I would recommend that anyone who wrote and guides this movie (I use a free word) should take a class online writing class or a decline in their university community with a film class. At least, there are many books to guide, write screen, and produce movies that would teach them something about the structure, plot, dialogue and consolidation.
