What did the director think? Everyone who has read the Artemisia biography has been surprised by its guts to deal with the rape case during the Renaissance and even torture to show that Tassi was guilty. The fact shows the freedom and real liberation - at its very horrible hour stands its man. Why the movies showing Renaissance should be so good and romantic clinics, we are afraid to see the side of life or has a Hollywood-happy-happy mood? When I always advocate the freedom of the director to create his own truth in the movie I can make a sense of referring to the life story of Artimisia on his head. A very awesome choice with the creators of this film.
