I would be open. I have used IMDb for years. But today I just went through the trouble of registering on the site, so that we could give this movie the lowest possible possible. I have seen hundreds of films, some of them bad, a few bad. However, I have never seen a difference as pretending and failing, of the highest intention and failure. Mira Sorvino is thrown out like a king, but it is impossible as Phocion, a young boy. Fiona Shaw is always a character of entertainment, but the discussion in the film is even worse, even, than in the sensory French game which is the source (Marivaux has never reached Hollywood so far, and we should put it that way) <br /> < br>> For example, for example, Leontine is a physiotherapist, passionate and scientist, is widely exposed to the chemicals from the beaker for the beaker, looking for the names of famous scientists. And the love between Agis and the king is played even silent. For this, couples should receive a joint award of 'Clair Danes', which in the world of justice will be given to the freedoms of the impressive and unsuspecting youth of impressive youth from the books of the 1990s (see Miss Danes in Les Miserables). <br /> <br /> In addition to pride and talk plot, there are other attempts to set up tropi art in photography. For example, there are times when a few of the viewers are lost and without an act of act, sitting seats, watching the main characters. The director wants us to know that he has changed to play. I get it. But it does not come out until it gets on the film. At the same time, seeing many people who sit in seats for a while, then disappear, is creepy and distracting. They are like some kind of terrible crowd of zombie, visible through mists, filling us with fear. When you see a bad mess and a song that ends this movie, you want to raise your crowd of zombies and kill them all because of the great pain of your brain to 1111 minutes. - Matthew McGuire
