I am absolutely convinced that the best Oscar celebration in recent years was in 2003 for two reasons: <br /> 1) Steve Martin was more cautious: "I saw players have helped Michael Moore in his hole" and "I'm not better to mention." The gay mafia as I wake up the poodle head in my bed "<br /> <br /> 2) The winners of the amazing: No one had Adrien Brody down for the best actor (real clapping) or Russian Polanski for the best director (Real Jeers and boos) but they won the championship last year was not very bad but there was a little bit of surprise and I was glad to see the RETURN of the King cancellation award even though it was not good at trilogy (FELLOWSHIP was better) but what would allow BBC coverage down was Jonathan Ross to find a few of his sycophantic partner round and pretend they were hilarious when they were anything but. So when I heard the Sky were doing the UK TV coverage I was expecting Barry Norman and Mark Kermode to make links, but instead we lived with Jamie Theakston and Sharon Osbourne! Oh gawd if the UK TV is a refusal of film critics (Obviously they are) I'm sure both Bob The Moo and Theo Robertson will be happy to fly to LA to give their opinion of loyalty to the winners and lost. Chris Rock was not very bad, but he is not Steve Martin when the scene has looked like a theater and the seats set! Not much of the glitzy field in my opinion. The main problem I had was the celebration and the "Oscars" that were given to the winners who sat on their seats! There is no such thing as a “little” Oscar and just because the prize is for the best Better Short or Design Costume They are also eligible as Best Picture or Best Director. All winners should be allowed to move to the podium. What is the pride of the Academy's arrogant snobs and I fully agree with the views that this form is embarrassing and if it is not for this surprise it could be the worst event in history. For their own awards <br /> <br /> Best Practitioner - Cate Blanchett. There is no great surprise for the category of competition. There is no real complaint since Freeman is one of the best actors of the US <br /> <br /> Best player - Jamie Foxx. The biggest prize of the night. Yawn <br /> <br /> The best executive - Hilary Swank. A great surprise since everyone thought Annette Benning was going to win just under professional politics but Swank deserved to give a good night speech. A great surprise since everyone thought Scorsese was going to get the reward just because he never won one. I am really excited about this because if you are not eligible for the TAXI Provider, RAGING BULL or GOODFELLAS was not eligible for AVIATOR <br /> New Film - MILLION DOLLAR BABY. Again another great surprise since everyone thought that the academy could distribute the best award to the best director and the best pictures when I thought the Hollywood friendly's THE AVIATOR would make it a dirty seat of the best pictures when the MDB emerging issue turned into a lot of voters away. > <br /> What these awards can show is that this year's voters have decided to ignore Oscar politics and actually give a prize to people who deserve something that they have not done in the past, i mean A DIFFERENT DISTRIBUTION OF RING FOR GING! And for a long time the school could vote with their heads instead of their hearts
