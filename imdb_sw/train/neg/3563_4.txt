Fot great part, this movie feels like a "made for TV" effort. The direction is ham-fisted, acting (except Fred Gwynne) is overwrought with soap. Denise Crosby, in particular, provides his lines as he reads cool on the cue card. The only thing causes this film to consider, and that once Gage returns from "Semetari." There is something confusing about looking at a young child, and this movie can be more than others can handle it just for that reason. It's quite bone-cold. This film makes only one thing, but it explores that one thing is outside the storage. It should only see for the last 10 minutes or so.
