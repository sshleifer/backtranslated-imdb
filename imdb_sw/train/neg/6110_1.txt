Bo is Jane Parker, whose father lost his history (Richard Harris, in the most unfamiliar place of work) is Africa learning something or another. He raises (how) and tells the stories of the inhabitants of the great monster that the night of mourning can be heard in the jungle. He comes back to the Man of Ape himself (Miles O'Keeffe, who has the best conversation of the film), who saves him from bad people and falls in love with him, leaving only a good time in two hours of injury to burst naked when the horny monkey appears and it is good. Normally I have a clear intention for different views about any film, but this is the only one. This is a very bad film made. If you disagree, you haven't seen. (Notes: Newsday called "impossible," which is the best summary of one word I can imagine. Maltin's modern opinion shows that they probably thought less than BOMB.
