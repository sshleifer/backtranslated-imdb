I have come to love the growing growing, with millions of others. So I have thought about this film, thinking if it is not good it can be at least a little and exciting. WRONG! I just need to ask myself, at the end of this, is the Angel of Charlie really pushing? I don't seem to remember as such. But this film, as bad as this kind of movies can be, is a little bit similar to the excitement of that period and show. I saw it all, despite the obstacles, could not be recognized. But it was a very bland, which I missed the artists at all times, especially women who played angels as they looked like. The movie just was not interesting. It tried to make every angel "character". (One angel is a fool, one is a "beautiful girl", one is in her husband ....), all the characters were displayed by one great characteristic clarity and a little more detail of values. The excitement of the show was lost and the dialog was .... dialog. That's very good. It is not bad. It is not the worst movie movies. But it is impossible.
