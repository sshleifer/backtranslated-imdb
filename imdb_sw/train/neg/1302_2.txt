This movie is like every Dutch movie, so if you like to enjoy movies such as fruits and berries of blonde. then you can be equal to this (although the two have the best stories and actors) Zomerhitte begins very strong, but even the same last area lives without any relationship with the story. There is a lot of deception (but I and others could not find this attractive girl), the conversation is laughable (as we did a lot with the pain of other film observers), and some of these events are quite random that this is more than comedy without pretending than nothing anything else (like a random area that a gun blows someone's eye out ... has nothing to do with anything and is mentioned just once in a sentence if "you hear what happened ... I was there"). The only reason I gave 2 is because some places they look good are ... that's it. And the reason I saw it was because we went to the sneak preview (here in Holland we have an amazing system for the sneak preview, you pay a little money then for an ordinary movie and you don't know what film you will watch. All you know is that it's a new movie which has not yet been on the movie). I advise it to stay away from this film, if you want to see a beautiful movie of the Dutch temmink or zwartboek.
