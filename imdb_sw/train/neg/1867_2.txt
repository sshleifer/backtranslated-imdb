Unfortunately, the only spoiler in this review is that nothing to destroy about that movie. Even if B. Mattei has never made any piece of master that he uses to do his work with humor and adultery that made him a happy director of Eurotrash. But for the past 10 years it appeared to be lost. This film is empty, nothing to activate from deep sleep into the first 10 minutes. There is no sex, no blood (thinks about the college?), No characters, no conversation, as bad as the 90'TV film. our forever, for that reason unknown Gems as: Zombi 3, Robowar, Mouse, altro inferno, Virus, Cruel Jaw and a few others. So unless you want to see B Mattei who has a new spirit of Frances's spirit, go over this. We know this good work of a professional to track his old films and have fun.
