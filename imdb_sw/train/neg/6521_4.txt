I probably didn't give this film to shake it right, because I couldn't look at all. Maybe if I would like to see it in the theater, in its original presentation, I could accept it, but it's very slow-moving me. I read the book 25 years ago and the plot details have left the memory. This did not help the film, for it is nothing less and clear and in clear of events. <br /> <br /> This is a four-linked link, or a film in four parts, and it was, I believe, intended to appear on the fourth night in presentation of exhibitions. I saw Part I to be comfortable enough, but that's all I could do to stay in Part II, which comes for a long time. Reading the philosophy of Tolstoy is one thing. If you get a good translation or you can read it in nature, its most brilliant text has been skipping any issues that may have a speedy story. On the film, however, it is difficult to reproduce without worry. I have other issues and parts of the film I saw. It is a very splashy, and a lot of hey-ma-check-at-this-camera cameras that mentions attention to itself, rather than serving to develop stories. Obviously, I have nothing to do, but I was not able to call enthusiasm for part III and IV.
