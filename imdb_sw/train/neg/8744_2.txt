I kind of accident ended watching this movie. I still don't know if I am sad or not. I felt like I was watching a film made by a group of film students who did not cut it. It plays every image of Hollywood visible, while all beat us and 'organizations are the worst messages'. Carefully this film does not know. Apart from that goes, it even manages to provide its own providers. <br /> <br /> Stories seems to be a fantasy world of fantasy of the world ends. Leadership behavior is a fascinating young man and a girl, but it is a programming skill and a visible hacker (I think), among many other fantasy-true things that you will need to feel. Also, I must have been known to be a movie of z when I saw Ned Bellamy ... he was going to be a good tip. <br /> <br /> Can't recommend this one, I'm afraid.
