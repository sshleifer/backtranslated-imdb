I am sure there is some form of IMDB worship that likes movies that MST3K exceeded playing. After seeing all this and "Werewolf" and reading a lot of comments about how they learned, I am sure there is some knowledge here. Many people say that people who hate them are "very scared and", "You don't know a good fear" or things like that. Yes, I don't really care, but I want something happening on the movie! Most of them are just a woman sitting and looking around! Or walk around the house / garden! Modernly requires something to give him a atmosphoere, it is available to have an incredible experience that someone around and looking at. Oh, and "makes you think"? Well, I was thinking "SHA! @ @ $ $ &% !!" One of the worst movie I have ever seen! <br /> <br /> P. For a record, I am a great fan of an ancient style of fear, Dracula, Frankenstein, Such kind of items.
