This 1970 hit film has never been good, but in fact, it was not good when it was released. However, it was a great achievement perhaps because the idea of ​​a little boy's love must be appealing to the audience with a regular TV coverage of the Vietnam War. The program is a clean array as it relates to Oliver Barrett IV, the hockey Harvard's hockey player, who meets with love for Jenny Cavelleri, a Vassar music student who boasts her career history. Her old school father does not accept Jenny, and in the usual act of rebellion, it means that young couples are getting married in one of the hippie moments, uninvited ceremonies. He places his dream job in New York, but gets unexpectedly ill and dies of his last disease. There is a guide to effective techniques of modern films shown by director Arthur Hiller, but nothing can hide the old story, photographed planned. The end of the inevitable left me completely uninhabited. All Ryan O'Neal and Ali MacGraw became stars and this movie as Oliver and Jenny but no doubt because there hasn't been the ability to show the depth or complexity required to make the characters compel. At least O'Neal boyish is sincerely in its weakest way, but MacGraw is a wooden and smirky character which is hard to see what Oliver sees in Jenny over his extravagant façade. John Marley (two years before getting a race in his bed in the "Godfather") is as good as the father of Jenny's father Phil, such as Ray Milland as Barrett's patafamilias seem uncomfortable. Frances Lai's closest music almost becomes parody in itself over the years. The quality of publishing on DVD is good, although the only exception is the guide to the definitions instead of Hiller. The most interesting thing of trivia is that the author Erich Segal (the book on which the book was based on) was born Oliver as a mixture of two Harvard guests? Vice President Al Gore and actor Tommy Lee Jones, who happens to have a little part in the movie as one of Oliver's residents.
