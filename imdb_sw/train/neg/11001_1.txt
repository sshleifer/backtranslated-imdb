I've never seen a comedy which was a lot of work to stay ... not one laughter. Ok, perhaps a little bit to Michael Clarke Duncan a little like a big, black, sexually-sexist. But all the others were very surprised. On that blank of any laughs "skits" go forever! Clear this if you like the value of your time and money. DREADFUL !!! Worse!
