this is a 'comedy' of terrible - it's really a bad film. no interesting things. no jokes are funny. I don't know how other people can claim a short film of this short could be 'smartest' or 'quality.' perhaps if only a film that someone has seen you can make those claims. but, I have seen thousands of the best films: ie leonard six parts (now, that's funny)! I don't know how the brothers are counted worthy to be listed on the web site: more like a home video than a real film. <br /> <br /> joke away, just skip this film. The root can be more interesting that this material is not planned.
