Bill (Buddy Rogers) is sent to New York with his uncle (Richard Tucker) to gain experience before they earn $ 25 million. Her uncle has paid 3 women Jacqui (Kathryn Crawford), Maxine (Josephine Dunn) and Pauline (Carole Lombard) to make sure she does not know the evil of gold. One woman Cleo (Geneva Mitchell) returns to the area by rejecting women. We follow the story as girls are getting more money to appear in the show rather than their chance of escorting to the 3 months that Bill is in New York, while Bill meets Cleo and another woman. At the end, love is available for Bill and another ................. <br /> <br /> The quality of the image and sound quality is poor in this film. Stories are included with music numbers but songs are bad and Kathryn Crawford has a terrible voice. Rogers is not good either. He is good enough but comes only in life when playing drums or trombone. There is a very interesting person who plays a cab driver (Roscoe Karns) and the film is only light.
