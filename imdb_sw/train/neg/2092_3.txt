Basically, "Caprica" ​​is a natural story of Cylon. The show of the show is interesting. However, authors follow many lines of the story and close with many POV characters who give birth to stories. The program passes through the glacial speed to meet the tension you can have. In any given place, little or nothing happens. Daniel Graystone (Eric Stolz) is a military contractor working for a robot soldier using a stolen gun. Unfortunately, his only working example is run by AI's daughter's death in Zoe, who died in suicide bombings caused by One Soldier (STO), a religious minority religious group. At the same time, Joseph Adama (father of Adama Commander "Battlestar Galactica") tries to hold his family together seeking the AI ​​version of his daughter (who also died in bombs) in the Machiavellian version of Caprica (which is very similar to 1930s Chicago). . In addition to wet writing, Caprica finds a similar problem with many natural stories. We know how the last (ie, Cylons promotes their own civilization and rebellion against humanity).
