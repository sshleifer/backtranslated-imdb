What? Have you ever heard a word that people "beat telegraph their purpose?" Well in this film, the act of characters makes more of future telegraph plans - it shows your home drinking and giving you a head over the head. This can be forgiven if the settings were used properly, or if the characters were more charismatic or nuanced. The behavior of Embeth Davidtz is not strange, it is only a wooden, and Kenneth Branagh is successful in sending the charm of his character's character perhaps was written to have. The bottom line: a clear line, a single note, a non-alphabet, and the "South" permits used by British actors.
