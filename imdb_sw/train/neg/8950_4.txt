I've felt on this novel a long time ago, many of my friends have suggested I read. I searched everywhere and finally found it. This is a book that everyone should read, because it is a professional and because of the vision. I enjoyed every page. I knew about the film and I couldn't wait to see it. When I was finally disappointed, many things that were in the book are not on the film (I don't think this is a spoiler) that makes it just a movie not mind ... Michael Radford could be a good director, but a bad writer. Especially as the author of the book. The movie is not quite dark, the text is very bad, the only thing that is good, even big, is acting. John Hurt is an amazing actor and my face alone I could see as Winston Smith. What bothers me most is the people in IMDb who said this "Best Adaptation Forever" without even reading a book! Or know anything about writing screen! You can only understand the beauty of the story by reading the book, do not think this as an alternative. As a fan of the book, I was very disappointed. The words I gave for this film go to acting.
