That this unfavorable apology to show an hour of amateur was revealed in Sundance is a good example of what is not recommended by most modern filmmakers. <br /> <br /> First, there is something like cinema art. Take a 16mm camera and explain it to anyone who has a line does not work for a real movie. I think we should just see the fortune director did not take a camcorder of man ... <br /> <br /> Second, indie films should be on real people. There is no real thing in this film. There is no one who finds that it is even far from man. What they see is the author's idea trying to impress his colleagues by showing them how "cool and edgy" he is sorry, but this is not a good text, or a good guide. What is left is a bad movie stick that somehow made its way to Sundance. It is hard to believe this was one of the best films presented ... <br /> <br /> In any case, it opened me to what was left for my brand Sundance.
