Undefined restructuring, and can not come close to capture the natural charm. Extreme length causes more of its attractive parts. This version is ridiculously political correct. The film is not fashionable, and especially not talented, not just acting, but direction, sets, clothes, etc. are all under par. It has inappropriate neglect for the period. Vanessa Williams is the only member organized who shows any flair, Tyne Daly is not very bad. They should be left very well alone. Beautiful rocky (Vanessa Williams) for the poor (everyone). See the previous version of 1963 and skip this. There is not much here to recommend.
