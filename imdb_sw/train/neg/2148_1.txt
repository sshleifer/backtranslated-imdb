How the merchants can, maybe. I must say that "Cinderella II: The Dream Come True" is one of the worst movies made. First of all, the film was made during the height of the rampage of Disney. It was created around the same time as "Mermaid II," "The Book of Jungle II," and "Peter Pan II," which all had appeared in their original film books. (Disney also made a "Hunchback of Notre Dame II" and "Atlantis II," but I will leave the header because their original movies have never been common in the first place. ") Let me say to me I am faithful to support the film The beautiful Disney, and I like the Disney's original "Cinderella." However, "Cinderella," however, was a waste of time. Cinderella's character in the series was very different from the original girl I was looking at. The new love.inderella had a very short period of time and modern times of time, "I'll make this feast my way!" Let me also tell you a new Cinderella (as I have called for love) says, "Ewww!" That is Cinderella's fight I try to get the best for people, but on the other hand, Anastasia, one of the stepisters, is good! heck? Why? They did all that like Lady Tremaine and Drizella are just a terrible family for the little poor Ania. li to the world: Did the people of Disney look at the original "Cinderella" when doing it? Yes, it certainly doesn't. If I remember correctly, Anastasia was despising Cinderella as Drizella and Lady Tremaine. I am for redemption and forgiveness, but there was no guarantee of redemption for Anastasia in this film. In the first, Anastasia was bad. In the second, she is good. Only one can not leave a story like this. I hope Disney realizes that this film, among other movies, mocks the name of Walt Disney. Maybe now that Michael Eisner has gone, things will begin to form around the Mouse House.
