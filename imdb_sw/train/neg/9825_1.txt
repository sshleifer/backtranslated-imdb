This movie seems to send inappropriate messages. There may be values ​​without using Christ. Other religions, I believe, can go to heaven. I am a Catholic who goes to church every week, but I disagree with that Christian pride. This is the worst movie of travel that I have ever seen and I have seen Time of Time.
