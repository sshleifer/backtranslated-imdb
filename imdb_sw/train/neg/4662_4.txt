Writers probably did not have the skills in the army, and probably never looked at the history book, but I still give them this film of affordable credit to take a long look at the role of black soldiers in the second world war. </> <br /> The action is confused and unreliable - any part of the fight! has excellent production standards, but the cast is interesting. Seeing Rosie's New York Rosie Greer was worth the buck I paid for this. The orientation of the art is the fifth - men wear Korean Korean uniforms, and it was a very good climate when the US Army reached Germany in 1944, not the sun as they show here, and I don't think the land is like northern California. The document does not make it clear why black soldiers are used as anti-soldier soldiers. There is a good touch that shows some men taking guns of Springfield instead of M-1, which the second level of soldiers would probably have been released. <br /> <br /> This concept of basic story (south south official orders a black soldier) should be extended to the massive production back, and not too late to try it now. You need to take this why, and I praise the creators of this film by making an effort. I remember seeing this time and thinking it was installed in Italy, which would have made more sense because there were black soldiers working in 1944.
