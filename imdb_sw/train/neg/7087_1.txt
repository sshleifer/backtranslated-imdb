I can't usually write a comment on the line, but this is the worst movie I've ever seen. Not only has it been done as a series of samples (“Young and Uncomfortable” takes place in fact by experts compared to this), but it also has a reduction in scary. It has no action. It's full of impurities. Here is an example: the boy wants to kill the main character if he was shot for it. So (after the luggage loads) here is: the man puts a knife in his throat and says something like "You are now dead". Then the main character says: "If you kill me you are dead, I have told you police you are afraid of me". So the boy (killer) goes like (just on the right): "Oh no ... fighters follow me!! Oh ... my God". <br /> <br /> Note: this is just an example. I can't really believe that this film will be copied. So: If you want to see the movie WORST ever… go ahead, I recommend it :)
