No use in trying to pronounce any part of this film. It was the same on the trash. At first you might think that you are on a piece of an amazing photo show ... and later shortly after you are faced with a big sack of FAIL! The fighting has never been a military, acting is a moving edge of the par, and the music is not good to describe. There is only enough of the story that has created this exemption to be made. The decisions that participants make and how they use the situation are weak, and they had nothing but trouble me. I think the only reason for this film that came was to act as a fan service using Yumiko Shaku.
