Poor Whoopi Goldberg. Think of him at a dinner party, and he adds comments to a deep political discussion. People just look at him and say, "Oh, what would you know, was a star of Theodore Rex". How can a person take him seriously after descending himself to the star of that terrible piece? Even young children would be scared in this fear. It reminded me of the worst part of 'Sigmund and the Sea Monsters'. True, coming to think about it, 'Sigmund' was much bigger than this. <br /> <br /> And yet it was released? By ringing the producer for illegal substances before telling him about it? Look at this disgusting thing for your own risk.
