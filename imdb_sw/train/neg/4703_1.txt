"Show me your boobies!" not funny, and certainly not in the center showing cartoons if you understand when I came out. I don't want my girls aged 6 and 7 to think of it or hear it. I feel sad that Nick thought this trick and then what we get, stupid kids who act like ignorant adults. I know it means to be concerned but think we are out there who have little innocent K and first class who can't wait to see this. I had to comment on how discouraged I was when I saw it. My daughters will not look at it. I would like to stop Nick but not encouraged at this point but if Nick keeps putting out this kind of fraud I will need.
