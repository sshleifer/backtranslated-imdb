If there is more bad comedy than 'Gray Matters' I don't know. The "funny" cluster of the New York Jews is that the brothers with Sam and Gray are mistaken for a couple and so decide to fix Sam and the girl, just find that Gray is the same as their goal - Charlie. The revelation that Gray is the gay gay is only apparent to him. There is a very exciting wedding sequence, good performance of 'drinking' from Moynahan and Graham, and the performance that will make them ashamed of the forest everywhere for wood from Tom Cavanagh. Sissy Spacek shows that it is quite impossible to do the comedy and he wants this excised from his resume. Molly Shannon has a good friend and worries of lumpen. Alan Cumming only appears with any loan but is very independent and has not been given anything to work. The whole tragedy has been reinforced by the amazing Graham's eyes to the final spot that is wearing a comedy cap and overcoat despite the place placed on the lesbian bar. It is interesting that this film was never released with no redemption feature and should be avoided at all costs.
