The background of this movie is revealed in the DVD box. Clothing workers build a miracle cloth that does not exceed. But the movie fails to continue with it. Instead it carries for 45 minutes, walking around with an introduction before making a great discovery. Since viewers are not very good at seeing a new baby describing things out, it's a wonderful option: the movie has been banned from any topic. Once the fabric is discovered, the movie also establishes quickly that both the major industry, and the blue-collar workers want to be invented, leaving the movie with just two flimsy movements; focus on the chemical, and run from the victim. I can't understand why anyone can describe this as a comedy. Sound is not exciting or interesting. It is more like a greater social resistance of the day: that ethnicity strikes the supply and production. Which prevents innovation from reaching and improving the world. Yes, maybe that's true, but without giving birth to the same reality, the movie is just the argument of zeal. You will need a detailed description of the comedy to find someone here. <br /> <br /> This is like Britain Meet John Doe (Meet Nigel Doe?).
