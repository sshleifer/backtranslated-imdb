Wow ... what would you do with $ 33m? I would like to give you an option; you can either) wipe and wipe it under the toilet or b) make a film according to the Whoopi Goldberg Cluster as a tough green officer interacting with a dinosaur ball who uses words like "I did not make a trumpet" and beat raspberries on the basis that this is funny. That is true, you would prefer the option that has more features - pushing down the toilet. <br /> <br /> This seems reliable. I can't even find words to describe that this film is bad. It is not even desirable in "bad type - it's good". I really have on television if I write - and when I looked I felt the need to come to IMDb and register my hatred. Considering Jurassic Park was made a few years before, how on earth do you think the audience could tolerate someone wearing a rubber suit? WG should be just walking and damaging the results. Everyone involved will go to hell for this crime. <br /> <br /> I quit writing - I'll ever ask.
