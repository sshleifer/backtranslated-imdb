"Incubus" is a mixture of good (hidden killings), the worst (the cut script, the irreversible solution, the bad events of the attack) and weird (intontuous overtones, a wonderful sleep and sleep with John Cassavetes - What a character meant be "wacko"?). Not nearly as irritating as it seems to be, but it's not particularly successful, either. (* 1/2)
