When I mention Malice as a film noir I do not likening to masterpieces such as Sunset Boulevard, Double Indemnity or Maltese Falcon, nor do I compare Becker director to Alfred Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick, Stanley Kramer or Luis Bu√±uel. I am just registering a protest against the darkness that pervades this film from beginning to end, so much that just over time can not do what is going on. I can't understand the darkness in the night scenes but this film was dark even in broad daylight, because what is in loss to understand. As it was, however, it would not have made a big difference if Becker's director was filmed in total darkness.
