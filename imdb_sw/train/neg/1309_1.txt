This movie was very bad. It should be less than 15 minutes. Pictures of the baby and the slaughtered animals were small. I usually do not write a comment but this was very bad for having a good and very positive view. I think in this case we are one step closer to an honest assessment of this head. <br /> <br /> What more can I say? I slept during this film 3 times. It was 4 hours after I wake up from 8 hours long to sleep. I think it's the point itself. There is no conversation between characters except maybe 2 sentences at the end of the end. <br /> <br /> When you fall asleep immediately do not try to rewind and catch up because you will sleep again.
