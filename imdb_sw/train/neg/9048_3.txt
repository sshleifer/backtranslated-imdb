It was originally originated as the ABC's Weekly Movie. This involves two innocent female students who are taken to a prison camp in the small town of South. They are not allowed to make calls and no one knows that they are there. The following is rape, torture, beatings, humiliation and destruction caused by a very disturbing conclusion. The TV version was (expired) bad. No weaknesses and beatings were very good but the general sense of fur lazy was wearing down. An unnecessary version is worse - there is a lot of deception, violence is very serious, and in one disgusting chain, we see a female prisoner who has been forced to fish when the "lesbian" woman uses her. YUCK! There is nothing wrong with exploitation movies but this only goes over the edge. You get the impression that filmmakers are happy to have these poor women who are being abused and destroyed - all of which have been hit on your face if you should enjoy it. Unwanted damages cannot help. <br /> <br /> I offer 3 because acting is good - but it really makes a hard film to watch. Patient film, evil. Not recommended.
