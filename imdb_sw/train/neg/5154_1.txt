this is the only movie I've ever walked. The evil practices - the worst plot - to throw the evil - to lead the evil - the worst movies - if they had decided to make a bad picture they could not do better work. I hope they are proud of his turkey. I was surprised anyone who was associated with this film was once again employed on hollywood. don't waste your time!
