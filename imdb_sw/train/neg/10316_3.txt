Be honest when I first heard this show though it may be a bad idea to make a show that makes Muslims use the joke of color on their own but it's the opposite opposite. I found that demonstrating it could help people understand that if Muslims use a word like this in real life it doesn't mean it is a terrorist thing. It also shows how people give the Muslims a bad name because they play in their opinion, looking at ordinary people show that even though there are bad Muslims out there does not mean that we are all bad we just try to live 1 day at a time, as it was difficult for Amair to find flights and how he said such words as “Raising” or Yaser saying we push competition, and people took the wrong way. Since it is a Muslim I know that such things are not common, but they do and many people think bad things about Muslims or Afghanistan or Iraq, its things are not correct like that. people will see how we are doing well by looking at this show and can make them think about how this action. I am glad to show if this came on the air. There are many that show that the Muslims of Piotr as terrorists, many people feel that it is good for my opioion is right to do so often because prety everything is worried about who we said you can't be surprised at, but it happens often and in fact gives the Muslims a bad name.
