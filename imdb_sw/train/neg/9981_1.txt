This movie was released as a comedy and a mystery. It is completely impossible for both. The only secret here is why a person will make the movie not built properly. The only comedy is a laugh I got when I saw how readers here put it here. Can you have two movies with the same name? The movie saw a star girl with beautiful blue eyes and a plot that was not there. <br /> <br />
