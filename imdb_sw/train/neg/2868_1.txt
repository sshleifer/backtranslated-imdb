In fact this is insulting to the victims and their families of the BTK killer. Events in this film are not suitable next to the truth. Why could they not make a film of real events without any meaning since the real events are more interesting then this is made farce. Don't waste your time looking at this for free. The low budget and the embarrassment of the events that should not be made the dragon, which is actually this film did. If they could let me give -10 on this film I would like. Acting is seen as being hit on an old VHS camera from 80 years. Save your time and money by watching this film.
