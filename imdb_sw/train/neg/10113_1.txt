I have found that this film is based on installation. The zombie in front of the DVD looks cool and scary. then you get to the film and are women with masks of raccoon. zero special effects ... and even the fight scenes you can see they miss punches and feet 2. The amazing thing is that Lommel works in the film briefly and is worse than other film actors. The only thing I can think is that Lommel is just trying to make such a bad film that people call it a "ethnic worship" ... however, I can't think anyone thinks it is anything but one worse movie made. The real fear in this film is very bad. I am ashamed to hire and interested in never seeing another film Lommel again!
