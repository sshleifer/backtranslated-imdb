When a good director / mixer of the actors is talked about J. Lee Thompson's team and Charles Bronson is not often mentioned. Probably because the output of nine of the two of them runs the gamut from a very good act of entertainment. Unfortunately Kinjite: Legal Subjects are in the end. <br /> <br /> That's sad because Kinjite can be better. But for my life I do not understand why it was necessary to make the father of the missing girl Japanese, the guy had to get the cheap jollies because the romance in his marriage has ended. That may be good for any other film, but it has not served the purpose here. Direct cops with Charles Bronson as a comrade who looks very limited in his work line and has a strong hatred against guidelines. This section can also be used a little to describe as well. But he will have to win it if he and his girlfriend Perry Lopez will go to find a Japanese school girl captured. During Bronson's squad he has told him where to find the child. A stylish player, killed by Jaime Fernandez is a husband and he and Bronson have history. In fact, in the best film area, Bronson made him look at the cost of the rolex and put his car on fire. At one time Fernandez takes place at Bronson's spot and Lopez all night of lunch and this is after his rolex hat, hits the place with a kill to kill everyone, but Bronson and Lopez. In fact I think the small event will have more than two fighters from LAPD after Fernandez. But that's another great hole in the plot. There is still a very bad right at Fernandez's end. I would like the whole film was better yet. This was the last film of Bronson-Thompson's team and the end of J. Lee Thompson as director. He should leave with something better.
