The only thing about this film is the shot of Goldie Hawn standing in his French bed of a bikini cutting and trying to keep several other lost women from removing his cotton wool when he was knocking down. Ooooof! Her waist protests against Nina Hartley's opponents. This movie came out when I had fourteen and the shot almost killed me. I had forgotten about all that went away from the naughty Roladex of my thoughts until I saw another day on the TV, where they really closed its midsection in the area, a good sad, reminding me of a smokin 'hottie woman's Goldie Hawn was in' 80 years'. Kurt Russell must have a fun life.
