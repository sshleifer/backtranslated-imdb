I am a 11 farmer in my high school. In my current class of world affairs kid kid in my class had this video and suggested we look at it. So we did. I really believe that we went a month, that my father works for NASA. Although I think this movie is a large piece of skin that I have ever watched, the boy that has created it has many balls. First of all he had to show JFK to get a shot? And how he can use all biblical use. The only good thing about this movie is enhances the debate, which is good b / c in my class we have weekly discussions. This movie did nothing to change my mind. I think he and Michael Moore should work together and do another film. Michael Moore next movie can be called "A Thing Thing was held on the 11th" or "Something Funny happened in the way of white house".
