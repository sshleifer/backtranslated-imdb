Modern real, indeed, except for the fact that the characters do not seem to be afraid. When Billy Zane tries to kill someone, he feels bad ... but he doesn't look. That's why I don't like his performance in this film. Tom Berenger is playing again. There is no good exciting, realistic guide. It's not always a shot, that's one great thing. Well done. I hate a helicopter chain, just because the terrorist kills almost a whole sea ... I give it ** and half out of *****
