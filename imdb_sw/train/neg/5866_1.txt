I remember this film when I was 13 years old (apparently many comments say the same AGE 13!) And a group of school partners. We all wanted to see Billy Crystal in his first movie, and we fell to commercial advertising usually telling us this was a great comedy. We got trouble for about 45 minutes, and all agreed to leave the theater. It was so interesting and empty, and a great cry from Billy Crystal's power had to make us laugh, we didn't laugh. I refused on this review by accident, and I decided to register to tell others of the world what the waste of this film was, now this lease, you deserve what you get, you've been warning!
