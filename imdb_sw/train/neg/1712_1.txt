If Todd Sheet had to happen and admitted that this film was intended to eliminate the kind of zombie, I would change my score to eight. Try to reflect the movie where each location, line, and even every performance enthusiasm was created to be a creature. I could spread the alphabet soup, rearrange what was left of the letter, and still have the best script. Two events especially come to mind when I think of this movie. BACKGROUND! One is when Mike's father and other dad walk, I am walking down the stair jam filled with zombies. This is a small staircase and even though they are running against the undead that caused it, nothing happens to them. When they reach the end, the former sea turns, says "God is a horny bastard", and only one. Others are in the military complex. The girl hits a zombie with a machete and once surrounded. Cameras surround him for forty seconds, while surrounded by zombies at hand length. He almost goes out of the crowd and joins other people. A PATER TOWER! These displays should be considered reliable. Still, I enjoy this film as well as any comedy because it's very funny. Kudos to Todd Wallpaper find many people in his movie and have a car to do but not really for anything else.
