Given that many horror movies take into account that one or more of the midfielders do something stupid during the trial, girls in this film will collect Gold, Silver and Bronze at the Darwin Awards Olympic ceremony. The psychiatric basin has made the choice better than they did, and they could shout loudly when doing so. If you like films and grainy pictures, the work of cameras deliberately (my 92 year-old grandmother uses a good camcorder with good results), very bad and unintentional plot / details, then this is your best film . Also remember that you should enjoy the following: women shouting because, women shout for no reason. In fact the reason and logic are not very visible in this film. For example: "We should get Stephanie" "I can't believe I was talking to him, if, last night" "he called last night?" "Yes, he wanted to talk about a certain date asked" "WHAT?" As is the case, our friend is chased by a feminist and shot with grisly weapons but I have a problem with the fact that he did not tell me he keeps date. Well, so the budget is low. That doesn't mean you should make it look like half a budget. 'Alama' is interesting as it all - except for one song written and made by the authors / directors of the film itself. In fact it will appear that the entire budget has been hit by sample tracking and Duskfall, the metal band of death from Sweden. The worst thing in all the films is the end that leaves us with the possibility for good.
