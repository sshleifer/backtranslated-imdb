Success has a tendency to be greedy, and the best loan I can offer is that you continue to be an old tradition. These three stories are not the same as any from the original Creepshow. For the best of the trio it involves a wooden statue that comes to life to take revenge for the killers that killed its owners. The second story is about the monster of the lake which appears to be no more than a floating slop, makes you wonder how anyone can be afraid of it. The third story includes a cameo from Stephen King as a truck driver, but more than that is a very unpredictable story about a road accident victim who is raised from a dead person to a conqueror. <br /> <br>> See original Creepshow instead, or if you have already done then have fun with it.
