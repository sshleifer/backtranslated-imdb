I discovered this movie and seller to sell OOP's. And this is certainly a OOP. One year after The Exorcist came back to business with this movie but what we all new was that Blair's work never broke, she never became a mega star. That is one of the many reasons for its films are OOP. He gives good performance in this film. It is against the denial of his parents and they have no friends. He played at the age of 15 playing a 14-year-old girl, that's funny. The movie is also known for the area of ​​rape in the rain were their broomstick stick up her virginity. In many versions are cut, why, I don't know, no blood is shared, okay, Blair is naked naked but nothing is displayed, no T&A so nothing to prosecute people. But the movie is slow, very slow. It is not unusual for me but I almost slept. It is about 14 years old that rebel against the community but no blood flow, no no nothing. Why this installed in fear is still amazing to me. If you are a fan of Blair, buy it if you can find it otherwise leave it as it is.
