I admit that on His Resurrection Body really was not as bad as I expected, my mother wanted to see it, so I used it. I just thought to go ahead and see the fear before my eyes, but in fact this was not so bad. I was expecting this horrible film, but it seems like the authors had no side effects, but made by Eva Longoria (Parker, sorry), seemed to be a little farther to keep the movie. I think I would see that it was better without him, just he irritates me. But Paul Rudd and Lake Bell had a decent chemistry that made the film suitable. But you have to admit, there was no guarantee for this film, it was one of the fastest payment for the type of actor. The movie can be funnier if someone was really paying attention to and had the best cast. Try to lose his grandmother, Kate, who was killed by ice sculpture on their wedding day. But when her sister takes her to an intelligent person, Ashley, she falls for him, but Kate hates to get out of the grave. Kate is jealous and does not want Henry to keep up fast and he will make sure that Ashley does not recognize him by disturbing his day and night by shouting, believing me, and Kate's voice, which scares. <br /> <br /> Over His Body Body is a good movie, without sure if it's worth the money, but I'd like to give you a tax if you want to see it or want it. Eva Longoria have not enough ability to star in order to work on film, no fault for those who love her, she is just on a small screens on the cash screens. Not to mention Ashley's character, she still seems to be very uncomfortable with everything she takes, or her "gay" friend, Dan, again, does not like much. Just by rewriting and looking well, this film would be better, but instead we get a romantic comedy to predict which will go away with an empty feeling.
