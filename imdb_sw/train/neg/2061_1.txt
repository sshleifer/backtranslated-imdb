The only movie I ever walked. Surprisingly, since I paid myself with my date and I have cheaper. But my brain could not stand more than a hit player, especially because I could write funnier equipment when fasting and touching. From the beginning to the end this film is offensive. Worse, not funny. It was not funny then, and certainly not funny now. But even more, it is that this film represents the beginning of the last comedy, very smart. It is a newborn, a sophomoric script and thought began when (which continues to this day) where there is cheap, and sex feelings dominate the comedy culture in the film. <br /> <br /> Sexual Olympics? Is the High School School that the child has not thought about? The beginning of the end.
