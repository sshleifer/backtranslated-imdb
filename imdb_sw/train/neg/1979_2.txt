Hmm, Hip Hop music in the West. Modern phrases like "cool" and many others to track. "Sistahs are in the house"! French selected nails on hard girls riding. Microphone paper is visible on the back of Li'l Kim. I can not just continue with the litany of mistakes made by the director and editors. <br /> <br /> Work is not as bad as I have ever seen. Women did well with the bad script. It was hearing hearing Louis Mandylor talking about natural emphasis. <br /> <br /> Girls are beautiful. The fabulous dress at least quite incorrect. I can only believe that they could throw him down which could be a good story. I would feel guilty to believe that this film was caused by such actions that would play well in the inner city. <br /> <br />
