This action of playing for classic Anthony Shaffer did not last long in the cinema. Recently after being tortured through the cable, I still thank you for not losing money on tickets. Director Kenneth Branagh, author Harold Pinter, and star / producer Jude Law are deceiving themselves that their honor alone can develop this trap through the interminable 93 minutes, unhappy with the previous class again. <br /> <br /> Michael Caine reinforces his reputation to play the second leadership in the 1972 amazing film. He now seems eager to destroy them by trying to shoot, played in the edition by Laurence Olivier. (All were nominated for the Best Actor Oscars, but they were defeated by Marlon Brando in Godfather.) By looking at the puffy and washing from, Caine glides through part to the bottom depth of she displays as a Batman's butler. He had come down to the appearance of visitors in a furious remake of GET CARTER. What is next - ALFIE II, or THE SON OF GOD IS THE KING? But then, no one benefits from this adoption by Pinter, who thinks that the frequent curses and excesses of sex can pay compensation in the absence of Shaffer characters. Branagh's direction relies on the blue and soulless lighting model which would not hold up at the second level nightclub. Neither shadows do not tight, overacted close-ups can help Law win its dull screen persona. Make it all fail as a direct drama and as a terrible detective, close to make you forget the purpose behind the title. <br /> <br /> The original fan production stage (by Anthony Quayle and Keith Baxter) and Olivier / Film of Caine would be good to do this business as a bad dream. The player Shaffer, who wrote the 1972 screenplay, with Hitchcock's FRENZY and several changes to Agatha Christie, must have his grave buried, if he can arrange a real or two massacre!
