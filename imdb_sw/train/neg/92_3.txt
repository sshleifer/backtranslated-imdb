True, I don't believe I have spent $ 5 on this film. I am a big fan of zombie and I think the movie can't be bad. Was the zombies in it right? I am wrong! To be honest film that had time ... I thought it was cool when the boy had his head but that was about him. In general I think that it would be easy to enjoy the slide of razorblade on my empty nutsack into a bowl of vinegar and then see this film again. The movie can be better if we can see the boob but I was looking at trailers for other movies produced by this company to see it. Buyer beware ... unless you are on the eyeschism.
