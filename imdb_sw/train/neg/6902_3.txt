Despite the review of this rave flick has found New Zealand, any hype around the production is sad is not recommended. In addition to the plot of clichés only, the movie is permitted by acting weak, accents, and lack of tension in general. If it looks to a large budget (for NZ), feel it is a village village in Kiwi ... <br /> <br /> Is there anyone who has never seen Brothers? (http://imdb.com/title/tt0250274/) Those who will take the same comparison ... I've heard comments that events like boys playing basketball etc. were shot at clichéd "boys are talking crap", but it comes as it has ... I believe Oscar Keightley considers himself to be angry, but again his offer is always seen no matter whether he has a personal knowledge. Those who have any doubts left to all of the Samoan-living-in-NZ culture have been deeply, without hope, affected by American speech, culture, and everything in the middle certainly have their own ideas made at the end of this movie. <br /> <br /> Robbie magasi always looks good on the screen, but it is allowed by the script. It always avoids the bad way when the "comedy" has a set of events that are so obvious, you're left to feel like having fun in the punchline clichéd - see you want to be a white boy ... <br /> < br>> I know a person who got this hobby and hilarious - however, that person has a minded mind, and he will have a bid to mention his name if he is given a million dollars. describes the ideas of this flick, OK but not good, not fun but not funny .... Wake up NZ - this is not a 5 star movie despite all of the penetration (middle class white guilty ?:-)) review .... <br> /> <br /> My advice? if you look, drink first!
