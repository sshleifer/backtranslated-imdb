"Gone With the Wind" is one of the most movies of history. It is a favorite movie of a mother, grandmother, and prisoners who are going to the cinema once every five years. Like a zombie movie, it is easy. There is no body to move forward, and it's a great light in the department of the year. "Zombie 3", on the other hand, is great on walking bodies and generously and shed his blood - therefore, better than "Gone With Wind". Also not included. Many viewers are subject to any fraud that is trash. However, it is not tricky. After terrorism robs the virus, he gives us when followed by a helicopter, and the chemical leaks inside. The terrorist, who is known for the bad concoction, hides in the hotel room where he slowly dies in the meat-eating zombie. One of her first victims is a cleaning woman. Once right, the hell of Lucio Fulci breaks down. As usual for Flick Flick, acting is angry, the storyline is filled with holes holes, and Gore is a lot. It is officially released by Fulci and Bruno Mattei, so it describes its schizophrenic nature. Written badly, too, should not be well, and the sound structure is flat. Still, it has been saved and their best consideration for the killings of the truck and its failure for patience. Certainly worth collecting if you are perfect undead. Or do not like "Gone With the Wind", of course it's a bad zombie movie at all.
