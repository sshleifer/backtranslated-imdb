Judging from this film by MAN MANU, we did the same year, I will not keep Harry Langdon on the list of screenshots screen. There's just not enough there. Perhaps he was going to develop his style but he isolated himself by taking his first great efficiency. In any case, all of his techniques are to remind many of the most beautiful people, but he does not know Keaton's knowledge of Lloyd's great knowledge. It also undermines himself to wear and walk as a character of Chaplin's tramp. His reference is the evil of the children, with the courage of the technique and the tendency to cope with the tragedy by looking at it with surprise, beating his eyes or touching his bearded lips with the tip of the first man. Comedy in the cinema of Langdon happens finally throw various obstacles in its path in which he tries to win through wimpy or na√Øve or at a minimum physical level, as cast stones in the hurricane is about to drive, and strengthen the collapse of the building with two and four rocks or dodging to lift the foot to be under it. In this story, about the son of a shoemaker who joins the crossing country to express the company's opponent's shoes, he can win with good luck. There is nothing here that hasn't been done better with Big Three.
