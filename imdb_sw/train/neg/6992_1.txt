The program is about a female nurse, named Anna, is given in the middle of the chaos in the world as the zombies-eating meat begin to rise and take the world and attack life. He runs to the street and is saved by a black police officer. So far, it's good! I often enjoy horror movies, but this piece of film is not supposed to be scared. It's not even exciting, just ridiculous. There the "Flintstones" or "Eat, Fran and Ollie" will give you more excitement. It is like looking at a group of people who are not able to get into the shops and shops. Heroes who have locked in, inside the shopping mall to avoid being eaten by outdoor hoodlums, not better either. Although they do not seem to be heard, they give the impression of being mentally disabled. Save your money instead of using it!
