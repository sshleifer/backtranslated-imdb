If you have dear actors, Peter Falk, Rip Torn, George Segal, and Bill Cobbs, you don't need Billy Burke, Coolio, or other obstacles. Great talent loses completely "Three days to Vegas", and blamed fall on the script. Neighboring neighboring movies are as interesting as this unveiled road. If you want to see how to use an old striker with a good script, see "Anime". Certainly there are no issues of redemption here, and look at these wonderful actors involved with the material as well as crime. I wanted to love it, but an unknown script hits the audience, giving them unemployed participants. - MERK
