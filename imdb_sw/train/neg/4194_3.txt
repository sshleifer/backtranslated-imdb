This film began to be very promising and a story about a director who lost his eyes and a blind woman who was bound to help him. However, somewhere in the middle seemed like the script did not know where to go. One incomparable event followed next (Russia should be very small because all of them are always on each other), the influence of female leadership behavior is understandable (why still following her after leaving the ship? does not attempt to borrow a mobile phone on a ship to call someone?), side stories were quite worried (it was a story with a mother and partner they had to be funny? And what was the story with a little sister about?). Still with all this seems to be a legitimate plot, the movie has managed to predict exactly. The sad thing about it is that it is very likely. As I said, the idea of ​​the film was good, pictures and symbols were very good and the actors of the main characters were good, too. So this could be a very good film ... but it wasn't.
