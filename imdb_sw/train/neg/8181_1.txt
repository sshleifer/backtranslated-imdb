I went to see this film (I actually went to see family photographs, which were to cut Moments + 2 short Douglas Buck concerts at Mar del Plata (Argentina) concert ... I had to cover my eyes after the 1st half of Cutting Moments and take a peek every time in time. When it was over, my stomach had decreased and I felt light led. I just had to leave the cinema after a few minutes after a short start (BTW, of course not only I left the room). It was aAAAAY also violent and disgusting to me! I am attracted by many brave people who really liked it. I don't get just how you can love that kind of movies! Exciting and bloody pictures that I saw were standing on the head for two days! I also try to analyze the story (my partner saw the whole thing and told me about it) and I think that it makes any sense. I mean, that amount of violence and things, makes no more sense than trying to scare people. And that's not good enough, I think. There is absolutely nothing in this film that I can say "Well, at least" x 'thing about it was good ". But well, I think I won't understand that kind of film.
