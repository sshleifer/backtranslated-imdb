This movie should not be viewed unless you are trying to commit suicide. I think this movie can cause serious brain damage. The main characters are red not the hero Kevin, Amy, his brutal, the proud and cheerful lover, Kyle, gold in the short red enjoyable sex, Daphne, the little girl who should be "cool" and has no sense of how to wear, and the partner his foreign, Nick, who employs an army who can make any sense. No, not the offender, that's really how the film goes. The film itself is a further deficiency of Glemlins's 1986, you will not be able to get Gizmo information anywhere. No, these Hobgoblins, made by Wimpy Man (Sorry, Kevin), make the dreams of the worst person real, and then kill the victims. Yes, you did - Finally, you take it to the player's club, where Amy's great dream has been revealed - She wants to be a pastor! Look, I watched this flick through MST3K, and even with Mike Nelson, Tom Servo, and Crow T. Robot are doing laughter-stock out of this fall of the road and still makes me bleed from all eyes. Not true, but I wish I had. I did not give you any more conspiracy, because volunteers give me a great desire to drive a hole through my brain. Besides, there is no mention of the value of the plot. They should put an Awareness Surgery on this film.
