This is a bad movie. Not one of the worst evil either. This is one of the worst. In fact it was a painful look. The direction was sharp, and flying around with green and yellow hues used in the movie makes the characters look like a patient. Keira Knightly did not influence as a very tough chick, and I don't believe Lucy Liu and Mickey Rourke signed on this criminal celluloid. The script was awesome and acting as a fingerprint on the board. If you haven't seen it, don't. You have nothing and you will spend two hours of your life watching this window .I have seen bad movies before and even enjoying them because of their mistakes. This is just a waste of time.
