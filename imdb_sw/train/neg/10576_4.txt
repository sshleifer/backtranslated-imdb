I was very excited when this series was released in 2005. The cluster was very simple and interesting: each part would be a one-hour cinema directed by the famous, good-looking director. Then, when I looked at them, it was a little stop. Some good events have emerged from the first season, but all in all was a mixed package. I included it in an attempt to learn, and I thought that the 2nd season would be even better. <br /> <br /> Boy, I was in shock. For one season he had a few good stories here and there. The 2nd season (without the exception of "Black Cat" at Jeffrey Combs's best) was a complete and total loss to me. Period "Sound As" can be the worst thing I have watched on TV over the last 10 years, and over other periods are not better. I believe that the 3rd season would fall this year next year, but I do not live with my breath.
