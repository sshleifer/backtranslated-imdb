Yes, I am not even pleased with this film for its devotional values. It is a B-movie action-flick, and the director of "Commando", which is also too blind and silly to focus on the beautiful B movie and the value of adequate entertainment in it. '' 90 '', but especially the movie should remind the movie's' 80's action, while this type of B movies was all-time. These films have gone up and are not widely available stories or actions. It was all about hitting the top objects, the great muscles of the muscles and the bullets shooting. This movie has all the links in it but I still did not like to watch this film as I would like to watch some movies. It can't say why, in fact the story and act and that is just as bad as it was for any other original movie from the same time. <br /> <br /> Maybe because the movie is often far too silly. All types of movies are short but the film is full. Fighting, Dolph Lundgren ran around with the shirtless, characters, stories. It is not very good because it is often very lame in words. Story sometimes does not even try to make a little sense and what is even the line of the whole movie? His story is about a real place and looks just written in order to create a movie out with the order of fighting, guns and guns. And this series is not very good to see. It is a very short and sad way to look at the truth, from someone who brought us "Commando". <br /> <br /> Nio first Dolph Lundgren, where he gets to play a great star of hero, who kicks the butt and easily looks relative, knows how to handle guns and other weapons and of course also gets a girl, played by Tia Carrere. This also brings us one of the worst sequences in the history of the action film and also one of the worst sequence of sex I saw in any film. They are all very lame with words and are used very well. <br /> <br /> No characters work really. Good men are cops but they don't seem to be like one. They kill almost without the responsibility of anyone and do not wish to be arrested, or to tell anyone about their discoveries. Even when they get a great deal of Japanese crime, she tries to take the streets of L.A. and beer is working as a drug addict and a massive drug addiction. And also think about for a moment, what is the goal of Brandon Lee in the movie? The film can be done easily without him and the girl too. <br /> <br /> To a large extent, blind and simple and not suitable for entertainment. <br /> <br /> 4/10
