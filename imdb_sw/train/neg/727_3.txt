I am so surprised that a good director like Chuck Jones began to do some of the most awesome cartoons I've ever seen. I did not laugh once in this short, and it's a cartoon bugs bunny, for Christ! Cartoon Bugs Bunny is always funny, not boring! Alas, this short turns into Good Night Elmer (another short of Yon Jones) with the addition of Bugs Bunny. <br /> <br /> The first warning of the red cartoon is always no gag benefit. Good Night Elmer was boring because it was designed for ever two and predictable benefits. This cartoon, on the other hand, faces a second sign of the red cartoon: there are many conversations. Cartoon has at least two gags up its sleeve, but most of them seem more than they are due to a great padding of conversation. At one time, Elmer has finished eating dinner, and the opinion, "That was a very good conversation of the debate," the possibility of further discussion that I have ever heard in the cartoon (characters read aloud in the future when Woody Woodpecker cartoons do not fit into my book ). Although this cartoon is only 8 minutes, it feels like 20 thanks to this interesting conversation. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <3 /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> The Elmer's Rabbit was not a fun cartoon for me, Jones and could not realize that he described a few clunkers during his career, you can enjoy it.
