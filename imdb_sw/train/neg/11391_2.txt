When I started watching this film I was looking for some sort of tricks but it soon began that this film was really about people on the train. The interaction between people is like those who can see any day on the street and sometimes there is a more interesting situation that the dialogue has been hit by itself. It's not that I don't know how this film tries to show how people interact, it's just that the film is very boring. If you want to see and analyze these types of relationships you would be better off to go and buy train tickets and watch people on the train with you. It is true but you may go to the film to see the film about you sitting there watching the film.
