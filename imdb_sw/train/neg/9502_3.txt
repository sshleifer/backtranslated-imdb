This movie was wonderful, completely unknown, and angry to watch with friends when drinking in a big house. I love things opened by Lisa walking about lost in a beautiful city. I want to be a good visitor lost in a foreign European area, although maybe not in the flick of a less expensive budget. Certainly get to the end where there are non-sexually sexually transmitted things that were made (in my copy of the DVD however). Don't try to understand it, just go and look for amazing bits ... which is everything. Don't look at this if you want a conspiracy or a character or anything for a purpose. Very good, although you can only give up this and decide to watch a real movie horror, as you say, Dead Alive.
