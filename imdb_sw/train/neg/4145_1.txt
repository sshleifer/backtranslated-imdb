Well, I have examined this film twice, I've explored the net, I have asked several people there. I have even gone to the earlier reading of Sheridan Lafanu Classic 'Carmilla', a book that this movie should be based on. I feel that the best way to explore this film is to describe the game of play when you look at it. If the plot of the movie does not seem to have any meaning, here is a book plot. Laura lives in a castle in Syberia with her father, Mr De Lafontaine. They continue to live happily and peacefully. One day they receive a letter from a 'Great' person who has done his work in a life of revenge for the death of his daughters. He is making a claim for supernatural powers while working, and he explains that he will visit them soon. At the same time, meet a wonderful woman for the results of Lafontaines looking for her daughter, Carmilla, for several months. Soon Laura begins to be damaged by fantastic dreams, and begins to come with a strange disease. Who is this wonderful Carmilla? And what does he do with the situation of Laura, and the Great? <br /> <br /> I have created this game and would like many people to play, and let me know their results. I even have an interesting name, and I can have jingle too, but I can't have trouble with that. It is called "this film is not recommended" game. All you should do is to watch the film, try to come up with a full plot describing what is happening. I have the whole meaning, all the questions answered, everything is perfectly, absolutely perfectly. It is worth answering questions such as ... <br /> <br /> * Why can the pumps walk in the daylight? Why are all polytheists? <br /> <br /> * Why is a girl called Bob? and why does he shoot himself? <br /> <br /> * The movie is a dream and when it is true? Why do you kill zombies seems to be the most acceptable part of life that does not have anyone hitting a copy? <br /> <br /> * Why Travis Fontaine spot and run zombie without slowing down while driving his car, still when faced with a hosted woman behind his car, accepting the excuse that he is a zombie too? And why then let the girl, which later shows clearly that she knows is a vampire head, drive her in her car? then let him take away, with his daughter, in the stolen car? Is hell a place to run everything? What is hell is a green goo about? <br /> * Why the vampire head suddenly begins to wear as a nurse? Why no vampires never fight? Zombies? What is the importance of the necklace? what is happening? why do you kill vampires? and how does Jenna know? <br /> <br /> Of course, it's very fun trying to come up with many questions about this film too. I have my farm, and I must accept it not here, but it's a good effort. <br /> <br /> In conclusion <br /> <br /> 'Vampires vs Zombies' do not have time in it where there are actually vampires fighting zombies. Everyone in the film seems to know exactly what is going on, yet they seem to be reluctant to listen to the audience on this. And somehow it is the basis of the 19th century novel of fear. How? Why? What does hell continue?
