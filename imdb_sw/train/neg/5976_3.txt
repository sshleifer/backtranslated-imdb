The truth is true: girls like COYOTE UGLY more than boys. And the reason is clear as soon as the plot is given. The Jersey girl goes to New York to be the author of the song. And after the initial frustration of being lucky, they hear some girls when they are doing $ 300 each that they did last night. He gets inspections in the bar they are working with amazing! The area is full of "two-year-old children" bursting in front of the babies playing. It's not bad and some of the characters seem to be, especially Cammie (the "grace coordinator" part was good) and bouncer but let's face it, this game was awesome and completely lost since the beginning. Violet and her father watched as they were talking about all the movies. And see Violet also runs on the keyboard with a dancer break! For the first time I could imagine, production could be very bad? For a short time with this movie, Hollywood can stand on its two legs and show less down without any public cry without saying, "You warned!" Instead, it seems COYOTE UGLY has the intention to kiss every great back in the world. Infant advertisements in the bar, but show a thin paper "follow your dreams" stories disappointed every young boy you targeted! And finally, music. There was no rest of the music I found in this film, especially when needed (hospital location). Each location has been seen as a short music video that you just want to leave until the bar is opened. But the peak was the last player: '80s if the song could expect Cyndi Lauper to jump on the stage and hit the race with Violet. Heck, I myself thought Bon Jovi was going to fly out with long hair and jam too! <br /> <br /> Besides some cameras actually working with girls coyote when playing (especially wet area), and a couple of beautiful couple, COVER UGLY is something to be embarrassed about. If you looked at it or did it, it was nothing but killing time. Or lose according to how you look.
