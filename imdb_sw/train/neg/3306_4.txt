A very beautiful woman, desperate to save her home and property, grows "pot" in her house, pulls a few old friends and then sells it. That's the story of this low-core comedy, emphasizing the lack of conditions and some humorous humor brings. For many films, it works. Humor is not a kind of laughter but it makes you happy for an hour and a half, so I think it serves its purpose. <br /> <br /> There is a moment of delight and Brenda Blethyn is happy to look at the leading role. But at the end it destroyed the "good" movie with an untrue message that only the liberalists of the film world would like to see. <br /> <br /> Like many people, I would like to end up happy, too, but not every warm and fuzzy for those who break the law openly. It is also common (1) children outside marriage but that does not provide a problem and seems to be the same; (2) pastors are shown as weak moral persons; and (3) even a doctor who gets stones, too! Hello! And the voters here are photographing Hollywood? This shows how the world community has reduced rates in the UK and Europe in general. Hey, people: at least have a moral view instead of anything but Timothy Leary "If it feels good, do" message.
