The original Lvelman series of novel is a classic type. It's a fresh SF adventure with certain substances (here and there) and I've always wondered why Hollywood hasn't made it real because it's just the kind of thing they like: a great explosion, advanced weapons, heroes-hero, hero finds a girl, aliens ( The great potential of CGI), good against evil in pure form, etc. etc. Rather (and considering the ideas I am Japan-o-phile and the lover of anime) we get this awesome movie of children that comes out of the story, combines in Star- Wars (cheerful as the last removed books often) lose and forbid one thing to the 'Thundercats' level. To see Kimball Kinnison, an example of the Galactic Patrol officer and the second step Lensman is shown as a young man is compassionate (etc.). I can't understand why the creators did it because they really had the rights of stories and they could make more money (FAR!) By telling them directly. It's useless.
