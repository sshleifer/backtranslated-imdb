Reduced, Reduced, Reduced ... There is no secret or excitement in this film. If you don't know who the "mole" is for the first ten minutes you must have a brain brain. The secret service must also be, because it took the whole film to put it together. There are no compelling characters in the film (not the film). The speed of the movie is slow no tension. A hired killer is the best shot except the stand by Michael Douglas than all that seems to be able to hit is a large glass pan. The funniest section in the movie is when the president's wife says the word of the code at the end of anticlimactic. It laughs loudly. At least six people went up and left the movie early. I would like to join them if I wasn't sitting in the middle of the column. I will not recommend this film to anyone.
