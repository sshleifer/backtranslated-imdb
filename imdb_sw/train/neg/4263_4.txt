The despair film. Performance executives are weak. Sets are beautiful, would be better. Myths are also weak. The war system is bad. Sound and quality of the film are trashy. The history of the people of Kazakh was told very much. This film should have many Kazakhs participants, in leading roles. It should also be in Kazakh language. Kuno Bekker and Jay Hernandez are native to Spain. I don't. Since the Spanish people are playing people of Turkic-Mongolia. This film is a disgrace of Kazakh film. Rustam Ibragimbekov despised me. He is one of the best filmmakers in the world. Czekh's director is judged, because he is not a natural woman, he cannot know the true spirit and the history of names.
