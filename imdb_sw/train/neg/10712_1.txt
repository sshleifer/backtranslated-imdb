This is undoubtedly one of the worst movies EVER, I insist, EVER made. What's worse, my old Dolphian hero is in it and he looks at it. Jesus ... Stories are really good but the way it happens makes my body hurt. The events of the fighting for the beginning are as well as those chosen as the struggle between the two of the dancers in the shell. The actors, except for Dolph, who also love, do very badly, but they wonder if their reason that they are all friends of the director, who by the way must be far, if not all, of the time. This is 12 million used in an unlikely way, because for the effect of the impact and environment, costs cannot be between .1000.
