What can I say about seven pounds ... well I looked over to run from Seattle to Tokyo and if the trip was long and stimulating the movie definitely didn't help. Smith's behavior in Thomas Thomas is close to his redemption at the end. The two hours of the movie as well as the run time are losing a lot of screenshots and random trash that combine the plot as quickly as possible. In the film's character of Rosario Dawson's character adds a little life to the film though not much. I don't understand how anyone can cry during this film all the time that I wanted to do was to turn off. Also Will Smith commits suicide and jellyfish at the end to prove that suicide for jellyfish is a stupid way of dying.
