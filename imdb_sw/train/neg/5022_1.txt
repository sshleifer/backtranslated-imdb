O dear, this film was bad for various reasons. I expected to see the lowest score for this film and I was surprised by the highest score. Enjoy it, but with so many levels, it's joke! Once you pass one shot / white and white gimmick movie, which was a good idea, the film comes, even when you run just 66 minutes. The credit sequence was initially sad too! In those van boys faced with flat tire and changing wheel, wow, which is needed in the story! Where were they delaying and managing Campbell? They didn't seem to have trouble continuing to evict ... sigh.
