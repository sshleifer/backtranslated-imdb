Rich Rich President (Bette Davis) is engaged to marry Allen Brice (Lost Carson lost lost). His father (Eugene Palette) has left marriage and has taken over with Steve Collins (James Cagney). They destroy the land in the desert and hate one another (but sadness) begin to fall in love. This seems to be getting a high level from the reviews here just because Cagney and Davis are there. They were all brilliant actors but were distinguished by NOT comedy dramas and this shows what the movie! Script is awesome - there is no one laugh in the whole movie. Laughing laughter in this deep Cagney and Davis fall down on the cactus (this is made NATO THREE!). Only his talents are what saves them from shame and shame. If both are doing better for lousy equipment. Cagney tries best with his lines and Davis examines every powerful line of line but doesn't work. Carson has this "what hell" looks at his face in the whole movie (perhaps because his sense of spelling changes in seconds). The only palette with its distinctive sound and on top of the dietary eating to attract smiles. But, for all, this was lighter and inexpensive - true work of staying. This gets only two stars for Cagney and Davis' acting with some nice but realistic movies - it is not worth seeing. Cagney and Davis hated this film in later years and you can see why.
