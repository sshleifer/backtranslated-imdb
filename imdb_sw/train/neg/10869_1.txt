My friend gave me this video and I was very happy to look at it, but after ten minutes of James Hetfield's soft and Lars sounding dancing in what seemed to be slow I started thinking, 'Why am I looking at this? 'That question will come through your ideas in 5? 10 minutes after playing play. I gave the tape back the same day, if you were a suspect, not worth buying or looking! <br /> <br /> My comment! <br /> <br />
