WARNING! SMALL PLOT notes clear! I can get almost anything positive about this film. It is written very badly that each character is caricature, but it seems to take itself seriously. It is badly cast, especially Ralph Macchio (both baby-faced, 5-foot-whatever it) as a tough streetwise. All the Plot elements are drawn in black and white, and each state immediately spread to some extreme peak. <br /> <br /> Most egregious of all (PLOT ELEMENT RELEASED) has perhaps the most extreme and contrived naked scene in the history of half bad film. One can only think the film developers and say, "We need JoBeth to shed on it ... hmmm ... I'm so! ... early in the film, let's give Nick some ridiculous conversation about Baring himself in hallways. you can use that line on it later and actually bore yourself in the hallway ... yeah, that's a ticket! " Weight at the end of 90 years and events like Columbine. However, implementation is awesome. This film can be a dark comedy in the vein of "Heathers", a political campy information as "Web" or a great test like "Brubaker". Instead, it tries to be all these things - and end up to none of these things. "Teachers" get F.
