I wonder if this film has been paid very much, even if I go to the normal level of 71 degrees it is c- or d so maybe it's the same but this movie was just an exciting exciting except boringly slow and unrealistic. It is not that the usual excitement is true but this seems to be trying, and a woman who has not been a case of prosecution had not been prosecuted because she did not want to interfere with the court even though she would put a man who broke her hand and beat her for life but not to protect A lawyer who had a sense for him and his family not only non-civilians who did not even know. There were other problems similar to the movies that would be similar if there were some kind of ethics to take away from the film but a short ethical question if it was right to try to kill Kady before doing anything illegally presented as far as Kady finished being a pastor The ignorant retaliation was indeed a lawyer was right in protecting his family since waiting for Kady to actually rape his daughter so that he could do something legal about it would be very strange. So now I have rejected most of my life for this stupid movie so please don't see it at least your life will be removed and that way at me 2 1/2 or so it means something.
