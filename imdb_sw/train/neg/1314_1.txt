This is the worst piece of skin I have seen recently. There is nothing good about this film. The plan is not clear, the conversation will not have any feeling, humorous events have never heard anything about real humor. Traders don't play, they don't even try. The script itself is somewhat in the league with Ed Wood and Uwe Boll. There is only one good thing in this flick, fights. They are well placed as a person who can expect from the people of Hong Kong, and that's the only reason to watch the Prince of the Sun. Although I believe the struggle should fill in empty space so the screens must not worry about thinking about the story. However, this weak and sad plan can stop you from looking at it until the end. Avoid unless you are a fan of a female woman Cynthia Rothrock.
