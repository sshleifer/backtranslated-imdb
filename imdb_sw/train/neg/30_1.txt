I did not like the idea of ​​a female turtle since 1987 we knew TMNT to be four brothers and their Splinter teacher and their enemies and each of the four brothers named the name of the great artists like Leonardo, Michelangleo, Raphel and Donatello so Venus here has no meaning or play Any important part and I believe that the former TMNT series was better than that new which has Venus As the turtle of women will not add any step to the story we like the story of TMNT we knew in 1987 to have new enemies in each section is a good step to be in action a certain but a female turtle is a very weak step to have a certain point, we want to see a newer than a series TMNT but as well as the same characters we knew in 1987 without that female turtle.
