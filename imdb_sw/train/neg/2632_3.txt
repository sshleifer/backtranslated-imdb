It is sad to test movies with many of my actors, sites and music, namely Douglas, Sutherland, Washington, D.C. and politically motivated, but 'Sentinel' is very affected. It was like they had a great idea ahead, signed the right diagram and had the big shots of the city and then taking a vacation to allow the remaining staff to delete others. And I wish I could blame the other bland performance from Basinger (not only I feel it is one of the worst actors in Hollywood, but I still continue to absorb more than ten years later that he is the only one, and only the worst actor in the film, win Oscar acting in 'LA secret') But it's not the only problem. Sutherland, who I love as Jack Bauer on '24' again includes Jack. I have lost her 'Time to Kill' or 'Few Good People'. Douglas certainly took hiatus from working and calling this one. Plot: Someone else, Assistant Secretary of the Service, wants the dead President and Douglas is (without precision) written. Is someone who believes? In fact, there is no spoiler here: as soon as they came up with a subplot half of the way through, it's more than before you know. And why did the man (saw) want the President to die? Is that disclosed in the series? Many holes of the plot, many doors are open and unlocked and also predict 'Sentinel' is. If you see only one film a year, you may not know who it is, but anyone who knows these types of movies or even has seen only one part of 'Law and Order' will know in the first frames. It was awesome? Not really, the movie was good, and despite Sutherland playing Jack again, he still gets it.
