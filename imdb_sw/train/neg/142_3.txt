First, there are some good things about this film, but it's all the elements of a few pieces with a teen movie. In this film, which I have seen, a great emphasis was on the fact that Denise Richards is in it, but she is a poor actress, and not as good as people are trying to make her (not that has anything to do with the movie). And what does everyone look at? Probably a part of the character, but as I said, acting ... Still, the texts are good. You know who it is for every movie, and you can almost predict what will happen, but not in an offensive way. I think a book based on it is probably good, and judging by the line of conspiracy, but sometimes I will read the book to find out rather than to look at this.
