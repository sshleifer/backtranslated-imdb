Is this the "worst" section of Star Trek TOS? Perhaps, at least my vote is less than 5. I mean, this part does not really mean disappearance. See something that makes you mad? Give me a break. This period also feels different, music has increased, almost obliged to reinforce the feeling of distress, until it reaches. Give me Klingons, Gorns, Tholians, Romulans, Higher Creatures such as Triskelion or nothing except Medusin, these are very interesting visitors to make a part around. McCoy gets to say his famous words "He's dead, Jim". Spock puts on protection pigs when sending ambassadors away but Kirk does not. They go in the same way a "barrier" for the third time that I can remember, which disturbs them. For the season's second season events will be "Specter Of The Gun", and "Dove Day" and others follow, and make Trek show a good look at syndication where it can take people like me up as avid fans. A private inquiry, Trek loved to use purple, purple purple, as in the outer part of the compartment, a spoon that is usually gray is now purple. We did not have a purple bridge but it was interesting to see, I realized at several intervals, it was made with a light filter and it works very well but in this period, on the ship's zone is very blind.
