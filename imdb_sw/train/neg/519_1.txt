At least a young geek gets a girl's film, often a guy is recommended by girls. In a 40-year-old woman is selected by a 40-year-old boy who is famous for women but somehow remains a virgin. But you don't have to share your brain with this film or I have lost a little over being a 20-year mix? <br /> <br /> One of the series of movies where 40 somethings act as young and women for some reason they get enough quality who want a great relationship with them. I find it hard to understand how a country that has produced very good TV comedies seems to think it depends on the dirty and unknown characters for laughing. They have made outdoor movies. They have done only if all Americans are 15 years old. Where will they go? <br /> <br /> This movie is entertaining and casual entertainment and nothing to suggest.
