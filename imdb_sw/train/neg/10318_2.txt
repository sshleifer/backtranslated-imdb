Who likes "bad comedy" shows as Pastor Pastor in Prairie? Only two types of people I can think of who are watching this are: One, Muslims and Liberal defenders of each group who are very happy there is a show about Muslims that doesn't matter even if the show is good or funny at all (which is not). Two people, the elderly and the people with the idea of ​​comedy are very predictable, written badly, stale jokes. The CBC needs to look at what they are doing with their audience. If they just write the comedy to the old people then then I think what will happen, their listeners will soon die and they won't have the left audience. I would be curious who even writes for this show? What? Do you think it is true Muslims, or hip, good young people? No, I am a white-colored boys who have been writing the same joke with the same kind of bad CBC exhibition since the 1960s. When you look at the CBC's comedy shows there, Air Farce was just finally taken air (good thanks!) But still we have bad valleys as this hour has 22 minutes and Rick Mercer that we pay, not to mention this bad forgiveness for "playing" mosque in Prairie. Should be offencive and funny? The CBC would just think this display was disabled at all offencive or funny. The attack on the CBC for losing our tariff dollars shows only a few people who will be anxious to look at.
