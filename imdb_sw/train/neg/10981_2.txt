Or listen, for that. Even the sound of the voice is bearing. Certainly, this is not the worst movie that I had seen (which would have been in relation to Billy), but it falls down next to the bottom of the barrel. This thing connects to the smoker and the smoker. It is not that the plot is internal - in the hands of a good author can have worked. . . it would certainly be more entertaining. There is no single plot of action that you can't see come for ten miles down the road. Talk is flat. Jokes are ancient. In order to add insult to injury, it is full of one direction, tribal gay. There is nothing in this movie believe me that the situation or relationship of two directions was possible, not less than true. There was no chemistry, no power, in fact there is no evidence of why it leads to love. . . we are told only in love. It's hard to think when they don't have the same thing and is not available sex. They like the book? Huh? It is not very bad, but pacing is very slow. I mean, near Jarmuski- swift, but without the quality of Jarmus. In fact, that would be a good barometer for you. If you like Jarmusch movies, try this.
