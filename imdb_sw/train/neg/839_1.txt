The only part of this film was the price I was paid. At least all I lost was $ 3.00 and when you passed through this bomb. A member of staff who was in charge of promotions missed the boat. When the female and FBI leader went to the place demanding the killers, Mr. FBI sent a refugee woman. When the murderer comes out, the guard has been turned into direct. One is left to think it would be the FBP agent will give weapons to civilians? I don't think. Mrs Xavier seems to be a very beautiful woman. It's very bad rating of R did not allow much of its appearance. It appears that the film editor will cut what can be the best part of the film.
