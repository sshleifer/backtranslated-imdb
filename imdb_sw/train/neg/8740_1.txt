My friends and I used the movie last night and we had a lot of laughter for a short time. The movie should not be quite funny, but it's just ridiculous and does not have any originality. First, Phillippe (I forget what his behavior is called and I don't really care) uses his typical employee ID to go through all the security centers. It's not just that it is pathetic but it faces when his great efforts to put an end to his terrible Lego room, which host a super computer. This is very funny. Mood when we should get a completely damaged experience with a looking room for children. Lastly, like all others, it is very happy, especially when the evil wicked lawyer shows 'justice at the time'. However, this film is a good laugh. If you need something interesting, definitely see.
