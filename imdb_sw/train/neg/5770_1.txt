If I had to build a film thermometer, this film would be quite zero. Out of ten stars, I would have thought of them as follows: <br /> <br /> Plot: star zero quality video: star zero sound: star zero act: zero star <br /> <br /> is like school students The secondary meeting met one day with the camera, they conspired with hitting the movie. It is missing any artistic value that I would like to watch children walking around to high school than watching this film. HOW / WHERE, there is something called deep. "Shootout" in the staircase is one of the most trailing falling scenes ever. First of all, the fighters surround the plastic guns for each other, locking their hands back and forth in order to imitate the recovery. On Monday the real "duck" each shot is not available. No squibs, no sparks, no blanks, just waving spraypainted squirtguns around. If you want to see two whole people playing "actress", take one day on the trip ... after refining the refrigerator, erasing the towel, publishing all the headlines, prohibiting gravel, removes books on shelves, etc. .
