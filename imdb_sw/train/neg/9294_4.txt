As a person who was disturbed by the incredible exhibition of "hero," I was worried to see this film considered to be similar to those lines, but better. It also showed what I like: Ziyi Zhang. Yes, I was disappointed with both errors. I bought a DVD-visual image, and that was a mistake. It was not good. <br /> <br /> I recognize these flying-through-air films film is a fresh fantasy but this story is so stretched off anything away and only reliable to make me shake my head in despair. A blind woman overcoming hundreds of opponents? Sorry, this goes away. Also, the male protagonist of "Jin" (Takeshi Kaneshiro) was very interesting to talk to him, looking stupidly on his face and laughing with stupidity, that destroyed the film too. <br /> <br /> With beautiful colors and incredible incredible events, this story - to me - had no appeal to make a suitable film to possess. This film is not a "hero" of mine!
