Well answer the question of one "why no one is watching this film?" because in fact, not many people saw it in 1978 and have not been shown on TV since. (If it was on a video that would have been informing me!) Even during the intellectual friends who were '70 years, girls' films were concerned to avoid this film. Unless they like Billy's cry, Paul Lynde or Joan Rivers "that" much! Paul Lynde was a funnier on "Crash" or "Hollywood Squares" than here. Joan cities at this time in his work was making a mockery of the roughness of the singer Karen Carpenter! Har-har Joan! It also looks like every name "name" popular name from when it is in cast. (More wonderful is Doris Roberts later "Everyone loves Raymond".) <br /> <br /> However, a very good idea for a story, a person who gets pregnant instead of a woman may be lost here. With help from Crystal boyfriend grows with a hooker to eventually lose his daughter but because he was "over" instead, she gets pregnant! (Information on women taking power away from men). The Crystal belly grows, it goes through all the female feelings and related feelings. Unfortunately, now it is a misunderstanding of society! She is attacked by a group that wants to be killed (I think). He is obliged to go to the secret to have his child ... on the barn. Or if you want, the farmer (God knows only where it can leave! Ewwww!) It turns out (no shock here) to be a girl! Everything else about this movie has not disappeared and forget, humor is a high school level or low. <br /> <br /> 2 stars for a good idea and a few good and appropriate time w / Crystal Billy. Ignore the Rabitt Test, you come all the time! I can't believe Roddy McDowell has been signed either! (END)
