A break would be a screenwriter and his would be an agent (Tom Wood and Arye Gross) are forced to live in a private parking center run by eccentric manager and panic (Ron Perlman) who believe it is a serial killer that is awesome city, "The Costume Butcher" so called because, after incorporating its victims to the Windex, wearing silent clothes). They persuade his life story to make a great film and assemble a group of suitable filmmakers (John Considine, Joe Pantoliano, Kristy Swanson) and discover that the art of making text can be murder. There is more than this film but unfortunately left in the room room and shows (speculation is a label that wants "lighter" of dark comedy). Our losses (and executives, all of whom are doing good and deserve to be better) if this has the preparation of a unique black comedy but it only grows by combining the cute. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Ron Perlman this is absolutely necessary to get just for its performance. His comedic time is better and he has the opportunity to do some of the greatest emotions (he did not pretend when he spoke about the views of the movie Hellboy that he needed to intervene when it gets Jerry Lewis mode). He's just happy to look here. David / Dukes David also shines in two (but important) positions.
