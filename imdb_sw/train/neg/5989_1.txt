wow I paid Â£ 3.50 to see this film on movies. I believe I have lost my time. Acting is the best cringe best and special effects are bad. Probarly script worse in history some of the embarrassing quotes I've ever heard in my life. I swear by God 'canceled' is better than this. Madonna must win with Oscar compared to these guys. An hour and a half of my life I want back. Faithful people don't see this, even a little child would get this film to be proud of their minds. I have seen this amazing film for the fact that it was difficult to tell who was more than a timber, telling people here on real cover. girls who do not waste your time on this film will live sadly.
