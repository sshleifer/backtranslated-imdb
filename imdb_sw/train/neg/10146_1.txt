'Furi Aircraft' is a surprising but more tragic event than a movie - I don't expect too much from the Seagal Film, all I expect is to be used for 90 or minute minutes for a trivial stage - this fortune doesn't mean even to reach the lowest expectations, the practice is very few and far away, the plot (which is not quite available in these films) is complicated and is confused with the big holes of the inner conspiracy, Acting is very realistic - dealing with shame and Seagal and its advocacy One is the best of the three-thirds - it's hard to believe that anything near the $ 12M was spent on this aggregate except $ 11M of the 12th was a Seagal salary - somehow I doubt! One period of any interest for girls or gay girls is that out of the two hot flies that appear to be no end in the lesbian sex of all types are full and immersed in other exhibitions than it is - it's good things that are different. and many of Michael Dudikoff B-Movies I believe in it / <br /> 1/10
