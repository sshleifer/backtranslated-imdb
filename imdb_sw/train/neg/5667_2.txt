I would be looking at IMDB before renting this DVD from Netflix, I'd like to have a few hours of my life. I am sure when I see that the film director also wrote. In this case, according to credit, the person was "the author and director" - unfortunately, is a sign of the overall quality of this production. There was a short time of interest (e.g., Judy Tenuta area was reminded of its first system of early warning at Judy-ism) which led me to measure these two stars instead of one. At that time, however, they were few and far between ... and I almost did not see them because the opening of the opening was incomprehensible to me, not to mention it valid in its violence. I agree I came back to look at that place again to see if I missed something that would help me look at it once I would like to see anything. Nope, although I at least identified who the characters were who would seem to be useful later. The "publishing camera" was widely used and essentially useless. I found myself talking to a TV screen: "What ?!" or "For good, continue with it!" Not recommended.
