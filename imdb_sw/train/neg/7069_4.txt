When the movie was released it was a great hit and soon became Blockbuster. But honestly the movie is looking ridiculous and conspiracy that honors the lost person. The movie has a line of Tag - "Preeti Madhura, Tyaga Amara" which means Sweet Love but Sacrifice is Living. In the movie movie movie (Ganesh) offers his love to the leading woman (Pooja Gandhi) even though they both loved each other! Its validity means the line of the tag. This movie has caused many young people who have been broken that they found this "Giving Provision of Giving" and so it was a devotional film when they were led by their lives. The work of Ganesh in the movie is the Boy, the Crass and the Child. In fact it looks funny in the song, (Onde Ondu Sari ...) when it should look both stylish and cool. His appearance does not help the leading role. His hair style is being mistreated many parts of the movie. POOJA GANDHI CANT ACT. Her dress is bad in the movie and it is not very recommended. The best part about the movies is the best movies and brilliant music with Mano Murthy who is really a gift to save the movie. Also lyrics by Jayant Kaikini have written very well. Director Yograj Bhat should be counted picturization songs in the right manner. <br /> <br /> Yet all in all except for songs, movies are very common !!!!!!
