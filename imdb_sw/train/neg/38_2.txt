or anyone who asks for seeing Al Cliver blowing honey, 7ft long black man in full nelson, your film has come! The film star Laura Crawford (Ursula Buchfellner) has been taken by a group that needs a $ 6 million compensation to be deployed on their island reserves. Nor do they focus on the rugged Vietnam vet Peter Weston (Cliver) being employed by the film producer to save the girl. And what they did not really know is the inner tribe that loves to give young women with their eyes of cannibal monster and the eyes of the gun. The equivalent of the same film has been set as CANNIBALS, this is more comfortable when you come to the value of entertainment, thanks to the dub hilarious song and the impossible monster of the eyes and the blowing eyes (Franco confirms the beat the ping pong in the disc interview. Franco gets a powerful EuroCult victory including Gisela Hahn (CONTAMINATION) and Werner Pochath (whose death is one of the head-times that I have ever seen as a young person who is not quite shown - almost - trying to be him). The film has dirt and dirt characteristics (Tempra colors). My view was the slow fistfight of the world between Cliver and Antonio de Cabo in the bursting waves. Sadly, ol 'Jess carries this one in amazingly (and, sometimes, hurt) 1 hour and 40 minutes when you should run 80 minutes fingers. <br /> <br /> For the most part, Severin's DVD looks very good but there are some abnormal photography photographs during some of the dark events. Also, one part of the long-term negotiation is in Spanish and no subs (it's an option, but only when you listen to the French song). Franco offers a good 16-minute interview on the film and has the best things to say about Buchfellner than his CANNIBALS Sabrina Siani stars.
