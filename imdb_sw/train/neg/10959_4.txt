I am a fan of the series and I have read all the books 7. I wanted to see this just to see how it was done. I can all say, that only the people who should look at these are already read the series and want to know about it. It is very bad, and will prevent them from reading. It doesn't mean, but Lucy is very bad to stop it from the film. Was she the daughter of directors? Hardly, I am sure that the beavers in the movie were jealous of his teeth. He had overbite that could put any beaver to shame. The movie just lose too much in translation. CS books do not translate easily as TOLKEIN LOTR books, or even Harry Potter. One thing they did well! Aslan! very nice. Although other human beings who have built (beavers, wolves) seem to be, Aslan had done well since it was not just a human actor. (I think of him like a horse horse? 2 people inside?) Also, I would like to know what children think of this movie. Maybe they will enjoy it? But as for adults, bet safe, even if the CS fan.
