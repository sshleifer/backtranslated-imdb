True, Parsifal is not an opera that can appeal to everyone, although it is my favorite, Knappertsbusch, 1951, in particular. The whole way of Syberberg is static. Whenever music starts to switch ... Syberberg keeps cast moving at the same speed. It takes Amfortas and Klingsor the last treasure. Whatever happened to the editing of the film? The result is to stimulate physical look. The viewer has never been transported spiritually. Your view is to run home and play recording again to prove that Wagner got the right, Syberberg got it. And that decoration and those "clever" reminds Wagner's anti-Semitism - Is there ever being an observer of this film without the previous knowledge of Wagner?
