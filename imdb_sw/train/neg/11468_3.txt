I don't know who has the idea that orcas goes around people and beat them and destroy things to take revenge but my god is wonderful. Orcas is definitely not the killer of this cold blood movie makes them out ... his profile. Orcas are very intelligent, do not get bad, but I am very doubt they know and understand the concept such as retaliation. So I must say all that I came out of this film was how interesting it was. So I was interested in it. Personally, I would recommend to go and see Jaws if you want to see a variety of Animals-Kill-Humans of the movie. But if you are like me and want to laugh at this away from reality then I'd like to go ahead. : D
