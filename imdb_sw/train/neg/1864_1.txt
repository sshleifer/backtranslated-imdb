I can't be a critic, but here's what I think of this movie. Just look at the movie on the cinemax and first of all I just say how much I hate the storyline I mean coming to the most awesome snowman of the kids, the second is pretty gory but the bet since the movie is the lowest budget maybe they used ketchup so MY GROUP. NI BOMB !!! a good attempt and sequel will take two more times.
