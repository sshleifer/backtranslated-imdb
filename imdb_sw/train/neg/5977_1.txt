Wow. I will not remember very much about this film, except that it has fallen. <br /> <br /> The program is basically; The girl's parents refuse him, so this PokoMon pretends to be his father. What? Am I the only one confused with that? Then, PokeMon breastens the mother of Ash to pretend to be a girl. I don't care if she was trying to make a girl happy, that's just big. There was no real plot. The girl was just a whiny what who wanted her own way way. Played with Unowns, he was the "daughter" of Entei and apparently could grow up with a decline in age by surprise with his "father" help. That is so much I can remember, but I think you can take it as a taste, and don't see it. (Or if you see it, don't expect too much.) 1 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Overall. If you want a PokeMon movie, rent "PokeMon; First Movie".
