Many of the King's fans hate this because they came from the book, but the film is central and books should change when they jump. That is, however, the film is not perfect, but it fails completely with the conditions of the film. I would like to convince people who tell me it's the worst movie made. I always follow the question "Really ... exactly what area you fear?" Every fan I asked, may be silent. Regularly a person, to lose for a horrible respect (No there ...), is called "Shtick" of "Grape-juice-out-of-elevators". If you are afraid of it, I don't know what to tell you, unless you are so afraid. I have found my eyes looking at these horrible-z-grade ideas of playing on this film of schlocky, incoherent. <br /> <br /> One part varies from the book and is really ignorant is the work of stimulating the movie takes Mr Halloran up to Overlook just to kill him; along with a member of the arrogant listener who knows that Jack is waiting behind one cluster in the region that takes Halloran to move down. It's really one of the stupid series you have put on the film. <br /> <br /> Oh, with a good choice for Mr. Halloran Stanley! Black afro-nymphomaniacs light further enhances the development status and character of the terrible movie. Does there ever be more than "off," out of the place hit on any film made? I see that it is a miracle that I was finally able to cross this turd, and accept that the 2001 Kubricks is a very important film, due to "evil" that came from this stupid, stupid, and devotional film. of kindness but not known the Kubrick boys, who could not describe the idea of ​​working in it and every film resource. Library of Congress in front of them. <br /> <br /> Dial on the most overturned by Jack Nicholson, the introduction of one-sized organs at a time, and Razzie chose the performance of Shelly Duvall and has a very crappy film.
