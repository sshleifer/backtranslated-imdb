I am a young pastor's wife and we took some young people to watch this film. We spent an hour trying to explain. They didn't find it and I didn't enjoy it. It depends on the concept that has gone through all three major religions in the world (the Bible principle, the Torah Code and the Code in the Koran) and it is undoubtedly a despair. This is not a step forward for Christians in art, it is a step forward for those who believe we look at our minds at the door.
