Good performances and art leadership are not a good film. This movie is so bad and sad, I can feel quite happy at the end of the "happiness" involving the union of the union. The quest for the intake of Lake Lake is very dangerous, and any movie involving Baldwin's brother is already fighting against it. For a positive note, Lang is still one of the lowest American actors, he alone makes it worthy to put in the VCR. I offer this 4.
