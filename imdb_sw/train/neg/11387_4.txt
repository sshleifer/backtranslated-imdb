Medellin is a good place to live, work, and learn. I have been there twice, and I have never heard anything about hurricanes, helpers using tourists, or anything like that. There is a "invisible police," but not a * Brother Big system. There is only enough police to be seen in everyday life, but they should not be someone without good reason. <br /> <br /> La Sierra is an interesting document to be young that shows in the movie essentially its characters. The directors of the movies build the lines of conspiracy between the daily activities of the La Sierra, and when the "character" dies, there is a real pathos. It is hard to imagine, however, that three young people are all members of Bloque Metro, a group that was a terrible Sierra before the Colombian government began to reform the country. The Sierra is not the best manifestation of life in Colombia; there are, of course, things to be concerned as such a small crime, but when someone thinks to escape it occurs in "modern" cities like London, New York, or Tokyo, Colombia does not seem to be different after all. Colombians are waiting for their chance to show the world that the country once once destroyed by the war is now more successful than ever.
