Man of Wicker. I am very angry that I can't write the correct comments on this film. The plan was wise, connected together, and totally blind. Nicolas Cage ... shy on you! I thought that since you were in it, it would have been at least good. It was not. I felt like a great part of the movie was left on the floor room, and even if it was finished - the film was abroad and deceptive. The end has left the agape mouth, the mind is gone and the good taste has been struck. I have never heard of many people from the theater when opening the day and very hateful. People were complaining about him in small groups at the shops, four floors from the theater near the door. It's bad. I heard it compared to: Glitter, American Werewolf in Paris and Gigli. My partner was very mad even without talking about it. <br /> <br /> Grrrr!
