A memorable line from a short show. After looking at the place where the line formed my team of the team of the intramural team began to use the line to break our hair on the fault. Instead of Ready / Break, our back quarter said FOOTBALL and another squad answered BET! The fun way to break the shade with our opponents blowing their heads as few of them were watching the show. Using this verse added a special feature to our season that I will not forget. We had the best season when I was at the university that year and in a small way it was due to the joy we were using this verse. The show was pretty much stinker but it is in the memory of the club's 1977 Pi Kappa Phi team in West Virginia Tech.
