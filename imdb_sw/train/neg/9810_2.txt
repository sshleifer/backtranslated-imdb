It is difficult to reject this film, because I do not like the story itself, and no amount of good acting would have kept me. Imagine “Add Arizona” to a meaningful line. Acting is approved, but Jennifer Tilly is a high way (still insufficient to make this good camping camp) as usual, coming somewhere between "Pain" and a DMV coworker. Some of the cast and their browsers are always knitted in impairment, either due to the complications of their parts or the difficulty of the whole exercise. A few hours of film destruction. Darryl Hannah uses most of the hard-to-understand movie. I wish I could tell you how it ended but I went out, sorry.
