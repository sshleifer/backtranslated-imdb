So ... we get an extra image of Brando ... interesting but not the good things of Oscar. Susannah York was very difficult. The new area that Lois sees Clark is Superman is little enough to be aware that there are blanks coming out of the gun instead of a real shot. The real fibers could decorate his clothes and then put the gun on the floor but forget that ... let's listen to Donner's happy version of Lester that made sense more logical. The President speaks Zod "abolish" the Washington meeting when it was Mount Rushmore. Finding that area has made this verse very strange. "The freedom of journalists" of Superman was seen as a silly compared to "..The outward appearance" that was well delivered and has an appropriate relationship in the original Clark area to stop the car. Then there is the end to "restore the world to turn when" effect. It turned back everything on the entire film and made you wonder where the rocket aimed at Hackensack, N.J. has gone since it does not open Zod and the company again.
