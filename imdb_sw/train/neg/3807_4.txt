Do not do wrong, I am a great fan of many movies of Woody, certainly he was at the end of 70 years of work (Annie Hall, Interiors, Manhattan) and over his 80 years years / early dramas 90 (Hana, Crimes and Misdemeaners, Men and women) I really liked his recent efforts (Melinda, anything else, a little bit) but this was bad, I though it could not be worse than years ago Match Match but how I was right. <br /> <br /> It was locked by cunning - basically cross between Match Match, Manoktan Murder Mystery and Small Time Crooks, and all the jokes taken out - Woody seems to be in an outdoor way, also slurring over his lines and giving 'catchphrases' of the hilari 'I mean that with all the respect ...' to the constant until the worst state of all becomes very clear. <br /> <br /> I know that many executives are looking to work with him but must at least read the first script - Scarlett Johansson and Hugh Jackman are better than this - and Woody should actually take more back to the role of cameras in the future, as he has any means about 20 miles behind it. It can't be sad if we don't have too many Woody films to compare this with - but it is clear that her best days are behind her and judging for this effort, Woody should call it a day before being a shock industry. <br /> <br /> Amazingly bad
