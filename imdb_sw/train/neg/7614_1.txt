This can be one of the worst movies of making it ever for production. The most exciting part is the beginning, where one walks ... and walking ... and walking (spoiler). There are only 15 minutes to walk. How? <br /> <br /> 2. Not to mention there are many issues and lights, and it's almost as if they photographed the nighttime during the day. <br /> <br /> 3. Acting was TERRIBLE. It seems like they got the theater (in Mexico) ... and then they took people who had been evicted. <br /> <br /> Please, for the love of everything holy, do not rent this movie. If you know someone who owns them, apologize. The director should be under penalty through the war crimes court for strengthening this to the public.
