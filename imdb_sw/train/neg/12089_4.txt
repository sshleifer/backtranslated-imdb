I lost the video "Piano Piano" without knowing anything other than what was written on the video box. I did so with horror because the films that win the Cannes awards are very good or very bad. Unfortunately, this falls in the last category. Almost one quarter of the way in it I found myself speaking loudly, "This movie is boring." Almost half way through I was saying, "Where did I see it before?" In three quarters I had seen it. In spite of its literary nature, this film is primarily a remake of Robert Altman very early (1969), and much better, "That cool day in the park." Altman was driven by more conspiracy and not under the study of behavior, the two films are the same. No "new" visible in this production. Each feature that was done in the past: an excessive behavior that is characterized by excessive behaviors (Abel Ferrara's "Liyteni bad" 1992); "Love" lost and the destruction that reaches the death zone (near) death (David Cronenberg's "M. Butterfly" 1993); unusual scenes of brutality (David Lynch's "Blue Velvet" 1986); And so on. Therefore, I am impressed by the fact that many have seen the film being "amazing," "bursting," etc.. This highly-made movie seems to have been done for the sole purpose of making viewers uncomfortable, and to be successful with some. However, I have largely answered these responses for lack of experience of watching the film. See enough movies and you really, finally, you saw it all. And when it is true that I have seen the translated 'R-rated' version, I doubt that extra events would change my general opinion of the "Master of Piano." In fact, the film does not exist. There is a very good work of camera and lighting is the best. Isabelle Huppert's credit performance also helps to save it as a waste of time. This is the first of Haneke's films that I have seen, and if I see more than I expect I will have the same views as I have with Ferrara: an attractive director but not close to other scholars who make him out. Rating: 4/10.
