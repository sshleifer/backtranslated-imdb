I am a young man who is busy with his own views, but I've come back from this film, and I felt I had to give my opinion. Let me begin by saying that I am a great fan of fear. But what makes the movie worse? I am sure to see even a little bit of good development of the script and character. I know they often do not have horrible movies, but the night of Prom looks like you haven't put any effort in the department. Then, we all like to emphasize. That on the edge of your sleep chair and unexpected surprise. Yes, Night night had nothing! Of course, we love a terrible killer. Prom Night to be? No, it has a good boy with a knife. And all the time it fails ... at least fear has its pleasure of guilt to make it enjoyable like Gore Gore Gore, and occasionally nude area! Well, well when you have a terrible movie tested PG-13 as Prom Night, they leave such things too. So for all this stuff does not exist, I ask .... does this still count as a horror movie? Don't. I'd like to call it more than comedy. People in the theater were laughing more for this then they were when I saw "Semi-Pro" which had to be a comedy (which also sucked, but that's another story!). I think I will have to abandon new fears. All the awesome movie days of beauty are stored in the trash so the movie studios can make money. The people I went to see and didn't even know this was remake! Which distressed me! I wonder what will happen when there is no more video to fix ??? Where will fear go?
