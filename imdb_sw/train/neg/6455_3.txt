Really bad movie. However, it is necessary. Of course the lowest budget: there is nothing of creativity, actor (if you can do what he does "act") who has responsibilities in the swimming area, someone who has been given a reptile suit has been directed after the pastor, cabin in the wood, But there are some points of redemption. Although the story is not new, for the most part, there are several parts that are not being attended to. For one, the black man did not die when he was beaten (the first time) and he even one of the first couple to die. But that's small. More importantly, there is a very interesting twist about Kat and Wes & Steve's attempts that I didn't see coming. Steve told Kat he knew what he had done, and I believed what he said and what Kat answered. But when the revealing creature was right, I was so surprised by the revelation of revelation. It may be because of my lack of skills and forms, or that is actually a clever loss. Anyway, the movie is very bad and don't look for anything better on ... Unless you are faced with a cheap flick.
