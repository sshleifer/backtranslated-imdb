I didn't expect this to be a great movie, but I didn't expect to be very bad. I hated my mother's behavior I needed to go back to the center. I came back again, hoping only one part of the film, but no. And for the daughter to stay there taking shame, or almost done out of work, or dominated by her spiritual home? What are you doing? I raised him to respect (and even fear) my mother but I'd like to put him in a nearby hotel if he has shown that he is angry at MY house. I was expected to follow a set of rules in my mother's house, after all. <br /> <br /> I couldn't buy anything. I tried to offer several opportunities, I did the truth. Sorry.
