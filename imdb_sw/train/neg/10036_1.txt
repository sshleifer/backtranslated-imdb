Sometimes I can't understand what directors think when making a film ... I had trouble after looking around (2007) and I think that they can't do it again. But after the mysterious cargo of wonder, Tashan finally finished as a heart attack. These 3 amazing songs in promo - Dil Haara, Chhaliya and Tashan Mein ..... and what you get in the movies? The story of zero, a predictable plot, a lot of Akshay Kumar's queues and nothing interesting to watch Kareena after losing its great weight! !!! <br /> <br /> Music of another great tragedy ... in the music album, they have used the time to give a good dialogue to these 4 artists and did not think to give a history of history when Akshay Kumar performed stunts ... The song is so beautiful, it is very similar to Tashan Mein and which is not in the music album !!! :-( If you plan to watch this film, I would like to say, see to listen to the original song that goes like ... 'Bachchan Bachchan Pandey ...' has made an attempt to speak bad English! <br /> <br /> Go away from someone, I need to beat!
