Okay ... I watch many bad movies. I am proud of that fact. There are often jewelery in the explosive bombs. But this movie is one of the worst I watched. I love a good movie awesome ... but one of the plot and sense of movement. Opening events seemed very good. Good music and pictures. Then it flows down the hill from there. One of the main characters has a disability (Right on ears called Tinnitus). Now this will also threaten to reveal its secrets. They did so with a very high purpose of the movie. So what he blows in his ears and suddenly he hears the ear of the place where it should not be. No need to continue lifting. So this person has a relationship with this girl and in motel falls and hits her head on the last table. So instead of letting everyone know about his thing he chooses to give us a body. Now her twin sister is trying to find out where she is and what happened to her. Well after seeing his sister regularly (like a zombie as a soul) and even referring directly to the body of the body that finally finds him. Now the body is found again and placed to be dealt with by one suspect and one who killed him. The worst thing is that he did not have a lot of plan. Just pretend to be her twin and meet the guy where the body was thrown. The child did not believe and even killed him. So it's all revealed there and even though he had a gun .... somehow he could get into it. So the last events of the movie are the "spirits" of him and his twine walk out of the water. So you mean to tell me in this film the success of the boy. And not two innocent people die. Good things about the movie: pictures <br /> <br /> Bad things about the movie: sound sounds and the release of misrirection of the bridge under the bridge do from others not all actors
