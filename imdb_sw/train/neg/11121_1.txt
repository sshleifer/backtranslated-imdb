In fact I can't understand how a person can give this more disgusting film 1 ... How can you enjoy such a lost film, where all the scratches of animal abuse are real? I don't even want to think of the pain that the innocent and unsaved people feel at the time of the ... Jesus ... What kind of a "human" that would torment them like that without cause, or just for money? I tell you, the director may lose his mind, or he is just a monster who has 'heart' of stones. Or both. He certainly deserves to raise his hands and burn alive. It has various horrible events that can cause shock, especially for sensitive people and children: a real frog is a living skin, fish are badly beaten and thrown into the water, dogs are beaten, birds thrown into water ... <br /> <br /> This movie is more than bad; It should be the worst films and ever lost, plus another, called '' Cannibal Holocaust '' or something like that. I will not watch or buy any film directed by this non-monster monster. No one should waste his time to look at it, especially when there are so many real movies out there, where all the cases of animal abuse are planned. Unfortunately, only a few people liked this - which is natural, for it is the worst movie ever - so it did not succeed. I hope this will cause the lost director to realize that such abusive acts of extreme violence and violence against real animals will not be praised, and that he will arrange all the incidents of animal abuse in the following films. I really believe that everyone accepts but what they give! There will be a day when 'all' people who have rejected and cruel will feel the same pain that they have given to others. <br /> <br /> This, however, may be just '' negative ''. I don't usually know the movie's comments if I don't like it, but this time I can't just be closed. I had to tell the truth, because the abuse of animals must stop!
