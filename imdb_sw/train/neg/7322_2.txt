I will give them credit where the loan is expected, and say that Linda Fiorentino gives good performance as a hard-acting actor who does what he wants. He is a brash, sassy, ​​hard-edged, and very much; he is better than this film deserves. <br /> <br /> But that's IT. This permanent stereotype is a splitting mess, trying to be once exciting, the wonder of murder, the story of honesty and betrayal, and the thrill of excitement. Movies, my friends, is not good for a bit. For example, who decided to beat C. Thomas Howell as someone to lead? He is not bad, but with a loud voice, it seems like a goddess of Fiorentino hard-cookie keeps up with a kindergarten teacher. Howell has no authority or screens to fill the role of leading man. <br /> <br /> Script is far beyond the film. There is no tension as Fiorentino's character receives mobile phones, no secret about his guilt in the murder which is the aim of the film, no sense of redemption as Fiorentino gets Howell wimpy losing his inhibitions. See the beautiful but unused gifts by Adam Ant and Issac Hayes, and one true sex zone between Howell and Fiorentino. Besides, my first impression will put this huge piece of rubbish down and rent anything else.
