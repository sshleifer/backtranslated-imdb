Leslie Sands' stilted play "Bride" becomes a bad car for the choice Bette Davis and Gary Merrill, only after their joint success in "All About Eve". After killing his wife, a foolish woman is visited by a good friend of her husband, who isolates herself as her husband once others start leaving home. Irving Rapper, one of the best directors of Bette from his peak years, can not overcome this bold material, which Davis is very strange to prevent up to the end of the genius (where he takes all thanks). Production and support are second-rate; only for Bette Davis producers. * 1/2 from ****
