It was at 9:30 pm on the trailer of my friend and we were supposed to look at the South Park (new part). The thing is, in my country, South Park is approaching at 10:30 and we decided to kill time by watching the show now saying, Father of Pride. I will start by saying that I just looked at the intervals. The first time I looked at it, I found it unhappy and free of charge, so I thought '' Holy sh * t, I have a football game early tomorrow, so I must stop watching stupid cartoons. But yesterday, I tried to give the Father of Glory a second chance. I find it to be the absolute end of The Simpsons, just replace the yellow characters and worshipers instead. The second thing I ask is why it was a TV-14 rating. I see the worst Simpsons, and the only real damage in this show is a few jokes of gay (unfunny). The Simpsons are also more violent (Halloween experts) and abnormal. I also heard that the creator of the series also directed Shrek 2, well I have heard of him: Shrek 2 was the best way and I think he stayed so much in the family theme. However, I must admit that the Father of Glory has made me smile (even crack once) three or four times. All of them, I don't know the Father of Glory. I don't like, but I don't like either. I found the best way from '' The Simpsons ''. <br /> <br /> 3.5 / 10
