OMG is one of the worst films that have ever seen and iv have seen so much I am a film student. I don't understand why Angelina Jolie will be on this film? Did he need money that was bad? I love AJ and I have seen almost everything that she has ever had so I watched this one ticket off. It was a bad SOO! even worse, very bad. It had a short 1 or 2 short but everything was bad n. The plan is predictable unless you expect to tell Romeo and Juliet then not. All horrible. Maybe if this 12 could be a good film otherwise I wouldn't recommend it.
