Like most people I love "Christmas stories". I have never heard this film and perhaps for good reasons - it's bad. The same situation, one author, the same director but fuzziness of natural heat was not present. Charles Grodin was a good choice to replace Darrin McGavin but I can't imagine anyone can manage him. The story seems to be forced and has no natural taste. Interact with neighbors, Bumpuses, is ridiculous. In "Christmas Story" The ears of Ralphie and the BB gun seem to be good but his patience in this movie is boring. Scud Farkus, a former neighbor of hate, is transformed into this film with another child with braces and weird hats but with a bit of Scud Farkus despair of despair. It would be very difficult to compare the original, even if this film was made by the original staff.
