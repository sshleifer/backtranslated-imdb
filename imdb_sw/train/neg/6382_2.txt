It is difficult to know what has happened to the head of Per Kristensen and Morten Lindberg when they wrote "Gayniggers from outside space" - the movie is called as a comedy, but there is no true joke rather than the names of odds (Capt B. Dick, Sgt balls). Other parts of the film are strange (no doubt) with no sense of emotion and sound voices (including 'characters' basically reading their lines without feeling of emotion), computers 'futuristic films' the spelling, and the plot that makes almost no meaning. Even though 65% viewers have given this film 10 out of 10 full, this is the exact opposite of what a good film. It may be ENTERTAINING to watch with other friends, but this film only deserves on '2' between ten ... a little more than the lowest possible score just because of the real fact that authors somehow managed to get other black star stars in the film this.
