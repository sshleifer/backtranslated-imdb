Average audience is looking for any sense of local cooperation in the film should give them directly. It generates a similar feeling as it appears on the curious array of individual images that seem to have another connection to another, but they are not completely inclusive. When this isolation technique to create a form of montage movies can appeal to a few students or critics who have entered the local language of contemporary films, it is very irritating and obscure for ordinary people who just fell on haywagon. The more unavoidable access can be a deliberate mark of the authors like Kar-wai Wong and Tarantino, but for me comes as Andy Warhol high temperature. The only character of the redemption I get is in the production of production, and there they do not want to cut it all out of themselves. This is one of those products that you watch and listen and wait for anxiety and free for clever development of ideas or ideas to develop all the wonderful and beautiful scenes. Sorry. Calligraphic loans without expectation begin to decline only if your interest begins to stimulate. I get a great yawn similar to allowing reading reading I think is a very good and comprehensive view of this film that is not worth anything. Thoughts and images without an external context are not my sense of enjoyment. Invite the penis around the Hong Kong area for a suey bowl. <br /> <br />
