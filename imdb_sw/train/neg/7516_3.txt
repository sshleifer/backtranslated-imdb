I lease, so shoot me! <br /> <br /> A good column puts an awkward story with no real benefit, but at least it's shot well. Director Jon Keeyes takes a simple idea of ​​a fake house with real dangers inside. Often this should be slam dunk, but this little stinker decreases very quickly. Style is on average and acting is the best mediocre, but the story and writing are just plain bad. Reduced incidence remains forever and very few events are in the center of the film's realities. A good feeling is put in the beginning but it is easily lost before any kind of fear is frightening, and I find myself exhausting and making another sandwich ... Insurance art is interesting and I think it's worth rental if you are looking for a dreck of less worthless budget, but if you love the good news and the end of the events, get to anything else.
