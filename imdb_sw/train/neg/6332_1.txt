I expected to see this movie when it came out, since I was a big fan of SNL. When my partner and I went to see it, people who came out of the first show shouted, "Don't waste your money!" But we certainly needed to get ourselves. When there were a few funny moments (Laser Bra 2000, Root Boy Slim), many of them felt like it would have been edited up to an exciting 1 hour show. It was very bad. When the opera singer arrived, many people got up and went out. This made me laugh, because I realized that O'Donoghue was increasingly on people's bonds for this purpose and this movie. Or perhaps he was just mad. Whatever - you don't need to waste your time to look at it, it's bad.
