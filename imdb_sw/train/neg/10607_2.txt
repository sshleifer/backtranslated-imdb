Jean Claude Van Damme tries to save his work by making the Universal Army. But, what? The movie saved him? I think he is going to hell, after death. <br /> <br /> In the first minute, we see in the center, where you can see the bad guy of the film. Scary, huh? But it's not as scary as acting (notes follow). Then, we see Van Damme and the black girl (don't remember the name .... well does not matter yet), trying to escape from some muscle people. Of course they are the Universal-Keeper. More ears, lower brain (just like the film). Over time, Van Damme fights Goldberg but then "message" is closed. It was only a test (Is this a film test for our nerves?). It turns out that Van Damme works for the government on the new Universal Army project (Who saw the first movie might think that this is the most important thing, that the demolition of Van Dammes could do). But it's sequel. And the "story" comes. Ah, I forgot. She has a daughter. Very useful for "stories". <br /> <br /> Well, after 20 minutes, a big computer hears a conversation about closing and leaving the project. Of course the cube is angry and convinces all soldiers to kill everyone. Van Damme runs from the center But the computer sends some soldiers to hunt him (He wants Van Damme as a soldier - because he is the best (really?)). And I think what, Goldberg is one of the hunters, who was always a penalty for the audience before getting a doctor. Funny? Yes, such as the remaining film. <br /> <br /> After some "story", Van Damme tries to save his daughter (his wife - a writer in the first movie). It comes to the last show where Van Damme is fighting with Bad Guy and you can see the most expensive area of ​​the whole movie (please see yourself. It's very funny to tell him). <br /> <br /> You will see that this film is a waste of time. Do not look at it. But if you do, put your six with you!
