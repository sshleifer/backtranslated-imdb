These reviews may have other damages. Removal of an old 1974 expired movie When it was in the second 60 seats it starts well. It is really good to act and plot goes very well. But even the big budget of Hollywood does not change the fact that the original plot was more reliable. For those who do not know, the initial plot had thieves who work as insurance inspectors. Who would accuse them. But even with changes around every aspect of H.B. The original Halicki, remake is a very good movie, until we reach the final location, the 74th edition that made it great. In this version is poured water, only 10 minutes, and faces a special effect of the monster which takes all the faith out of the dismissal. Where the initial transfer was widely believed, the star was a cheat driver who made his own stunt, remake falls flat in the last 15 minutes. My advice, if you want to watch a classic car expelling film, fine natural in bargain bin in your lease as well as stay clear of a new remake.
