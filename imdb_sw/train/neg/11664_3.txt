I wanted to enjoy this film. It moved very slowly and was just boring. If it were on television, it would have taken 15 to 20 minutes, maybe. What happened to the story? Casting by the big photographer worked on the wrong base. If this depends on the life of the director, why did not find someone to see that the text itself was "free". Then he led the speed of the snail which could be the source of the few people who come during the movie. Music increases, but with different films, not this .... with soap opera saga possible. There was a time when the discussion was misunderstood when Armin Meuller Stahl spoke. I was not alone, because I heard a few conversations about who spoke to him. Why Hollywood can't make the best movies? He had a nugget of good news, but he was just hanging wrong.
