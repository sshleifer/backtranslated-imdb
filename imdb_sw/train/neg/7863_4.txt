TH2 is entertaining that you will laugh a lot with a blow and maybe say "oh sh * t!" and "get your face off the pit of God you are dumb ** s" or things along those lines but I don't know if it's worth seeing - I was very angry at the fullness and horrible military characters who don't seem to know the first thing about the fight. Yes, there was more violence, gore, and a higher body than the first but still discussing whether it would erase my feelings on all the films about how stupid is (and not as good as Dead Alive or Feast ). My time would be better to look at the Aja wage at the time of 5.5/3 <br /> Go to some laugh, or go to some year, but don't go expecting to come from that satisfaction.
