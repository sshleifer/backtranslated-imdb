"Spirit of Dragstrip Hollow" seems to occur in netherworld without spot, a long period of time, where a great sin child can do will be in protest against the law and get a traffic ticket. It opens with a little girl girl getting a business from her opponent, who runs on a car race. That's on racing-drag - this B Flick is strongly associated with rock 'rock, man! The Americans of the Americans were very clear to the respectable, square-minded youth who loved the party and still did not have the adult's mind. There are a few interesting double and fruity exchange (Necking Kid: "We thought we'd come to the fresh air" ... Father: "What do you think you would find, under his throat?"), But the spirit is a little late when it comes. In short for 65 minutes, the movie hits us with a race of cars that happens off the screens before "Scooby Doo" hit by unmasking which is useless. However, for the buffs of nostalgia, some fun no matter what. ** from ****
