There is enough star capacity in HOUSE OF SPIRITS to create another galaxy, but the final product is very good. The movie and its message are very good, and I think maybe many will agree with them. (Independence of democracy, the government of the roughness of evil, transparency, discrimination, etc.). Unfortunately, we are suffering from head to toes and these, and many tricks are used as I have explained them. Finally, we are left to look at the most respectful people without any mistake that has emerged and the bad cretins who do not have the characteristics of redemption. It shines and doubts all matches to combat "pro" to fight wrong. Jeremy Irons has a pastor, a very opposed man. Meryl Streep as his bride and Glenn Close, as his sister. When the camera stays with these people, the film tends to move, and it is quite fun. Unfortunately, the Spiritual House holds only a small small way, and the characters climb out and out of the picture as the target of the gallery of shooting. We don't know them, so we can't care. The result is boredom. If Bille August, the director and photographer of the picture (from Isabel Allende book) could add a film or photograph a few, this film may have worked quite well. As it stands, it was a good attempt, with a good message, and extra yawnfest. <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
