Why are you worried to see this film, if you have good movies to see. It's a waste of time and time. The movie is so bad that I felt bad for wanting to look at it. Everything in it is BAD. Pastors were bad. The document was really bad. The story is stupid. And CGI EVER worse. The only good time was the first 60 seconds of the movie at the strip club. One interesting thing that, there is a reputation that we want to die because, she is so stupid that we get enough of her (I don't remember the name but it is BOYFRIEND of "Selected".) , this movie is incorrect. 0 stars out of 10
