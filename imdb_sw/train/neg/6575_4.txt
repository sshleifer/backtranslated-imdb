An interesting film about the actual event took place during the Battle of Vermont. It put my thoughts to the end and I am not willing to look at it. I have never read any of this invasion so I was eager to see if the rebels had removed it. I enjoy historical films from that time. My biggest complaint is for Confederate uniforms. They look very good !!! Acting was a little hard time. I love an old man to eat cooked potatoes because he had no teeth. The wounded soldier playing play with the hound was a little strange. In general, it was a natural film.
