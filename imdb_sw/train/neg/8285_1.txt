This may be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Jessica Simpson don't only have the skills to work, but the script is very strange and foam. In fact you hear a great conversation that goes, "I love you more." "No, I love you more." I stopped watching the film (online) after the first half, I couldn't take it again. "Charm" of the girl "south" does not work and is really quite angry; His experiments in the humor of slapstick falls flat and he offers lines as he reads the script right off the page. Luke Wilson. What? Did not read the script before accepting to do so, or fell to Pope Joe (the father of Jessica and also the producer of the movie) promises a great profit? I hope now knows better than getting into another film like this. Luke Wilson is a good actor - I hate to see the pain on his face if he is hurt through bad conversation. <br /> Also, I think the original presenter gave this film out of 8 out of 10 maybe either participating in the film somehow or employed by Pope Joe to give the movie a better score. No one in their right mind can find this film. Jessica has a lot of money, right? Maybe you buy acting lessons?
