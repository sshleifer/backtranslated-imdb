I have seen many movies and rarely would like to measure the movie "1" but this film was awesome. The action was wrong, the plot was ridiculous, the consequences were untrue and the characters were not. Usually when I watch scary movies I think it's DUMB when the characters hear the noise in the house / forest / school / etc and then explains "hello is anyone there?" - but at least they are believed to do so. This movie could not even get that right. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that will make other B-horror movies like Stations and Fog look like a talent for winning a professional award. I have had an open mind when I watch the movies and I can only say this movie was a full-time waste and I write this comment so that anyone thinking about watching this film will think again. IT'S AWFUL!
