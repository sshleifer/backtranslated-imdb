In spite of a good touch of the future, the sensitivity of Asimov, and the cold performance of Will Smith, this film does not live up to expectations. Clich√©s comes thick and fast; (with a recurring dream, the maverick soldiers have its cut-badge and a lieutenant hardass, more writing can destroy it - you can see at the end of the kilometer). This movie also continues - you never feel that you've walked anywhere; what is supposed to be a global catastrophe never leaves the CGI Chicago. Robots themselves are good at close, but the 'crowd' looks more like a bad Disney - CGI has gone again. And if you can damage the robots for smoked, why do they need to insert 'nanites'? You know it's a duff movie when such stupid questions start to explore you before the peak. It may be good, but it is less than its total parts, mainly because of a prediction of predicting which can be from any film of forty years ago.
