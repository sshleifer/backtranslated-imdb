That is true, you heard me this film is 'LOOK'. First, the band, which hell will go to see or listen to the band called "NAKED BROTHERS BAND"? It's not just a terrible name but it's also musicians, they can't even play anything! Also, the leading singer looks more girly than Geddy Lee, and even more so his voice is awesome! They are not only terrible but they are terrible actors. Directed by the crappy director and a thin plot, this should be an unusual film ever. I would like this site to allow you to use ZERO or NYEWA votes out of 10, because giving this dirty 1/10 is that WAY also offers. I don't know that you can call this comedy film. If you are looking for comedy and music, go to "Weird Al" Yankovic guy 'because he will do better than these unnecessary tweens.
