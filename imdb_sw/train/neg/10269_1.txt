This movie is bad. for anger, i mean bad. I was so happy to see the dry color in my local hardware store on the morning when I suffered from migraine and heat stroke. The acting continued to increase further when the "movie" continued, and the drug users used to appear that the last events were approaching. when misty was shot to death he decided that it would be wise to right after the mordem. that is not mind. In fact, the incredible stevie could be caught that with his eyes closed. if you decide between playing with a guns of a nail while drinking and watching this film, remember that the nail nail will give you the best story to tell your friends.
