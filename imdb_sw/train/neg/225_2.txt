AUTHOR: A young girl, Jed, taken with spinster, Kate (Andie McDowell), because she believes that Jed has a relationship with one of her two girlfriends. Kate thought she took them in delicto flagrante. Kate gives us Jed shoes out of the door. Jed was surprised, then he sat down in the middle of his footsteps. Then he runs on the "Slave", one of the head of the head) and the truck. And die. <br /> <br /> "Then he runs." What? Can you imagine a screens actually presenting the script for this feature? Until then, his comedy which is expecting to be bad, but has not got a real fizz. Everyone but Jed is just angry. Then kills Jed, and sadly everyone, to the end where gals learn to love and support, rather than destroy. I offer 2 ugh's.
