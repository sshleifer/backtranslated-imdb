Boy oh boy oh golly gee, something that was very interesting on the film was a bluescreen effect used to make "invisible" to Mama. They looked like they were hit on an affordable video, and it looked completely untrue, and even the best way that is so incredibly so close to the movie ... The "shoadicam" shots attempt was also sad. I mean, hey, if you had a flick of the bottom of the budget, that's good. You can still make a great movie with a low budget. But, the movie BAD with minimal budget and effects. That makes a bad mix. In this case, the damaged combo formed a craptastic film, "The invisible mother." If you have children, and your children have no taste, maybe they will stay awake through all this.
