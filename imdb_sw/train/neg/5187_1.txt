I can't go and reflect the RAW's theories. I mean, this is a website about movies and if the movie is opening or well done, it's not a philosophy that discusses on the site. When you say this, this video is easy. It's one of the talking-head of RAW after another. Some of these are video memory, so you can see how old they are over the years, and that's very good. But, otherwise, the visual experience cannot be misleading. It is a wonderful comparison, but I continued to think on Sunday afternoon when I saw some of the Carra Streisand star car * Funny Lady * (another very bad movie). After a while, I was OD'd on Barbra, I wanted to have one area that would not be seen: you know, "at the same time, other characters in the film were up to something else ..." time. But it was all about Barbra. Well this video is RAW's * Lady Lady Funny *. So, if your idea of ​​a good time is looking often takes on the face of RAW's face when it breaks down with his theories, they have gathered in the form of a defect that does not add any interest or understanding, then be my guest . For me, I couldn't take after 20 minutes.
