You remember Spice Girls' movies and how bad they were (instead of songs), also their manager Simon Fuller (also the manager of this band) makes a similar mistake to the Club (one of my favorite bands) on their films. S Club: Tina Barrett, Jon Lee, Bradley Mcintosh, Jo O'Meara, Hannah Spearritt and Rachel Stevens (happened to the seventh member, Paul Cattermole?) Basically asking their master for breaking, they continue, and when they see themselves on TV! Three of them change, and vice versa, half finds that it is a clones made by a passionate scientist, and the other half finds themselves in trouble. Also star Gareth Gates as clone yourself. This film can be more conspicuous than the Spice Girls film, but instead of "Bring It All Back", "Do not Stop Movin" and "Never Had a Way to Come True" this is not a reason to see this film. It is not long after the band split the useful. Enough!
