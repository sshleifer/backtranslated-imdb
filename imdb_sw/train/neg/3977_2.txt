The twin ordinary sister Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen climbed a reputation in a sitcom as "two kind", I never seen them in anything before, but I had an idea of ​​what to expect, but it was worse. Basically, the sister of Char Charli (Mary-Kate) and Leila (Ashley) in Rome for the Summer Summer Program, but not long after starting their work once they are evicted from a series of publications. But the person who owns the company they work with, Derek Hammond (Julian Stone), gives them their work back, and they emerge slowly to be a good asset, and talented artists, and help prevent a meaningful person from taking a company. Also star Leslie Danon as Jami, Derek Lee Nixon as Ryan, Ilenia Lazzarin like Dari, Kao Archie as Nobu, Valentina Mattolini like Heidi, Michelangelo Tommaso as Paolo and Matt Patresi like Enrico Tortoni. You can tell them that this film was made to go directly to the video, the function of the camera is completely beaten, and it is not appropriate when you want to please the Roman stuff. In fact the background is the only interesting thing, the twin sisters are two of the most sad celebrities, I realized before they watched that they would not share with us in any way (they were not the same), this is the burning of the rubbish film. Beautiful poor!
