I agree to be a fan of original production action. I have never seen a version of the film until recently on the cable, and watched it in anticipation, to see my records again, because I did the original show. Think of my shame. <br /> <br /> This should be the worst interpretation of the Broadway show for the ever made film. They changed stories, changed songs, lost souls. I expected a trip under memory memory, singing to the Music of Interesting and Mirror, In Ballet, and Twelve Tumi, Hello Tumi and three. Not! Not only did they mix music to an unknown stage, but they destroyed the story of the story, and add songs and programs outside (hello Cassie and Michael Douglas) not in the original, and injecting "drama" where it was not necessary. The original was enough pathos alone. If you were a fan of the original Broadway show, don't bother. Sorry I lost my time, and bought my records, see this introduction.
