Think about the end of Grudge 2 and the following: <br /> <br /> - a person who constantly says the word Sunshine - cowboy - a love story - Sarah Michelle Gellar cut yourself - with a creepy mirror <br /> <br / > OH AND WORK OF WORKING WORKS ... yay ... <br /> <br /> Not a good movie ... I wasn't very happy. Cards for cinemas also lead to misleading and I found that it was just absorbing people to look at ... I can't believe I went. Save your time and money ... visit See III ... The film where the literature makes you wonder if there was an effort put into it ... <br /> <br /> Im Mike and Im out
