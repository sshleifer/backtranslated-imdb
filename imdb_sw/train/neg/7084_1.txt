As many others said, this is a bad movie, from every aspect of film making. How they got other name-makers known to take this project is amazing. Many people have complained that they were shot at cheap video cameras. Yes, it was shot on the video, but not a 'cheap' video. What made it worse was lighting, white balance, shot and editing techniques. There are many methods of shooting and editing that have been used to be a breach of production. Hara, lighting, lighting on the use of hand-held bullets (Ala Woody Allen), the editing of choppy (another method of Allen), but it doesn't work well, without a real purpose. <br /> <br /> The lack of white balance in the kitchen of the restaurant events is embarrassing; very amateurish. The incidents of sexual intercourse were not worth doing at any rate. <br /> <br /> How this ever published video is over me. It is important to check if you just wonder how bad.
