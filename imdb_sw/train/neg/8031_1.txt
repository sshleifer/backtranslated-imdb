The American Humana Agency, which is the source of known "No harmless animals" ... (registered trademark of AHA), began to monitor the use of animals in film production over the past 60 years, after the horse was forced to fly his death from the rock to the shooting of Jesse James (1939). Without saying, the act of anger kills the whole aspect of this film for me. I think one might say that at least a horse did not die for free, because it was the beginning of the people who wake up with pain and pain that caused animals to make a film, but I can't help but feel that if a poor animal had a choice, this certainly wouldn't be a way he would have!
