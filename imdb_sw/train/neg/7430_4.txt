It is interesting to see the image of Pierce Brosnan's work was before Bond arrived on the scene. In this exciting "time", Pierce Brosnan plays gentle Patrick, who works to lead the children of ghetto on "self-confidence courses". He loves a woman, who has a 90-year-old baby named Eric. The man who had gone to the drink immediately came to the area and began to destroy with Pierce. <br /> <br /> At one point Pierce does "vegeburgers" without guilt. The man comes in. Pierce begins again making vijiburgers. The man will attack Pierce. The small handles of a half vegeburger call fall from Pierce's mouth. This final clash without showing results. This is good if the film gets. <br /> <br />
