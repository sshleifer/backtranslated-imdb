I would like to mention many funny movies. There is a surprise that you have seen to be funny, and it is. Some movies, like Gymkata for example, try to be bad but end up funny. The Ladies Man is a film that tries to be surprising, but it can not be strange if it was on a boy who found many chicks in the middle of a nuclear death. It's a funny-funny. I don't think I laughed harder than chuckle anything in this film. Not just want. It's boring, stupid, angry, angry, mind-bogglingly rough, but it's not funny. I don't care particularly for Tim Meadows, or this behavior from SNL, but I expected better than this. <br /> <br /> Movie doesn't lack logic or common sense. It's like the author of the script had a bag on his head while writing and could not see the keys he played. They say the "nature" of Ladies Man, but they can not inspire its amazing inspiration and act if it is still seventy years. The movie tries to get humor out of someone who seems fun and porn, shortly after trying to self-reliance. This is a comedy? I like to think of myself having a good sense of humor (Spending a lot of time to write comedy like me), but maybe I'm not only quite sharp enough for this film. <br /> <br /> Lee Evans, so funny as Tucker There There About Mary, is very bad here. I was pleading with my head to be closed. Finally I was rolling over my seat, whispering under my breath, and having a movie again, maybe they had attempted suicide. This film can be as bad as the World War, but it's the first movie I've got that is approaching. <br /> <br />
