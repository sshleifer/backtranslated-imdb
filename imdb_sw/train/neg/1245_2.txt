Completely the worst movie still with Burton, who seems to be the worst for every leading film. The sad script carrying and restrictions is the first part of the most unfavorable part of this film. This is a kind of movie where everything happens, you will surely hear someone coming out "lost his gun!" or whatever it is to let everyone know. Carter is very bad and so Wahlberg, who can not play this automatically and have a lobby. Very good effects and photography, but limited music in the John Williams mold and Burton Elfman hole. Heston looks at the nonsensichal area to lose its famous sayings of catch from the first movie. Very serious consequences. If anyone out there has also seen "Right to Sleep", perhaps they will see, as I am, the quality of the decrease of Burton films. I have heard that this special project was produced by others and that Burton was brought as a director, where his case should be questioned. But I think he has allowed any possible vision he might have earlier in his work inserted; The evidence is in the film. In "Hollow Hollow", he could not decide what kind of movie he was doing, whether it was a comedy or a real horror movie, and a number of actors of the British character (Chris Lee, etc.) to make you also think it was a kind of monster rally film ( they are never afraid, as fans of fear know. The movie could not succeed with fear or comedy because it was schizophrenic, and no style was introduced to remove these two. "Planet of Api" is the same way, and the result comes more like "Total Memory" or "Tango and Money" than as sci-fi. He has also fallen into the leadership of many other "chiefs" to try to satisfy all the audience as possible. The word for Burton, if you're out - choose something and do the same, or use a particular style for all the peice together (like in "Mars Attacks" or "Beetlejuice") or you can also retire, because people like me are fans of your movies stops going.
