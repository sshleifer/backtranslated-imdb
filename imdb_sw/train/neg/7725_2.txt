This film is one of the worst films that are not available. Dolph Friggin 'Lundren with a Japanese sense is enough, but add a true buddy-buddy step with a mixture, a high and high-top village, a clich√©d love attraction and one of the longest of all time, and you've found own suicide-inducing therapy for people who enjoy their lives and, up to check "Showdown," did not think never kill themselves with a blowtorch. I don't know if it's just me but all the subject of homosexuality is not a trick. There are frequent references to male penis, and not to women, either. Brandon Lee and Dolphin are talking about everyone's place, and really before going to suicide, Brandon says to Dolphy, "If we don't do that, I want to tell you, you have d-- I've ever seen." what is this ordinary person could tell someone else? In the ACTION film is not down? And would you like those to be your words? Later, there is this gem: <br /> <br /> Dolph (about man): "I would like to cut a certain part of its anatomy." Brandon: "Man, you have a compensation." If RuthlessReviews.com's boy said, "Unfortunately, Dolph doesn't know," I have a revision? I've had a revision? You decided that his last words should be about my privacy! I was ignoring the ears her and his nose, the man. "<br /> <br /> This is the unpleasant things of silence and great joy if you are a person who enjoys receiving root roots from dentists without milk, without novocain. It's on par. Enjoy so much for the whole family!
