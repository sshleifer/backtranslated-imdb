I respect the fact that this is a very popular show. However, in comparison with Robert Altman ingenious, hilarious, zany, and groundbreaking 1970 classic movie, this show probably last to be less-of-mediocre ... even if he didn't run for 11 years, which doesn't necessarily have any good. This exhibition formed all-important parts of my early childhood (it was on re-runs every night, and I think whose parents look at it and laughing it up), but it's one of the memories I don't miss. And now that I have seen the movie, I can give this series the correct definition. On its own, not nearly "2 out of 10" bad. However, the characters on this show have nothing like those on the film. Some of them technical are the same, but they are just the same as the name. For example, since the time of Alan Alda something else like Donald Sutherland? His style of humor is quite different, as well as his attitude and attitude. New characters are not great; they only serve to forget those who change. It is similar to new actors (including Jamie Farr). The only thing that actually transfer to the series is the radar, who still (even if played with one actor) only the color of the imitation of nature. What else? Oh yes. With laughter track (I did not care if it was used in surgical scenes or not), it comes across as creepy, given what is going on in the other environment. And because it lasted about four times longer than real Korean War, it takes viewers to have this wonderful crack time that does not work out the world of cartoons. I've never loved this show, and I never.
