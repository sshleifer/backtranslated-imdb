I watched the film, and I was afraid to say at least that the movie could not communicate with me as listeners. The language would be embarrassing to the roads. <br /> <br /> Plan; the father does not force his son to marry, it seems to be too much. The idea of ​​a grandmother asking her child to be a pastor and an enemy will lose the mind of a weak mind. <br /> <br /> ... and I waited for the whole movie for a laugh, and laughter I did for my ignorance to lose 3 hours to inform myself that the movie is not worth watching first. <br /> <br /> Hope saves you your time!
