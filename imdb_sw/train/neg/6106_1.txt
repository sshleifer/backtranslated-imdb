This was just a horrible plot was the same, but the rest were bad. I mean coming to the puppet and then tried to make digital movie and that made it worse! Usually I like a small movie budget but this was just a waste of time and almost made me come back to the set which came. I have about the low-budget films set by film like 6-8 on them and I'd like to say this is the worst movie. Also the words have been erased and they are using fake plastic matches that will not be seen even as true, they can use one that looks even less close to real truth so you can save your time and money and don't look at this bad movie.
