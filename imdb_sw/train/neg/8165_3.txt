It's a spirit story. It's a sex story. It is a story of revenge. It is a very non-violent film. I think it follows for cheap on each movie's slasher lines which you have ever seen. It has a unique place, the cocky inhabitants, moved to the desert. In fact, there are some very beautiful images. It's just so slow. Bad editing and all work. There are spiritual children who seem to speak on the waste waste. I do not know the principles of ghosts and psychology and the seed hat are played by. It also has a place where a person eats a piece of meat that is actually left of his wife. My friend once asked me why it is important to show this kind of improper, ill-treatment. I am afraid that it is just another step in our preference reform. Three is not a clever here, no tongue in the cheek, just waste time. A lot of blood; little plot.
