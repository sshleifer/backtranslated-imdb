No, it's not a horrible movie ... This is really a love story. <br /> <br /> Ring is a silent film from 1927 which two star boxers and a woman comes among them. He loves the boxer known as Jack "One Round". He loves him until the champion comes, that's it. Although she married One Cycle, she begins to play hard with champion until the end of the boxing fight between One Round and champion. He comes back to one corner of the Round, when only the things look better, and gets the inner strength to win the battle and win his wife back. This film was very early in Hitch's work, but the shortcomings of time should not make him a permanent film. Although there are special tricks of the film, and some comedy relief, this film is not recommended until its future career. It must have been very dangerous for that period, though, with a woman who was embarrassed. That can be established back in 1927. When you look through these old films, it's amazing how I think that they can be approved on today's screen and come true. Maybe I must be .... <br /> <br /> Skip this movie unless you plan to watch all Hitchcock films. You can sleep in the middle.
