I lost this film because I expected one family to benefit. Although the movie is a family friendly, my family is not good because it gives a false view of God. If you obey God and follow Him, you will not succeed. Your football team will not always win. You can't get the best score. Infertility is not always treated. It always gets increasing. Sometimes, you will be connected to an old car. God does not meet anything. Instead, we were created to glorify him. Sometimes we glorify Him when things seem to be bad for us. Living is Christ; The die is profitable.
