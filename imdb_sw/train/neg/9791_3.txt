Basically this is about a couple who want to adopt a second child. In the approved organization they meet the mouse (Stuart) and decide to accept it. If you think this is stupid, hold, because it gets worse. Stuart came to his new home, where he was treated as a human child. (Spare me!) Others are pretty cliché naturally, about family problems, envy from the old "brother", and last end all issues are resolved and all are "happy family". The decay and disappearance like this is, shown in the most unfamiliar and modern way. I don't know if the director believed that he was creating creativity by introducing a mouse to a photo, or he was trying to fill in just a minute, but he stopped the recipe just because of stimulation and hatred. <br /> <br /> Then why did I give 3 and not ZERO? Because of the family cat, who loves Stuart as well as "brother". And because of some funny gigs, where Stuart uses its great size. I generally believe that the film will work well if: a. Stuart was PET and not "brother". b. It had already put out the extraordinary gigs, as Stuart tried to announce the cat, and had gone out of the boring clichés which was not even suitable for anything else.
