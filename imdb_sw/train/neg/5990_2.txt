I haven't seen all this yet; runs on the cable right now, and I seem to keep coming in the middle of it. My main reason to be interested is that I am a fan Bill Paxton; he is a very good actor, and he has turned into a good job every time on his job. Another thing is that, when you are never a fan of the previous series, I kinda liked Thunderbirds for shipping and effect work. Derek Meddings was most likely in the business during the seventy-seventy years, and its international reserves of Rescue Reserves are amazing. The current team has done a good job of translating its work into a large screen. <br /> <br /> BUT ... <br /> <br /> This is one story of the lame. Children are asked to drive, and while they are doing a good job, it is difficult to stop your unbelief, especially when you have a 8-year-old child of Brains, a huge tons of tons and a whole all-aerodynamics. Everywhere you look, you see a Ford logo. Product placement is the way up here, and irritating. Ben Kingsley is doing a good job as The Hood, but he can do just one-dimensional role. If you can accept the film on its very small features, Thunderbirds is a fun, enjoyable journey. Do not look closely at the running machine. <br /> <br /> ADDENDUM: Finally I saw all this, and it's worse than I thought. Acting is poor and safe, and when the effects are good, the stories about many viewing have found a cheese. The placement of more than Ford products is furious, and children like the mid-net characters on my remaining nerves. As with the Avengers, if it ignores the source material, it carries. But not so much. See original show, and you'll see what I said. <br /> <br /> And word advice for Jon Frakes. Take a referral course to the Director's Association. You can do better than this, old friend. <br /> <br /> Other info ... <br /> <br /> I saw it again. Last night. On Telemundo. Inserted in Spanish, with sound effects of comedy cheesy. And yes, I came in the middle, with Ben, Ron and Sophia in their war zone against Tracy Island. I didn't think it was possible for a movie that was closed to worse, but it was. It was a terrible disgrace. If this has been done the same, no children-rescuers, no language-in-cheek jokes, would have worked. As it is, it is another joy of childhood childhood that has been destroyed.
