"I am a cartoon!" "You are an example!" What? what does it mean? This program cannot be as bad as a boy, who is afraid of everything, is greatly encouraged by the end of the film because he entered the library. The only purpose of this celluloid waste was to encourage American children to read, while the cheapest and most effective way of doing so could be a series of advertising! Even the talent of Macaulay Culkin (as a child), Christopher Lloyd (as he can predict that he is the First Teacher of the Library), can save this unpopular film from the bright plan. ) Leonard Nimoy, or God of sound, Frank Welker as the cartoon characters do not save it. I can only describe it as the 1990s as a sudden change of Children's Water 1978, because the bland animation makes the film worse, not improve the bad plot!
