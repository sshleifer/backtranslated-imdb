This film was slow but stimulating and acting often left the country of ham. Redgrave's behavior was improper for another 60 woman trying to compete with something of Thurman 20 for the love of Fox (why is more than me). The title of the movie should be "Poor people in the lake". Players played if they were in practice. Expected end of boot. I can't believe this is on this site as comedy!
