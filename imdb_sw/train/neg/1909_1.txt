One of the worst comedies (without, worse movies) I've seen. The boy (who works as a mind phone!) You must pretend to be gay into the house with the woman's dream. Hilarity does not guarantee. Patience, glowing gay-poetry, and bad talk do. If you read Brad Meltzer and as a crappy discussion, you will love this film. <br /> <br /> Be smart. Avoid this. if you see it, destroy the copy.
