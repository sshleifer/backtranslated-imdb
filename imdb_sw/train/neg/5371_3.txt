This film was a disappointment. After very slow, very intense (and quite normal) beginning film will begin to lose. A very big lesson leaves a very little time to explain, and out of the reminder I wondered what this was. The characters do not remain deep, the story is not quite persuasive, most of them are not ideas of understanding, and there are some very nice parts ... Like, the boy needs to do the body dig. Of course it is night and it has she has to do it alone ... yawn! Or Revelation of the "Nazi" evil as well as "genetic destruction" ... Wow, that's original. There are some good bits, though, like a fistfight area, a mountain view and some (run), but (though Reno and Vincent Cassel are doing what they can) certainly not worth it. (3 out of 10)
