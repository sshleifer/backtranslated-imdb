After what I thought was a good performance of the two tasks in Man from the Snowy River, WHY Kirk Douglas was taken by Brian Dennehy in a series? It was not similar to Spur and Harrison, as shown by Douglas. Maybe he realized how the plot was good - Jim returns after a long absence, to get Jessica followed by someone else. He could not expect any girl to wait long without contacting him, and not get competitive. For the Disney movie, this has a bad language, with an unwanted part when Jim & Jessica were beaten unmarried - LAME much. It is a desire for the mind of the audience, according to members of my family. I'll catch him first, and try to forget I've ever seen the peak!
