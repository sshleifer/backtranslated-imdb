This means that the comedy but a very bad taste, and no far to cause a smile in the film. The film is about couples who are trying a child, and those people in real life who are in that situation will remove it from the pictures shown. For example, maternity clinics are not to play and are quite embarrassing. The male leader who plays the construction worker with his hard hats comes up as a bad excuse for refusal from the Village. Female leadership tries to look 20 years more than she. All leads emerges as unappealing, unattractive and completely unconvincing. There are various incredible and incredible scenarios in the film, for example with a budget flight, which is not recommended for any humor. The only reason for giving 3/10 instead of 1/10 is one mark for Shirley Maclaine, who is a class on anything else in the picture, and one mark for half the music (even age).
