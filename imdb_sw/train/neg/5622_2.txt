Okay, apart from the original psychedelic pictures, the details given here were good. Music I could do without (not that it was a bad music, just that didn't fit this film completely). About the content of the film, the director brings many times away from the pagan view of the existence of Christ and compares the amazing scenarios with the events of Christ's life and the life of historical figures / gods such as Mithra and Dionyses . Then he introduces the original line of Christianity and gives a 'ok' case, but not one that beat me off. If the director was stuck with the truth and continued with them, this film would have been good. However, at this stage in the film, it is divided into a group of personal attack on Mel Gibson's "Passion of Christ" and a Christian private school which the director attended in his youth. During an interview with his former head, (which during the course, comes the light that the director started under false lies) I felt that the director was doing the kind of infants. He was asking good questions but, like the film itself, the interviews emerged in the attack of this self-school law, not Christianity. All for all, if you are only interested in certain information, see the first 30 minutes or so then close it.
