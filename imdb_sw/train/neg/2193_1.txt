A talented woman is broken and thus brings her head to life. Certainly this is the plot of the movie. He tries to get his other body looking through the city's sleaze area for a perfect body. For some reason she has a monster looking bad at the closet in her cabin. The fashion sleeve of the film is delicious. No one in the film can do the action including the head. Monster's closet is a man with a mask and you can say the truth. The plan is slow, weak, and the end is not done. See Secret Secret of Science 3000 version of this argument. Believe me people who could not watch this film alone.
