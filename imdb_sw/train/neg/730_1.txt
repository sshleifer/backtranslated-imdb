I haven't seen the first film and if such a thing is not enough. Looking at just a few hours ago I was trying to remember something about it. From what I remember is the main plot seems to be a group of very sad people to stay at home with this old woman from Friday 13th and stabbed with someone's wood. Some people die, the film ends, I start a law suit against someone who bought me this film if I want to compensate for the wrong time in my life. I will pay you Â£ 1 to remove this film from my hand ...... oh wait I already gave away from "friend".
