Where is Michael Caine? I have seen many times of MST3K, but this normal seasonal season (episdoe K-20) is one of the worst movies ever made. Three "stars", Lee Majors, Chris Makepeace and Burgess Meredith, are struggling with a large group of movies at all times, giving lines that must be written by Dick Cheney's secret work that includes Exxon and GM users trying to cut money for aid research transport and energy efficiency. It seems like it was done in the dark almost completely, perhaps in Super 8. It makes Runan's Run looks like Sistine Chapel's movie crossed by Shakespeare. I can't imagine looking at the definitions of Crow and Servo since it is unknown even for that. Obviously what is required in Hollywood is 401K that is a requirement for practitioners to take bad movies like this to pay for their health care services. For "his polluting rights and running" themes, at the end, I half expected to see Charlton Heston came where he offers "his speech" of the conversation. Lee, could I forgive you for this in 1989, but 1981?
