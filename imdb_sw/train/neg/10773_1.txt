I just watched the awesome thing on TV. Without saying it is one of those movies that you just expect to see how much worse it can get. In fact, I don't know how many bar can go. The characters are included with one kind of stereo stereo after another, and a clear attempt to create another "Bad Bears Bears" is embarrassing to say at least a little time. I have seen a lot of valuable violence in my time, but there is no reason to write anything from them since this is "Numero Uno". I would like to put this in this way, I watched the Vanilla Ice film, because it was so bad. This ... this ... is not the same.
