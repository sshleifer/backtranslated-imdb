Some of the moron who read or see the memories of the angels coming to the earth, decided not to care about what they heard about the human race and the angels being greater than ordinary human beings. Introducing them as a little historical one that was 40 feet high, is more than ridiculous. There were historical references to the house and furniture in the parts of the world, which were much larger than needed for ordinary human beings. These were supposed to be built at a level that would be able to lend to a footman of 10 to 14, somehow to support "David and Goliath" stories from the Bible. There is no mention of any historical references to buildings or artifacts that would support the idea of ​​a height of 40 foot.
