In fact I didn't expect much from this film to see if it has people from Parkersburg WV, which is I live, and do it. This city is limited and so this film. There were a few that were revealed in the film but I was concerned with all the crappy scores they made to show. This film can be good if there is a real acting in it but it didn't have any. Unless you are from Parkersburg and you are interested in seeing what you see every day, then don't have this film. The discussion will make you sleepy, acting will help you tear and Steven Soderberg should lose trust after being shot like this. His predictable movie without surprise. What you see is what you get and that's a 73-minute trip to Parkersburg West Virginia and the Belgian Ohio without a writer.
