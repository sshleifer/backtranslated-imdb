I wanted to love this film and look for a way to think it was better. Do not do wrong, not fickle at all but never live at all. The cluster is beautiful, cast is good (I was pumped exactly witnessing the return of David Naughton) and, God loves' em, you can tell everyone who tried the best. It falls constantly and again. "Cruel murders" should be as a regular reference to filmmakers that Christopher Guest can only make a film of Christopher Guest and, despite the fact it makes it easy, you should just forget to try it. Naughton and Brian O'Halloran are amazing in this and should be seen more often ... that's why this gets 4 stars from me. If you want to have a "Spinal Spine" of fear I suspect you might want a guy who made "Spinal Tap" for help ... just to think out there.
