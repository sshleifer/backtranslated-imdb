Here is a small interesting movie that gives the words "low budget" a terrible name. Our physics teacher who has nine children builds an amazing serum that causes "mass renewal". Students have been falsified for fake hijackings of submarine sandwiches and flying school equipment. It looks like a revival of the classic B movies from 50 years, right? Don't! It is not a happy example of the high campaign, which is the way, PUT mark. The excitement of the breast and the bonds magnifies our desire for pleasure, contrary to the fear that would have 99.44% more in the first place. The low-of-barrel entertainment for the best, help with pints of red blood and bodies of dead students. The furious movies like this could lead to ultimately the worst GURU THE MAD MONK (1970) work of a psychologist who has a Master's degree in film production! It's automatically "F", so relax easy!
