Kim Basinger's stars like Della, a desperate housewife and a bad man, who gets into trouble while out in the local shopping mall to buy the final Christmas. After putting a quick note on a piece of paper and connected to the paper on the wind car which took two parking space, he finds out that car owners are a Rainbow Avenger of criminals including a white, Mexican boy, a Chinese and black boy . They tell him about the note, the safety helmet, and the eviction continues. During the film Della will go for hunting for hunters as he opens his local Bronson. <br /> <br /> I saw that this is a little too much thriller. Acting was good enough (except for a few incidents, "Why did God why" was so well deserved in evil though) It comes a little bit because of the fact that criminals Della follow after / after having stupid intelligence. If they did not have anything to be given "Home Peke" baddie, perhaps their ultimate failure would be something more interesting than meh's reaction. The reason for the lack of faith that I intend to look at as a director and one of the producers made part of bringing "Shoot em up" on the screen (a film which when giving trust outside the window was too big). This film did not reach the length of the film, it was good in its rights. <br /> <br /> My bridge: Anchor Bay DVD Extras: Comments by Author / director Susan Montford and producer Don Murphy; 25 minutes and half 'Make-of'; trailer and two TV ads for this film; and trailer for Less Less
