I am a Christian. I have been worried about the films made by Christians, however. As a rule, they "know-nothings" when it comes to film production. I like TBN to try to show God and Jesus in a positive and honest way on the screen. However, they did the job of hiding. Acting was horrible, and unless someone knows the Bible somehow, one cannot understand what the movie tried to cross. It's not just a very much made film, but people who made it even had some truth. However, in this "critiki", this fact is worthless and is very deep in entering. In short, the Omega Code is the worst movie I saw, and I will not recommend it to anyone, except for comic relief from daily grinding.
