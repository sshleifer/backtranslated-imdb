After watching this film on DVD, I watched the trailer. Sound top spells films as surreal. Well, there's surreal, and there's surreal. There was only one part of the film that seemed surreal to me, but in fact, it was more mixed than surreal. Another unusual photo, especially the lunch area that everyone is on the floor, was very nonsensical. I have no idea of ​​a picture that does not mean anything, but these events seemed to be useless. My attitude is that the director was trying to convey a local monologist to Logan. I don't know what else is describing what is going on. Unfortunately, nothing I found gave me any clue that Logan was thinking about, how his attitude was, or even his emotional state. All I could say was that he was very unhappy with his appearance, and that he had a crush for an old man. I thought the end showed what the relationship between boys was, but not much. The purpose of delicaposing uncomfortable events and those that were indirectly appeared to be a deterrent rather than artistic decision. However, as an exciting and non-existent film was to me, it was a change of speed. I was very fond of Madagascar, and I had a passion for this movie that is a kind of description, and maybe even fashionable. It didn't come even closer. For me there is no question about it: this movie deserves A for effort, but D is implemented.
