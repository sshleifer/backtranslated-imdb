As a South Baptist, it is discouraging that I have to give a movie under Christian less. Certainly not so many that I want to disappoint the filmmakers from a kind that is not widely used. Still, we must say honestly that "The Love of Love" is a common budget, a low base, an independent Christian film. The plan is predictable, it works easily (I am a good type), and editing has no feeling. If a television film may be slightly above average, but as a film is very much needed. Keep trying. You need to have a film about about real Christians in your place elsewhere. What? I would like to turn to G. K. Chesterton or C. S. Lewis for some inspiration?
