The basket of an outbreak of the basket emerging as a comedy. Elvis Presley has a proud Indian striker who travels rodeo for staying at home in the desert-people in Arizona, where government suits have only invested in a herd of cattle (which is a great need for stud). The director Peter Tewksbury needs great skills is the story of the story, although what he does not know in the assessment he does for the improperly comes of the monticas (his definition of society is not meant, but Tewksbury has a satiric bend for his freedom and there are some funny scenes) . Despite the turn of beautiful colors and Katy Jurado and Joan Blondell, the total damage finds a way to disappear, and there is a very hoopin and hollerin to develop great interest. For Elvis, he is free and frisky around - and when it is best to see him enjoying the screens, someone needs to wonder if he just left on the movie this time. These photo shapes are very different from what-hell you feel, and although the spirits are high, the return is low. * 1/2 from ****
