The worst act, and the most unknown story. Even B-respecting movies / benches / scenarios that were caused by horrible people as they entered a foreign ship were boring and very crippled. <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst sci-fi I've ever seen. I saw a 5.0 star and I decided to watch it since I loved genre, but it has played a lot. Now there is a very nice movie in the case of ALIEN, I think because most of them are small budgets / / <br /> I offer 3/10
