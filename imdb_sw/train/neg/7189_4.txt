What a disappointment! The 6.1 results here on the IMD created positive but, oh my, I was desperate. The first thing that locks itself is those who volunteer, living at a children's university. Yes, I know young people can be babies and so on, but why are they shown on the movies are always defined as a full marathon of brainde? There was one character I thought was good, but he (he didn't reveal it here) was killed before the end. Other characters were not killed and even the hero / heroine thought they did not just do it for me. On the other side: the plot is very good and the production crops are cut above for this type of flicks. Acting was not very good, Rutger Hauer stands for a small role. But all fails and bland and characters of braindead. You stop keeping them after 10 minutes. 4/10 (and that's generous).
