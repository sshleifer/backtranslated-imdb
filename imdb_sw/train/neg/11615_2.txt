Although not a Sam Rockwell fan, I was surprised when I saw his name in the features of the 'Joshua' opening. Heck, I didn't even know he was in 'Joshua' until I was starting a movie. So it goes without saying, I was looking at the movies on the basis of the film, not leading. Type of 'Child of Rosemary,' 'The Omen' or any other religious movie 'Joshua' was billed. Unfortunately, it fell flat. Decrease, very fast, and flat. However, I continued to see how all this could solve, and more hope of faith, at the end of the end would be clear on the subject. Okay, I agree, it did (we wee bit) but it's fast stale. And it's a low-budget movie, or at least they did. Someone falls? you don't see the tone, you see someone lying under what appears to be blood. Someone gets hit by cab? don't see, you see someone complaining, riding a bicycle. I don't know if this is called "style" or just sluggish or just, lack of money for special effects. We have a "rich" family with a mother, a very strong father trying to balance everything, a child? Joshua, who can not be an antichrist and a new born baby who weeps very much. He cries as we see how many days he is alive? and what was it? What? Is there a mouse above or is Joshua? Is his mother nuts? Is Joshua crazy? Is he jealous only for a stranger to a family? Will it be Michael Myers? Or runs his family with a mold? I don't think so. They were nuts before, and no "so-called" acting could make me believe otherwise. Unfortunately, hardly any questions were treated, difficult to open open doors. I am sure that it might be an idea, but for Pete, give me something. Anything. There are many good passages that are available to explore. Joshua is more than the Mini-Me of the Antichrist.
