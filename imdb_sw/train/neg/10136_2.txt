No one can make this film for its merit but, if you have a sense of humor and enjoy the schlock movies for their MST3 quality, then this is for you. It comes up with "House of Roads" for its proud characters, sets and story line. Wrong writing covers me the truth: "I want to confuse the boys" instead of "... dusty boys." F-14s removes from the carrier but, when they include, they are F-16s! Without a feeling of anger or anxiety, Segal returns to work in general who, a few minutes before, was looking for a "mental barrier" in Seagal. Segal runs out of bullets and resorts with a knife to kill guards. Typically, the guards offer a gun drop and fight with knives too! Grenade hand is dud but it escapes however. A small fighter can fly from California to Afganistan without adding fuel. Then Segal returns to California - a long way, that is, through Europe - though there is a carrier who gives him a 20-hour help from the Arabian Sea. CIC in this carrier has 3 black PC, 2 TV flat screen and pictures of gauges and maps on the walls. It's hoot!
