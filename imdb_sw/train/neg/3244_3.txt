The effects found in this story about a mental-health professional who cooperates with con artists are contaminated that I must think that that was the desired purpose. Sets are fake and no time I don't feel that I was watching movies. It seemed as if the executives were just reading their lines, rather than embracing them. Although the film has elements of the original original film (except the color) that technique is very salty that I almost have to finish that is a kind of approach. Since the presentation was not appealing to me, I was at least expecting the story involved. Usually I am slow on the uptake when it comes to stories and twists twists, but you can see what comes here within the first fifteen minutes. At the time, "Gee, I forgot $ 80,000," when, I thought myself to be a true thing. For a psychiatrist specialist with enough experience of gambling to do so it is more ridiculous than faith. If for any action made like an intelligent person, the whole story would have fallen apart. This kind of wood has left me cold.
