The movie is essentially the story of the Russian pastor to return to his home for the funeral of a sister / friend. There are a few other lines of stories that could actually be more interesting than they were taken, but they were not fully taken. The foundation of the film is the funeral, feminine, and future controversy over the future of the crones society that makes dolls and sell them to buy vodka but now missing the artist who made their dolls sold. It seems, the movie has not been served. A prostitute's journey from town to village is an endless journey of train and walking through the mud. Perhaps that should please us in the size of the Russian environment. The village itself, as it is, is a group of widows and one male, a dead girlfriend. Continuing business of the doll is a problem for everyone involved and eventually seems impossible. Most of the films are made by a hand-used camera that can cause nausea. Another problem for Western viewers is that the lower heads don't include songs and crones. Don't go to this film unless you use Russian.
