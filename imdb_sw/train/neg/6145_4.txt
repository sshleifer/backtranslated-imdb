Although I have seen "Gymkata" at the back of '85, I did not remember any of the conspiracy except for the unveiled images of Kurt Thomas running and fighting behind the stone walls and desires about the end. > <br /> After reading some of the other reviews I got a copy of the recently released DVD to re-enter the world of Gymkata. It seems this is one of the films that were produced when '80s that would go straight to the video today. The film star, Kurt Thomas as Jonathan Cabot, hired from the blue to enter the "Parmistan" entry and hopefully win the "Game," a blood-suicidal blood donation funded by Khan who encourages his people to scream like " Power Yak. The mission of the mission involves the defense system of Star Wars. Jonathan is taught in military art by Princess Rubali, who never speaks or stops the house. Once the training tries to mix with the locals by wearing a red shape and a sweat of blue and white. Of course, Cabot finds himself fleeing and fighting his life on the Parmistan stone roads, going on a date with destiny, and a game. Star, Kurt Thomas was a patient used by director Robert Piga, who looks like it has never been on the set. What is known as the script is on this side of the capability. See other reviews for many applicants around. The city of crazies has a good time, but eventually it is destroyed by bad editing. Last ... meh. There is still a germ of a beautiful adventure of action here. Hong Kong version with more visceral and speed speeds can even be very good.
