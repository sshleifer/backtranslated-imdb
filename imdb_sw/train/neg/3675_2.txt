True, everyone in this movie looks like they want to be somewhere else! No wonder, cast not to the left hand, but not quite. I haven't seen anything more than Natascha McElhone pretending to be a particular agent, carrying a gun. It does not use the city-brat destruction in such a role. The only thing that I can think of is to throw on Doris Day as a prostitute. Some of the cast are also bad, perhaps with Hurt as discrimination alone, sometimes you can see him trying, but sad. Oh, did I say that it's a completely false story? Dangerous many people live because you have left and want to see your family? Must, should it be because the boy (Weller) is Germany? 2/10, because the picture may be worse.
