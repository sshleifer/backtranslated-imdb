Wait, don't tell ... they threw the movie and put it out. You know, this film can be shot on the back road in New York. "Gangster Bangster" I think. Gangster Rap, Gangster Designer clothing clothes including kerchief which somehow got moved from the neck for protection from dust from the dust. I think it was to protect the head from the warmth temperature through K-Mart hats. "Budget tax-horsie", apparently, gave the horsies. One part of the bedroom where the girl was talking to the boy was speaking his words .... I was even talking. You know, watching this film proves that, it's not about acting again ... it looks on looks and it's about money. It couldn't be too much of that movie. Well, for all, I think that this film will drop as all the worst movie ever done. Just one more thing, although Ice T was where? What? Finally he went to Oprah?
