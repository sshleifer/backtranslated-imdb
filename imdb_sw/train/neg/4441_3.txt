"The Victory of Love" is proof that not every author Comédie-Française who uses a cross-dress has pretended to be associated as Shakespeare to see. Or perhaps something lost in the translation of Marivaux's change, the Commedia Dell Arte actor Brittannica says: "His cunning and cunning sense is known as marivaudage." When Mira Sorvino enjoys combining three combinations of combinations, her role of pants was not even Cherubino in "Figaro Marriage." <br /> <br /> The herky-jerky layout is angry and fairly seems to show that a lot of take is needed for every long speech. The best is Fiona Shaw as a spinster fooled, with the dress. <br /> <br /> Show the audience we see and call fast so that all this is an artifice does not really help. <br /> <br /> (previously written 5/29/2002)
