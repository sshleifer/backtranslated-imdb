This is indeed a terrible DTV film of Z-grade. <br /> <br /> But with verses like: <br /> <br /> "It's easy to die, I'm often" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Why do you read this book? " "Because it makes a more interesting plot" <br /> <br /> <br /> "You made your way here, now you can make your way again!" (after guiding the person into the floor). just good film. Act is angry, but some actors I know, so they change it? <br /> <br /> The old house, cut open and modern dwelling, is a site of murder. The movie (bad) has been made on the basis and the story continues again.
