I would like to give this film zero between ten, but it will give you two. One reason is that Shah Rukh Khan looks at the film, which is not the reason. The last end is that Rani Comes from this film and does smooch with Kamal. I love Rani very much and have a reputation for being a good actor. Why didn't I enjoy him in this movie kissing Kamal, but not his great plan. Any of the bedroom events that made this film appear, lets you talk about this film. What? It is good or bad, I think its movie of the garbage that has made me a bit. I have a wonderful critic, you can see my other 250+ views by clicking on my name, I have a good taste. The movie is not entertaining is one thing and if this is assumed to be difficult to hit movies, why no morale in this movie. His selfish movie is not good story and it says. Looking at kamal kissing these vendors make me sick, One can kiss him well.
