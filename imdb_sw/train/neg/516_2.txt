We know how in his future movies Burt Reynolds' laugh looks like brakesching scakesching <br /> <br /> Must have been hanging out with Hal Needham very much. <br /> <br /> And from the looks of "Stroker Ace", WAY much. Do you believe this was the basis of the book? Neither can I, but it was. And maybe not the best seller, I will try. Burt is another good old boy in the NASCAR circle who beat with Beatty as a frog chicken frog and designs on his team. Anderson provides what the interests of love there and Nabors makes its Gomerose feeling like a trustworthy contractor / best friend Lugs. <br /> <br /> Many people here are Burt or Hal friends. Others need to work. And even NASCAR's real drivers go into action, and look more talented than those with SAG cards. <br /> <br /> Besides laughing, Bubba Smith (before "Police Academy") gets them like a Beatty scooter. And Petersen, in the perfect condition of Elvira, gets lots of pleasant votes like a woman who wants to know Lugs very well. It is true that Burt lost much time and effort in the film as "Stroker Ace" where he didn't care if he struggled to act or not. They were not interested in writing his character, why are you sad? <br /> <br /> Two stars. More for Petersen, and for out-takes at the end. Now they are funny.
