Unfortunately I do not remember the book again, but I remember that I had the feelings of Edgar Wallace's story. This film represents German Production of low quality. It does not matter to my mind - although the story itself is good, it's just right to be judged. In the midst of grief are the characters who are very interesting and spread - they have no links in their exhibition. Even the well-known actors and German lovers Joachim Fuchsberger and Eddy can't save this poor festival. However there is hope ... I am told that the following films are getting better and better. So in conclusion I must say that this film is not suitable for movie screens but can be enough for idle daytime.
