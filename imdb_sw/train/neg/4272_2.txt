These types of movies where different psychological or other physiology try to destroy the reputation (and ultimately eradicate) someone who is ignorant to take their lives. Poor Street, Pacific Winds, Marriage Bears, White Wife, and thousands of TV texts are some examples of this. But when a few, especially Fatal Attraction and Pacific Pasights can offer at least some paranoid, the suspenseful characters or twists a few twists, the illegal Entry has everything to book. And not because of his stars (Kurt Russel, Ray Liota, and Madeline Stowe), this film could drown faster than Danielle Steele's services. Russel plays Michael Carr, a young man who asks for help with a pair of officers when someone enters his home and tries to attack his wife (Madeline Stowe). Unfortunately, he silently gives his anger over the feeling so he can not help in that situation with a serious mistake (Ray Liotta), a common psychopathic villain and no limits to his power. When you first had a feeling with Carr (perhaps just pretending to do it), the boyfriend is a friend of the couple. But recently, the fighters want to carr out of that way, destroying the life of a young man almost any way he can (which is pretty easy when you are cop, and when you are cop who installed the security system of a guy in his house) to take and maybe , find his wife. It looks under the last direction, and more like a soldier just needs to prove his power. The wife is like a trophy, in other words, than the end. And the story seems completely with the book, you can probably predict any event before you appear on the screen if you see enough movies. From the "amazing" character of our main character, the naive knows that he is the victim of the credit card fraud (conducted by the psychic psychologist) at the end of the close-he-not real-dead.
