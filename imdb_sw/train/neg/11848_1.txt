What is supposed to be a secret line of generic consultation with a dead counselor is actually a story of a headache with a group of actors (the only actor being Ginger Rogers, in a very early role) all trying to find a murderer among the small residents in the apartment building. posh. These characters begin with a sense of meaning. As a low and low-cost budget production, many actions around Rogers and its leading man (someone, I don't care who is because he has tried too much) to talk about their various possible solutions to crime, while constantly being cut off by detective wonderful and his head in his butt. In fact, I have never had the worst time to watch the old b of this kind of film, and I have seen some real head titles. Oh, and the pastor did not, because there was no player. But pay attention to the man next to the player. There you go. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
