I saw this film yesterday. I rented a DVD from Blockbuster. In fact, I know one of the artists. I can't say who ..! (That is under vraps.) But I must admit, it was not as good as I thought it would be. Hats under this man .. But it is a shame he was not in the film for a long time. What missing the film is an idea, script, sound, etc.. It looks like a good movie .. but it wasn't that entertainment .. <br /> <br /> Okay, I'm glad my sister paid Â£ 10 to rent 3 DVD from Blockbuster .. I chose this .. and I was desperate. Otherwise, the fingers below me ..! Not my cup of tea! 0 out of 10!
