I watched this film last night and I had lost it. Much of the "time of truth" was far away. At the beginning of the movie, grandfather made a comment to this grandson and his friends about how they felt when they hit 9-11. This movie was supposed to take place in 1994. Also, one of the grandchildren was wearing the Eagles Jersey Donovan McNabb. He has never been written as yet. The story line was good but the truth and the real time of the time was too far away and you made the film look fun. My partner is a strong reader of WWII books and records. I lost this film hope that it would be good. Acting was so-so. Dog was good. But the way that this film was made I was happy that I paid only 4 dollars to pay the opposite tax would have taken me to look at the theater. I hope that the one who reads this understands that I do not mean the absence of those who fought the war but the truth and time period should be closely monitored.
