A scientist and his girlfriend driving while his speed is caused by a car accident. He is running away unattended but he is reduced. He saves his head, brings his home and saves it (!!!!). Then it starts looking for examples and tabs for the perfect body for the head. His disabled assistant looks over the head that begins to talk with a telepathic (or telepathetic) that connects to the damaged monster set in the closet. and some fun. When I grew up in the late 1970s, a local television station showed this film 20 times a year (no spread). They showed every Saturday Saturday TV - not. See this on TV back then that was good! Clear blood and run with the bad monster and sexual ignorance - who cares if it was good? Seeing it now I know how this is so true. The role is completely lost, the production code was absent, the script is dumb and (far from the very interesting situation yet) this is good things. There is also a gentle cat to fight between two women and admittedly big monster at the end. Also add in the end that leaves the last tons. On the one hand this is an interesting example of the film's exploitation of 1960. On the other hand its trash. Any way, not a good film but it is a must-see (at one time) for fans of fear and dead. Headline is also amazing. Check out the last features that find TITLE tissue (call it "HEAD that does not Die")!
