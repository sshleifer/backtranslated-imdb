I see the attitude of Diehl to be a microcosm of America itself - to see the Arab terrorists under every rock, only to know its end that it is his own actions around him that has led him to the siege of the truth if it does good for everyone everything will be rainy rain and explosions. Sorry Wim has made amazing movies in the past that do not interfere with politics and for good reason, polemics is your weakest step and reduces this well-made, amazing film with amazing characters, conversations and programs. Good luck on your next flick. Another thing that has been a part of the non-residential part of LA being there because of hunger, these people don't have enough food. In fact these people do not violate the law but the real hunger is spiritual hunger, emotional hunger, mental hunger. They need self-esteem, self-esteem, respect that you cannot give to someone. Yes they are hungry and if they need it available. Under the hunger center in America, I would say it was a drunken drug, drug abuse, mental suffering and economic destruction. Dealing with hunger though good efforts are a band-complementing human problem affected by the age of people. Bill Diehl was good and Michelle Williams was as good as the old boy ((cliched) of old.
