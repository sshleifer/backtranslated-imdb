I do not like this film, but I didn't think much of that book, though honored by many as a "hub", I found that it was not found in character development and closed and unknown in the program, though it was more readable than the first Fante efforts "Los Angeles road" Uncategorized until Fante became fashionable in the middle of the 80's. I was surprised to see what kind of Towne soup would make with such tiny ingredients. She has worked hard script-wise to fix the many shortcomings of the book but for my money has not saved you. There was no movie in Ask P dust when he tried to stay faithful to the book. I think of the folly of this Towne. <br /> <br /> By word: forget.
