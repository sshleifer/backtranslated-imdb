There are not enough gay movies and enough resources to "come out". Each is an extra acceptable for a variety. Although the production standards are high (good 'look' good, Matthias Freihof (Philipp) looks good REAL in a pair of jeans) this is bad. It is a period of period: homosexual life under the rule of terrorists (Berlin East, 1989) life that looks 40 years back west. By the way we see our own history; what can be like homosexuals in the 40s and 50 years here (often reminds me about the 'End of the End in Brooklyn: the book is not a film). . It is very amazing I wonder if the director did not have a hack for random. Yes, it is a miracle that this was beaten and released before Wall fell and yes, life behind `Curtain 'was hard for gay people. A good director can show it all without attracting the audience. A good director could have this same mark as one of the great movies coming and not one of misses.
