There are probably many people who fear dentist than, let's say, little monster or awesome gifts. Which makes it a perfect lesson for the awesome movie, in fact. Dr. Feinstone (Corbin Bernsen) has been a successful dentist for several years now, but when he takes his wife to cheat and poolguy stimulates, and brings anger and frustration for his work. Okay, give a dentist and mouth dentist, and maybe I think it happens next ... <br /> <br /> As I said, brilliant ideas have not been presented as appropriate. Especially the end is great to allow. The final text: see Mark Ruffalo (You Can Count On Me, Nighttime ...) in this. <br /> <br /> 5/10.
