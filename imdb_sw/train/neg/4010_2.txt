When I saw the first show, the first few moments seemed to be promising. Bill Compton introduced himself as a "wonderful vampire" and Sookie volunteered as a free woman. However, the show decreased from here and the once interesting characters are as entertaining as a card box. <br /> <br /> As the story continues the main characters lose their original qualities, with their ability to act. In Section 5, Bill's faces are so low that his face has a forehead. Sookie, or rather an actor, has died more than his beloved vampire. All these horrible events surrounding him and he only touches on how interesting it was to lose his virginity. Personally, I think they did the main characters sleep together very early in the show. The way they met it was something that had been happening and could be much easier. Once Sookie lost, he hits around as a general gold, thinking only about Bill's libido and the size of his piece. Bill also loses his view of debonair and well, he gets very clear. His actions have not been told the truth unless he does so with Sookie. Why? Their love for each other is not considered, if there is any love. So far it seems only that sex is the basis of their relationship. <br /> <br /> Yes, yes, vampires usually the same sex but come. Every five seconds I see some sort of humping continues. It was not so surprising, since HBO always tries to adopt a soft porno core as a decent TV show. Bill comes out of dirt and just get to Sookie without what it is ever? I laughed so hard I almost tried. <br /> <br /> The program is just a stream of awareness. Anime have never been in detail about anything. All events occurring are often left unnoticed. The only thing that is regular is sex. The only thing I can say when I like is the small characters. Tara and her mother drunk are more attractive than the main characters. The only reason to continue to watch the show is for the development of the limited characters. <br /> <br /> Stimulating sex with the main characters will show you better.
