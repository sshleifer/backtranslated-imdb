I liked, I did the truth. Please do not think that I am idiot but I must admit that I enjoyed this film. I expected to be kidnapped, it was kidnapped, but sometimes it's okay to relax and watch the crappy film that you don't think so much? I didn't look for any secret or moral meaning, and it didn't have any, but that doesn't matter because I just watched it for entertainment, and it was interesting to me everywhere. This movie is why Ben Stillers (saying 'there's something about Mary') and Vince Vaughns (however you mention his last name, I can't have problems looking at) to work. It is okay to watch a decoration film as long as you do not expect too much, and for one we will stand, jog, maybe run, but it's not a car because I don't have a car, on the Blockbuster Video, or even the Elections, and rent a group of these interesting films for toilets and staying one night watching them. Good day for the reader. P.s if they say that these comments help you then I don't like you, if you say it has helped God bless you, you will go to heaven.
