This movie is of course the worst movie of the fear I saw. And it says a lot, considering I have seen such stinkers as Demon's Paradiso, Lovers' Lane, and Bloody (which is the second second). However, I love bad horror movies, and as you can tell him from my username, this one looks at the truth. Sometimes there is nothing else for entertainment than the unsuccessful flick. For this film, the opening area that the woman gets dry in the tanning hut seems to have no film, especially since the movie fails to tell you that the event happened 2 years before all the film. Acting does not exist, and most of the camera cameras are of women's shrink wrapped in spandex. Police was a stone player, a monotone player I ever saw. The best / worst part of this film, however, must be a weapon of murder. Great security? What were they thinking about? Who is the killer? The "Huggies" broken heart? I would like to give this movie as a whole, but I found if I didn't have an explosion
