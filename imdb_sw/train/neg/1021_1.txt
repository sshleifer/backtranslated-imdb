The movie began to power, LL Cool J (Act) as a police officer undercover, and Sgt partner. Lazerov (Dylan McDermott from Practice, perhaps sent as a bad person?) Making theft and murder. Labor refuses to kill a drug dealer, which initiates a crisis of dirty soldiers and conscience. Other major names (Freeman, Spacey et al) are well healed and film shows show. <br /> <br /> Movie will begin to be reduced as Justin Timberlake (Pollack) is brought. From the opportunity to make a good film that people can see on a regular basis, or that young girls will go and see immediately because of Timberlake, I would have chosen the past. Even talented actors should work hard on their tricks; Timberlake is not talented and no amount of hard work can save him. I would like to think he would put on the best show, due to the fact that he has been making talent for years. Everything he did in this film was not sure. Because the singer sells millions of records and exports to plots, it does not translate directly that they can act effectively in feature films. Even the fans of Hardcore N'Sync will not be able to ignore the lack of talent to work. <br /> <br /> That is where there are few holes, such as the pollack's sudden pollination and deadly works of the warehouse machine. This movie had many promises. Very shocking.
