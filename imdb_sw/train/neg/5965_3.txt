In 1454, in France, the wizard Alaric de Marnac (Paul Naschy) was disappointed by his grandmother Mabille De Lancré (Helga Liné) was tortured for the deaths of suspects of witchcraft, vampirism and lycanthropy. Before he dies, he scorns the future generations of their killers. In the present days (in the 70s), Hugo de Marnac (Paul Naschy) and Sylvia (Betsabé Ruiz) and their friends Maurice Roland (Vic Winner) and his beloved Paula (Cristina Suriani) are going to the ceremony, where they cast out the spirit of Alaric de Marnac. They decide to travel to Villas de Sade, real estate of Hugo's family in the camp, looking for a monastery and hidden treasures. They see the Alaric head and the fiend they have, bringing life to Mabille and implementing the members of the year sacrifices. After the death of his father, Elvira (Emma Cohen) remembers that he has a hammer of Thor's hiding well; together with Maurice, they are trying to defeat the demonic Alaric de Marnac and Mabille. At the end of last week I bought a box of awesome formats and five DVDs of Paul Naschy for US $ 9.98; despite being no memory, I have decided to take a chance. The first DVD with a release version of the "Rest From Out of the Grave" is a movie of the B (or C) trash that has made you immediately remember Ed Wood. The story of fraud has been revealed through bad screenplay, instructions, presentations, movies, decoration, special effects and version with the women's naked lot. The result is a hilari and I can confirm that Ed Wood's style is back. My vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Not available
