You know, I went to see "Mountains and 2 eyes" to love it. I was very excited at first, and remake was entertaining. In fact they had more money to give us closer than Wes Craven made for special effects next time. Although I still prefer the original film, remake was done well, and it was a pleasure of guilt for me. Bloody, intense, and very serious consequences. In short, a great movie of popcorn for any fan of fear. It has brought us "Mountains and eyes 2". Man, where do I start? The plan, or lack of one, is a thin paper. We cannot break the new ground here. The army has decided to monitor the area, and all these people turn. So what are we doing now? Let's send in the National Guard to investigate. In the true fashion of Hollywood we need to make them dumbest, and the worst soldiers have ever seen. Gee, I've never seen that premise before. To make a long story short, you have mutants killed one moron soldier at a time in model style. Once again the special effects of Nikotero are good, but they kill no matter how graphic becomes boring, and predictable. In fact I appeared to me that this flick was done just to grab the goat quickly. It was bleeding, and it was a model, but I found it predictable, interesting, and not frightened. For me it would have been good if this film had one original idea.
