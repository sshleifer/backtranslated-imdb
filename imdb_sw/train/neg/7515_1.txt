It reads. That's all I have to say about this sincere excuse for the film. Sucks. Sucks. Sucks. I mean, what did hell think? Participants involved should never be allowed to make another film. Acting was very bad even to fail to enjoy it at the wrong level. The "lesbian area" attempt was sad. I felt bad for women involved. This film takes! Sucks! Sucks! When I heard the rumor of the follower. <br /> <br /> God / Overall Help /
