I have seen other films of Guinea pigs, like the Mermaid in Manhole and He died, and when they are good sick, they at least have a sense of humor to them (however dark). The devil's attempt though, is nothing more than hiding a bunch of punks to present a little girl in many ways of suffering and abuse and no plot and no liberation values ​​for anything. It's not too far, except maybe put-minded, but it's very obvious and I certainly won't call entertainment. Now, I'm not a paragon of good taste in the film and I love my garbage and spray, but this was too big for me, in fact. I'm in for trouble, in fact, I am looking for things that are confused at any time possible, but this was too little. The woman is campaigned, beaten, and thrown into a screech through the heads of the head until she is finished, and then beaten with meat and raw meat and grass and left hanging on the outside of the forest somewhere. If you think it seems to be good, go to it, but certainly wipe me away and look at anything else of Guinea Pig. 1 out of 10, quite nausea.
