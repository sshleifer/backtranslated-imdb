Before I started watching the show, I heard it was beautiful and very interesting. What is deception, the scriptures are that I am sure the authors are the son and grandson of Scoobidoo writers. And how about SFX and colors, they are getting worse, unavailable, are not full-filled, as text is written and displayed. This exhibition is like a bad pony that a child could put on sugar and butter to think because because these ingredients are good, they are good. Unfortunately for this show, only two links to this show finally violence and lack of general trust.
