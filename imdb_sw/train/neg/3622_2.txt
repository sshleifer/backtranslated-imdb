I discovered this a few months ago at the Family Center, and had several TV shows from my youth, I decided to look at it with my 4-year-old daughter. I had to have psychedelic mushrooms to go with it, because this just amazing! Not only the music with amazing tunes that you forget, the desired effects of cheesy and cameos and stars that have passed well together, seem to have been produced as a good journey for someone. The talking stick, British children have been very old for this kind of decoration ... in the words of Krusty Klown "uuuuuugggghhhhh! What was I?" If you are a great fan of the whole work of Sid and Marty Krofft, go to it; Otherwise, unless you want to get a loop before checking, stay off, away, FAR away.
