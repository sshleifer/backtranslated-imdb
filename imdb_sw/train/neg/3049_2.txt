Why does this head generic? Santa Claus ??? So bland and unpredictable. Films before trying to enter the spirit of the holiday, especially the 'Santa Claus Overcomes Martians', at least it was entertainment to watch because of the barrier, and all the pictures of the stock are used ... for some reason, that seemed to be happy to me. But this film only looks at Christmas on the butt, and enjoys the fun of all children. Santa lives in space? His enemy is the devil called Pitch? Santa gets help from Merlin Witch? What? What is this? Well, for it was done in Mexico and some of you can understand how the film was made. I had to admit some effects were wacky just for a while. It was a spiritual group! Although, with all the difficulties with the movie, it still feels like a Christmas movie. Good defeats the evil, and Christmas still has a part of our beautiful girl or a beautiful boy in the world, or perhaps the world, thanks to Santa Claus Winning Martians .. it seems. So, I think you should try, even if it's one of the worst movies all the time ... although you must put a smile on your face any day.
