I really hated movies. It was so lost. They need to get acting lessons .... no, wait, which will not help because Naked Brothers Band people retards. Do you know why I'm here although I am a Naked Brothers Band? In order to warn people before watching dumb movies so that NBB does not provide any money from it so that they cannot make other stupid songs that have been so badly damaged that any old man can go and write for 10 seconds. Okay, I'm kinda turn off the movie here ..... everything, it was boring and they did wrong. It was not funny at all although they tried hard to be. I think they are eligible for credit so ... well, the movie is not worth your time. Just check his rating. The movie (and series) is very painful to look for anyone who even half the brain. Eagerly, if you liked it, you need to go to the movies where the characters do, and do not hit their line in monotone. I am in the actors' club at my school and other people are more truthful than those Nat and Alex. Fast before delay! I thought so much that Herbie's totally dependent was better than this poopie piece. I don't even know why I even went to HALF's film. I don't think it's even worthy to be called a film ...
