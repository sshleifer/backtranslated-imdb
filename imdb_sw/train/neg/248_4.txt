When to hurt when will you stop? I don't want to ever see another version of Carol's Christmas again. They continue to make movies with the same story, falling on trying to try to make the best film, but sadly they can't do it, as this is not a good story. Moralistic, old-fashioned, conservative fun-thinking. As people learn. Various versions of this film prove that we do not.
