If the mother of Toby locks herself when it takes Col to go to the top floor and return down into the room with a ceiling 24 with no chairs, counters or anything near her body stopped without motion that she could possibly climb up to make herself in a little girl who played a daughter The last family was the best actor in the whole movie, and the puppy's first couple was second second. The basic story has the potential and with a good script and the director can be a very big flick, but this version is sadly not. I get more scared when I open my electricity bill every month.
