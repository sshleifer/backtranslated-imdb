This is one of the “worst of the most beautiful” movies that you always hear about but you will never see! Unlike Troma films which are deliberate and camping (and I'm not amused) this is 100% cleaner. Yet for elements such as a robust killed robot that is like one of the Powerful Gold Players on an acidic journey with the first magician partner who calls for electricity and transforms into a good wizard East the fact that it takes itself pushes so far on the edge of the evil that makes the full circle to return back to entertainment. It looks good because of it.
