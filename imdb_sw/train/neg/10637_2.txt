I am proud that I bought this series. I expected more action, more pictures and more stability. This is a pure series of propaganda, very dark, without any charm, or romantic, it just kiss itself. I see executives working too weak. O'Donnell may seem to be as good as Robin (and Batman), but in this picture they don't have any charm. Perhaps as an old man, he loses his child's charm but they do not have any advantage. It does not surprise, that it was not displayed in many countries and is sold in the UK for 40 percent of the proposed price and was not even issued in the Netherlands.
