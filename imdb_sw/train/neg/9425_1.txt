Did anyone change this film? Or is it just the release of a DVD that had thirty major shortcomings between events? Not right, I fell asleep the first time. Then I slept the second time and the third time. The plan is not so bad I have seen, but it's close. Acting is not the worst I saw or ... but it's close. Production .... well, I can honestly say it is the worst I ever seen in my life! It does not try to be bitter, but Unhinged could be used more productive. <br /> <br /> Please don't think I hate horror movies, or even that I didn't like this film. I just felt laughing in the film more than I felt I was laughing with it. The horrible times have not been done very well, but they can be made even better with the budget. The characters seemed to be dirty, or ignored all together, misleading ended was very bad, and the performances took forever without revealing much. <br /> <br /> I would recommend to avoid this film. </ 1/1 / / 1/10
