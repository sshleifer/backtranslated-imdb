The second attempt of a New York specialist in less than 10 years to make a film "Swedish" - the first to be "Brother Carl" of Susan Sontag (carried out in Sweden, with Swedish actors, not less!) The result? Oscar Wilde said well, referring to Dickens "The Old Search Store": "One will have a heart of stone not laughing loudly at the death of Little Nell." Pretty very one thing here. "Interior" is full of domestic pastors. ("I'm afraid of my anger." Looking at the middle distance: "I do not like who I am.") Leadership quotations (using decent time) from Bergman is close to the parody. The self-reliant family continues to remind us of how worthy and talented they are, until they reach destruction. ("I read your poem the other day. It was inside - I don't know - New Yorker." completely. Most discussions are similar to the amazing things from the original Allen films - just ordered its executives to play a straight line. Since he has not given himself in the cinema, he has poor Mary Beth Hurt all copies of his scholars, practices, and neurotic behaviors, and turn him into a proud pride (such as Kenneth Branagh in "celebrity"). The basic plan - a non-working family with a silent mother - seems to be raised up or down from Bergman's "Light Light", a primary family melodrama emerged and a lot of existential angst. It all comes through a shop shop / shop shop: prohibit a pencil blind on paper, an interesting surf that attracts people to walk on the beach. etc., etc.. <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <3 /> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br /> I will take "Interiors." Woody rarely made a funnier movie.
