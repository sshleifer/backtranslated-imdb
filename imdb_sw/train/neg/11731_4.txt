As much as I am concerned this Merry Widow version of this is the worst version made. There is no mercy or love or spirituality on this version, it's macabre, German, uncomfortable. The Nazis reminds me of love; who cares? This silent version of von Stroheim is not a reliable mix of the original story. In this we ask John Gilbert and his family of pride after the proud American actress, played with Mae Murray, who had a modern hairstyle caused by the female way that was not translated which has redeemed me again and again. I wish my romances light and good, and create a slow deficit; not complicated and sad like this. And come, the bees have hit the lips, take them out, girl! <br /> <br /> Go see the direct performance of the show if you would like to get an original idea of ​​the original operetta sweetness with Franz Lehar. Failure, waiting until TCM shows the voice of Jeanette MacDonald - Maurice Chevalier. It's better.
