I can't believe that people thought that this garbage pot was beautiful. Removing the attempts of humor between violence, hatred and folly, 'There Is Something About Maria' leaves a little reason to stay until the end. Indeed, Cameron Diaz is very good, but that won't be enough to save the movie. Ben Stiller strives to work in a conspiracy, and is very talented, but movies are losing. It is not just once trusted events. Shots were beaten when they were well fitted. The Farreley brothers should be put off to make the film at all costs. I'm looking at IMDB to see what they're doing just to know what to avoid. <br /> <br /> 2/10; The bonus is from one time I screamed. It's not like I have a nice or exclusive breathing in my opinion. My wife hated, too. The next day we saw 'an hour of refuge' and just laughing. This movie just dropped.
