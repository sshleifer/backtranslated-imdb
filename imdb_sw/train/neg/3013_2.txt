Starting with its long opening of the columns that appear to be the end of the meeting of the meeting in the Chinese factory, Landscapes are trying to show a significant impact on the environment in the natural and traditional communities. His droning story thinks that industrial development in China and elsewhere is never quite the same, if it had never been a industrial revolution in Europe and America and Karl Marx has never visited the British Museum. That there may be a link between today's Asian car for manufacturing and wealth and early experience of hunger and fear have never been mentioned. At the same time, there are attempts to provide pictures of Edward Burtynsky's industrial waste somehow "good". Much of the film is a slide show of these pictures. They are well-produced, the museum hall, and apparently looks at several exhibitions. For me, however, they just show that almost any image can be made to look good as well presented. Industrial equipment is still a waste of industry. Relationships, if any, between the images and the message displayed in the film are still unknown. I don't mean to imply that there are no real problems and sometimes when countries run to do business. Developed conditions, however, only give us a strange and bitter desire. It's like two-hour speech with Noam Chomsky. Maybe it has some value as an exhibition of what was caused by the US (and Canada).
