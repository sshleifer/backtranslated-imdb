Avoid this trick at all costs. Wrong script, bad lies, bad acting, bad editing, bad sound, and bad music. Get the idea? This movie tries to be west west, not. It tries to be hard based on violence, it isn't. Trying to refresh the old version, it is not recommended. Vendors are trying there well, and my heart goes with them. But for such material to work and hard to do something to shine. For me this has apparently all of the "outdoor school outdoor film" will put the world to fire "the first attempt. Fresh filmmakers often cry out that they, or their budget, can chew. The best thing they can do is to take a few steps back, compensate as much as possible, and work on their small budget sometimes.
