When you go to an open movie under the Greek summer night it doesn't matter what the film is! Edison started very well with good efforts from the actors-who-want-to-be actors and once again Morgan Freeman but ... (In the movie often starts to get the audience, done, little boring still story filling in the middle of the movie which is more of the characters and less on stage, done, and the third part is a very good thing so that you can remember the movie ...) when you see the 30 elite police (packed with weapons that can demolish the building) shoot to the guy behind the car, fail to beat him once when he kills all (but 3) and then the boy takes the fire to throw fire (kill 3 others), you can realize that the Greek Aerial atmosphere filled with stars is a very good way to be corrupted by a movie like this!
