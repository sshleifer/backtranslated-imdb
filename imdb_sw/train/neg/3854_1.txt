Julia Stiles is a good talented actor, with guidance from a well-known agent has great potential. In fact, the person who led him to this success is not someone who cares about his work. I sat in a theater surrounded by young people who left the clubs to find another movie to spread in the question of who thought that this film would ask anyone. It was written well, the director casting it could put just 1 or 2 minutes of effort in the characters and the director was not concerned.
