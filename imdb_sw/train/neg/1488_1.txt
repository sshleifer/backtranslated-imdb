I had to register for IMD just to comment on how this movie was bad ... my cats and cotton have a better story than this. It is not the worst work I've ever seen, but when you wipe out every film in 5 minutes, it stops slightly. There was not one 'horrible' film on the film, except when they were watching the movie 'Halloween' on TV. All around, it seems like it would be a good story, run credit and say that Chasey Lain was in it was a bit of loss if I didn't recognize him immediately and his location was already before I could '' '' '' '' '' ' ''. I am so happy to see this hotel and I did not pay you as I would like to be true if I have paid a penny to see this. I usually like or at least find something to redeem in the movie, but this is different. It's so bad that it's not even very exciting - it's bad - it's just bad.
