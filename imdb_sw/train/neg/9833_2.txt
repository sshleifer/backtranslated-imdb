False defendant, underwear-run chums John Wayne (as John Scott) and Eddy Chandler (such as Kansas Charlie) change the identity as "Alias ​​Smith and Jones". Mr. Wayne becomes "John Jones". Mr. Chandler should be "Rev. Smith", but Wayne calls him "Dr. Smith". At any time it is one of them as entertainment as Roger Davis, Pete Duel, Jonathan Harris, or Ben Murphy; though, Wayne can be considered more successful than any of them, the work of wisdom. Beautiful blonde Mary Kornman (like Anne), grown from her days in our "Gang", is a good interest for Wayne. She and Chandler have several beautiful pictures and Wayne. If you are not a fan of less than John Wayne's 1930s, this film will not make you one.
