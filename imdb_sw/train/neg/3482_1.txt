So, I know I have voted 1 out of 10 but this really isn't more than half of the stars. I liked it. It was stupid and untrue, I could not believe any registered star to make this anonymous project. James G. and Cathrine O'Hara were excellent in their characters and Ben Affleck and Christina Applegate was also very good, but the story was played and I encourage anyone who sees this in the video store even bothering me and read the back cover, but just go away ... I don't even want you to get what the film is approaching, because it is too stupid to write about. <br /> <br /> Do not rent this! It's awesome! Horror!
