It shows a game of survival in war. In my experience of the film as a great boy of the film "action", I have lost that click that faces the eyes and my mind on the screen. One of the things that need to be in the film so I can be good is the ability to seize the viewer in real-time film and time. It didn't happen to me. I became "aware", for the whole movie.

More about films about war, it grows its popularity according to it. <br /> <br /> A simple concept: if this was a world war II or movie, it's just changing time, and everything that was the same, would it be this reward? Certainly not. Why? Because there are good things that lift the way up the bar. <br /> <br /> Compared to his opponents in Oscars, I do not think that all the winning awards are correct.
