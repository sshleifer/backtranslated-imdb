*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Juggernaut is a British made "exciting" released US and First National. Karloff is Dr. Sartorius leaves his departure because his money has disappeared. Karloff is obliged to return to France and introduce medical practice. She is recommended by a devout woman who wants to withdraw her greatest husband. He knows Karloff needs money. <br /> <br /> Karloff agrees with the proposal and soon becomes a husband's personal doctor. At all times, the wife pretends to be a city with a good player player. Karloff finally injures the old geyser and poison and he slides off. However, his son (from another marriage) arrived a few days before the murder and knows the will has been changed. When she is losing beans to the wife, she may have berserk and even ask the baby's hand. At the same time, Karloff's nurse has lost Karloff religion to kill an old man. When Karloff finds that he has not got any money, he asks the wife to hate the child. The nurse condemns Karloff and finds the hypo does not exist. Analysis shows poison, but not a good time as Karloff stimulates a nurse. Make a short story, the nurse runs, gets the police, and can save the next child from Karloff. Karloff instead injures himself and dies. <br /> <br /> This movie has some nice points. Karloff owns and has a kind of mad doctor who made in the Devil's Order and a Man Who lived again. It's special, however, to see him walking hard and a little siege. We do not know why he walks this way. I think the director thought it had caused more. The 2-year-old stereotypes of the 2-year-old wife is a horrible thing. She has French reputation. Although he is very victorious, he may still hate him (or perhaps you hate him because of his acting ...) <br /> <br /> Less than Karloff's average car. If you buy a copy of Sinister Cinema VHS, the sound is a little.
