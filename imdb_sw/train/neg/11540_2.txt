This reminded me of a lot of "Weekly Dirty" of Michael Winner of "Winny Weekend" and it is very bad to feel a budget budget below. First I must say it is a fan of all exploitation and great film. I am grateful, say, 'Demented' because ineptitude and the 'Last House on the left' because of the inevitable violence. And any Italian infectious and abnormal Italian leaves them. This was not meant though. The kind as the director of the British budget thought 'let's get it fixed' I will hit you at your grave 'without making it worse now that fear has returned in style and hostel. One thing is not only sure to be shared or be sure. What is the daughter of the fighters? Why are you worried that someone is an expert in security cameras? Crappy.
