While cheap on video at the beginning of Fat Crazy Ethel II, I wondered if the same film was on the lid. Unfortunately, it was. The story itself is simple mind. Ethel, the maniac of homicidal and eating disorders, are given in half the house because of overcrowding of hospitals. She is the most gentle woman looking at when one person places dead bodies in another soup. Ethel then is hated by one employee of the house and chocolate bar after hitting the cost of reducing the cost of feeding the dog food. Ethel succeeds by spraying through the wire to the level and then .... well, you get an idea. If all this looks like happiness, it is not. This film was not made for the most costly and costly. The characters are wooden when giving their line that they should stand out in front of a cigarette shop. To make matters worse, half of the film has the first key on Ethel's film, Insane's Crime, which is much better. Very bad effort.
