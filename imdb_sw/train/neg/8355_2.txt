Wanda Nevada is an amazing movie of pubescent using the 1979 concept of what causes romance illegal for girls aged 13 years. Script, pacing, and patterns are very safe. Procedure for protest against faith. The characters say with a simple diction that usually finds in films based on less than 10, but also includes many sexual references related to the behavior of Shields and image deaths. <br /> <br /> Movie wants to be a comedy on a certain level but never enough, a picture of adventure but a compound and actions are of concern, and children's movie but it sells pedophilia and child rape as a real possibility. It also wants to be the image of the master, come to the image of the old, movie spirit, spiritual spiritual, travelogue, and western. The overall impact is of great ignorance and misconceptions. Nevada Wanda is a perfect waste for a while unless you want to see very beautiful shots of Grand Canyon. That can do very well.
