The idea was surprising, the participants were wonderful, the story could be very frightening, but writing was bad and no depth. I couldn't enter this film. I could not feel for the characters, there were many of the cliffhangers, and the movie approaching just weirdly. Was it the end of happiness? I don't know. Was it the sad end? Again, I don't know. You come out of the hearing hall. Movie had a lot to offer, but it didn't. Just because you can edit, doesn't mean you should, right? I will not recommend this movie because you cannot say that you have left the feeling of the film as it was completed. You will only be confused. Believe me, maybe I will thank you if you watch this film. <br /> <br /> 3/10
