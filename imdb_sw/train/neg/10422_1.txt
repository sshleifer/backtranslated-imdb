First, I am not afraid to ... Nothing except for my few phobias, but this film is quite awesome. This is not correct for children at all! I had my mouth open all the time just accusing me. Didn't believe how gory was for children's movie, bunnies to be brutally killed! It should only be so awesome and counted G. I recommend that more than 8 see this. But don't get in badly, maybe it's a good movie if I didn't have a brain damage like a child. I can't believe the parent will allow, let's say, a 4-year-old child looking at this. It is to the edge and hard, not to forget the gory, for young children. I am more than 4 and I was shocked by violence. I do not recommend
