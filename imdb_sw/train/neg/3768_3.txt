That's right. Modern written, targeted and produced by Fred Tepper and family. (Fred should know more, after making a set of 'Titantic' and 'Dogma'.) So, the plot. There are some scientists, and some of the dangers of forests, and hot chick with large artificial breast. They are all very bad in their work, including a hot chick (who I think it should be a photographer, but who cares about why wearing a bikini). One of the forest rangers says that scientists are "professional people," which is good, because it would be bad if they were professional grubs or jellybeans or Ewoks. <br /> <br /> They go through the wood in the search of strange bones of the foot, and no one says that bones can only be of Bigfoot's wonderful. They just walk with one of the unabashedly rangers hits on hottie. We all hope he dies soon (with his sister who translated it into a good stupid person, but it's really just awesome). Then they, * explode *, get the Sasqu ... I mean, Example like Livestock. Of course, there is no conversation that can be just the bones of Bigfoot engaging in ... I think scientists and rangers of forests do not think just about those kinds of objects. <br /> <br /> Then Sasquatch and his tribe get very angry and kill all the people we do not like, they drive away the lost and invite his aunt Muriel and Cousin Josh (who died in a serious accident accident) again. (I lost several times), an unsuspecting plot, a bad CGI (a man with a monkey's appetite best), and to do that was not good enough to add everything to make the film no longer look at. <br /> <br /> Looking out though; it is advisable to laugh at unintentional.
