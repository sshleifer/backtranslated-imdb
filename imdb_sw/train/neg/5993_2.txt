I grew up (b. 1965) as I watched and loved Thunderbirds. All my schoolmates watched. We played "Thunderbirds" before school, during lunch and after school. We all wanted to be Virgil or Scott. No one wanted to be Alan. Counting from 5 became a form of art. I took my children to see the movie with the hope of finding out what I liked as a child. How sad. The only thing was just a snappy theme. It is not that it can compare with the original symbols of Thunderbirds. Thanks to the morning of Saturday morning one television station still takes a series of series Gerry Anderson and his wife created. Jonatha Frakes should give a place in the seat of directors, his version was not quite optimistic. Losing film. Fill the trash. The CGI Remake can be accepted but replace the marionettes and Homo sapiens subsp. sapiens was a big mistake of judgment.
