This is a piece of WW II that is broken, stolen, etc.. Acting is about what I expected from this MGM executives "B". <br /> <br /> One of the greatest attention. Jean Rogers, who worked very well to play Dale Arden very much in the first two experiments of Flash Gordon is just bad in this film. Her character is very annoying. He never never let-up and overacting it. We should believe that at the time of World War I in what would undoubtedly be the Higher Secretary, he would be allowed to enter and out of any office of his choice though he has no official function. From that perspective I am sorry that I have watched this film. It has changed my opinion of Mrs Rogers. For, he is very swift. <br /> <br /> Lee Bowman is its ordinary man, meaning it is just enough. <br /> <br />
