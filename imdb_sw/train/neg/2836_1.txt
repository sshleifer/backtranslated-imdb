I saw the open fabric on the video storage shelf. And before I get my first VCR I thought I would like to register for this small gem and it is a good choice of film when it's very good! This is a hilarious discussion. And it has cameo and Donald Trump. Anthony Quinn is in it unknown. And much like Christopher Walken seemed to want stars in every bad movie in his later years. This film is Mr. Quinn's Country Bears. <br /> <br /> It has features like, "Close and allow me!" <br /> <br /> And "You say a lot of sh_it!" You will be disappointed with the war zone like Bo makes SOMMERSAULT at the billiard table! And what does the kick good kick when he comes from the roll! Chop action socky and T fun! <br /> <br /> It is a fan of a film that can ask more? Oh, and when the behavior of Mr. Quinn commits suicide and return to disgusting Bo as the soul asks why he committed suicide instead of his curable disease? He says, "Real men don't quiche." Yeah, yes, yes. If Bo was a good cookie he woulda called for the right exorcist then and there!
