Yes, that pertains to. This movie was awesome. Two minutes in I wanted to blow my eyes out. This has been rated as a "new LDS comedy," but it's not the same for members of the church! I don't think anyone should be victims like watching the film of this low quality. Before all, you can tell them that there is no effort at all in this movie. It looks like a horrible fabric, glib, a trite plot was thrown with two small things in some way filled with a gift of thought (at least half). Then, there is acting, which is bad for everyone * involved. Even watos fail to liven up. <br /> <br /> And let us forget the fact that our protagonist is a deep jerk who we want to believe may change, but that road is full of bad conversation, hideous shame "gags," and a lot of Mormon "in-joke" that anyone in their right mind, LDS or not, should only think * stupid *! This should be one of the worst films I saw!
