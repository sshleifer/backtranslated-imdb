This movie should not be made. From an incomplete animation, even more bad acting. I don't know when the people behind this film said "Ok, it looks good! Let's do it!" I was afraid of how real this movie was bad. At the same time, which may be part of the work, the computer produced Saber Tooth's gold is located from the roof hitting the idiot architect of the cat's mouth ... uh, ooookkkk. The son of the movie was a paralyzed sabretooth who was killed within minutes of his first appearance. Two others can kill a few of the people before they are burned and shot. Then, there are ordinary victims of anticipation in the jungle ... which scary for one reason alone. Is There a Second Part? God, for mankind everywhere I don't trust. <br /> <br /> This movie was a clean garbage. From the scope of the maximum wind power on the slide show ending.
