I had many expectations from this film and more because it was Yashraj's film. Jimmy makes a call center and one day is invited by Pooja Singh to teach his boss, Lakhan Singh, English. . They all fall in love and decide to run but Pooja tells Jimmy that he can't do it if he gives a debt to Lakhan Singh, who is also known as Bhaiyyaji. But they decide and steal money from him and so just Jimmy sees that Bhaiyyaji / Lakhan Singh is Don. Meanwhile, Bhaiyyaji employs man, Bachchan Pandey, track down Jimmy and Pooja. Played with Saif Ali Khan, Kareena Kapoor, Anil Kapoor and Akshaye Kumar, the film is headed by the first director Viay Krishna Acharya and is presented by Aditya Chopra and Yash Chopra. "Tashan" becomes one of the worst films I've ever seen. Yes! Good condition is good with Kareena Kapoor (and losing her with great weight) looks good. But the plot is too narrow on the story and sometimes it doesn't mean from one location to another - so why I said earlier that I expected more from this film as it was Yashraj's production. By mentioning songs, unfortunately, there is no single song I can remember now. There is a time when one can laugh and especially thanks to Akshaye Kumar and Saif they could do better when Kareena Kapoor played its part properly. But this can not say to Anil Kapoor - it did not agree with him as a villain. Finally, do not mind Aditya Chopra, who in the past has produced and redirected a good film such as "Mohabbatein," Yash Chopra was doing with the filing film? <br /> <br /> Conclusion: bad movie, not worth losing your time and that's my first and last feeling.
