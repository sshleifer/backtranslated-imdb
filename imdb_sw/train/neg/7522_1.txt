Wow ... where to start ... it took this to Big Big for $ 2.99 only. That's three bucks I won't see them again ... ever ... and why? I'll tell you. At fifteen minutes of chat, boring, boring chat and college angst which seems most suited for the movie Lifetime than flick the fear of being advertised on the box. (Maybe the droids of sale that made hell for eternity). Follow it up and a little bit of cheap price (not the good intention of the mind and you ...) and lose the plot at the end that comes from anywhere, and makes sense. No, bad, bad ... <br /> <br /> Are there any features of redemption? In fact, at the level of Joe Bob Briggs, there were six breasts involved, but that is not worth the value of my third time lost. Without those, this coulda has been Sci-Fi at the time, say, two or three morning ... <br /> <br /> Bmoviefreak
