This film is probably the worst movie I saw. I am learning French at college and so understand all the conversations, so the language barrier is not a matter. I must say it is very difficult to feel and any of the characters shown on the film. There is only one professional actress in cast and I think there are no professional directors or authors. Even though I have tested 1 out of 10 maybe it is not a good score. This is an attempt to lose the current total of 7.3 to something more. Probably 4.3 will be a proper rating because the film is actually non-event 100 minutes or so for that he will never return. <br /> <br /> The real embarrassment is that I am sure some college student is provoking his nut to make the film twice beautiful and half length. However if you want to join the bandwagon which appears spinning IMDb you can also continue to provide "Lost in Translation" 10 as well.
