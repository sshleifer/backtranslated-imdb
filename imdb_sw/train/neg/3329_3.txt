Take your primary flick of Frankenstein, try some Reanimator (but not a good place), and you have Doctor Hackenstein. In fact, this was clearly guided by the previously mentioned films but has not included anything special for himself. The scientist accidentally kills his wife, so the whole movie takes place one night trying to raise his wife. To revive his wife, he decides to remove the parts of the body from some women who have been destroying and, unfortunately, choose to stay at night in place. I can't say that acting is bad, don't lead. Everything here is just too common. Does the small experiments here really work (see the area where Hackenstein hides behind his deaf assistant because of course he will surely be very sad if he has seen a woman with a needle), but that's not enough to recommend this film. Music is decent, what blood there is respect, and cast looks quite well. And for half a time, I was enjoying this film. But I've never felt like this was anything more than waster time. Avoid. Try the Frankhohoer instead.
