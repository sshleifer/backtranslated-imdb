I want to say first that I am a Christian (and that I work in the film and TV industry) so I understand what works on film lengths so that the potential of film developers in this regard. I am in a good message, lifting it as true to the living conditions (that this is a fallen world and that things do not always work ... even for Christ's followers). I am glad that others are very excited about the high Christian message; for me I was just that implementation was where the film fell on his face. The movie lives and dies on its story and here you have one discretion of patterns, several performances, and a unique change in behavioral behaviors that are not confused to say at least. I believe that the film is not appropriate to give you a club on its head and message to get the point. I am sure the Kendrick bros. it will improve over time and that their way of writing stories too. Maybe they can redirect someone else's screen as their upcoming project. Game movies are not my first love but good (Mobilizers, Part Dreams, etc.) can inspire in many ways. If you would like to have a PG film that is inspiring, look at the 'King of Hill' of Steven Soderbergh. The whole truth is the truth of God ...
