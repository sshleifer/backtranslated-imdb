The first half of the movie was fast enough and set up characters. however everything was suddenly happening very quickly, the worst reason for Akshey Kumar to date 3 girls, loudly on the action of Akshey and John Abraham. Neha Dupia was a movie attraction, Paresh Rawal did well but not equal to his performance in Hera Pheri. In general this film was a great disappointment of the film inappropriate for its trailer. secure your money and look at this movie, see Hera Pheri and Hungama again! Overall: The effectiveness of displaying the level of performance and the appearance of a no-story film or thing, the plot was odd non-emotional music and Preetam man who bought Dhoom! keep! When all the movies were in the same room, the new audience (casting of women) were the same as their first movie but the actors who started as Akshey and John were totally disappointed by the director appointed as Priyadarshan gives his movie worse!
