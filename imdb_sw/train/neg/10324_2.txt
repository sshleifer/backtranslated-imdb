The mosque is one of the most CBC competitions I've ever seen. They have a way to produce a simple comedy software which can be for the most old-offended viewers with CBC which means 85-year-old farmers in Saskatchewan. The joke is all predictable and thus the death of the hurt can not believe. The exhibition is a hammy and more that has been done but I do not charge the perpetrators since these types of common characters are particularly likely that CBC requested and needed. Very few show and bad jokes they tried to show as a "controversial" well is less controversial than other boring comedies comediies as The Hour has 22 minutes, Royal Canadian Air Farce and Report Rick Mercer.
