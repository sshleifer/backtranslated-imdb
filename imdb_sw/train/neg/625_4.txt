For all the violence in this film, it would be NC-17. But a year may be pg-13 and there was a big question when a mother had a boyfriend who was a bad-looking boy. There was a lot of behavioral development that made the film better, then after the child returned to life as a scarecrow, there was an unintelligent hour and ten minutes to kill people. There was so much violence and I think the body was bigger than twelve which is a large number of movies like this. Almost every character in the film is beaten or drops his head, but the teacher who called him "white garbage" and "hoodlum" (though the lester's character is anything but not close, I know hoods and is a hood part, they don't draw a class, they stay there and give us things to the teacher. The teacher deserved the most horrible death than any of the characters, but was just beaten back. There were two concerns in the film, but it wasn't long enough to be quite awesome. As I said, the massacre was serious and sometimes people who had nothing to do with the line of story eliminates their heads. If the cloud was fun to see, then it would be a 17-bit. The two children describe the body they get in the wheat fields, they describe it as more gorier than it really was, explained to the soldiers that there was dirt surrounding the boy's intestines. His stomach has never been opened so there were no ulcers that were inside his stomach, although I would like to see it. Acting was sad, the characters were lost, and the scarecrow could do a lot of gymnastix queues. I advise you to rent this movie for death events, I no longer see any time soon, but I enjoyed a lot of violence. Also, do not bother with that good, I looked at it for five minutes and I was angry to die, it looked good but not. The original Scarecrow took me seriously.
