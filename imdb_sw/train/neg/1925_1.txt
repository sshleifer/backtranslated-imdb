Ron Howard explained this? The cartoon of 1966 attracts, teaching a simple lesson for children using a simple plot. In this movie, Howard gives us a Whoville filled with those greedy, ignorant, self-centered. Jim Carrey is awesome, but I'm sure it's not his fault; I think the script is needed a man who remembers more, so Carrey sent Tom Green and the result is the magic of the film. As well as Danny Devito's Penguin on the return of Batman, Carin's Grinch is not quite good and that any level of comedy that can be beaten from its behavior is only fatal. Where the cartoon of 1966 included the Grinch which we can recognize all of, the Caroline's Grinch is that an angry, very powerful man who has seen one or another, sitting in a car that has been reinforced or a newborn in supermarkets and cane. This grinch has completely lost any level of humanity, humor, or any awareness, and its redemption at the end of false film rings. The whole movie ring lies: there is a competition of stupid Christmas lights, an attempt to explain why the Grinch is such a jerk by digging in his childhood, and hidden secrets that are why some of them are that weird mouth extension and some of them are not. Contrary to the cartoon of 1966, I would like to think the children will receive this stirring movie, irritating, and full of different messages. What? We really need to see Slutty Smurf, who Christine Baranski like Martha May Whoer? In addition, Ron Howard filled the cast with his incompatible relatives. Throw in the joke of anger, sexuality, and some of the Carreyesque low-humorous humor, and you have a very close movie from the 1966 cartoon (or a book that was revealed) as George W. Bush comes from ideas, wise. Buttons under this great oil turkey.
