This film might be able to become a terrible film. The main character was made well and I felt sorry and there was a decent amount of backstory. KILEKA, everything else. Director, Emmanuel, are not able to make movies. He uses some of the idiotic shots forever. <br /> <br /> - a few combinations of random images are spread throughout the film. I don't know if he tried to be comprehensive and intelligent and poetic but he didn't. It was stupid. The random shots of the main character trailer lived in, random buildings, acute building shots, a random building that walks away. WTF? And clouds. There are a lot of dark clouds. He liked this approach to having a cleared area on different shots instead of just one shot. EX: This tries to reduce its weeds and camera circles next to him. Instead of just one shot, he edits it as 10 different shots so his true EDGY! and HIP! and SMART! ignorant. Acting is awesome but what makes the movie more interesting. And scarecrow is a gymnast causing him flips and spins and twirls at all. And some deaths may be better. You expect a big bully to have a long term well built but not. Corncob easy in the ear. The love of love was fire. Causes. Why this film gets 2.
