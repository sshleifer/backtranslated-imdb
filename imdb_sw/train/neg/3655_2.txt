Oh my, I think this could be one movie of cheesiest I ever seen. I am bad, this is one of the last movies b. The first evidence is that it is not a DVD of $ 5. Laam, that also applies to this. I have found this on VHS, from a video that is full of rental videos in a local video store. I can quote a blurb: "In the 17th century of Japan, there was a Samurai who could put his name was Mayeda. He was sent to an epic trip around the world to get 5,000 muscats from the Spanish king. A severe storm gives their precious gold to buy weapons and almost takes their lives to Mayeda must fight all the problems of survival and the end of Japan's beloved loved one. "Then it goes on to say" Epic multi-range epic action adventure in three continents " br /> <br /> I had to see a different film. This was not an epic, and indeed there was no multi-million dollars. No, 'Shogun Mayeda' is really just the adventures of Engrish-speaking Mayeda (Sho Kosugi). He is not really Shogun, but that's not important. What is important, is that he makes a very cold sense of John Cleese's once in a single fortress in 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail', with his ability to go from great events to show his mental powers of Samurai. Amazing. The most important thing about this film is the accent of Sho Kosugi of Engrish. The film may lack everything that makes a good film, but it makes it with the most of the best ever-ever, produced by Engrish's most cool ever. And honestly, you really want anything else? You can move forward 'Shogun Mayeda' to the end, and return to the final Kosugi line. The tape may wear before it is enough for that line. Awesome. <br /> <br /> 2/10 - So very much.
