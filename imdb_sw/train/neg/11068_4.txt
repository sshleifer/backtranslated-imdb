Dahmer, a little confused man. Dahmer, a mixing movie. In fact, I had a few beers when I watched movies, but that didn't explain why I was so tired of this flick. His balls are nothing but a fog and irritating, and there is no true story and beginning and end, the only thing that was prudent in the film was the writing of the beginning and end of the movie. The middle items, which will be the film, are just pictures to stimulate and waste time. We don't see real killings, everything is an intervention group. Sometimes you can even get the impression that Dahmer is going to something around, but you know he doesn't, for it's <br /> <br /> based on true stories and this has happened, at least many of them. But what happened? It's not easy to tell. I don't encourage people to waste time on this film. I did not like it a bit and I felt desperate when it suddenly ended. <br /> <br /> * / *****
