Why have I lost my time with this movie? There was no single joke or a good line. The sauce was not a smell at all. I mean really, it's out of the pipe to breathe enough control? Why is Lampoon's national name connected to this film? Even the Christmas holiday was better than this (I really thought that the film was very interesting). <br /> <br /> FIND IN PLAGUE!
