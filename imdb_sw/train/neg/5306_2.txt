Okay, I'm blessed. I have seen two very strong crops, one in New York and previously cast, and another in San Diego Rep (Rosina Reynolds and Monique Gaffney, you rock!). Compared to one of these films is almost unknown. I have been plodding through the DVD for the last two nights and I have never been. The way to talk a lot out, and many waaay added scenes to people. Yes, two major exhibitions are very good, esp. Mrs. Streep. But comparing the action to the film is definitely a "bottom-up" pattern. Strengthening to play to meet the need for the film of the goers of various types and specific was a bad choice. Please please please visit you to find the production of certain action near you.
