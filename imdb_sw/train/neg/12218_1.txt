Very bad. Very, very bad. If a partner who likes to do, have or - at least - to cook a catering table on a film, I found it difficult to prosecute the citizens who actually found a film of any kind. However, this movie ... oh dear. Detecting Frightworld does not desire anything more than the misuse itself (self-esteem itself) and trying to make it look similar to the most common standards is a mistake. And being fair, it is more entertaining than - say - Red Zone Cuba ... but not to the extent. So I don't try to ask, I would like to ask to give out the observation. <br /> <br /> 1) If the year is a film stage, shouldn't it be seen? <Br /> <br /> 2) If you have employed three sound people they make sure that at least one knows how to use the equipment. <br /> <br /> 3) In a terrible movie maniac your shot must be more strict than a smurf donkey. It is difficult to know but in fact ... 4) There are many video publishers in the Buffalo / Rochester area, many can employ real cheap. Find someone who knows how to create a location. 5) Just because you have someone who knows how to use After Effects and other cool apps does not mean that they should do it every two seconds. <Br /> <br /> 6) Kudos to get girls to take off their heads but sometimes, find girls who on top we want to see taken away. <br /> <br /> 7) Editing should help tell stories or set mood. At least in this type of film editing you must sell the gags of the year. The series of a series of sequence in the male characters is unstable, it is wrong. <br /> <br /> Some good things. Not all work was bad. Jack was good and I liked Acid once he started fighting. There was a beautiful picture, unfortunately was thrown on the screen without rhyme or reason. "Acid Poptart" is a name that deserves the best movie. I like moxie's Frightworld too. In the future, now having a type of film under their belts, I hope they all involve longing for something better than Colman Francis. Upgrade at least Ed Wood.
