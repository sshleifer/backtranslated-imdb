To read my review of the HOUSE which has been beaten, many can assume that I am 14 years old who thinks SCREAM is considered to be afraid of "classic". This is not, since I am 30 years old and I have been looking at horrible films for my life. But in fact, I am a 80-year-old child who grew on a slasher / zombie / ghost / cannibal, etc. ... the most horrible films - so I love many awesome films that are more than pictures and faster. As a person who can understand different genres, painting, or in this case, the film - but not like them - I can understand why other people can enjoy this kind of film ... I'm not ... </> <br /> House which is covered is a very interesting and stimulating film for school girls. The wife of the school load says in the hand of the metal (or whip in some cases ...) to keep the girls in line. She has a little baby who sows and loves girls during bathing (in their nightclubs is not low (???) ..., and at the same time, girls are missing out of school if they are victims of the killer who sleeps over campus. I can see why HUMAN HANDS are often compared to SUSPIRIA (which is the center of the film in my opinion ...), for the atmosphere of the school itself and the cooperation between girls and their caregivers - but this film is lighter and unlikely that I could stay awake. I'm in "tension" and "insisting" in awesome films - but this film did not happen to me. I am desperate - HOUSE THAT SCREAMED reinforced the fact that I personally enjoyed more than 70 films. This is not a hard and quick rule, but those I have enjoyed definitely seem to be different. you see "for awesome fans who enjoy most of the films created by them - but if I don't know so many fans, I can't recommend this ... 4/10
