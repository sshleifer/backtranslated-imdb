I've had to change my focus on the worst movie in the world after seeing this. This is it! Make this mistake for this film is great. <br /> <br /> Here is a list of reasons: <br /> <br /> The story of hope (despite being a true story). Bad work (what was Judge Reinhold thinking) The bad stunts of course. Children's conversations. Promotional promotions. Lack of space. <br /> <br /> Get a photo? <br /> <br />
