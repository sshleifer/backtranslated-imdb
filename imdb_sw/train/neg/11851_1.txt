This was a desperation - there was nothing original. Brits seem to only be able to make a non-broken film without a top history of the American version. The preliminary series with interesting stories and performance monitoring and great attention to lights and settings. I have watched it many times and I am still engaged. <br /> <br /> Just the other to deal with the poor on the offset line with the "Cracker". Get better with BBC America or BBC Canada and look for fun such as Waking Dead, Spooks, Witness Witness, and Judge John Deed. Look at the original evil of evil, then search for "Wire in Blood" for more of the good prestige of Robson Green. Hollywood needs to watch this actor!
