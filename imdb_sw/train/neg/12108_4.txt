You just had to write that one of the liners, but it's true. I love the gangster type and this is the weakest entry I have seen in recent years. I have a reputation for everyone involved in many fields except one most important, script. It is a weak story about minor crimes. No amount of good acting or black and white styling film can make for a lack of total substance. I love Kevin Spacey and I heard he could make another film about the whole. My advice doesn't waste your time.
