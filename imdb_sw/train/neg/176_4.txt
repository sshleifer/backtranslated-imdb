<br /> <br /> I saw this at the Sci-Fi center. It came after the first. For some reason this movie has made me interested. I don't know why, stop asking. SPOILERS --- Okay ... It was a cheesy how this person was involved in making a film. In the first movie, he had a "cause" to kill people, but in this sequal, half of the murder / attempted murder was based on any reason. Stanley murdered the director because of the innovative differences, captured a collaborator from the innovative differences, but what is involved and trying to kill off? No cast, no movie. Wanted to "look real when they died"? If this was supposed to be a great film budget, use special effects, MAN. Of course if the first, the captured girl leaves, and Stanley ends up getting dirty, and the pieces of stars. Woooooow (fear). This film capability. And sadly for all ... sad part ... I would like to watch "Cabin and Lake 3". It's because I love Judd Nelson, and he's just a good part about this sequal.
