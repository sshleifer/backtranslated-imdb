In fact I can't say anything bad * or good about this. Its characters love enough, it capably produced and designed, and professional-looking (except for suesy monster suits). However, it has no origin, no ideas, and nothing has never seen in ALIEN, PREDATOR, ARMAGEDDON and / or OUTLAND. It's just another formula, a cookie player, "grony drones of corporate in a comprehensive position against the unbeatable monster" flick. Pretty very waste of time.
