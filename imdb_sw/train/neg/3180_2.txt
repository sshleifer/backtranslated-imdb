What a stimulating film! In general, only Nana Patekar just hit his master Karisma Kapoor, when he tried to run away from the village, with his son. One can say BORING ??? The concept was not very bad, but it was not well done. Canadian districts, and some village events were shot. However, the total number of movies was released. That story would be good, but the movie seemed just coming. There is only ignorance that one can take, allowing three hours of blood. <br /> <br /> The best part of the entire movie was a song "Ishq Kamina", and that was only five minutes long. Other than that, this film was a piece of skin.
