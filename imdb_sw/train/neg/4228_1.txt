I can't believe how bad this piece is! I want back to me $ 3.99! The words accuse of this degraded piece of information! Dubbing in any way or form is not the same as the actor's lips. The movie looks like it was done with a vintage camcorder of 1970. I've played the best movies with my mobile phone camera. Gore is laughable due to a strange plot. Acting is what one would expect if you called all your friends on Saturday afternoon and you started to get caught up, then try to play on your garage. Don't do wrong ... I wasn't expecting O'Neil and I love Zombie movies, but the production standards are very low in this film to make it impossible. Avoid!
