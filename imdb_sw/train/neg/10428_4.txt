Did anyone else feel betrayed as I did? At first or so it was very good but last. My God. It seemed like it was possible and cheesy. It's not great and epic like the whole run of the show has been. Many studies have read that have been envious but I can't understand why. I predicted that the last way to end earlier but it took that step because I thought "No, they will not be able to do it, that's FAR also standing." I can never stand. I feel unworthy. I think I'm almost walking out the door to sell every season I have. Someone please. Change my mind. I want to love this. Very bad. Someone tells me why I'm wrong. Great version. End of terrible.
