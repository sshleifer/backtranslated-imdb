I agree, I don't remember much about characters or stories, although I don't know there is one, I was soooo angry with this film that I had a hard time considering. How can you mention the film "Keys to Tulsa" and then follow the film in Texas? The desert desert desert near Arlington (I think it was a place) there is no way similar to the green hills around Tulsa, and a celebrity in Tulsa would have a great neighbor to live. Of course no one in the movie has found a Tulsa or maybe they could realize how there is nothing in the cinema even similar to it. Isn't anyone seen Rumblefish or Outdoors? I know this seems to be interesting but I can't help. I looked at this because I love James Spader and I've often attracted Eric Stotz. But even these exciting actors could not overcome these orders, and meant individuals who are not in TULSA !! Sorry, it can't be more expensive for the film in Oklahoma. What if "Living and Die in LA" was shot in Toronto? Could that be effective? Well so too.
