Ooof! This was a stinker. It does not fall 'somewhere between Star Wars and Thriller', indeed. In reality, it comes somewhere between Wham's cracks! The video with Captain EO, just not a big budget, and many young teenagers are crying out. Simon Le Bon begins before and in the middle, while the rest of the port are trying to hide the fact that they have stolen all their work from the previous 3 albums of Roxy Music. The shortest part of Barbarella did not add anything. Avoid at all costs. (However, I liked the places they played with the "Hunger as The Wolf" but why was there a tiger walking in viewers turning into a battered woman with a tiger? Anything.) The 80 video DVD of Duran Duran is worth looking at the cause of nostalgia
