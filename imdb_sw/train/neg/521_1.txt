Wow! This film is quite bad. I can't imagine how anyone could read this unwritten script and bad green. Release is the second level column and realistic displays from close to all that has been hit. The story is included, divided and unavailable. Explain, guide and predictable. No wit, no charm, no humor. It's not sexy at least. The characters remain as flat as a proverbial pen. There is also the power of misogyny which became increasingly difficult for the stomach as the film continued. When your leadership (Carrell) is unfunny and unappealing is rising from there. Despite changing money-around the end where love prevails over greed I was left with a feeling of disease within my stomach. If this is the one that passes through a sense of humor and social, then we will be destroyed.
