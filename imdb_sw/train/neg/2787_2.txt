For a number of stories of Kid (Prince), singer, on his way to become a star. Then likes for Apollonia (Appolonia So). But he has to deal with his father to beat his wife (Clarence Williams III!) And his own destructive behavior. I saw this in the theater in 1984. I was not a big fan of Prince but I liked the three great songs from this film - "The Purple Rain", "Let's Get Crazy", and "When Tanks On" . Festival events in this film are great - full of energy and excitement. Unfortunately this is a very small part of the film. The story is very obvious and has been done many times before - and even better. Subplots are, to put it well, to be dealt with badly. Triangle of Love between Kid, Appolonia and Morris Day was so predictable and tired that I actually became insulting. His wife beat the father is needed for stories, but these events are being dealt with strongly (by acting and leadership) that I could not believe. Script is a bad conversation - a conversation with some of the "comedy" practice. And there are tons of misogyny here - Mother's Kid get beaten; Baby beat Appolonia and (because no) Appolonia strips and goes on swimming in a dirty river. Williams and King's characters' treat women in a bad way every time. Where is this movie completely defeated? Appolonia is good and beautiful - but no actor. And Prince is (easily) actress WORST I've ever seen. His open face and the delivery of timber talk is very bad I couldn't believe. This film comes only in life during the events of the festival but there is no truth that many. The "big" events are being mistreated and addressed that makes this movie a chore to stay. They should only have made this film of the festival. I give this 2 - just music.
