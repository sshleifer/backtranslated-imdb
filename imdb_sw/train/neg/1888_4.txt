This video reminds me of "Irreversible (2002)", another film of art works and is a cruel and powerful human nature. I didn't like the movie but I can't say it is a bad movie, it's special. I also remember about "Camping Cosmos (1996)" where a class of low-class statistics are residents of the barracks in Belgium. The same description of people living together, in turn against their will and with all the struggle of the characters that are not the same. I also thought about the books of the French author Emile Zola who was the author of the original style. I did not like the movie and I do not like the people in it. They all look like vulgar, without any basic flavor. One can ask a question why they live, they all seem to be on this planet is a member of a great farce, forced to live according to their will. Or you can say: Hell is over this world.
