I am sad that the period of history that is very interesting and very expensive for the film can be made of ho-hum. Wm C Quantrill was not shown in the film, perhaps the most interesting figure of the period. Frank James was never mentioned, Cole Younger, ditto, and blood blood Bill Anderson, whose angel was killed every time he came to war was not at all in the script. Instead we had to look at the false characters who had never been anyone we cared about. how sad. The dress was strange however, as it was the shooting area in Missouri. I hope Ang Lee will make another film from this period and try again, or another film manufacturer will look at the enormous wealth of material to write the play screens.
