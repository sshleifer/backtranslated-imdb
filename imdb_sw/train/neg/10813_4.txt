The first half of this version was the best I saw (and I think I've got every version of Jane Eyre who has ever done). Jane's childhood development and character were unique. Then, it was like someone said "Uh oh, this runs too long," and hit the whole story for whipping. Major events, including all the time, are included, connected, and given in such a way that they completely change the story. There was a little transition or even development of the area that would be difficult for anyone who does not know the story even to follow. The great desire was that the beginning opened many hopes, and finally hit it.
