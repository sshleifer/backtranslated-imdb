A viewer of something will remember more is the pain of the movie head has given because of the high flashy, shaky, camera and fast cutting, mixing. It is not against these kinds of stylistic materials if they have been done similar to Oliver Stone and Steven Soderbergh with their many movies, but in this case there was very WAY. It seems to be reduced-flying and shining in the light of each other on the city of Mexico and every important area was there to prevent you from realizing that the story is thin and anything was predictable. A great desire is in the fact that you can easily think of how everything will be finished. For films pretending to be violent, innocent and ethical, it cannot be judged that stories have been told many times and with much more development and character development. That is another despair of the movie. If I want to look at the flick of the above step I don't need any accuracy, but this film attempted to justify the murder of Denzel Washington's behavior and failure to give any reliable presentations. The first half of an hour or so nothing is happening except that the archetypes of dumb and clich√©s are shown and when the action machine begins to blow speed is cut off quickly that you don't know what happens. So the film does not work at the level of the role play / reliable desire, nor is it a fresh movie action. Of course the movies are not as good as some of the disabled disabled years ago, but I can't understand why so many people say this film is something new and so cool. For video video it is a very long way to the movie has very little substances.
