Three Characters - Having a Rocket, It Will Walk - 1959 This is the first film of the long-term feature to have a stooges star and is very bad. Makes THREE STEPS TO WORK IN DAZE (starting in 1963) looks like a hub. <br /> <br /> Non-janitors place on rocket. They climb on the rocket and goes to Venus. They meet certain things including the buffalo talking “Uni” which repeats the world with them. "Uni" speaks as an average, good person - 'Oh, hello. How are you? Beautiful planet here. Hope you like. Hilarious. Very few of the events and many events are just going on. It does not return from space and the film is too high the story goes, but nobody told them that the filmmakers of the film are going on for 10 minutes or so in a party where nothing happens. Stooges leave the party and then the film is near. <br /> <br /> The top section of the film - the end where the stooges sing a little song dapper about their journey. Larry and Curly Joe beat Moe on the face with two pies. Cruel. <br /> <br /> Another author mentioned a good music name. Huh? The only music I saw was two common tunes - ILL TAKE ROMANCE and probably SONG AGAIN, both of which are played at a party. And * really is the top part of the image - music from the old film of Columbia. <br /> <br /> The long blonde was beautiful. <br /> <br /> Evil - a new VHS video from just 99 park.
