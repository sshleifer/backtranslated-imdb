On this day and the old wonderful effects of the film, this was a bad desire. Workers seemed to be hard and powerless, as it was the conversation. West is not typical for Hollywood for these days, but movies like "Silverado" suggest that someone out there knows how to do good. Considering that, it is difficult to imagine that anyone could go at any cost at the time of release, largely making such a weak film. If you like and you are looking for a good western, keep looking!
