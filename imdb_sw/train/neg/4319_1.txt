Sorry, but I will destroy the whole line of plot and finish with the hope of avoiding the fiasco of the holiday as I have seen now. The father dies and the mother asks Santa in a letter to bring him back to the family for Christmas, ... and Santa does not. The father is a peachy, healthy and does not know the fact that he is dead. But all like a parent who recently looked at my five-year-old friend lost his best friend of canine, it was a flick of fear. Now my son believes that all he has to do to bring his friend back is to ask Santa! Do not underestimate the power of a small heart - no amount of influence will influence him to be the only movie and that his dog does not return for Christmas. It has been a heartbreak to look at her fun just knowing that Christmas will deserve to lose her again. Shamed on you on behalf of all believers who have lost a loved one recently. It is difficult to cope with the loss of one at a time, but there are certain requirements that we should not show even the possibility.
