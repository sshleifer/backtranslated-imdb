The thing about calling "The House of the Dead" the worst movie of all time is that it is not true. There are the worst movies out there. I look at the Hong Kong ninja movies that are the result of a Japanese police ceremony that has not been made with images of the ninjas inserted at the end to create something that can be called "movie". The dead are still one of the worst films I have ever seen on the movie. Walking out half way, I felt I was a dumber for that I had spent 45 minutes of this trash.
