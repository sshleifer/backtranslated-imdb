I'm 'guts' to let you know please please avoid 'Dahmer', a biological film based on the real life story of a very powerful murderer. 'Dahmer' loses more attention to the focus of his focus. Jeffrey Dahmer, who was killed more than 15 male males and ate some of their body parts, perhaps was the worst murderer of our generation. However, the real sick people are a great film broadcaster who should examine their heads before deciding to have this very bad project. This is not an easy film to dig, although Jeffrey could easily wipe some of the 'brainsadillas' or even some 'real life'. Potato skin '. * Failure
