I'd like to give them 2/10. I was very disappointed. The story story was not well developed, for example, events were very short and concise, so values ​​were not quite clear. I thought Brenda Song did a good job, but Shin Koyamada seemed to have a hard time taking up her role. I could see the need to put in western things in the show, however, there is a certain place, where Chinese elements were also needed! Girl for example. His physical appearance resembled a robot, rather than something out of Chinese culture. The last and worst error was correct and distorted to the show. Some may show that this is 'Kid's show' and therefore, there is no need for such standards. However, there are other Disney exhibitions, such as Mu Lan, which have been much better in the development of stories and presentation. In conclusion, I feel that Disney movies should be better research and better. Show good is not enough and just a series of military art depends.
