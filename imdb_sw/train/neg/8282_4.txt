At the moment you should know about this film, Jessica Simpson "bomb" which was very good to go to the video (limited, anemic operating performances). Basically, Mrs Simpson Katie goes from a small town in Oklahoma to visit her boyfriend, to surprise her, just to find her in bed with another woman. He is fierce, but he has one friend (Rachel Leigh Cook, who I would have seen many times in the film), who allows him to stay. Katie has been employed by two co-workers (Penelope Ann Miller and Andy Dick who always likes) who are using Katie just to find the lost President (Larry Miller). This is a movie b, its strictly not thought to be deep. Jessica Simpson is not a good actor in any way, but she's pretty good and never never angry. The film seems to be not a disgusting thing, but its water loss. In comeo, Penny Marshall is funny (trick in-joke about Milwaukee making me chuckle), and there is a funny scene involving Norwegian priests (don't read too much in this). So, it's not terrible, but it's easy to fly. Your safe bet is watching it on television if it does. Again, it's not good, but it's not a big disaster.
