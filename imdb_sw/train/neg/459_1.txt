I was looking for a good comedy, easy to spend time but choosing this film proved to be a big mistake. <br /> <br /> I can't write one good thing about it. First, the script is stupid and not quite funny, relying on the joke of fatigue, published by the farting string to laugh. In my book, that's not exciting, that's interesting. <br /> <br /> Outcomes of the low budget '(if I can even call them side effects) and awesome movies. In many places it feels around the film indie beaten without money. Working / working ... I feel for the executives. Did Pamela Anderson and Denise Richards expect some money to accept this? (watching their latest films, it would seem so.) Despite the dress, Pamela shows her age and in general, they don't even have such a sexy, not funny. <br /> <br /> This movie is not even in the rough-it-funny category. It is very bad, as if everyone involved was sick. Avoid it.
