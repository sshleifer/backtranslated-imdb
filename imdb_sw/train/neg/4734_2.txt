Do you like beautiful girls? I am too. What is wrong to say about girls / beautiful women? No, why would I give this film just two stars out of 5, though it was the "talent" of Chiaki Kuriyama and Aya Ueto? If I wanted to look at good people, I'd like to look at MTV or something that is why. This is a movie, a movie called action however. So by definition does not really need the right plot? I don't accept 100%, but let's say yes. Why do you need? Locate 20 minutes from part 1 (I might spread a bit, but I felt like over 20 minutes ...)? That would be "No". But again you do not know, people who watched one place do not know what they ate this morning for breakfast, so hey let's remind them ... he maybe reminds them twice? Just to be sure they will not forget ... at least until the credit card, of course !!!! Do not forget about the story, about the development of character, about real feelings, about "acting" (and no, I do not think women in a walking skirt and / or fighting is responsible for acting!) ... what? Yes scenes action. Practical events are not bad and that's why I've given movie stars 2 instead of 1! I was giving this film a chance, but it was a waste of time ... You have the best things to do / look, believe ...
