A great hit on the release of an Australian audience, it can still be funny today, but its high-top political destruction and mildness, unsortle humor can make it a little cringer. It goes too long; some of the content can be saved in this order, Barry McKenzie Holds His Own, which needs new things. In fact, Aussie's behavior is amazing, but it also becomes angry as the film continues. Some say Crocker songs are the best bits, and indeed they are natural, but "hilarious"? Barry McKenzie's adventures will come down as an attraction to Australian movies, but we have to do everything in our power to ensure that overseas listeners do not see many Australians like Barry McKenzies (or, therefore, Mick Dundees!). Testing: 5/10
