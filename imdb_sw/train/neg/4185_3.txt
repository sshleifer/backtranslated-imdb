I am giving this film 3 much worse than the most popular worship movies 2. Is it not meaningful to you? Well, it is not recommended. That is another movie of a vampire and stupid plot, no, I would like to restore it again, a wonderful plot, where the cowboys position (complete with cowboy hats) are fighting the race of the seat seats. than this? The only thing in this movie is Natassia Malthe, and its wonderful beauty of Norway. God, I would like Michael Ironside and Brother De Deuce would stop receiving dumb tasks in dumb movies! I mean, at least SeaQuest was good! I know Mr. Ironside from many movies, has worked at 164 movies at this time! It is true that he was rarely in a great role, but still!
