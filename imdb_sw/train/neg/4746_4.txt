There are several bad things with this film - the behavior of Brenda Song to be one of them. I do not believe that the girl is a good actress-I honestly not. I believe he is given poor lines. She should be, "a worthless girl, a girl", and when playing on TV she plays, she can't even get a dry noise from me here. The way, I must know what to expect I will watch this film. <br /> <br /> The movie was not terrible ... original. Wendy's response to Shen was quite natural. I mean, how would you feel if someone, claiming to be a reincarnated successor, chased you around to command you to wear a medallion and insist that you needed to fight "great evil" and save the world? Which brings me to another point. I know this film is completely false, but it still has a foundation in Chinese culture. It seems like "all fighters" in the line of the family of Wendy were women. I am right if I miss, but I'm sure that monks would be the same. Certainly, they might have worked some way, but they didn't give you any information. In doing so, they have only contributed to many efforts of female empowerment efforts by Hollywood and journalists. Do not forget that, however - we continue. Wendy behavior becomes more than a failure as the film will continue. Yes, he is a young man, and is close to family-I mean, who wants to fight against evil at birth? The problem is, when "evil" begins to manifest itself, Wendy does not appear as if he is being reduced if he should be. He is very worried - even for someone like him. He continues to take care of his training. I will use this dialogue for example, Shen: "If you win this war, evil will take, and everything will go away." Wendy: "Who, talk about pressure. Okay ... let's talk about something else." Yes, let's Wendy. Let's go play while you have to teach properly. Of course Shen allows him, but his behavior has excuses. Better to have shared with him, than he is not, and he can not teach quite, and get both killed. <br /> <br /> Oh, say what. Shen also told Wendy that it was his fate to die for him in the war, as he had with his grandmother (I think that part). <br /> <br /> This makes Wendy more actions forgiven. <br /> <br /> As the author of the script could have, Wendy is separated from this "great war" is the same day. Do you know what Wendy does? What? Even you need to guess? Yes, he goes on to war, when he tries to leave for serving, monks (who Shen was bound into the body of his coach and teachers because "he felt fighting with an old man") tells him that Shen has gone to war alone, so he is going to save her. <br /> <br /> We first see the fighting of half of honor, which is actually a entertainment. Until finally, great evil comes from the body of the Wendy-and-homecoming fighters, and builds a typical example of himself out of broken pieces of the body of his ancient fighters. <br /> <br /> However, Wendy gets all the "panic". Then Shen goes and defends him from this - forgiving me for forgetting his long-term Chinese-name and can commit suicide. Wendy takes Shen as he makes his long-term natural inclusion to worry about air. He / she heads the title of the article out. Now ... it was so bad that Wendy became very strong, very fast. No, I can not be allowed because it was his "destiny" and had a "strong inside" of it. No, worse ... since when could he raise people? So Shen was raised from the dead. Then, Wendy is fighting a boy. <br /> <br /> Loses the way easily. The worst part, it's time to jump together, and catch him at the same time, and he's banned forever. Then experts praise Wendy on his sacrifice. <br /> <br /> Two things, # 1: Is not the mandate and the director of the script does not know the war they need a bit more "finesse"? # 2: What sacrifice? The fact that he did not go home? Because the girl did not break the sweat, or even burst. I mean, coming now, this movie was a PG TV, I wanted to see someone hurt. <br /> <br /> Ah-hem ... moving forward. I know it looks like maybe I would give one movie, according to my opinion. Part of the investigation, you must know, however, is breaking something down. You don't have to try to look at the bad, but if it's there, you forget. This film has a lot of bad, but something happens when you expect never to be a very big thing in the first place. So, I think it was okay. It is not that I did not say it would not have stopped anyone from looking at it.
