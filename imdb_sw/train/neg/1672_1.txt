This is the only movie I saw that helped me write comments on any web site, and that's an important information from someone who likes "Monolith Monsters." This film is perfect for anyone who wants an unpopular film. It is without sex and abuse, for example. I believe that this film is safe for children of all ages. This film is perfect for anyone who does not want to be attracted, opposed, or excused in any way. Adults can easily get on their sleep in front of the TV while children are watching this film. Do not be surprised, however, if you are going to get children to turn the TV and start the game board. As an adult who enjoys being hosted, who enjoys everything from usual to wonder in originality, drama, comedy, and action, all of the adult things that show real life in the world and / or stimulate ideas, this movie has nothing to offer.
