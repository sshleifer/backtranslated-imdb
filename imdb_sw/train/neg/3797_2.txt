The years have passed since Alex Rain (played by Olivier Gruner in the first movie) stumbled on a horrible program that involved taking human space and machines however since then the war between cyborgs and humanity has emerged and we are lost, now it's a superwoman of the kind that is The behavior of Olivier Gruner's character (It is also the only half of his limited ability to act) which I think is a small relationship with the first, however when the creator's wife was created concealing in 1980 when the bounty hunters from the future hunt this mix sci-fi clunker. Nemesis was struck by worship, that I can see why people liked even though I wasn't a fan of the film. Nemesis struggled to come up with different ideas, developing a good look and giving tons of actions, it was almost working. Nemesis 2 do not even have such a desire, it is a cheap deficit from The Terminator and a muscled woman who is limited on the ability to make she makes Olivier Gruner to look like aspian master and the mechanism of action lack of explosive scope which was the main selling part of original. I will admit that I was not a fan of nature but it is better to follow better than this. Contents also showed good cast as Tim Thomerson, Cary Hiroyuki Tagawa, Thom Mathews, Brion James, Thomas Jane and Jackie Earle Haley this no reputation and this time is just an inappropriate movie and self-vibe. In fact after seeing this, it's fun adding a half star to the original. <br /> <br /> * out of 4 (bad)
