Don't make a mistake, I thought that this film would be stupid, I did it honestly, I gave it a low level of meeting. The only reason I saw it was because there was a group of girls going (different stories at different times). When I started to look I saw something, this film was awesome. Now there are two shocking forms, there is Freddy vs Jason awesome, where you and your friends sit back and laugh and shock about how terrible, and then there is a movie like this. Cat in Hat did not succeed in creating even a short-term mind. When I was looking at the first one I was not motivated by the meaning, but I felt like I was being hit by the horror of the movie. Mike Myers is usually brilliant, I love many jobs, but something in this film does not know. One of the things that the director / producers / journalists changed was that they refused to use any color of the original book (red, black, white) on any character but Cat. Unfortunately or not, they also refused to capture any original (and nichuki use this word, but it fits the original) zaniness. The book was like Ice Cream Sunday, colorful and delicious, and the movie was almost like a bland and hard to swallow as a sauce. Avoid this as a prostitute of leprosy.
