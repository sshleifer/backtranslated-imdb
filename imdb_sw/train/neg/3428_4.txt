In fact, if not for the water of Ethel and Sammy Davis, 7 years old, Jr. (here they were lost without Jr.), Rufus Jones to the President would be one of the worst manifestations of African and American discrimination. appear from the beginning of the talkie era and would not be worth seeing because of it. Mr. Waters is better here to sing "Can I Blue?" and "under the Harlem Our Moon" when Mr. Davis will show us how his childhood experience in the showbiz led him to his state as an adult. He is a very good player here because for a short time I thought he was a young person with decades of experience. So if you are interested in ignoring a negative quotation here, Rufus Jones to the President should give good pleasure. P.S. This suggests the fourth time today I have seen and heard the song, "I will be happy When You Are Dead!" It should be a very popular song about this time.
