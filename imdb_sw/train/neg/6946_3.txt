I watched this film a long time ago (aprox 10 years or more) and then I liked it. I remembered another day and I decided to look at it again. The second time around was not happy. Acting is 'so, so', the plot will have no meaning, meaningless and predictable. Acting ... I am sure it is not clear for these actors to play these characters. The conspiracy ... there is no way to hell those women could be left with the first under 2. Ding, Ding ... we have a string!). Black women claim that in a special way that the only way that black women can 'hit the system' or get a large amount of money was to steal and not use their minds or other resources. It plays a lot on mercy b / c all dies at the end (bar Jada) but not sad (you think 'They were very foolish, they deserve to die). You don't care about the characters unless you're a poor person. I can't believe these standards of more than 5 films.
