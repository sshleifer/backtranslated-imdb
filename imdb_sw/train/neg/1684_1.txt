*** Traders *** Vendors *** Vendors *** Vendors <br /> <br /> There are bad movies and then there are movies that are so bad that they are easily interested in their ignorance. That's the case of Columbia Pictures '' The Grudge. 'The movies of the movie began when America was well-favored by the Japanese' film 'Ju-on' film and revived to restore the movie in English. This started the most common tsunami around the world even washed off the coast in Orlando on October 21, 2004. The column, and I use the word freely, involves a house in Tokyo by the skinny Momma spirit who appears as a cross between Margaret Cho and Alanis Morrisette , with her sudden chubby head, rambunctious but evil second grader. What? Is there anything more than a 8-year-old Japanese boy? Certainly there is! The Chocula Numbers comes to mind. With this modern bunch we should add a wonderful black cat that I liked easily Chim Chim. (Remember Speed ​​Racer?) If you've thought, they were killed in this penalty area and now they want to kill everyone who enters the house. You see, as described by the Japanese detective, when a person dies in fury their soul wants to take revenge on everyone who goes to the lines of property as described by the ward commissioner or something like that, and forgot. <br /> <br /> The story begins without enough by Bill proposed Pullman named passengers from the balcony. I think it's Bill Pullman got this job because his children begged him to go to Tokyo Disneyland. Then we hold the charming Nurse Yoko, 'oh no go inside' screams to the audience, but woe does not listen to good warnings and is prophesied as a magic lamp. About 30 minutes on the movie when we see his American hero Sarah Michelle Gellar as Karen. Sarah Michelle Gellar can be a powerful actor but I couldn't help think of Buffy Vampire Slayer, much of that was bothering. It's okay to have Jennifer Anniston's star in the movie about the adventures of six friends in New York. Try as much as possible, you can't stop thinking about another project that has made him popular. But I digress, Karen, a nurse is employed as a replacement for the original issuer who lost in us spooks. He moves around, meets the ghosts, the woman dies, and the other things happen. Looking at the vixen-colored look for clues The half I expected to get the spirit and pull his mask to reveal it is actually an old Gower who owns a gymnastics garden left! 'I would have found it and if it wasn't for the kids who are busy with your dog!' Takashi Shimizu, who is found to be Ed Wood of Asia, made two bad choices related to sound. First, he chooses to use sound only when someone is killed. This is better to decide to eliminate any doubts because the audience has a two-minute warning to prepare for other tragic deaths. Second, he gave the ghost noisy ghosts of noise that looked like a gopher. After the movie, I heard several people leaving the theater and crying. Sarah Michelle Gellar has become the only savior. And of course we learn that the fire that killed the house was extinguished for some time in the next chapter. However, based on the humor of the uncomfortable audience, they did not want to sequel but to apologize. 'Anger' can easily be changed in comedy, perhaps then it will be appreciated for its value camp. Considering that, this will drop as the biggest thriller of movies since 'Godzilla vs. Megalon. ' I would like to wait until the movie will come to your local hall hall where you can receive public shame that is most suited.
