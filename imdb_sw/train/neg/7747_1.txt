The fact that the cover is drawing, such as old B movies should give you a warning about the quality of this film. This is, however not a movie B. It's D-movie! It is not known, and animals - WOW - is the worst data-animation created during the last two decades. You can never see the sabratooth SCAAARY shown on the front cover. You hear people shouting, bleeding and dying and often see teeth or star tiger. It's so amateur! Maybee worth seeing, because it is very bad. Give your friend and say: "This is the most beautiful movie I saw, and waiting for their answers" He, he. <br /> <br /> The movie is weak to give Spoiler Alert! THIS IS THE FARMER.
