How many frosts should we see walking in a spoon in the back and lift it through a reflective glass? It has been done in two movies in recent memory & fourteen times on this non-film film, a non-performing film. There was only a few moments of fun .... when the ghosts invaded the private space of the two characters. Speaking of the characters, acting was as flat as Coke's Diet in 64 ozone. The side characters could be dragged from various cartoons of Scooby Doo. There was a old sheriff friendly. There was a kooky weirdo living in backwoods and draw Alabama. Non-progressive printing. The most horrible chapter was for the murdered child. But instead of investigating the murder of a child, which would be interesting, they just let us know that he was dead & his parents had a hard time connecting his death to the community with each other. When they came to the cabin, the events did not always happen .... and pictures of flashing of the dead daughter were interrupted here and there. Oh ... and eerie voices were over again. You know what I sayâ€¦ the doors of revelation that open themselves, cricket in the forest, yada yada yada. Ooooohhhh. Didn't see it before. Again, you will see the door of a wonderful delivery on the film again and again. INFORMATION FOR AWARENESS: A horrible event is scary only if it does not return every 5 minutes on the film. Think of these things before calling out "it's a shape!"
