When I saw that IMD users beat this film under 250 film, I thought it was very hard but I did not know a bit that the minimum was right. <br /> <br /> I am a great fan of the Wayans brothers. I loved their awesome movie 2 and even enjoyed Chick White. The little man, however, had a very hot sandwich and the joke was gone. It is clear that the joke will be close to Marlon Wayans, who plays the upcoming midget that was recently released from prison. She and her lover, Tracy Morgan, stole a gangster that means gangster. Things go awry and midget should put a diamond and a couple of views who played with Shawn Wayans and Kerry Washington. To get the diamond back, the midget pretends to be a abandoned child left on a concerned doorstep couple. Of course, it is taken by the game begins on a diamond quest. <br /> <br /> The movie has other actors and artists from Saturday Night Live like Molly Shannon and Rob Schneider also from In In Color Color. All these talents, however, cannot help the poor script and jokes that were not funny. <br /> <br /> Special effects of making Marlon Wayans look like a midget was the same. I mean, it was not believed 100% but it was ok ... nothing good. I just want that the Wayans brothers have struggled to develop a script with good jokes rather than trying to hit their poor script and cameos from their famous comedic executives and executives. <br /> <br /> Waiting for cable or television. In fact it is not worth any amount of money.
