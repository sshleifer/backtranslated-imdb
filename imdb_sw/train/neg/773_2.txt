No, it is not a GWB rule, Decider / Strutter / Smirker - but a series of mini "King Cove." The life expectancy must have found this dog is because the series was burned in two periods at the same time, many of them declare between 11 p. Friday night and 1 am Saturday morning. Why do I look at anything, I can only ask for an abrupt attack of eyeschism every week. Most of the cast are unaware of who might remain unknown. Only two names are Shirley Jones and Rachel Ward, who turn out only on the exclusive show (Jones does not do through the entire series - a lucky woman). Ward, by the way, is aging well since the day "Thorn Birds" day. One of the main sticks for the plot - who killed the father of the heroine who is guilty of the murder of the father but is free after six years in the slammer - has been set up for a long time and is completed so quickly that you don't care who puts it. There is a great deal of sex "steamy", several killings, and all kinds of odds - almost no one that is interesting or reliable. Most of the cast is not very attractive and certainly not talented. Writing and direction are similar to cast. When you close to the end, the postcard is hoot (very small). !
