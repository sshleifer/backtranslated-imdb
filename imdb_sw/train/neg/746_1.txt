Store $ 8.97 you will use Walmart to buy this DVD and go to see the real film by Steven Spielberg. <br /> <br /> I am a filmmaker, and being a fierce fan of HG Wells, I had to buy this hope of sitting down and looking at three hours of good entertainment. Instead, it took four days to finish watching this because I couldn't stand looking over 10 minutes at a time. It's bad. <br /> <br /> There is a report that Timothy Hines had a $ 20 million budget for this production. Where did heck do it? Have you used more to buy a new home? His retirement funds? Or what? I would like to start with what is really about this film. It takes the truth to the book AND there are a few good displays in it. I can respect the actors who tried to make this beautiful film. But the beautiful performances were shaded by the horrors ... and I mean special effects of horror. Every freshman film student could do better with CGI. For me, many of them seemed like a "card-off" card card that was used instead of a modern CGI program which a $ 20 million project should use. There is no excuse for amateur production that was used for this film. My partner and I sat down and returned our version of the Ferry area using a software that paid less than $ 1500.00 and within the day it had five minutes of the area that seemed better and more than made by Hines. I found a film with a budget of less than $ 2 million looks better. Best. <br /> <br /> In my opinion the specific effects used in King Kong were previously more modern and better than Hines' special effects in this film. In fact, I am even more grateful for the killing of tomatoes because of this film. There is no excuse and modern film technology to be seen as B-Movie 50 except that it was intended, which should not have this special project. The problem I had with the transfer of the DVD was that the film is jerky, the other demonstration of the amateur film making. In general, I see that I produced a $ 45,000 project in 2003 which has better movies and special effects than this film. I strongly encourage anyone who enjoys good film choices or who is a WOTW fan to leave this film on the shelf and watch Mother's 50-foot attacks instead. It would be easy in the eyes.
