Surprised enough does the movie have a certain quality of redemption in it when it goes towards its end. On the other hand this film is being really bad with the defect, with a small budget, with the evil inscription written script and everything that goes with it / <br /> It's silly. That for all the money going around in Christian circles can not be seen to earn enough money to make a good movie with. I am not religious, so I did not have a real decision to make a realistic but filming tool as a good tool for reaching new audiences to churches and making people more interested and interested in reading the Bible. In this regard these movies are seen as a lost opportunity. The low budget affects the movie and destroys it. It makes the movie laughable looking and its effects and only offers the overall movie campy B-movie as a feeling. <br /> <br /> But what hurt this film more is writing it. The only things that happen in this film are insulting to the mind and then I don't complain or talk about the religious aspects of the whole story. The way the movie progresses is simply improbable and the people in this film do things as likely to be being insulting to its audience <br /> <br. /> Also hated how the movie was like a regular opera soap. It seems to me that they just have a hard time turning this into a full movie length and they have added some characters and only great developments to fill things up. I just couldn't care less really sometimes. It needs to be said that the movie gets harder and faster towards its end, when its story gets more focused on its nature. Still still predict every but prevented this film and become a full wreck of looking and until this kind of movie worries, there's far one worser looking out there, although I don't think this film will be against any new spirit. <br /> <br /> 4/10
