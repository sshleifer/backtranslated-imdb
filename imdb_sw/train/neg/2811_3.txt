Will they ever make movies without ignorance and sex? This came at 3:00 on Sunday and I couldn't believe what they showed. Thank God my son was out or I'd like to be free if he had seen soft / medium porn! Do people who do movies don't care who they say or destroy? Can children look after the church and do they show? !!! Acting was good and I was excited but GEE! There was violence and bad but it should be expected on the western film. Randy Travis was very good in his role. If the authors, directors and producers will simply stop wearing many unwanted items for sex. What should make them stop going to that direction? Where can I complain?
