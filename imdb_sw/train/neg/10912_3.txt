I did not like this movie significantly. It was not very real and in some cases it was just stupid. Rob Schneider is definitely one talented person and when his acting was very good in this, it seemed just like a real waste for entering a star. I mean there were some parts that were similar to humorous in a good way of the way but that about it. The only thing that took my mind during the whole top joke is that there were very good women who are now living and not one of the films alone because of it but in this case it was just where even a little of redemption can be found. All in all were a low score under the usual film! The Last Question: <br /> <br /> Homes: I am not happy to beat a lot of money on this. <Br /> <br /> Purchase of DVD: Ummm, I would think .... no! Renting: If you have a prehistoric feeling of humor then why not.
