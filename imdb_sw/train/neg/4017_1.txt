Yes, this film gets a lot of attention and is considered common in adult film types. Still, I didn't like this. About a woman who commits suicide in an area that is suitable for a horrible movie, has been given the opportunity to return to the world in short to live a passionate life she did not do before her ordinary life. Sexual incidents of Crappy follow. Why they are crappy, for one they try hard to be the skills that they take away from the actual sex act. I mean we are looking at sex for sex we are not. Little girls also do things in an artistic way, but they are still very beautiful and beautiful looking. Of course girls in it are very good. Here we have an uncomfortable leading actor and that does not give things. If you get leadership in your adult film it is not available there is no artistic vision that will make me enjoy the film. Sexual incidents come from a strange chance ... I mean there is a snake in one of those people. So I this movie just fails if it is not worth me even a bit, but instead it takes me away.
