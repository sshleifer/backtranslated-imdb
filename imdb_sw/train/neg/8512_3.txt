I love silent movies, but this was too little. I would also like to say that it was worth the hour I stood I could. I don't think any kind of movie even approaches the book. And don't try on children, they may feel. And the woman who played Pollyanna, how old was she? 38? I know the rules of employment were different back then ... But OVER THE PEOPLE.
