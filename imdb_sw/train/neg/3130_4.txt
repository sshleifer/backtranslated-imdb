I came to this film I need to close. I thought the cluster had great potential and was suitable for an interesting movie. Don't make a mistake here, I didn't expect Kane of Citizen, I was taking this to the B movie which is. That said, it was still not there. The historical perspective of the story takes place up and the end leaves me a little cold. Acting in the movie was very timber. All in all I give 4 for a great idea, but the movie can be scored too high for a little attention to the movie to make a base. What? It's worth seeing? I didn't need two hours back, but I don't know that I would like to recommend it to others.
