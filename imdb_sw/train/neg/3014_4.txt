Recently I watched the Art Design at the Seattle International Film Festival. I was fascinated by the film as a photographer because I know both and the fan of the work of Burtynsky. When I believe the movie has a good job to get the message, I couldn't help but feel that it was done as a full picture after the photo and the future book of Burtynsky. For one reason this one is a great use of images still comprising zoom and pans to them. Although this is a good effect when it is used economically, I felt like 75% of the movie was still only from Burtynsky's book (which I already have been given). That's probably salt, but that's what I felt. If you own a book or you know its work can be better to fly this.
