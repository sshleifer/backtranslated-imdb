If you liked the "Fiction Pulp" and if the camera had to love this film. I loved the quirky story (although I feel that "Pulp Fiction" was the most tested movie since "English patient") and found that the characters are not real but interesting. It is not "On the River Water" or "Citizen Kane" and is burdened by European advocacy. But the worst part is the hand held camera. It is very sad and sad I found myself waiting hard for the movie to end. I don't know why new directors think this method of photography is very good. If you suffer from motion sickness, stay off, hand held camera will have a noise in 10 minutes.
