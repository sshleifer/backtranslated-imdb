I have come to realize from watching the fear of the Euro, especially the films made by the cult of Jess Franco, that you can't expect a conspiracy. However, Franco has already dealt with this film; and despite the surreal atmosphere, and the features of the film as one of the best director - Succubus is unfortunate is a very bad film. I need to admit that I have seen the cut version of America, which runs around 76 minutes; but unless it is only a logical disconnect, I am sure that the European version is no longer boring. The plan has something to do with the woman around it; practicing S&M and talking trash, and it's all awesome. No fault and sex are lighter, and most of the run is taken by an interesting conversation and despite the fact that this is a short film; I had trouble making it to the end. I tell you that places look good with Franco has done a good job of using his surreal status; but the best features are gone. Jess Franco is obviously a talented director who has made the classic garbage films - but this looks like it was the one he made money, and in general I recommend flying and seeing some of the most interesting director's work.
