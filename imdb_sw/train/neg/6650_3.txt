I think this would be a very good film if Cajuns is shown to more light. My family is from south-east Louisiana and I am in south-east Texas (20 kilometers from Lake Charles). I've never heard of people I grew up to talk like these people did. Cajuns were shown as a return. Most Cajuns I know are educated, arrogant people and have no untrue voice when they talk about how these people did. All in all was a good movie, with beautiful surroundings and music. I understand that the authors were from Lake Charles, and they know the area, but with the love of all things Cajun, please help the students learn the language, so that they can live among the people you tell and understand how they are doing before they go to try to try as they are. In my opinion, when the characters make you believe it is the person, it's the most enjoyable movie!
