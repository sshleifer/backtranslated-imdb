This movie was exciting sometimes, sometimes hell was very funny. The basic message received from the film, is that women are responsible for all human problems. Every time a woman is shown on the film, she is lazy, a pastor or pretending to be a poor man because there is no apparent reason. I don't think the message involved is good for men or men. <br /> <br /> But, it's a comedy, and a piece of art, so it's a special view. Even if I disagree, they still have the right. <br /> <br /> An exciting photo, but some of the comments that others have made are just stupid. Best film ever my foot.
