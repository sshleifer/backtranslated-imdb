this was a worthless film that I had ever seen if there was no plot and the characters didn't seem to care. 90% of the film had no conspiracy, I laughed my number began to finish. A little where the elderly when catching Robert Duvall was hard. on the operational level to make the black film does not include a lot of rainfall and uncertain feet on the main character. this is an attempt to fail to create a color of surprise and instead separates the viewer from extraordinary events. to see if this was the basis of 'manuscript' by John Grisham I did not count this as one of his book for the film change as it shows no suspended information and cooperating as a film as 'company' or 'wet rain'.
