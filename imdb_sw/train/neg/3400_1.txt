This film is an independent trash. Check out this film if you just want to hear Gaelic spoken or enjoy a good voice sound. Look for any other reason and you will be disappointed. It should be charming but not - it is just irritating. The characters are difficult to keep and acting is poor. The story in the film is also not available with the treasure. I expected a happy family film, but this also did not appeal to my fourteen-year-old daughter. It's very rare that I can't see the film through its end but this has found the best of us all. Even though the film has been installed at the moment it has a look and feel of the East cheap European film released during the winter war. There is not even enough for a good scenario of Scotland and movies to redeem it. True shame because if this film is shy to Scotland.
