Well the preview has been shown funny and I usually don't go to the movies when you open the night exactly with my kids because ...... well you don't know. Here is a movie that will not deny to children or adults as a joke is too much for children and falls flat completely for entertainment purposes for adults. In fact I was embarrassed to be my age of 9 and 6 and have to describe my 6-year-old S S * T describes. Basically what happens here is a total loss of the Dr.. Seuss's. It adds a bad and lazy neighbor who wants to marry the mother of the children for her money. If that was so small, then maybe that would be good but it is nearing that the main plot around the whole movie and the "cat" has a greater role to present to the neighbor who is. Take my advice and read this book and make it a movie.
