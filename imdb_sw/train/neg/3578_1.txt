There is nothing to redeem this film. They took a bad story, told it, wrote it, made it wrong. It has a bad conversation that was badly done on a beautiful and trashy story. <br /> <br /> As bad as it fails as art, it fails even more as a business. Who can be the target market for this. What age group? What is the interest group? One should make a film about how and why they did this film. That I would pay to see. I have seen thousands of bad movies, and this is an array with "Sailor Who Fell from Grace" and "Manos" ... my choice of three really bad movies I've ever seen. Everyone involved with this should be forced to negotiate with VanDamme for all eternity. It is worth it. Check out this movie and practice a professional - how would you take this and make it worse? I can't think of one way.
