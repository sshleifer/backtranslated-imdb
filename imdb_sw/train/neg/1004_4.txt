The Jewish journalist Justin Timberlake (like Joshua "Josh" Pollack) is worried when the defendant complains "Thank you" to witness the LL officer J (as Rafe Deed) leaving the testimony. In the opening of this film, you are given details. You will see the lover of Mr. Cool J's detective, Dylan McDermott (as Frances "Laz" Lazerov) decides to kill the murder of Damien Dante (as Isaiah Charles). Traders in the city of "Edison" have been very badly beat their suspects, stealing their money, and hitting their dope. If he misses his partner (here, called "Pussy") or winning Pulitzer, the corruption of the city can not sit well with Mr. Timberlake. Timberlake decides to investigate corruption, which reaches an unexpected scope and risky levels. Author / director David J. Burke keeps the film on the water, but it is difficult. LL Cool J blows Timberlake in the "pop star and star of the film" sweepstakes (aka "the author's development" up to "actress"). Mr. McDermott is pleased with his role. Freezing credit causes the case supports support for Morgan Freeman (like Musa Ashford) and Kevin Spacey (like Levon Wallace). F.R.A.T. it means first to respond to the assault and prudence, but it is more important to know that "Edison (Power)" star Justin Timberlake and LL Cool J, not Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey (who seems to disappear).
