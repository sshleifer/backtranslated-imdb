That is another film that has made it more and more interesting about AIDS and tragedy. It starts a lot of incompetence and prediction and continues in the movie. I continued to wait for him to take, but unfortunately he never. Acting is fair, but the script requires a bed of work. And if you are looking for dirt, do not waste your time with these low-performance executives. Due to poor quality of sound and lack of information, I have missed 1/8 of the film. If you have never seen more than five homosexual movies, or soon you agree to being gay, you can get this interesting film, otherwise it's your movie's low budget. It's one of the worst gay films I've ever seen.
