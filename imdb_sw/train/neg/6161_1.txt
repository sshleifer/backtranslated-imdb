This is unlikely the worst fence, fighting of the sword, the movie made. That's not just because the so-called fence is poor but because the plot, the characters are so weak that they have to throw it into the sex nude area and, later, they think the group will play around the fence area in the fence club. , I think to maintain the interest of the audience. It is the loss of Abraham Murray's talents. It is well used by many revolutionary movies like Zorro, Scaramouche, anything with Basil Rathbone as a village. As the fencer myself I realize almost impossible to catch a fence as a film on the film, but if it ever happens it must have a fresher, the best drawn characters and plot in more detail.
