Yes I agree I wept during this film. It was so very sad, that I could not help myself but cry. The TBN Network (Third Party Advertising) has done again. First to have a Million Dollar Man (the former professional wrestler) on their software, and now this. <br /> <br /> Omega Course follows the course of religious sex movies. It was quite exciting, but at the same time it was troubling to find it with the accuracy of the Bible. The movie follows the so-called "biblical principle" rather than the actual biblical writings. This film is very poor; from his writing to the direction of his awesome terrible act. It's very difficult that people put efforts in this movie. It seemed more like a late-night movie someone looking at the USA or directly at a home video instead of a released film. I strongly recommend you not see this film, even if your life depends on it.
