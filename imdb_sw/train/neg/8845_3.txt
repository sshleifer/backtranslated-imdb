I watched this without knowing anything about it, except a brief description I had read here. After watching I was saying that the director shows the promise but seems to be good, then I looked at other things he did to see if this was his first or second movie, but no, he made the House on the Haunted Hill and Fear Dot Com. He had missed the mark on these two movies and was similar to this. <br /> <br /> The story was too good too, someone could fall in love with a girl because she is good but has a child mind? I paid 3 because there were pictures that I enjoyed around the end but generally this film is very good.
