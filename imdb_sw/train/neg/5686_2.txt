Hello. this is my first opinion on any movie I saw. I looked at the problem of doing this to tell everyone that this is true, the most enjoyable movie I saw. I feel like the film was poreli, which will give you insight into budget constraints. I felt like I was looking at the worst remake of the film. Which I can agree, I saw is also a very graphic, but, I did as the film saw. The situation where it takes a hammer to the head of the prisoner who is standing standing is the most disturbing scene I have seen. The area was almost forever, well in fact, maybe it was about 5 minutes but still. I want to realize that I love other awesome movies and I give credit if it's good. The director was a boll, and his group was using this film to think before doing another similar to this. remember one last !! FOR ALL PEOPLE who enjoy watching the beings, voting, as well as women and children as beautiful and five-month cycle of a person with a happy and happy player then you will enjoy this film, if not, and love, go with a great budget , as seen by example. I don't believe people are making movies like this. however sorry for anyone who likes to be a boll and take heart, this is my only opinion on the movie.
