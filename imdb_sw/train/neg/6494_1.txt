I love Anthony Hopkins as an actor so I was very keen to see how he could act as an author / director. I can't be more desperate with this argument. The movie was disjointed by the movies was more done to the point I wanted to pull the plug out of the wall. Participants were very good but it was a waste of talent. Not all actors excluded as writers or directors and clearly Mr. Hopkins fall into this category. In all the movies I saw in my 50 years, this is the worst movie ever. Please love all Mr. Hopkins and hold on to work, which you are best, to stop writing and lead to those talented in those areas. If I could give this film a mark under one I certainly would.
