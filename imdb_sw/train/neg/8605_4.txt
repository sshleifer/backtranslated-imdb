This is at the end of the end at the end of the 80 years that is sharing with some bad slugs and the taste of human blood. If you can pass the ignorance of the whole thing you can actually get a little comfort from this out. Acting is bad and the plot is just there to hold the movie together between the gory slug attacks, but the movie is not the perfect waste of time. Special effects are quite real, and the year has been done well. It reminds me of the remake of Blob, perhaps because of the simplicity of all. For all, you can doubt more for an hour and a half of your time, but I can't recommend seeing this movie unless you get a strong stomach and it's in this kind of thing.
