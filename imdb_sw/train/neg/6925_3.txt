I feel a little more generous with this film than others of its ilk. The manifestation of madness in this century always happens with them to be quite strange to be different. Their antics are very scary to be completely fictionalized. Everyone is Napoleon or other historical figures; or they have thoughts and chickens. They are about to do or fight him. It is like the author says, I can do what they do, without understanding of damage or even mental illness is. Look at the wonderful picture of man in the "One Player on the Cuckoo Nest" where diseases are trusted and true. I was working in a state psychiatric hospital. I didn't see any of these guys. These are very good and count them to make them mature.
