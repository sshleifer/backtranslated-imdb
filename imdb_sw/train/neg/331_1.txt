I can say without a shadow of doubt that Going Overboard is one of the worst films I've ever seen, and yes, I've seen Cujo. Adam Sandler is a disgusting thing like Schecky Moskowitz, a wannabe player working on a travel fabric. That's a plot. <br /> <br /> That's it! There is nothing else in the film that is suitable, it is everywhere like a shadow of a shade, and not in the naked wacky, but more exciting, 'throwing all the shoes through t.v'. even Great Noriega makes appearance, because no one can understand (certainly not in humor). Add to the Miss Australia mix, who has the worst Fastest Australian ever I had, and you have something that I will not call the worst movie, because crossing the overboard is not even suitable for the background of the film. I strongly recommend this film, as it will strengthen the position of each bad movie you saw. I assure you the first thing you will say after seeing the bad movie will be "at least not as bad as Crossing More".
