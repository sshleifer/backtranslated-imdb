Okay I don't know where to start. Obviously this was made for TV movies, so my expectations were low. I was amazed at the general direction of the second hour, but everything before or after it seemed to be a color and type of movie. And talking about bad chemistry among the spies of love song. I love more in detail, but this film is not recommended. Bridge: D + (IMDB rating 3/10)
