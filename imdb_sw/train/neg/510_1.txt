That's certainly one of the worst films made and released by a great Hollywood studio. The plan is only stupid. Conversations are written on the clich√©s; you can complete multiple sentences in the script because of this. Acting is ridiculously bad, especially of Rod Cameron. "Choreography" is silent and odd. One can only sympathize the inspector who saw the dance of Yvonne 23 years old as sex; it's just a very bad choreography. Part of the ballet at the beginning of the film is very interesting. If you are on bad movies and enjoy laughing on some Hollywood strokes, this is for you. I bought a colorized version on VHS, making the movie even worse. The shapes of Yvonne's heavy, when the color, has it looks like a clown at all. And he is the best part of this film. What is the way to start work.
