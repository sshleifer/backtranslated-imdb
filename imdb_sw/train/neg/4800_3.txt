If you did a flick type in the last 80 years, you usually had a 50/50 position that would have been put under water or in prison (sadly, we did not get a ferry under the flick). Written by the murder of the boss Mafia Moretti (Anthony Franciosa), Derek Keillor (Dennis Cole) ends with a death row, similar to Frankie's brother Frank Sarcinello Jr. But this is less than Derek's problems as a bright government agency (with a stoolie group) Col. Burgess (John Saxon, who also leads) uses prison as a testing area for a new supervisor. This is the only Saxon flick led during his work. For a boy who has worked with tons of directors, it seems to himself that he used any tips from those who were cheap-o Italian. Indeed, it is a low budget, but that can't forgive a beat, a shot, or a minute of minutes in the first 15 minutes. On his loan, Saxon did so little and works in a nude hilarious area (our leadership sleeps during the prison just by fantasize about a woman scientist). Cole, who is seen as Jan-Michael Vincent's most powerful, is suitable as a Stoic provider and Franciosa - the worst rugby games - provides all of it as a master of a group of people. The latter takes place in the favorite area of ​​Marty McKee, Bronson Canyon. Retromedia released this on DVD as the death of ZOMBIE.
