Forgive me for speaking clearly, but some films are good and some films are bad. Of course, there are great things within these two groups. Films such as Godfather, Saving Private Private, and Star Wars make fun in a good community. On the other side of the scope there are those films that are not worth mentioning. From time to time, a person gives a really awesome film. Films that should be displayed as an exhibition of how the film can be bad. Movies that are worse. The film is Maiden Voyage. In short, the Maiden Journey is a story about a luxury passenger ship separated by a group of evil criminals who want to compensate for the owner of a ship with similar damage. Of course, there is an all-American warrior on the board, full with a cut jaw and chest wrapped, who saves the day. <br /> <br /> This is a production that slows down low. Everything about it is bad. Acting, leadership and so-called plot is breath-taking. In short, it is insulting to the mind of any unfortunate observer. Even the American viewer will be offended by its deficiency. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's bad. I will resist the temptation to compile a list of things that distorted me about this film. However, his dumber-than-silence conclusion should be used as an example of what I say. Think in your mind that you are a bad rocker and standing in the open sea on a quiet sea. You are with a hero who has an interesting bomb. Said the hero blows a bomb to you and climbs up. What would you do? I don't know about you, but I would throw a bomb away as I could get into the sea. Not this person. He looks like our hero swims and then tries to blow the bomb for a bad result (for him). It said. The damage will be appropriate to mention the Darwin Awards website and it can also be a precise conclusion to the production team.
