My friends and I left after 15 minutes, and we are not the first. Later, we tried to get our money. Movie games management did not allow this, but agreed to see another film. The only time you serve us is to see Dickie Roberts: The Child of the Child. As you can say, this was not an unforgettable night. Perhaps one of my worst night films. Close the second must be when I saw the double head of Interior and Heist Disruption. In conclusion, for humanity, please see the Commandment.
