This is a typical stinker and cast with a great name, especially older ones who had passed well and slept this time. This is a repressing film when you think about it. Stay on earth, and you will suffer from disease and eventually your destruction. Gwen Verndon has shown that he can still play. Still the film has not stressed more about that. Maureen Stapleton, looking at haggard, has been shown the action from the "Queen of Star Dust Ballroom," much more in the world since 10 years earlier. I just hope that this film does not encourage the elderly to commit suicide to the extent of Jim Jones. How can anyone have enough voice to love this and say it makes you think? <br /> <br /> Why Don Ameche won Oscar for this false reason? When the elders did the last thing for the last time, why was the boy encouraged to leave the boat? Why Steve Guttenberg flew the ship too? After all, she has seen her love-woman. This would be a good film if the older people only got their fountain of youth in the world and stayed there. Unfortunately, except Wilford Brimley, in this text, Vernon, Gilford, Stapleton, Ameche, Tandy, Cronyn and master knows who else has gone. Authors should take the screenplay and placed this group too.
