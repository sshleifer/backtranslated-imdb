Hm. While the fun film of the hollow pits, show the worst, natural (special) special effects (all that has led me to see this film three times over the past six years), beaten regions of the worst I've ever seen. I am not sure who the fighters are, I know it is all that the killer uses a suitable guillotine, as shown in the location of the apartment killing. For all, it is not true as a film, because only 30 minutes is fun, some are confused and confusing channels that do not develop stories for the conclusion of logic (which I cannot remember yet).
