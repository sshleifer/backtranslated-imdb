While several performances were beautiful - Victoria Rowell, Adrienne Barbeau, and two Italian friends came to the mind-story that was blind and obstructed, the emphasis on the girl's nature was done better, and those relatives were shown as bad, not like real people. I found myself worried when many who were supposed to be funny. I can't understand why the paper here SF said this was a good movie, and wonderful WHO put a new idea here on IMD. I am very disappointed in this film, and mad I went to the theater to see it, based on the infinite relationship to the Park Park, which is a funnier of far away, beyond the invention, and of the movie touch than this. I must specify specifically the emotional peak in the church, which was wood and numbers that I was near to the left, and some viewers really were. That was followed by a peak of shade in the cemetery, which I saw come 10 minutes before it happened. I do not like to spend my money on the money.
