While the position behind the House where Evil Evil can be surprising, implementation is very serious. I don't even know where to start if I have a lot of trouble with this movie. I think I'm just counting them: <br /> <br /> 1. Do ?? When you see that Edward Albert, Doug McClure, and Susan George (and his teeth) are your movie stars, you know you have trouble? It's not something about me, but these are not names for Writing. Susan George may have a few movies I enjoy, but I never thought of him as the greatest actor I ever saw. And in this film, its acting is shy. For the other two, the less said to be better. The Spirit? A ghost or spirit or whatever you want to call a little bit of ghosts in the home of haunted.at Disney World. And, they are on horrible. And why should they be so obvious? The lie is not the habit of the House where Evil Evil. <br /> <br /> 3. ?? What? One movie can predict what? The result of this film is very obvious after meeting with three characters. If you couldn't see where this film was headed after 15 minutes, you need to see more movies. <br /> <br /> 4. The High Priest? What are the chances that the house you are buying happens only by road from the Japanese monks? Not to mention that one of them knows the history of your home and comes up, finds on the door, and asks if you need help to remove evil spirits. Amazing is a word that comes to mind. <br /> <br /> 5. Everything else ?? It's very hard for me to think of any better writing about. I think I will give you the point to the opening area and the architecture of the house. Is the true sign of the winner? noting the architecture as a model of any film does not say much about a real movie. <br /> <br /> I will quit. You should get an idea from what I have explained. And, I've never mentioned a little girl or an invasion of Craba or many problems. To warn them, this is a terrible thing.
