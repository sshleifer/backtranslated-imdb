The movie is about two stories: one is the political killing of a girl-calling, another high political party. The crossing point is the nature of the public relations played by Al Paccino, since he is a witness of crime and an evening striker. If the script is awesome without a conversation of respect and freedom to guide any act of drama, the performance of Al is memorable: how many colleagues can be as influential as a strong and fearful person (like "godfather") as here as a little servant (see also "Donnie Brasco") <br /> <br /> Indeed, the lion's big lion has been exhausted. Through these years there is a very moving, because it makes the audience think about getting old as well. But slowly it is just making it because it can return its power to the Church area. <Br /> <br /> Maybe it's a good thing that the movie is so bad because it sets the star on Al!
