Thanks to this film, now I can answer the question, "What film is the worst you ever seen?" I can't even think of the second second, and I've seen some really bad movies. <br /> <br /> Nothing works in this film. Make one feature of any movie with this movie failing. In fact, I found the best on YouTube. Here is a common discussion: <br /> <br /> "Steve?" "Steve?" "Steve, are you?" "Steve, I'm not a child" "Steve, this is not funny!" "Steve, is he there?" "Steve?" "Steve?" "Steve?" "/ ARGgh !!! Ahhhhhh !!! Nooooooo!"
