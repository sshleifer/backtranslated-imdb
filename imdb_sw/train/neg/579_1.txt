Listen to the director's comments confirmed what I forgot when watching the film: this is a film made by someone who wants to play during the film. The program is a kind of thing that young people cheat when they go through "I was able to write a win / book / winning / win award". There is an interesting idea that has been featured there (probably because of its guide to someone else's movie), but it is completely closed under a script, caused by unwanted and unwanted. The lines are bad, and the showings did not include, although again, I would like to blame the director. He doesn't seem to have consulted with all actors on what is needed, rather than beat the script in their hands, and showed them their camera and tell them to continue with it. Who knows, by teaching a little, these administrators could have restrained themselves (say what you like about musicians in movies, Jon Bon Jovi was the best in your Row Boat and more than accepted in the Holly Man). <br /> <br /> If it stops, the throw does not have any chemistry. A good chance to use casual sex with parallel vampirism is passed time, in order to infect the character of Bon Jovi and the blood of the vampire from his sick farmer, given the transfusion. He should blame him. Mind, they should appear to be interested in each other in the film as well. The only true period of sexual tension, between the two women's instructions, is for the directors themselves to the accreditation accident. Previously he was willing to use this sequence of silence as a reason for other trivial things - so, I think the product has become worse. But not so much. In fact, if the films are going, this is a planned, unsuspecting and forgetful plot. Even if trashy movies are not enough or not enough to be entertaining. It may be a little delightful to lose blood, but the director has left for more comedy, for all the wrong reasons.
