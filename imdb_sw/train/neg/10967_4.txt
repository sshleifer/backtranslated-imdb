I don't believe, I would like horror movies. I love false science movies. I love independent movies. And, I would like the movies below the B budget. Sometimes, even if it is a bad act, plodding texts, wooden lines, impossible conditions, and so on. However, I did not like Christmas on Mars. It doesn't work on too many levels. For all the reasons mentioned earlier, and much more. That includes abnormal, transparent use of female reproductive pictures. With many male genitalia tips, through Freudian. I believe that this is special because of ignorance. Contrary to another attempt to do something completely different. I mean any movie that takes years to film, can not keep the density rate and the target required by modern viewers. I was hoping that the whole movie was just a dream or a reminder with the main character. However, sadly, it meant that what happened, as we have seen things revealed on the screen. Only about gentleness I can explain, is that the image at the end was ridiculous. If this was used earlier, instead of the last, it would allow the film to remove where 2001 ended ... I don't know what was so important to this film that even took place. Was it a plot? Indeed, it cannot be. Was the characters? I urge you; I mean, I could live without knowing about Ed 15. Was it a conversation? Amazingly, no. Music? Perhaps, but more-likely more than ego without learning of the principals that need to be beaten. The best efforts are dead on the floor of the cutting room.
