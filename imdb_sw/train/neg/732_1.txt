The little boy sees his mother being killed by his father depend on himself. 20 years later he gets a group of friends together to make a mistake on himself so he can not turn like his father. All stake holders are placed: a good couple; "funny" guy; strong hat (but sensitive); smart girl (she is wearing glasses - that's what we know); nerd and two non-human blondes. It all involves a wooden wooden image that comes to life (don't ask) and kill people. I knew that I was in trouble when, after a large opening area, we fly up to 20 years later - all the horrible movies are doing it! The talk is good, the act is bad (except for Betsy Palmer - why Betsy?) And murder is stupid and / or thinking. My favorite part is when two people should have sex with an image that finds the man in bed to show that he is fully dressed! Unhealthy evil, stupid not exceeding the film of horror. Avoid at all costs.
