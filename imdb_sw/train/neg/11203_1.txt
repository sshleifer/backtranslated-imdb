The screenwriter tried to create again "Exorcist." But keeping a love story of blah-blah that makes you sick rather than putting you in touch. You have nothing in this film. It was likely to be something special but it beat it by showing a group of people drawing on things that nobody cares. I liked it very much, I wanted to leave the theater when I saw but dumb movie tickets were so expensive that I could withstand the dreary suffering which seemed to go on forever. They use the local computer graphics here that instead of discarding me (as it intended, I hate CGI) only I destroyed the movie even more. Some people say this film was bad in cinema movies because of "stimulating ideas" and "slow-action action-because it is an intelligent film" was what it was. Is it minded or stimulated when the story is essentially about a good boy H like Ledger as a priest who has a love interest and does not leave his religion? It looks like an unconscious concept. Oh and there is a joke about the "singer" (the movie was originally called "the singer"). The idea of ​​taste but the movie took something "to eat" very seriously, making the movie concerned with the illusion on how dark and mind was. Yes, I know there are sinful animals in the Middle Ages but this film makes it only fun. Nothing in the film was right and I forgot why I had trouble seeing this film. If you want to scary the films that have been deep, see the Rosemary Child, Planner, His Owner, Brutal Organization, Criminal Justice, Pini, Rin, Omen, or any movie Romero "Dead Trilogy". Negative talks are not the same as the intellectual people, the popular fans of the movie think that though (such a kind of people who think of a non-emotional movie like Hulk is the center of the movie). If you want to panic in mind, look at the Order. This film makes the church look like a driving trip.
