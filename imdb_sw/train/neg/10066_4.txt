I recently looked again and there is another version which is short in 1999. I feel they are one movie but I would like to know different. <br /> <br /> One is Japanese and no short pikachu is all I can come up with. Otherwise why voting for the same film twice? <br /> <br /> Prof Ivy was rather boring. He seemed like he was almost asleep, no words for the few lines he had. This was fun enough but it didn't have much to it at all. Collector (who is after Lugia, who has no plan to destroy the world) and ordinary characters who try to stop him because trying to capture Lugia causes great damage. <br /> <br /> The following pokemon movies are better, deoxys (poke 7) is good, without. 8 around here.
