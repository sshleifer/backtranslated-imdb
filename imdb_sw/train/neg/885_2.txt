Anthology is always a risky business and I think this effort should be praised. There are many talents involved here. Most talented characters, directors and writers. Unfortunately, I did not enjoy much of this film based on the three issues I have. <br /> <br /> First, groups vary in voice and quality. And unfortunately some of them compete with others. Second, several groups feel to feel my progress. As the seeds of good news that have not reached fruition. I'm not talking about endless happiness here (or even the last time) but instead, they do not have a basic development or even a set of upstream sets. Last but not, I don't feel New-York and its inhabitants were shown well. What is left is short-term films that can be useful to others but will leave you an average viewer not verified.
