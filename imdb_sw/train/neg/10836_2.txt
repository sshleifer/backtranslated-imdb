"Magnolia" is an amazing, amazing guide that adds up to a little bit. As "Eyes Wide Shut," "Magnolia" is an infinite series of events without taking into account any consideration. The camera goes through the road and road, infected with sad characters. Where is the reason for dealing with these people? Common themes seem to be people who say so much, who cannot care about others (except for John C. Reilly's characters and Philip Seymour Hoffman), and they are wrecked wounds that can fall to pieces or die. I remembered how I loved "Shina" because of the inevitable monster of the dad played by Armin Mueller-Stahl. There are many uncomfortable characters, not here, why would we like to spend time with them? After saying this, nothing has to do with "Magnolia." Paul Thomas Anderson's ideas were hit on his trousers and stopped. There are two ideas exactly that bomb. They all occur at the end of this 188-minute film. One has a cameras moving from one character to another while each one is singing one of the Aimee Mann's songs of coffeehouse. Sweet, but not good because we can't see all their terms together. Another thing that I mentioned cannot be disclosed unless you say it is totally unexpected and worried. Magnolia has a very good acting. Especially Tom Cruise who offers performance I did not know that she was with him. And John C. Reilly plays perhaps the most beautiful and good offender in recent memory. But all adds anything. When an unforeseen mystery happened, the girl behind me in the theater could not hold again and say, "This is stupid!" My feelings are many of the film people will agree.
