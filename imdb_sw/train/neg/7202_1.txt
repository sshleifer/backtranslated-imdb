Since I loved the cartoons' visitor in the 80's, I went to see this film. I lost my money. The plan was too narrow. Also, the film could not make me long-lasting. I was glad that it was over. <br /> <br /> If you want to see the Gadget's Auditor, see the cartoon instead. It was better than the movie.
