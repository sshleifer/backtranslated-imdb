The movie has a good start to show Shannon Lee interesting and powerful and set up two very easy characters through the first half. But later something happens with Shannon all of a sudden turns to this straightforward frame, the second bad girl and the movie is lost in its own environment. The second half does not exist any type of charisma and is full of clich√©s, acting evil, horrible plot and the worst proportion of interesting. Neither the terrible managers chosen by the group of cheese. "The Game of Death 2" was bad and clownified Bruce, but her daughter on her make a bigger attack than herself than twice who played Bruce Lee at that time. I believe that he can do better than this and I hope he participates in the best production in the future. If you are a real fan of the basic step and doesn't care about the quality it goes and see this film. I was looking at myself but I was very disappointed.
