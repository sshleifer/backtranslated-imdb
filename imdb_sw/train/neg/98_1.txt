I received this film as a gift, I knew from the DVD cover, this film will be bad. After watching it for more than a year I finally looked at it. is an exciting movie? I was almost not finished watching this bad movie, but it would be right for me to write a review without viewing the full movie. I hope when I say "this movie comes" I have seen the fact that a bad player player has even sponsored to make this pathetic film, but it could not cost more than 20,000 dollars to produce this film. each you need is a cheap camcorder or a mobile phone camera. 15 people who do not know the skills, the script written by two men of the drunk. <br /> <br /> In the fist of this bad argument of the author (Tara Woodley) thinks to be a drunken man on his way to report on the designated city. He can never be destroyed. They went to have to leave the house, but luckily so almost completed furniture and bottles of alcohol at the door of the door occurs there. just because they think they are drunk but not all looks. <br /> <br /> Then a drunk man starts drinking tales of Tara spirit / zombies. The stupidity of his stupidity The story of the lame should be very bad in history. <br /> <br /> His story / <br /> Sgt. Ben Draper then one of his soldiers will die to complete fatigue (I think this is what happens) after allowing the poor soldier personal Wilson to stay on him then jump to the grave and then the soldiers fall, Ben Draper </ br>> pouring into the deep grave. But Sgt. Ben Draper is in great surprise. His wife / girl fiend knows about this and she and her boyfriend kills Sgt. Ben Draper to take revenge on Wilson's private (near the grave of the soldier he decided to kill) The soldier wakes up from his grave through a zombie and killing them for revenge on his behalf. /> The deviation was paralyzed. Even if you love B HORROR movies, don't watch this film
