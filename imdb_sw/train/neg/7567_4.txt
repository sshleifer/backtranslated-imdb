Stories: Youth-goon is a girl whose family has a history of mental illness. He lives in a mental institution after he began to believe that he is really cyborg. In an institution that meets Park Il-sun, a young man who builds a bond with him. If you are reading this maybe you already know how best Chan-wook Park is. But 'I am a Cyborg ...' is a great departure from the usual location, and sad. I am a great fan of any film or story that tries to do something different. God knows, we all face enough skin on our local movies. The main thing about the movie I need to say is that it can't say anything about mental illness, or creating characters you care about. <br /> <br /> This story must be one of the most amazing things I have seen in years ... but weird is not enough. No heart for the movie ... just surgery and frustration. The combination appears to be the main theme of the movie. All actors are trying to understand their own problems, but it's Chan-wook Park himself who shows that it is the most mixed combination.
