Such worse than the rating is given. This is a typical movie of SciFi today: bad to act sharp, a script that is not well written, and a good direction. From the opening area where DeMille hides its sets to the end, this movie is awesome. In the early stages this film has Moses (which was Charlton Heston in DeMille film), Pharoah (Yul Brynner) and Nefretiri (Anne Baxtor) looking at the boy opening the box on the sand. The characters who were representing the three icons mentioned earlier were bad and were identical to people who were "demanding" to be. The fact that this is a desert away from civilization is foolish when a person is injured and all shout for ambulance. The scribe does not know the fact that there are no patients in the middle of the desert. I was shocked that Lord Baccarin decided to make a low-quality film.
