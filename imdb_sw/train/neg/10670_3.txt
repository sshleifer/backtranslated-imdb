The color characters that you do not have never will care. Moving conversations in places. No twists (they think they have one, but if you didn't know after nearly 40mins you're not very bright). Most of the participants known in the roles and performances which, fortunately for everyone involved, will be forgotten once the final document will continue. I don't know the "slow" movies, but they go to the place - somewhere. This is not. The plan is not the one that made this film directly to DVD, that's just an ordinary excuse to try and combine some fake complexity. <br /> To write as 37 (!) ten (10) ratings must be from people involved in production.
