[*** SPOILERS RISKS OF ********************************************* ***] The name of this movie is launching, so I was expecting that I sat down to look at the label tag on TCM. It's a great desire. It is sent to the best and the production standards are the first level, but the characters have no depth, the plot is thin, and the whole thing goes too long. For films associated with alcoholism, family division, honesty, gambling, and sexual abuse, movies are fantastic flat, prosaic, not dead, and played. One example is Frank Hirsch's loyalty: his request for a burden to his wife "going up and resting a bit" followed by his predictable prayer, leads - even more of the forecast - his evening with his delegate ("hey Nancy, I've got blues." Let us go to the car "), all according to good form. We do not feel these are real people, but paperwork worksheets in the marionette play. Also, the source of open conflict between Frank and Dave Hirsch did not reflect or explain. Dave deficiency and Gwen on-again / off again unknown because of its ability to not delete or stop the pot. His subsequent marriage despair for the character of Shirley Maclaine / Ginny is, since the time of presentation to this viewer, however, will surely be punished for failure, and it was clear - for the collection of this type of opera soap - that can only be resolved and a man killed. At that time a jealous partner started around with guns and began to bet with myself about who - Dave or Ginny - he would be killed. Anything was pony and 'P'. After saying this, the performance of Maclaine and Dean Martin is calling here. But in general I find the interest of the movie to be the sole period of the history of Hollywood history.
