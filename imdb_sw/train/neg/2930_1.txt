I like British humor, I believe it is one of the best in the world. I like almost every UK bed (right ... maybe not Python Good, some of the jokes were excellent, but some of them were not aware.), But this Lords League is just a good thing to make you sick. This version was good in some way; helped me to lose weight because looking at this piece of rubbish made me not feel hungry again. This is just a disgusting, sickly and unusual view of TV show and I wonder who is laughing in these things. I watched it for 10 minutes and turned it off. It was very disgusting, looking at men dressed in a woman with yellow teeth and running on the car ... I mean ... what was so interesting about it? It makes me want to puke. No humor, misleading pictures and toilets, toilets laugh ... I don't know ... if you like these things ... you go ... see ... but be honest, people look and enjoy this must have some emotional problems. Tools.
