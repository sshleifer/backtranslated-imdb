Why did any legitimate actor read the script participated in this piece? My God is so ashamed to even look at it. I can't imagine the shame these people should feel to be part of it. Also, there is a controversy about whether the Phoenix River had comeo in the movie. He had no permission but his list of responsibilities here (IMDB) gives him a debt. BTW ... Rain is her sister for those who have been asking before. This film is proof that no matter what great "names" you have. Plant ears do not make silk handbags. I love Lorraine Bracco but this was just sad, sad, sad ... Maybe someone else one day can tell me why this kind of film. It does not have a beautiful, entertaining, or even comedic asset for comparison with the worst everything else.
