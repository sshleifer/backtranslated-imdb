Perhaps the most popular films I saw. <br /> <br /> There is no plot line. Feature elements of behavior. Full of humorous humor. The entire film was chaos and direction. There was no end to the story. The airport was held in shopping mall. <br /> <br /> Similar stories were searched frequently until you want to say "please, just continue with it!" Even the song and dance did not mean and very badly. The only thing about this movie is that there were hot boots around ... but many audio movies have anyways these days. <br /> <br /> Btw I'm not from a native of Indian <br /> <br /> 2/10
