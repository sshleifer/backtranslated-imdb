I despise the horror movies, that's not a secret. There is no plot, evil act and blood goggles is the core of these movies, and this "movie" is not different. I can't believe the cable stations run this waste. (This trash was released directly to the video, if I remember.) If you mention any other film it would be a great insult to another movie, I say: all Phantasm movies, all movies of Jason, Freddy movies, Chucky movies, and more Michael Myers movies can be inserted in one word: IN! Phantasm III: 0.5 / 10
