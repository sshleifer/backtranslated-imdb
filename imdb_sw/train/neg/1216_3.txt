The types of films wait actually takes dive in this one. The main problem is IMPLAUSABILITY. I realize that you need to create difficult situations that can cause emphasis and feeling what happens next, but this film was predictable, and cannot be trusted. I find that the more I watch this film, the more I continue to say things to actors to lead them away from danger. To make the wrong decisions only on the plain to be ignorant. If they took time to make it more realistic, I would be a little happier. Having said so, you can be better off from this.
