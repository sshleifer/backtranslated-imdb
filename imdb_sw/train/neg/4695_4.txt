I watched this film a few times and never never thought it was funny, but it's still fun to look and good for a few laughcheche. <br /> <br /> Its over women who work in the company and their boss are jerk and they end up giving him a taste of his own medicine, and trying to get the honor they deserve. <br /> <br /> Acting is very good. Dabney Coleman is one of the 80 stars that play with a good man, not too bad, not the same. Dolly Partin is fascinating and enjoyable to watch comedies and he less less truly shines here. Jane Fonda is so-so and has little to me. Lily Tomlin is the best thing about this film, she has funniest lines and made me laugh in a few voices, you gotta love her. <br /> <br /> I would like to recommend this to anyone who likes 80 comedy. I like the movie but has things about it that I don't like. It starts well and has a good flow and then everything begins to come together once and make me a little bit about the characters. They all have little fantasies on what they would like to do the boss and though 'cute' I just thought it's slowing down the flow of the movie. If the film goes once again takes with the funniest items it happens and then again decreases, just close it in a quick way that is very good to be true. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 stars, but try it if you haven't seen it. I think according to your feelings can be more or less.
