Johnny and Jeremy are kind of vampires. Reduce fangs, of course. They are dark, painful beings that are no better than spreading their own troubles. Through their trickery (the sharp language and the fuel bag, respectively), they deceive the unhealthy souls, which continue to be persecuted and exploited. That's more or less based on this black comedy, if I understand it. It is not a mixture of black humor that I can easily register, because because I am frustrated by thinking of the impression of the audience, the main character. I enjoyed it, however, the sound and sound of a quick fire (and very honest). I was very surprised by the planned power, especially David Thelis; The only character of Jeremy was also bi-dimensional. Photography and music, both wonderful and surprising, works very well together. <br /> <br /> What takes me out of "Naked" (and the main reason I never suggest to anyone) is the way it seems to constantly present misogyny as a legitimate way of vent to someone. In other words, in the world that takes the worst, what is the difference if a person can hurt pain for girls, right? To recommend (like others have on this site) that Johnny is not a very good person because he is not bad for girls like Jeremy, it looks quite strange to me. They are all horrible, unworthy people. And they are willing to hurt women every time they get a chance. One can say that Johnny finally gets what he deserves, as his bad karma suddenly throws straight into the ass. But yet, his sad and Jeremy behavior is stolen at some point as a laugh. I could also be wrong, but I think most people who like this film also find the feature of the film that has been darkened.
