The sun should put on this film, forever. <br /> <br /> Continues forever (which is not usually the worst thing - the list of English patients, the Schindler List) but it is stimulating. The maturity of the actors is amazing and so it is a line of stories that never ended up which is not seen anywhere. <br /> <br /> In short, losing talent and film.
