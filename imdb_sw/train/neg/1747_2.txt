It takes for a good note just to quickly disappear and allow the prospects. Mac (Akshay Kumar) and Sam's (John Abraham) characters are not well built before Mac's boss decides to beat him with the third air hostess. The end of this game is about Mac, Sam and Uncle Mambo (Paresh Rawal) to deal with situations that seem to be forced. About the top, Paresh Rawal is a very talented actor, I thought he was lost in the role of a great chef. Akshay Kumar can endure, John Abraham is very bad keeps knocking furniture and Rajpal Yadav is the only one to save grace in the movie. <br /> <br /> The second half of the movie is funny sometimes, but in all DUD (songs are boring) and great to allow if you expect some good entertainment and comedy.
