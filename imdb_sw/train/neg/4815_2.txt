As many comments I saw this film under the name of Witching which is the name of reissue. It seems Necromancy which is original is better but I doubt. <br /> <br /> Many scenes of witching are still with many wind scenes and these are still bad. In many ways I think additional creativity of the least added value of entertainment! But do not show - just 3 events and dirt and are people standing around different types. No rougy diabolique involved! <br /> <br /> This movie is very common and difficult to know what to criticize first. The discussion is wrong and the same out of the Troma. At least Troma is a language in cheek though. This is a complete human boredom. Acting is different from Pamela Franklin (Flora a child with innocent children would believe!) The worst and loud voice. Welles looks just waiting for his pay check. Another female direction has an interesting face so I don't know why Pamela thought she could trust her in the film! And the doctor is very bad too. He also appears to quarrel as Gene Wilder. <br /> <br /> Made with transparency and modified events without reason and editing is choppy. This is because magic is copy and keep working and not a trick for it. Just lighting is the same. The voice is also awesome and it is difficult to hear with a new alarming voice that is never appropriate. Mother 'spirit' is also the same trash but the actress is the worst trick in acting that at least provides unintentional laughing. <br /> <br /> Truly this film (magic at least) is only for the ignorant. It can't have many ordinary fans if it is very unknown and I've really got to mind-losing too much! A little bit was when the credit was over - enough said it was better for this bad reason for the movie like PLAGUE!
