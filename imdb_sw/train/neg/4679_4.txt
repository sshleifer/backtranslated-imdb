What a terrible film. Do not do it wrong, Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington are good actors, but apart from a few interesting pieces, the film is taken more by travelers who are crying, crying, volunteering, and usually lost when everything is wrong. <Br /> <br /> Take it easy to make sure the audience still understands what is going on (where Denzel Washington explains to a radio manufacturer how he should be like Scotty in Star Trek is not just something more than joke) and you have an unpleasant excitement acting. Let's just hope that the real nuclear US Navy is not delivered to the script! <br /> <br />
