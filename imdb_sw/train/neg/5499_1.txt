I saw this bomb while playing on the movie. I laughed all the time. Why? Because his foolishness seemed to make me go mad. I look back on it and realize there was no one funny thing in the whole movie. There is nothing to desire. It is incredible that Lizzie sets up a piece of Nurplex and becomes a great man, a culture ... yet his small kitty dress is quite complete, with the fact that he is now hundreds of times larger than he was when he first put it. Or the type of movie in which one can be surprised by the defibulator and just fall does not know, and return to the concept without ANY medical attention. And do not let me start on the fate of the ignorance of "villain" that they decided they needed to create "conflict." Uh this. For someone who complains about Disney who only searches for children - these films are apparently not controlling these words. What? We really need Daryl Hannah accusing Jeff Bridges of having kinky video clips? You do if you are Disney and you miss the thought of making a film appeal to the above crowd without writing more script! I strongly believe that Disney pays the board of ratings so the film can eliminate the killings and still find the level of family friendship. <br /> <br /> It is losing a DVD form.
