My wife and I used this movie because some people were identical to the "Office Office". Blockbuster and IMDB was even as "selection was also recommended" if you liked "Office Office". Now, I've seen the Office of Work 15 times or 20 times. Probably one of my 10 favorite movies. Witch, humorous, and featuring the characters reminds me of people who have worked with over the years. The "Haiku Tunnel" resembles "Space Space" for both of them are films. That's where the similarity is approaching. We stayed for the first 50 minutes of HT, giving them the benefit of doubt, hope, and, * ask * to be better. It was not. We couldn't make it again, and stop the tape. Thank you GOD was a free rental. I'd like to be p *** ed if we would like to pay. We should be paid for staying that way. Now, since we have not seen the end, perhaps it comes with miracles and separation itself. I testify. Haiku's Tunnel is too bad to believe it has ever been generated. The movie is SO unfunny is painful. Just mail friggin ready already !!! Columns are ainine. Jokes are bad. We got until the "printer does not work" and had to stop. We could not take it again. This film is EMBARRASMENT for Josh Kornbluth. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Office Office ...... do not waste your time with this turd. 0/10
