Scott Menville is not Casey Kasem. That's the first thing, most importantly, and most exciting about this experimental review of Scooby-Doo and the company. Shaggy's voice is contrary to what he saw in the original Scooby Exhibition. They have also changed the dress and the classic style of walking from nature. <br /> <br /> I don't know what they're on yet with the villain angle, but certainly not follow the formula used in any of the original Scooby shows. <br /> <br /> And the animation style is very amazing and misleading. I love it, but it's not a Scooby-Doo animation. But the amazing animation used for other WB exhibitions grew up on me; this can also. <br /> <br /> It is worth a glance at - once - if you can handle the lack of proper Shaggy Sound. That's right enough one jar to enjoy a good show. Besides, I'm trying not to be tough, a fan of nitpicking. Make or die, as the word goes. We will see how it appears after two events - so I will have a lot more views.
