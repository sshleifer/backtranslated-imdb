Christ. One long series of films, this at least has the ability to stop the song (the "Unprecedented" Tomorrow) but it develops a culture of despair and dislike. At this time, Annie and her friends are going to London and being infected in Joan Collins's plot to beat Buckingham Palace or some of them. The movie has a very wonderful view towards its characteristic names in a bad situation and how irritating: every time a little bugger hits "Leapin 'lizards!" I could feel my teeth grinding itself powder. It seems to be photographed, slushy and plodding, the movie has only one memorable line ("Unhand me, you stupid mind!") And the fact that it was not previously recommended.
