For the first time the movie seemed to be doing a good job, it had a description of the characters set ... the plot seemed to go in the right direction ... however, as the movie continued it seemed that the director focused on the wrong things. .. most just changed from the film. The characters' characters have been changed for the bad situation in the film. Also, there seems to be a lot of meaning - in other words - they had things in the film that didn't seem to be the same as the film itself. And the head ... no where in the film has the right title according to the film ... I think the head is working for verification .... Actors did well with what they had ... if they had a good director and author, maybe this it would have worked better. But it didn't. So now there is a new awesome movie unfolding this Friday .... My opinion! .... don't waste your time or money.
