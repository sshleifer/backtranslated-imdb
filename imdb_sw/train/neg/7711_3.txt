The heart of this film was a good place, no matter where the brain was. <br /> "Attack" is essentially a spoof of "Birds!" (two years before the fact - go well.) of what happens when vegetables, or in these cases, attack. Through all kinds of films (stop motion, paper-mache tomatoes on skateboards, restore movies, people watch non-screen tomatoes, people throw basketball basketball players on screen actors ), tomatoes are always attacking everyone in understanding their leaves. Then, it's about Mason Dixon (Miller) and a group of spies that I don't want to have any government side to save the day. Of course there is a journalist (Taylor) who gets into the worst times, playing and singing Military soldiers, Japanese scientists with dubbed voices, some people around around the parachute and Samurai ... and oo, San Diego's chicken before making it. These are not all good. In fact, you might well do this after watching these. Some discussion is inutterably bad ("Please go ketchup" - it's not something to say in front of tomatoes.) And until "Love of Discrimination" goes ... well, I can't blame the tomato for spreading on hearing. <br /> <br /> What's good about it? Yes, I liked the theme of the theme and the original credit, and there was four people on the phone once that was locked properly. ... that's about it. <br /> <br /> Three stars. Not a "killer" of love, but you try. Panda, Peace.
