he was my hero all the time until he was going along with {if you could call it a movie} I went to the show to look at it and come out and not just ask my money but he asked twice the money how bad my hero acting and the hole was ... .......... I do not believe that Steven Segal's work has dropped significantly because it has been reduced to 4-degree films and 5 secondary practitioners. I looked at this moving expectation to see the beet crap out of other people how he usually does. When it is reduced by using one judo in the middle of the shoulders to take the opponent and someone falls as a ton of brick something wrong. The program cannot be seen as a film, and even if you forgive the image, and you read this story as a novel, you would like to leave it wondering why you have even taken the book. <br /> <br /> Steven Segal goes through and looks like he's just doing it because he's under duty. It shows no effort and no enthusiasm, and in some cases she does not show at all. I like to repeat the views of other people, but the use of stock photos for cutting events and flight planes. The scenario of these events has been cut off, the shaky and the events themselves seemed to have been damaged over time. The zappruder film depicting President John F Kennedy is a strong and clean. My opinion of honesty is telling you not to waste your time looking at this movie, not on the level of the work of an adult or the wounds from. I read one review which said the movie had a budget of 12 million dollars (Segal paid 5 of it) and that the movie has not yet entered the budget. I must agree. It is not surprising that this is directly on the DVD film, since there is no owner of the exhibition of the film that plays this movie.
