This step reminded my stories from Crypt Keeper. It has an idea of ​​one kind of people to get what they deserve. I think that's always theirs in the story of the Crypt. It also goes to the worst acting. Acting very bad. I enjoyed the movie by knowing that many people did not like it and I did not expect much. Whenever I look at Kinghen's movie I don't expect too much because all his movies are bad compared to his novel skills. I have read Shining and Carrie and were many books. I like how Carrie played as it was a true story and a book around is a group of reports and theories. It was very good. But I noticed that all the novels were not like the film. The end was very different from film versions. I think from the two novels that all his novels have been greatly changed and end up always cheesy. I last Thinner is worse. So Cheesy. I want to read the book to find out the end of the end. I advise everyone who likes to read the Kinghen stephen novels to watch his movies before hand so that you can compare. And that way you will be very satisfied in the book. I am determined to do so with all his novels made in the movie. I am sure if they were on the movies were good books of the truth ... and the screen went very badly.
