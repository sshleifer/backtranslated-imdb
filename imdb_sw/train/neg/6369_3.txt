The only reason I have rented this is because of the article in Fangoria Magazine. The article made this film look attractive. Yes, it isn't. This was a very interesting, written and directed movie. All actors in this film are bad, except Faye Dunaway, who is always happy to watch. But most of the time focused on Gina Phillips and met him with ignorance and monuments and Duilio Marzio. Marzio has a great emphasis on Argentina, you can only understand two words that he says. Also supported is Nicholas Pauls, who plays ultra-bland love interest for Gina Phillips. Bottom line: This film is not afraid. There is only a good event and that's five to ten minutes of the movie. I would have given this one star, but I gave him three because I like Faye Dunaway very much. But even he was not the greatest in this.
