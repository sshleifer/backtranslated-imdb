It's one of the worst films I've ever seen. Acting bad, laughable 'action' (it is understandable that cars are moving slowly), the script of anger, to engage the last and improper position to make a sense of the movie. We know Justice Reinhold is a good actor, but he should be ashamed of this detritus. There is no great tension in the car and, when the characters arrive at the time of optimism, it laughs like banshees for some reason, even 'high five-ing' when they see the bridge decreases! Also, the sequence of events that leads these people to share the courage of the same car. It seems according to real events, though? If so, the truth is obviously a stranger than a lie! Unfortunately, that was shown in such a wrong way.
