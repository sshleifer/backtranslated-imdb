Almost all compound information in this movie does not matter and is not required. It does not symbolize the true human, dead and beautiful story. It is a Hollywood innovation, along with the trumpet songs that remind them of Denzel's Washington film, the shots of the exploding cameras and the focus, racism, unnecessary and interesting discounts and the most popular brand names on the list of clothing offers. It is done to serve the abundance of zombies which means in life comes from looking at the names of famous people. The only thing in the movie is the last features and the funky song that accompanies it. I feel like idiot to watch this, keep yourself.
