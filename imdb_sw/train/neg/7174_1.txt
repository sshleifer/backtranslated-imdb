I wanted to read other comments before I left my opinion and most of them dominate: this movie is scary! From the act of false animation for many errors. In fact I was hoping that the flaps would be extended and expanded the imagination (can not extend the flaps without the engine). The landing equipment cannot be reduced unless you have electricity. A little bit of fan was not enough to stretch any gear to landing. One thing I thought was special when they went, the back wheels were touched and then one nose broke, and so stopped the plane and all the back tires in the air. How does the captain request the left and right residues for tires that did not touch the ground? What? Forgotten destroyers? Word to the director: Know * all you can about the plane before trying the movie "bird". Sorry for the technical rant, but I give this movie 1/10.
