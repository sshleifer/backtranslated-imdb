Beyond the shadow of the mysterious Planet Planet is one of the worst movies ever ever made, but it focuses on the heart in my heart because the poverty of its special effects and astoundingly awesome sound track after the first 15 minutes (and being honest that it's all you need to see) combine to create something that is in the split. The opening area in the 'space' is close to an unknown state if the movie image gets, such as water-washing bottles reduce your eyes. Before you've had time to work out if it's you who has gone mad, the credit goes on with the struggle of life. <br /> <br /> And away from the double-headed plastics big snail that terrorises our heroes, also get added double extra to have both voice actors both sound and voice at the same time. Pure genius. The sad thing for fans of this kind of fare is that I've just ever seen one copy, so the possibility of ever seeing yourself is most likely. Maybe I just copy only in existence. <br /> <br />
