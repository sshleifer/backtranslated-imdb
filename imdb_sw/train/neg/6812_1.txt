From the beginning of this film you will realize that the film's name is not related to the movie itself from watching a naked woman chased by people in the most mysterious masks for all riding workers in bad clothes that I have ever seen and all of these in the heads make this kind of film should think twice about seeing and as the film slowly moves along with you soon realize that the vampire is not a vampire you have to ask yourself where the name from some part of the film made a bit of meaning to Pierre and is the father but if the film gets its silly end you have to think why you finish The film in this way and surly had a better ending if only there there are these headlines not film looking basically
