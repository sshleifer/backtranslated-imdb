My colleagues & I almost reduced our short-term television from a hostage that takes us when we look at this piece of the 1970s self-important pseudo-zen dreck. I would like to read about this campaign for many years and read my traditional television lists for YEAR for this Turkish search. A few years ago our local ABC partners were known to show cool flicks for the weekend weekend clicking (ie "Frogs", "Lepus Night", etc.). Then one day it happened: at 1:40 am on Saturday night (more than 5 years ago) there was! We had more than 15 people and flick did not despise! Check out! Andy Griffith as the worst and most powerful since Jaye Davidson in "Stargate"! Check out! William Shatner plays his headings that resemble human hair (or any other organic thing for that). <br /> <br /> Listen! The jaws that lost the 1970s of physiology which makes "Chicken Chicken to Soul" looks like BF Skinner Feel! The content of a decade was better than 70 years. It is one of those who read ... The plot revolves around the middle mid-sized group that decides to absorb to the boss's head (Griffith) by joining him on the cross of dessert that uses California & Mexico. They all wear leather skins, look more Christopher Street than anything else. On the way they leave Cantina, drink, combine smoke (see Robert "Mike Brady" Reed smoke together is a picture you will forget quickly), start a war, trying to do rape, and just act as a bunch of middle-class urban jack offs. Although I have a good copy of the TV I have this feature will be opened in the video so that the whole world can enjoy the smell of half of it.
