It took this to 50 cents in the gray market, it had a good excitement. <br /> <br /> I found it interesting for 15 minutes, then it's just repeating it with the smell. It is good to see Mick and their main team, I would not have much more to talk about the conversation to hear what it says and play. <br /> <br /> skits are political and very amazing naive and simple, kind of inappropriate text of Monty Python on acid. I lost more time looking 60 years ago of the drops of England instead of what was done in the silly skits. This movie is a good reminder that times are changing, and what is urgent is becoming clear. A good song, but now played by this DVD.
