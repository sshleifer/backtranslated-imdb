What remains of the planet Earth is set aside by a few poor and hungry victims of the tag. They should eat bugs and insects, or whatever, after the toxicity, or something, has eroded almost all human civilization. In these dark times, one of the few people in the world can still live in comfort, we will call the Big Boss. It seems that Boss Know All is the last person in the world who knows that these spores even exist. The spare parts are far from any living soul, and they are very safe with many array of death systems. <br /> <br /> Heads All Who Know Big want the secret spores to remain in its secret instruments. Therefore, it makes a plan to send a team of action to remove the spore tools from all the protective systems and the secret area. Send people to places where secret secrets make them hidden again. Sending people to turn off all protection systems makes it possible that spores can be opened easily into the air. What about allowing dog to lie? One of the most beautiful features of ENCRYPT is Vivian Wu's delightful and elegant. Since the members of an amazing optical team leave for a predictable time of the system, Vivian Wu's idea accepts the idea of ​​his former employer's long-term commitment. He is something of love, something of desire - a conceptual concept! <br /> <br /> Fans of Vivian Wu may want to watch the best B movie which he is from a few years called DINNER RUSH. DINNER RUSH is highly recommended. ENCRYPT is not.
