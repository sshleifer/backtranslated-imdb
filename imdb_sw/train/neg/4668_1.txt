Possible film, imposed during the 19th century, has failed to produce. With names executives like Maggie Smith, Albert Finney, and many others, there was no reason for movie failure. However, the movies had no end, it had a slight excuse for the line of conspiracy, and it fell to pieces and its continuing. A common story of a rich young woman and a poor young man, gathered in love and destroyed by beauty (or lack thereof) and unacceptable, has the touch of the death of a mother and a woman who was far away. Father, played with Finney, is a frustrated man, persecuting his daughter in life and death. He believes his lack of his daughter will destroy his fortune by getting married under their social status. Vendors tried to lose the rest of the story. Washington Square is a black hole of destruction and destruction, losing precious time to those who are sad looking. I am giving this film for 1 instead of 0, just for executives. Close yourself, keep clear of Washington Square.
