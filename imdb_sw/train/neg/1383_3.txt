Launch, prompted the movie action action. I was very optimistic for this film, and the type of executives of HK soldiers is one that I do not despise, but rarely I see the story of the story as a desire and good if this was. This would have been forgiven, as in these types of movies, when the action sponsored, unfortunately, did not. This step holds the highest trademark and high status of the HK action, but it is not very much involved, it is not quite good, and actually often not quite good (perhaps this is due to renewal for the American release, it shows signs for many sites of patchwork). I was shocked.
