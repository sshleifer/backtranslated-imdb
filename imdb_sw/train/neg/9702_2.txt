I don't think this movie was tested correctly. I took my copy and left the PG mark and wrote down R. I DON'T want to recommend this to anyone under 17 or 18, whatever the R depth. <br /> <br /> Why? It has a jungle area with several non-Indian women. I don't know about you, but that's not something for young children to look at. True, it can be "fashionable dress" of African Indians (?), But ... I think half of discrimination should give the movie R rating. I did not see the film recently, but I think otherwise, it was okay.
