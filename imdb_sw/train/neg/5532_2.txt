The rebellion of the zombies is not the worst film I have ever seen, but it's too far on the list. When the trip will be sent to Cambodia to discover the trick of making zombies after World War, one of the members decides to use skills for its own evil purposes. And he succeeds, at least the first time. A triangle of love faces a particular story. <br /> <br /> This was really a stirring film, and a bad acting that caused it hard to tell who were zombies and who didn't. The discussion was worse and the plot was not possible (not part of a zombie but part of the "romance"). And when I'm not a student or a movie star, the camera function was not found to help the film even. I have seen small movies that are worse, this is impossible to please anyone. It's bad, and it's not a very good way to get bad.
