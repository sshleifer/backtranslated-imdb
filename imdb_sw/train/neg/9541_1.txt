I think many people say / go through their first movie on IMD because the movie was awesome or awesome - I write for the last reason. I was fascinated by the sequel for "Wargames". I thought nature was very good to consider its time and its content, I felt it was worth looking more than once. That in 2008, I was very optimistic about what they could do with this film. Computer, Gaming, Terrorism, Military forces have increased greatly since the first film, and "Wargames: The Dead Code" got the opportunity to make it all on the big flick. The movie failed in every way, but I especially blame the authors and anyone who had any input on the origin of gaming issues. "The Dead Code" was a simulator of the aircraft of the aircraft of aircraft and a few people standing. At the same time, the Farmer will be a string of 7,000 orders - which no one affects what is happening on the screen. Until finally "he will win" by clicking on the box on the screen with his mouse that provides a gas that immediately kills 20,000 people (no one near gas). Because he struck 5 LEVELS for 15 minutes, this describes RIPLEY (a real life war machine) that is a high threat to terrorism. Even though the age of 5-16 can complete the task - the government believes it is a threat to humanity. They say things like "He has the knowledge of bio-terror experts" ... He showed less skill than someone who studied the first paragraph of the Bio-Terror Entry Week. So, the long-term film looks at the closest location to .01% of the budget and the excitement of any Bourne names generated. They have 1000 opportunities to capture and delete anything. Sometimes they are mad are lost to forget him but sometimes they only create opportunities to let him go deliberately to follow him. <br /> <br /> Ugh ... I would like to write more .. but I have already lost 1.5 hours to watch this, I would like to look at Broderick and Joshua to play a tac match for 1.5 hours.
