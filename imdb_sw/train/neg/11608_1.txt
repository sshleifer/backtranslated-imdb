If this person can make a film, then I'm sure that hell can also do that. Indeed, if you are making me a film, I have promised to do the following: <br /> <br /> 1) I will add more women to honey. This movie did not have. I think the B-class-awesome movies are only lost because of their traditional use of the female body. I don't want to let my viewers drop. 2) I will stop making so many events where the hero rises to find out just a dream. I think HorrorVision had 4 of these events. And, based on the film was just one hour, the dream ratio and the length of the film was very high. And, if I decide to make a series of dreams, I will make sure that someone wakes up without clothes. I mean, who sleeps in leather trousers? <br /> 3) Uninstall any movies like Star Wars or Matrix because I will know that my budget is small and I do not want my mask contempt for the great movie's Hollywood movies by adding satirical records about them in mine. <br /> <br /> 4) And finally, I will not mix modern technology with undead. I mean, palm experiments can only be awesome ... at least they turned it into the evil of the rolly-polly evil before the screen was hit or something. Therefore, if you are looking for a reputation in your production of upcoming fears, I will count: want-director of an extraordinaire movie.
