I chose to see this film because it has a good logo here on IMD. But many people have a bad taste or someone has been making a mark. Every way was a true desire. The movie is such as stupid and far fetched as a title can suggest. Surely there is no reason to summarize the plot - but here it goes: it felt like someone was thinking: "Wouldn't it be cool to make a movie where there were snakes on the birds? ? And that's about it! The program is thin and unusual. The snake is a bad CGI (but it is wise to cut corners on a movie that no one with their right mind will recommend to anyone!). Acting is poor, and all people are unreliable stereo types. Counting: It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen - get off!
