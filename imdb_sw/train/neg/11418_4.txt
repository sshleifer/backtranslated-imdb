Joel Schumaker explains the script he has written and has a Georgetown district group facing an adult life situation. The story line is the confusion itself, but some events are true. There are many talents and time here. Sent is awesome than the movie. Events are Demi Moore, Rob Lowe, Judd Nelson, Andrew McCarthy, Emilio Estevez, Ally Sheedy and Mare Winningham. McCarthy and Moore are very popular. Lowe is very bad. Coming to age is not so simple.
