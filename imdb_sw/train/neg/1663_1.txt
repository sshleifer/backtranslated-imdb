First of all, this plot has decreased further - the girl wants to do it, everyone likes, the snobby girl intervenes, all seems to be lost, the girl pulls through, everyone loves again, giving us something that is worthy of, the attractive man who motivates the heroine, and the single parent's problems and it's so predictable that you can read in a straightforward manner. Second of all, I hate how they continue to lose classic music. They send a message that everyone involved in classic music is emphasized by snobby and close-minded - in fact, I don't remember a particular quote, but I remember one time in the movie, Holly says, "Why they have to be very powerful ... so classical? "In fact it reproaches how labeled ethnic music in this way. Third, I've passed over several times, but the only reason I can think of making this film is to promote Britney Spears. there's just nothing. <br /> <br /> And oh, when the actor who showed Holly (I don't know if he was really singing her or not) had a good voice, it was not surprising as they did that - especially when he was playing. He was adding more at all. <br /> <br /> star 1/10.
