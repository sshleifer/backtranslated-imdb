Many people here say that this show is for children only. Hm, when I was a child (approximately 7 years old) I watched this first show. It was an abomination to me. I talked to other children about this and, of course, shows another and know what? This was a measure of disguise, whenever we wanted to emphasize something (on TV or anything else) we said "Uh, like Rangers Power" and laughed. And before visiting this site I couldn't imagine that there are really fans of MMPR. It was strange to me that I decided to look at it again and try to understand why people like it. I didn't enjoy seeing it. But it came to me: maybe I wasn't thinking enough? It can be. However this argument is not enough for me to weigh more than 1 star.
