I know what the hype around this is ... This is really a bad movie ... he had nothing to me, just a natural scene is where everyone comes together in a party, and a good song is playing, hitting a fine and beautiful shots of movies that it makes you go ... this was the best part of the film ... If this is not a film that lacks everything to absorb the viewer No story, nothing to think like other people say, no cooperation between different stories ... was more than a test to make again the 'Magnolia' of Anderson which was brilliant, but fails easily ... Well is light and easy to look, but that's movieclips too. Maybe first write a story before making a film ... 4/10 One of Belgium's worst movies I saw
