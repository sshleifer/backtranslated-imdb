The murderer, the cannibal pastor is murdered by a soldier who loved his recent murder scene. In his grave the cult is gathered with plans to raise him to the grave. Certainly this works and wakes up to stimulate male penis and he is back in his old ways to watch every new zombie. Two of the employees who go a little on the city seat and have a drug problem, return to the case. The first two members of the worship service are also trying to stop the killer by reviving another kind of death. They think they have left them but out from the grave comes a doll of doll doll that was used in the original resurrection. It seems to be really frustrated but there is just no trash. Acting is awesome and one of the fighters is one who plays Dr. Vincent van Gore in the face of a series of gore and he is just as horrible as a furious fighter in this film. Another offender only about the efforts to get his bad lines. Now I am on a low budget movie but this movie is just awesome. If it was not very easy for the women of the eyes and naked they would have slept. There is a little bit of but not more than animal breeds placed on the stomach of the victims. Zombie makeup on the other side looks great with his foot long leg that he uses to compress his victims is a kind of funny routine. There is also a semi-respect area where the killer loves for sex gold. Doll and the sound of chipmunks is a stupid thing that I've seen in the film. It's just a plastic toy on the line of fishing. <br /> <br /> The end is very bad. You expect the murderer to have more war than he. God knows how they made enough money. <br /> <br /> 4/10
