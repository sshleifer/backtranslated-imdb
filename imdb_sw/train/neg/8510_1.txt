When we were in junior high school, some of us boys regularly put stinkbombs. It seemed to be funny then. But producers, directors and cast "Semana Santa" ("Angel of Death" in the DVD section of your video renting) are adults and they are STILL to keep them away. <br /> <br /> As a preliminary inspector who wondered if they wanted to stop away from home, I am more doubtful to take one for any events. Mira Sorvino, fire in "Aphrodite Powerful" and other top-rated films, seems to be engaging in this project. His acting does not exist, more locked by the wistful stares which should show how "sensitive" he is in trouble of various film victims. But I would warn you - do not be the second victim! Step off the DVD if you get on the shelf. Tbere is not the bullet of the good foot of Mira (the only top that I could get in the film) and the support of the poor quality, giving unwanted dialogue talks and the shame of "Spanish" with the best school production exhibition.
