According to one of Gabriel Marquez's books and may be a priority documentation, this video-adaption is very interesting as it fights against sleep rather than enjoying some movie deslices. The story is about an old couple whose son died and lives a life that is dominated by poverty, and where the main character is a cock that hopes one day brings money to the next cockfight. No sense of pouring more words on this inappropriate piece, perhaps you can see Salma Hayek here, but sitting 90 minutes in front of your screen just for that? No gracias .....
