I realize that it should not be a BSG and I can handle slow displays if interesting but I find myself completely irresponsible with this series. The BSG route was seen to be: Step + Adventure + SciFi + Suspense + Secret + Drama </> <br /> Caprica's formula appears to be: Bland Drama + Moderate Scifi <br /> <br / > Maybe it will get more interesting but if part 3 I can't watch. In fact, it's under my watch-week list. This is a sad situation. Syfi's path has completely destroyed the Friday night line. Something happened on the days of the SG1, Stargate Atlantis, and BSG on Friday night? They had a good thing there.
