In fact, my expectations for little Bush were low. I expected a small series of cartoon for many fun (but it has led to the intervention) Bush's joke. It seems I had to decrease my expectations even more. This writing was very sad. In addition to the joke of Cheney-Chicken-Eating, and some of the giggly-little swipes, it was realistic and negligent. <br /> <br /> Animation was as modern as Flash Flash of thirteen years. It is a shame that they used Macromedia products for this, because it has a lot more potential. I do not like too much Bush, and I am happy with Bush as a second person, but this was only half an hour to swipe to the President for a short while funny. Trey Parker and Matt Stone did much more with That is My Bush. <br /> <br /> What! You own a permit, skip "Lil Bush" and go buy a copy of a short comedy "That's My Bush". You will love me.
