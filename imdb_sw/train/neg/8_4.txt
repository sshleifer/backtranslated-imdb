6/10 Working, it's not good but doing good work. <br /> <br /> 4/10 Director, makes stupid decisions for this film. <br /> 2/10 Author, the story is useless for all and has a huge amount of damage. <br /> <br /> 4/10 Overview of this film. Do not waste your time with this film, not worth it. I gave 4 for this film and could be very much. The perpetrators are more widespread than they can be in real life and other incomprehensible things happening "story story", not a good way. Because of this style of the film, it gets tired after 30 minutes (too many effects: slow motion and cameras move and move forward). It is always good that the movie uses music to make the story go well but there are so many songs in this. At the first hour there are around 50/50 conversations with music
