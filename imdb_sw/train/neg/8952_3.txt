Having heard about the prestige of George Orwell's prophecy for all my life, now I have 37, but I've never read that book, I am confused with what I have seen. <br /> <br /> I'm very knowledgeable and concepts mentioned in the novel, as I am more confident, but through hearing and quotes. Without this little film this film would have been completely hidden, and yet I am still not more educated on the 1984 story than I had before. <br /> <br /> On the other side. ... cinema is amazing, Hurt & Burton offers a beautiful performer and feel for the total of the movie is very strange and desolate. The prostitute's situation was a piece of fantastic dark to make film. Now to the bottom, and there is a lot ... There is a continuous battle, (at least away from the propaganda involved), but why & with whom? Nothing is explained. There are two names (Eurasia etc), but they have no meaning without definition. Who is Winston? what does he do? Where does he come from? where does he do? why does he change information information? why not the front row? Why eat food in canteen? Is that what he drinks drink through the whole film? Why is he so weak and sick? Why isn't the brain like the rest? What is related to the mother and sister? What happened to his father? A small backward story would be good, not found that, useful for those like me who have not read the book. Without it, this is a mixture and it is difficult to follow a movie of the house that keeps you always thinking about what's going on. The voice sound was included and has been badly beaten and frequent discussions from Big Brother screens in conversations that make it more difficult to do. I agree that this may be an artistic choice but it is very sad. <br /> <br /> Also, I know this is mentioned earlier, but why all nudity? It seemed just freeous and felt like it was thrown there for lack of any plot. I personally can't sit the way Hollywood feels it has to describe the story lines word for word these days. We are not all of us with the brain, but this is a very few steps away from the other way. I can only think that it depends entirely that you have read the book because if this film is a 'real translation' which I have seen many people say, I would be very difficult to understand why 1984 has been pronounced as a classic. <br /> <br /> There is no denial that it was light years before and it has pretty much predicted all changes in our society so far, (maybe this has become a kind of Bible for power that?), but many journalists sci-fi have done the same without leaving gaping holes in the story. I think I must do what I have to do from the beginning and buy a copy of the book if I make any impression from this. <br /> <br /> All in all, very disappointed in something that I have been waiting for years.
