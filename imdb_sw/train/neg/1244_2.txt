This is the first time for me, the first time I have been disappointed in the movie Tim Burton. POTA is not a bad film (big set, clothes and unusual performance) but it could be done by any lost director on hollywood. The pacing was very unusual, the last three spent just waiting for the last film, and I myself and cast. Tim Roth was the best, perhaps just a pleasure in the film. Rudi Tim.
