My God. I bought this film and ... I kept ... thing ... whole ..... . Okay, it will be ok ... I know I will be the same for a month or two. Sometimes soon I hope to eliminate the backs of flash. I'm going to eat something after the movie but I can just seem to have the courage to try and hold any food down at this time. Bad? Yes bad. Very bad. BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD. Waiting, the bad doesn't seem to get the message in the right way. Hmm ... There is no word to describe how terrible .... not a shock ... Hmm a very bad feeling / made / made / directed / written. Now I don't know what to do but throw it out. It is possible to burn that I did not want to hold down under the digging of a thousand years from now. The worst movie since "Happy Happy"
