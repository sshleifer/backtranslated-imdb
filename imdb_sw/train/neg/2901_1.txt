The fact that there are good views on Dan in Real Life on IMD just made me realize that their junket staff are hard at work trying to try people to watch this terrible movie. I don't have no words, no idea where to start describing the worst films that I lived last night - Dan in Real Life. Steve's characters in earlier films led to believing that I would like to feel something about his behavior and enjoy the discussion but if other posters I heard the concerns and embarrassment for the cast. The talk was made, the family was Walton's family of the cookie and the film has been many times before I stopped someone thought it was the original idea. <br /> <br /> What! you own a permit and terminate this awesome film and don't believe everything that you read on IMD since the first comment was written by people who lived in a different theater to watch the GOOD film.
