This movie is so bad that I can't even describe it. What in the hole is bad and the writers, producers and director? What? Did the world get money for this abomination? The program is delicious, acting is the poorest, story ... What is the story? The first fight in this film is the same but then continues to repeat itself until you want to turn it off. <br /> <br /> I think I am the greatest provider for leaving this stupid movie after the first minute. EXTREME RESEARCH *** > <br /> I offer 1 out of 10 because it is the lowest level of IMDb that should give. <br /> <br /> Are you a warranty: See the movie of Uwe Boll instead ... twice ... it fits most of your time.
