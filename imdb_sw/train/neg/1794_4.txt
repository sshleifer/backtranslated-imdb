not your regular vampires, not a bram player or anne rice here. The original story of vampyre. These vampyres are genetic mutants that the sun does not support. they are evil clean for. <br /> <br /> The film is not perfect. Most of the executives are very clear. The two guides who play van help and rly vecyre chick are very good though. The film is a powerful violence that can disrupt others. it is also loaded with the detail of science which many will find difficult to understand and can be bored. I was bought on a clever story and two beautiful performances. without telling them how this film could be successful if it had a big budget and a big deal
