This is one of those movies that appear on the cable as two hours in the afternoon to attract exhausted girls during the steel. Acting is the second level. Poor Mathew Modine seems to sleep through the entire film. And God helps Gina Gershon. His feelings are very high. It doesn't feel anything like a true English woman. It seems forced and destructive, as he does. She should be connected to what she does well, the girl's showgirl girl who plays on the roll & roll band and has a drug problem. Other characters do not have the best. They are two dimensional. empty, water and silly. What? Should we take care of these people? At one time Christy Scott Cashman get lost in Central Park. True? It's not hard to go to Central Park. Just follow any way out. Not only was I not worried about everyone involved, I really hated them. The only reason I was staying and the collapse of this film was Fisher Stevens. Even his brilliant humor can not save this dead fish. Each area is an example of renting a romantic citizen and nothing is left to surprise us. The script was as bad as it was acting. If you catch this fish throw us back!
