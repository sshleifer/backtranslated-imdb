This is not a very good movie, but not a stinker either. It is very confused and so long lease for your own risk. My GF and I have seen this movie outdoors (we think) so here it is: <br /> <br /> * ** MAJOR spoilers CHINA *** <br /> <br /> First, This film is really quite simple after removing all of the ambiguous unconscious-dreamed government junk (95% of the movie.) <br /> <br> Ignoring the junk, what happened is this: A group of school friends goes one night. They leave and get into a car accident where everyone but Cassie and Sean die. That's easy to reduce the version. (That is true, I said Sean, carrying me) <br /> <br /> After the accident, Cassie sat in the hospital in the middle of life and death to the end of the movie. This is where the dream part begins. <br /> <br /> The movie is called the SOUL, right? Cassie's mind and soul carries over after an accident to collaborate with another soul (Annie, Matt, Raven, 2 weirdos and Jude) with image designers and his mind (Sean, school and other things around it). The soul continues to act were described as: Annie rave ongoing chick, 2 weirdo-killers (from opening area), Father Jude still help people etc. <br /> <br /> We are then taken for a very long journey, shown lots of photos (which a lot of my GF and I still can't install in) but all the boils under it's not being at Cassie's death. Finally, Cassie gets up in hospital after being "dead" for a while. His family and Sean there. This is the truth again. He is the same. <br /> <br /> Then the director adds little links to trying to break us again by showing a little snippet of his dream in a wheelchair to be strangled. But this part is really just a dream, and he wakes up beside Sean, is clearly still dealing with his traumatic experience. <br /> <br /> Because of space restrictions, we didn't cover everything, but feel free to give us an email if you want. <br /> <br />
