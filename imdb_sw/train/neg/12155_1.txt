If this movie is written for leadership and generated with the intention of creating ethnic ethnicity of the cinema, it can (i) be hit. What? Have you ever lived and watched the film that was so bad that it becomes interesting for the issue of its errors? Well this is. Each of the cast acting should be appointed for the worst of performance. It is difficult to find other films, and this type of production budget, which has very little of any value. The whole thing, from the opening events causes logic. The discussion is completely unacceptable and does not matter. Ditto for the character and the overall story of the film itself. What is really a sense of driving, is that some buffonons on board boards actually made decisions to spend money on this piece of rubbish. Wow.
