In fact, I had to sit on the computer and write a review immediately after looking at this hole. Why? Because I must let you all know how this movie is bad. It's quite bad. Just to get you so bad, I'll give this information on the movie. During the events of the violence, which often have people to shoot or blow zombies, they watch scenes from the video game. Yes, you heard me right. This is fun. In fact, it makes me think about the fact that it takes ten dollars these days just to get into the movies on these days. And see maize filled like this? No stories to talk to the movie basically does not have anything to offer except the regular shooting of boob and cheap loses. I am so frustrated with this, knowing that I watched it. Okay, I'm locking myself. It's too bad I can't even find words. RATING: ZERO out of *****.
