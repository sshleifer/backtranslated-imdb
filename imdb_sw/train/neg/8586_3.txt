What a desire ... admits that it is better than the original, but the story is weak, the plot runs away and the final result is a compilation of pieces, not recognized and knit together by the amateur. There are many ongoing mistakes that are so contested with the original films, and the emergence of Darth Vader was done so much that what could be the time of the story in modern cinema is now a cheesy guarantee that will be released for years. I can't complain about a bad discussion, if this is a Star Wars ... The original three films were fashionable, a sense of worship and a fictional story, and an extraordinary conversation was added to charm. The experiment was a deep attempt to make more money, and the lack of this love shows in events. Surprisingly.
