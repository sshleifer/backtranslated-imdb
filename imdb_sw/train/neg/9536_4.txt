Best of Best 4, it's better than 3, but just hard. Basically, I say this because part 4 does not contradict 1/2 section (as 3 does), (for example they are not a reference to Tommy Lee having brothers). However, I loved Russian line of story, and especially part of Sven Ole-Thorsen as Boris. In addition to however other fighting objects, movies are not something special. A small budget is also very visible (especially in the war zone). Also, part 4 does not have a moral truth or say something as part 3 made, there are more than the best characters (Hudson, Thorsen) section 4, but not as the beginning of the series (and even these characters have very little responsibilities). Alas, the Best Best of Best is the Rhee show, and being true, can not carry the movie. Look at the tape, Rating: 4
