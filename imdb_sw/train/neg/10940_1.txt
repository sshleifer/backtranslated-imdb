First, let's agree that Lorenzo Lamas can't seem to be a skilled actor, even the most respectable, sometimes very clear. However, in this section of @ *! ^ Called SnakeEater, the film industry has generally fallen. <br /> First, let's start with a plot. Vet Vietnam called Jack Kelly, who was a soldier (who should be tough as a leather string and then, which you can believe when he shoves the nails through 2 guys feet and their pinnacle pins), gets a word that his family has been killed and his sister has been kidnapped. So he keeps the job of saving his sister. It had some power, but it is still narrow thin. <br /> <br /> Now, acting. Being the own actors, I have a good reputation to say that this was some of the WORST that made in the history of art !!!!! Lamas are, well, yourself. Playing clubs / refusal should be beaten and shot for their exhibitions that insult the actors everywhere, especially talented people who never break them! <br /> <br /> Finally, action. The great weapon is so-for BEST, and the fist fighting is hurting. I have seen more struggle than a real look at the Renaissance Festival (and that was a fake lie)! Readers, listen to me: WHAT IS THE CACA OF THE ALL OF ALL! If it was FILIA TO BE IN THE WORLD, YOU WANT TO GET! Because of your cell-brain count, don't see this!
