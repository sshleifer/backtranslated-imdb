I'm trying to determine if flying into a wood chopper will be more enjoyable than this dreck. It completes the destruction of what was the first film. With Jedi, risk, Clowns and Sith we have the death of Lucas's work. Want us to swallow Annakin is Vader nonsense? I never believed it to be true. This film proves that feeling. The story has never been from Phantom Moron, and every new film took the event until all that was left was a toy game. I'm going. I know where some new rocks to throw it. Want fighters? Here comes. Luke and Leia are NOT READY. Vader is not their father. Duke Countoo must plunge while still can. Yoda has a limited vocabulary than Yogi Berra. His advice has never been good for anyone. Obi Wan told Luke for the first two films. Annakin did not create C3P0. He found him in the wilderness and told his mother about putting him together from the beginning. Chewbacca has fleas. All this round and Vader and the collapse of the Republic can be judged for b b *** h Amma-Lamma-Ding-Dong. If he had any intelligence he did not want to come to Annie's light year, but he had said what George Lucas had written to him. What dope!
