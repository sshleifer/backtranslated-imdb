Study session: Hong Kong, 1966. Paul Wagner, a man who built a Victoria Tunnel, was killed along with his wife and partners. Women's twins, Chad & Alex, are divided. 25 years later, Chad, a Karate teacher in Los Angeles, & Alex, a common weapon in Hong Kong, are joining the power to retaliate their parents' murder and surely claim tunnel. It is the second time that Jean-Claude Van Damme & Sheldon Lettich have worked together, after making "Lionheart" previously. This is also the first of three films showing Van Damme play two roles ("Maximum Class" & "Replicant" are others). The program is very easy to take a retaliation story, the only feature of the film's release is the performance of Van Damme as two very different people ?? a rich and poor-and-tumble boy, a hard-cut boy. While it goes, Van Damme does not work very well in any role, although taking him Alex is amusing with gentleness. It is amazing if you have brothers wrong with each other, with them dressed in different clothes and have different hairstyles. Bolo Yeung makes henchman very worthy for baddies.
