Knights was just the beginning of the series, experiments, one can say. The plan (I don't have to call that, had no plot) it was completely useless and there were many mistakes, like [warning, presenting a summary]: only of cyborgs (bad people) but after the peak, Nea discovered that there are many more remaining. And he was told that the cyborgs were hard to kill, but after a new training, Nea could kill them with one blow. <br /> <br /> The movie was just a kicking clean. I was not surprised at all, when I realized that the leading star was a kick striker. There was one direct thing in the entire film: it offered a lot of laughter when watching it and talking to my friends. I recommend checking it, if you need laughter.
