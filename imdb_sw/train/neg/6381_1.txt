This film is about a group of male male males who have lost the male women in the world, to create a homosexual world. I looked at it to see it bad. However, I was shocked at how bad it was. It seemed more like a film made 50 years ago. Acting, if any, is very bad. Set and props are so artificial fake, making any college film look mega budget. And the special effect is laughably simple, in fact jaw drop as others have a comment, but the jaw dropping stop. One should be very drunk, or in a state of consciousness to understand this film. If I came from Denmark, I would be ashamed and embarrassed that people of my country produced a very bad film.
