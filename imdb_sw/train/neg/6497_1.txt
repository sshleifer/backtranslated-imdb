In fact I was very optimistic to go to this film, so I took what was given with salt and I looked forward to the best. About 1/3 of the way through the film I was just leaving, the only film is mish-mash of things happening because there is no clear and all is rejected. I like movies that make you think, but this film was just a group of ideas shared and never connected. Thinking it is David Lynch-esquire if others could believe it, there is no place near the area instead of trippy pictures. Saying is very much to hide the fact no good plot or story is just a way or justify why you pass 1.5 hours in the film. Acting was good, but that can't save the lack of stories. I agree with one of the comments previously sent ... "it's like being in someone's head ... when they have drugs," in other words there is nothing appropriate.
