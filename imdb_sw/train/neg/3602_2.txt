I am a strong response to the B-Rate of film fears and I have seen my right part of slasher pictures, so I have a great measure of judging this film. It appears easily on the echelon of the worst films of the 1980s that should be given. It is not as scary as the Babylonian Night, not as a Re-Rewarder and no value for the Campus. What it said, this film is not worth. Remember, the art of film is for a completely different film. Still hitting back behind the DVD box is not available on this film. $$$ (There is a lot of violence but we have seen it all before. The killer kills nubile students and a regular member of the center for losing their throat and all other fatigue techniques that fear the film using. /> <br /> NUDITY: No <br /> <br /> Stories: $$ (The story focuses on Francine Forbes - who changed his name to Forbes Riley after this film made - who accepts a career training at university. People begin to die and Forbes believes that the murderer is looking for him. Is it his new old heart and libido-crazed heart? br> ACTING: $ (scary for all levels. This slasher has a feel of school-school hole production which is because college students can make a better flick than this.Forbes shows the talent of talent such as one seminar of the students, but everyone is of "extra" grassland not to act.
