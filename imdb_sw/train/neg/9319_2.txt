I don't know what you're talking about, the first time I watched this film with my two friends that we can't cry. This is one of the funniest seats I ever saw. These views about porn are similar though hahahaha. <br /> <br /> This movie is really worse, but it caused tears in my eyes because of the phony characters, poor conversation and acting. Not to mention the expensive cameras that had been filing? It looks like one of those movies out of my drivers ed. class. Props looked like they came out of the school's high school show. Music seems to be from the original Nintendo system. The only thing that came around was bothering me about this movie was that it had a clown killers who, who wasn't creeped out with oil, llowing clowns? hahaha if someone would ever look at this though, they need to look out for the offenders of words like writing words and some of their face words. hahahaha I died.
