I am very sorry to say this but "Thunderbirds" has not come with a big pop, never tell any sound. At one point I gave a lot of attention to walking out of the movie, and sat in the unplanned hope that the film could improve. If I had to despair, it didn't get better, it was worse if possible. I would have gone to see that film with the thought that it would be "spoof" I'd like to stop. They had a good opportunity to make a great franchise film here, completely lost that opportunity. Bill Paxton and Mr. Ben Kingsley should be ashamed to have names on this film and Jonathan Frakes well and what I can say, he should be ashamed and embarrassed without being away from the truth. I saw this film in the pre-release, I was waiting to see it more eagerly, and grew up in sixty years and the original exhibition. To say I was desperate would be something to lose. The last thing I will tell you about the film was the cover on television shows was more wood than where the characters in the film.
