This is a collection of sorriest of clich√©s, connected together in a straight line, without a known conspiracy or any good way of doing what I have seen for a long time. Canibalising scenes from Star Wars, the Fire Rule, Godzilla, Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter, went to all the war on the mind of the audience. Was this film good? It wasn't even movies! <br /> <br /> Even if it is not appropriate so to really be funny and to achieve a cult condition like a comedy, the movie offers some laugh. The trick is to put the borrowed scenes in the context of their original film. Gandalf can be funny talking Korean, heaven looking blue hilarious as a comparison to a kitten and evil henchman can give a lot of fun switch between and out between Sauron and Jaja-bing, or whatever its name was. Under the bottom: any pleasure derived from this film is entirely dependent on the state of alcoholism and the view of the audience, not on the director / author. Secret on you, Shim!
