This B's early entry into the patriarchal society struck a fine young Gene Tierney on advertising and poster, but you have to wait a good time before seeing him, driving a Hollywoodized camel. Previously, we have developed George Sanders and Bruce Cabot in the desert as boys who are not available, but they should join the attack. I have seen Sanders as the most enjoyable cads that was fun to witness a rare good guy to turn. However, the direction of Bruce Cabot is very confidential to me - he is based and unsubtle for comparison, but I always felt he just emerged, exciting, from the bottom of the car, covered in oil and six-grade education. Some people like 'em in such a way, like the Genebi's character of the Gypsy queen. This is to fill the adventure, tho, and just as we warned against the invading locals and guns, ready to lose and attack Brits in their country, there is a final gun battle that we should lose the main character for the good of all. This feature does not require anything more than your Saturday afternoon priority, the producer who has done anything else well connected. It was almost more interesting to note the great help cast and surprise seen by Dorothy Dandridge in one of its first responsibilities. Two or two and a half-five stars
