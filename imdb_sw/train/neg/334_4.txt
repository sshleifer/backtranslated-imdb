The bad movie certainly. It's such a fantasy fantasy and many poor effects, a lot of quick events (single airport for example), and real time inappropriate. (Charles Dance) is as bad as a bad guy and he is better at (Last Action Hero). (Eddie Murphy) is making a non-comic joke, and I heard that this sun has already succeeded, a great success of time? I can't understand why or how? In one TV interview I heard (Eddie Murphy), when he was chosen for Oscar 2007, he responded to comic! <br /> <br /> One of the comments (Hey ... It's the 1980s!). Well, no friend of mine. It is the folly of movies that made many RAZZIE movies like the 1980s or 1950s! <br /> <br /> There are two reasons why I write about this movie. The first is that I will never forget the long-standing feet of (Charlotte Lewis) especially when she was on the bed before bad men attack her home, wearing only a blue shirt and OH BOY campaign had confirmed her naked legs as it should . But how odd! If I have looked at him to follow the movies and he had no good again? However the second reason is that I have recently got this film title in my list of movies worse than 100 !! Under the bottom: the bad movie, the legs of Greeeeeat.
