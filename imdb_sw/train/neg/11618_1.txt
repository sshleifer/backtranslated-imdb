Acting in the film has been done well, but the movie is slow and interesting, as soon as it gets interesting everything that comes down with great stability. I am glad to see Sam Rockwell in this, he did a good job, and so did other actors like I said but someone ... this is one of the most hit movies I ever saw. Now perhaps in short film this film will be good, but moreover, avoid. This film has a lot of filling makes twinkie cake envy. <br /> <br /> I've never been, walking out on the film, but looking at this home and family, I came out. Well, it was terrible. It seems my opinion doesn't have enough lines to write, so here there is more filling. I think I was followed by the movie I just watched.
