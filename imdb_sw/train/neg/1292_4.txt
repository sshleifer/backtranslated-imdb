Well, this was not a very bad film I had ever seen, but I had heard good things about it and I had lost much. I could see where the filmmakers were coming out and that they were trying to explain the fact that the two sides in this war were not quite different from the other person, that people were lost in war, etc., etc. (well, that's my concept, however = ^ _ ^ =) <br /> <br /> At any rate. I have watched many long-term movies, but this seems just a refreshing to continue. I continued to think ... cares for ??? I also saw that the instant was dead and the discussion was hit. I understand that this was the 1800s and all, but many conversations seemed just unusual. No one seemed to have any feeling in many films except during melodramatic events. “Love” in the story does not seem to be supported by anything but “I am a husband and you are a girl”, which I don't think a lot of love, and I still heard I was led by the belief that these people were in love . Oh well .. I think it's the whole "all this fear around us, we have each connected to" something sort, or nothing. I was also hoping for some kind of power between two best friends (all of whom seemed to have interest for a girl) but that was just a kind of dropped. Maybe avoid a delightful piece of cliche. I don't know. Well .. Well, Daniel Holt was close to the only character I loved the truth. And Sue Lee was the same. I wasn't quite sure to love Jake, but also appeared too ... without spineless, I think. Jack Bull did not care at all. And I'm sure you think * to hate everyone else, except the poor ordinary people who drop down and left. It was very good and had anything to "fear of war" down, but I have seen many other movies and the same theme, it has done well. (I really enjoyed Patriot, for example, even if it was an emotional barrier) But, as I said already, I'm excited. What can I say? :)
