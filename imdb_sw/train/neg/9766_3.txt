Roger Corman is definitely one of the most unreliable and unpredictable directors in history. He had one wife involved with some of my horrible films (such as Edgar Allen Poe "Masque of Death Head" and "Piti and Pendulum") with some cheap cheap items (like "Creative from Haunted Sea "and" He is the God of the Shark Rock "). Corman also made several movies not available with ?? just set ?? almost impossible to judge properly. "Safari", for example, with this known as "Gas-s-s" can be called as the exploitation of psychedelic. In other words, they are a wonderful wonder of hippie-culture influenced movies. Half of the time you don't have a little more idea going on, who are these characters who walk back and forth through the screens and where this whole hell goes. This program is unique and still very suitable: a wonderful but deadly psychological gas is a sudden and devastating threat that the world's population over the age of 25 years. This * can * be the basis for the excitement of the atmosphere , gently and nail post-apocalyptic Sci-Fi logo, but author George Armitage and Roger Corman decided to make it a "comedy" movie-comedy comedy. There are no characters even trying to prevent their inevitable deaths; they just engaged out on the street and found the scale of the crime party. "Gas-s-s" is a despicable thing and tries to be very difficult. The entire script appears to have been created elsewhere and not all interesting. Certainly not my cup of tea, but the film has a good fan base and many biographies, so who do I say is not worth your time or money?
