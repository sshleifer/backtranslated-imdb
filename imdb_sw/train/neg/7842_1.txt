You took this to an accident t.v. The display - and could not believe how completely the whole experience was. By comparison, the natural "Man Named Horses" was to give him a sense because he had a person's interest around. But this piece of meaningless words - words leave me. It was not bad enough to have a "story" presented with all the effects of rain bread, but the error was mixed with the lack of definite definitions each time the so-called "Sioux" was spoken. For kindness, filmmakers could not find North American Indians who were also actors and practitioners to act like "Indians" in this farrago rather than fools who used it? I found it very embarrassing to look at Richard Harris striking around the countryside to be clear of a standing director behind the camera, telling him to run and jump from point A point point to point B only to create minutes of minutes and minutes. Surprisingly in all things!
