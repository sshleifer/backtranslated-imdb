Movie 'Gung Ho!': The story of the attackers of Carlson Island of Carlson was held in 1943 with a view to going on the American values ​​of the second world war. It shows in the best way that movies can create a body of propaganda. The value of this film is just a collection and no artistic. In the propaganda film does not mean to judge the trends and actors. Check that the movies if you are interested in learning how propaganda works in movies or if you're a great pleasure of Robert Mitchum who plays a small role in the film. If you want to see a film for the second world war, you are better off with the goal. I rated 4/10.
