I have nothing to say on this film It is so bad that I had to put my first comment on the IMDb website to help other viewers save time and do something more interesting, rather than to watch this "movie". looking at the walls is better. And because I have to write four verses of Scripture, I tell you also it's a small movie budget, a bad act, anonymous, mutt of stupid like a wolf, and so on ... Also a story brings something new, special effects are made in style 80. <br /> <br /> Movie is almost as bad as the movie "Megalodon". <br /> <br /> Enjoy! ;) (not watching this film)
