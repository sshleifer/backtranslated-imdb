In 1934, Shirley Temple played three major movies and began to make a name for himself. Unfortunately, the label needed to be tested to see what all the people liked so much here. Two of these things were singing and playing. Another was a short, interesting film that kept people thinking and leaving their ideas. You know the other keys for Shirley's successes. This movie is not available any of the above, despite Gary Cooper stars and Carole Lombard and despite the best director at Henry Hathaway. In addition, there are many chat rooms here that are boring, and many arguments between Lombard and Cooper. Then on, you did not find the end-of-the-last feel-the-way that the public wants. I think they learned after this film.
