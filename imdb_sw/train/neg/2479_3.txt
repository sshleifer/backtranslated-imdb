I learned first for Wendigo many years ago in one of the books of "Scary Stories" of Alvin Schwartz: according to the story, Wendigo - after being called your name in the wind - he finds you aside, then fetching you into heaven and pulverizes you. Although it looks like a strange idea, the story of Schwartz became a positive concept. <br /> <br /> Movie "Wendigo" is not recommended. Basically it has every fear of fear: the family goes to a new home and the strange things begin to happen, anyone who harms them is praying, and everyone can listen to the old Indian boy. I have seen these things so often that I no longer care about counting. <br /> <br /> Any way, avoid. Patricia Clarkson and Erik Per Sullivan (Dewey on "Malcolm medium") have done better than this.
