If there is one thing you can focus on Disney to do, it's their abnormal ability to take a story and tell you over and over again. Even watching business for Lady and Tramp II was a bad experience. Disney will destroy one of their amazing classics forever. It even had a dessert area. It's done before! And that's what I say directly on this video (the whole concept should be banned). Everything is a rehash of the original movie and even a few of the best Bluth movies. Little penguin and walrus (I have forgotten their names) is just a copy of the Timon and Pumbaa carbon. Morgana is another Ursula. He even repeats to all his old lines. These songs are sad, unpleasant. I have never heard bad songs from them before now. And talk is good. It's fun and easy. On the other hand, at least they took time to make a certain animation. All the common characters are not as interesting as they were (or maybe that's low for the little Mermaid fans). Back to the negative, Melody is just so ignore the cute you can just vomit. I almost did. Do you own your little fan of Mermaid. Don't waste your money on this. True, it is not as horrible as the Return of Jafar or Pocahontas II, but that's a little comfort.
