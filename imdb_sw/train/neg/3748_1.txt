... but this doesn't work and I am surprised to see how many people see it as good. For what reason? There are enough other tips here and there, but all materials are self-reliant. Lynch movies are generally attractive because they create a sense of frustration and still, they like to play when doing so. There are some feelings of seeing, there are some young people, characters, ideas etc. But this is light and yes, useless. Because anything to focus on is "limited", or it is also unchecked, or explained earlier in the best way. It's just a Lynch trying to DV, nothing so should be treated like this. 1/10
