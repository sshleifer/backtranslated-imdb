After Chaplin made one of his best films: Dough & Dynamite, made one of the worst: Lords of Nerve. In the first year in the film, Chaplin made up a third of all his films. Many of them were experimented with ad-libbing, editing, gags, shooting area, etc.. This happens in the racetrack where Chaplin and his friend try to enter without paying. Mabel Normand is with her friend too, and Chaplin can remove her friends with Mabel. Then, Mabel Mabel at the top seat without obvious results from her behavior. There is a lot of slapstick here, but there is very little to recommend this film to others then check Chaplin to develop. Publishing what I saw was very bad, which could have affected her happiness. Charley Chase can be reduced. * of 4 stars.
