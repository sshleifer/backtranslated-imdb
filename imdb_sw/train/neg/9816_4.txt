This movie was like a bad fall for the train, as well as it was bad, you still need to keep looking. My dear and I used and lost two hours of our day. Now don't get involved with me, acting is good. Only the movies are generally just angry with us all. There is nothing positive or good about this situation. After this film, I had to hire anything else that was lightweight. Jennifer Tilly is usually as a very good actress. Its characteristic looks of manic and not all there. Darryl Hannah, although she played more, she does a good job of playing the situation she has. More than once I found myself on TV to tell him to fight or get violent. All in all, a very strict movie ... not to the heart of despair.
