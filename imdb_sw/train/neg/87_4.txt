I have read all the books of Softly Love. Knowing well that movies cannot use all the features of the book, but generally have at least a major part of the book. I was shocked at this film. The only thing they have in this book in the book is that Missy's father comes to visit, (although in the book all parents come). It's just that. The line of the story went out and it looks away from yes, sad, from the book, which I just can't enjoy. Even though I didn't read a book it was very sad. I know that the pioneer life was bad, but the whole movie was down. The rating is by having the same family of the film that makes them good.
