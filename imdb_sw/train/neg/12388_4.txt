** WARNING: SPOILER INFORMATION ** <br /> If you can get to something not very exciting, this film offers help of the melodrama of pride. Surprised enough, this movie has been published and rejected several times over the years, although it is difficult to understand any filmmaker led by this trashy festival. None of the Hemingway women can do here (though Mariel has grown over the years), Anne Bancroft gives only a touch of the class as a prosecutor, and Chris Sarandon is turning to a nervous and irritating boy like a wonderful, brave guy. The former former director Lamont Johnson cannot make a cement package from this plant's ear script, which emerges from bursting and bad conversation with a strange situation. For example, the last sequence, where Margaux takes his player and dismisses Sarandon down after his most recent act means to be exciting but does the job of holding the heart instead. Add a fascinating color and spacy music to Michel Polnareff and you have a real pleasure of guilt, although you are likely to feel grubby and you need a hot shower after looking at it. Don't say you didn't warn.
