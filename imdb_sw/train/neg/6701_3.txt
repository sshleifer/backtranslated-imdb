I have been an environmental supervisor for years and I have been eager to show this. I used to record all the events because I thought I could learn new things. I can if I could go back to Rachelle. <br /> <br /> I am sure a lot of these are happening to be seen as a real show and appeal to the class of viewer. It does not work for someone who is very interested in the planet. <br /> <br /> This show should be called Live by Rachelle. Since Ed is a great news story, maybe a second show that is very bad about the environment will be a good idea. Refreshment is not important for some of us. <br /> <br /> I do not record the episodes or watch the show, but let me know if the real green show might be in the work.
