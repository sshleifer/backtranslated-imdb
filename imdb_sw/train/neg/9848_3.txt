This film has a great picture of noirish / neorealist, and it tells a story that is not free of Hollywood sugar coating, which is only possible because it was a free foreign film. But some events are developing for a very long time (wedding, in particular), and I've got a modern and non-modern realistic conversation to be more straightforward than the financial screen. The talk was particularly exciting, and it seemed to be bad if the movie continued. Many of the actors were Italian-Americans or immigrant migrants living in New York thirty-thirty years, but their conversations showed whether they were making lines to play Shakespeare when they mix cement and brick. Near the end I was surprised, not because the filmmakers wanted me. I think the rhyming poems can be defended by saying that the characters would be speaking Italian, and the dialogue is a real interpretation of how they can talk. But it wasn't done for me. Another line of conversation has made me laugh for a different reason: the son of the main character, born and raised in New York in the 1920s, suddenly takes a good lilting to the British permit. I just think of something that has to do with the fact that the film was done in the UK. I 'm giving this movie' A 'for the effort and intention, but the lowest level of implementation.
