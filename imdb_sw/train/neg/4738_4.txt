I liked to look at the original Azumi and its mixture of live life, compelling story, sound sound, guide (Kitamura stone!), Edit, and mention beautiful Ueto Revelations that filled that part perfectly. So I had a great desire to see Azumi 2, but after finally I felt I had won a lotto and lost a ticket :( Azumi 2 decides where Azumi left, however these are 2 different movies very slowly. The excitement also has been taken with no development of the character. This seems to be headed by the person involved and further reducing the value of the TOHO monster's franchise (if possible!) I agree with other former consultants who say that this was a lost opportunity. Ryuhei Kitamura continued with this phase. There is even a good forests of Japanese forests to look at when the slow action is unlocked and we are brought very briefly to the little characters who are being killed quickly. Fight against Guy Spider (straight out of the part of the Monkey!) In the bamboo forest was close to the memorable y elaborate war zone. Azumi 1 we had a great clash of the scene and the effects of the barrel camera, Azumi 2 brought us a Azumi cape! The end of Azumi at the end was uncertain, but Aya still does a good job. He looks good at cape ... but where did he get from? I don't think I will see him once again! ... it's pity.
