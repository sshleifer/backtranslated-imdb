When I work in a video store, I found it to be my job to talk about the worst movies I have seen, and to warn my friends and colleagues. During one day of the sharp debate of the worst films, my friend advised me to check B.T.K. The murderer, even saying that if I could watch the entire movie and still claim that my previous choice is the worst movie, then he could look at it. I lost. I believe that even I have made the video better than this in secondary school, and that was not very difficult for young minds. This film was not only in what was considered a productive value (it seems to have been shot on a bad camcorder, though it is surprisingly clear), but also in action (wood, holes, and pathetic is not available to the surface) as well as just a bad feeling of film. I can remember the scene that I heard the glass smash, suddenly, I remembered some of the worst high school games (I know that I say a high school very often here, but this film was seen as infants) all with a matter of setting, which seemed to be fake too, but also if people were reading their line from the script, it's not quite what is going on. My review does not do the right to this film, because I can't describe how long I lost it was. It is amazing that I am doing a pleasant job to describe the pathetic excuse for the film.
