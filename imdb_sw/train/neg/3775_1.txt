If other viewers are mentioned, this film was an interesting attempt to photograph. Color is a book of courage. I think the director has been taken up by his artistic “vision” on the appearance of the film rather than focusing on the content. Despite the stellar cast, the exhibition is lack of information and the story is not recommended. Madonna was likely to be thrown as a stunt to get the press before release. As good as his appearance here has accepted his album "I am a Breathless (Music-directed film Dick Tracy)" which was hit by a stratospheric (due to a large part of the "Vogue" drum - which does not exist, nor is there a little relationship this film). I would like to think a lot of money from this film has come from the tie-ins for the "I'm Breathless" album. <br /> <br /> If you look at home, with the last names, you will think "there are two hours out of my life I would like to have back." Save time lost - don't bother with this.
