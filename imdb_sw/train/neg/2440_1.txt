Koen Wouters is a strong singer and presenter. In the early nineties he tried his hand on the cinema also. But this amazing piece of junk finished its work once and for all. It also ended the work of Dutch actress Nada van Nie who continued to be a TV player and TV programmer. I saw this in a nearby field (near) because I was a fan of the Koen Wouters group, Clouseau. And so I feel to spend money on it. It seems to be cheaper, it's a horrible story and it is treated every way possible. Some people think it's very bad. I'm not one of them. I just found a waste of time and money.
