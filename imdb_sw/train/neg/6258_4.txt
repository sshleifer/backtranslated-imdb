Author of the author Tony Piccirillo made his own play about a good man, a widow recently, learning in the past three weeks has HIV; he is looking for a gay partner who has had, brought him to the apartment and tied him, put a blood test to the boy and promises to take revenge if the result returns. The amazing concept seems more comfortable on paper than is shown. James Marsden's slave is emotionally concerned, but the fake way of drama is amazing - it's like watching the version of Tom Cruise. Scott Speedman should work harder and greater responsibility, but his personality-shifts from a guy-up-edge embarrassment not to lobby, not a conversation of two people. The boyfriend of Marsden's gay party is uncomfortable, of course - he feels compassion for the speed of Speedman - but he does not take or act like any sexual person can in this situation. The movie is not cop-out, in particular, but it is a fraud, the most disabled and bad editing, bad pregnancy disorder, low budget production, and a great end that is faced with silly pretension and soapy melodrama. * 1/2 from ****
