Showed in Australia as 'Hydrosphere', this very bad film is so bad that you should be hypnotized and you should look at it to the end, so you can see if it can get worse ... and it makes! The story of the story is predictable appears written by the high school class, the set is pathetic but with much less than miniature, and acting is timber. <br /> <br /> Muppet 'infants' seems to be stolen from a cup of props 'Remember Total'. It didn't seem to have one idea, original in the entire film. <br /> <br /> I've found this film so bad that I laughed most of the way. Malcolm McDowell should be put to his head in shame. He really needed money!
