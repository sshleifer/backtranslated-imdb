Because I wanted to give this movie a chance to take two hours of my life (in fact it was only 35 minutes) it was my intention to try to understand and hope to appreciate Indian movies. All I saw was a few old movies of S.Ray. Looking for IMDb I have looked at this and after seeing 8.7 I concluded this should be the one that opens the doors of the unknown and brings the joy of art. Oh how I was wrong! The only logical explanation for this level of 8.7 is that 970 people who voted for India and only themselves emerging out of Bolliwood's production were Adam Sandler movies. With this rating this movie will be positioned 9 place on the IMD list of the 250 best movies of Citizen Cane, Goodfellas of Psycho! I am not impressed by going and refusing because there is anything that I feel worthy to remember from this painful experience. My only hope is that there are many Hindus who like me find this movie as obviously ignorant, and the quantity of kitsch and cheesy music.
