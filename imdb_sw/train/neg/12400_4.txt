Matt Cordell has risen from the dead for the third to go, although I don't know anyone cares for this point except for fans of MANICA COP rabid. Cordell, who died in the last flick, is raised by the voodoo, and is now hot on the way of the innocence involved in the assault of his fellow officer Cordell very much. I missed this part of the early 90's budget quickie, but it was good to see Cordell making the body count in different ways, bad. The problem is, the whole film is a static good, and just Cordell is not Jason or Freddy. Interest is very fast, even to the master of the movie boss Robert Forster as a doctor who ends up with his mind being hit. Close with the first film in the series, which is interesting and exciting and exciting, at the same time.
