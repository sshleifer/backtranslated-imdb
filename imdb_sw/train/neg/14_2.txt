There are times when finishing one film wants to have a full-time return. This was one of those times. I was closer to just 15 minutes left to endure ... and I would like to have ... <br /> <br /> The speed that one goes from direct-laced, life controlled by one of the full spinelessness and the roleless be so quickly. From the closing ceremony to the end of Tristan Price (Jesse Metcalfe) the right person and culture allows himself to be lost by the woman, by violence, and by mind things. Of course, the woman's part is understandable when looking at the beautiful talents of April (Nathalie Kelley). But for a penny of a pound of drugs, abuse and dedication to someone who has met is impossible to understand. Really, instead of being able to look at Nathalie Kelley and Monica Keena, this film does not contain the features of redemption. Save your money, forget your time ... do anything else ...
