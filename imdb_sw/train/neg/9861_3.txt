I'm sitting this way for GenCon just because it was quiet and I would. It is a waste of time. Beverly D'Angelo and William Katt? WTF? What is the woman playing with Flo and Abe Vigoda busy or something? Really, a piece of unwanted waste. The characters were equally meant (I think ...) and timber, many of them seemed like they were on an independent. The so-called "hilarious" described in some of the other known reviews were hackneyed, I cried to the authors. I am confused about how anyone can get this value of their value, with weight. I only give 3 out of 10 because to be 2 or 1, it would need to be at least five hours long or more than Kelly LeBrock.
