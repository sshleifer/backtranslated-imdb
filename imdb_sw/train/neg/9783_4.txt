Not the worst movie I saw but not very good either. I am a color-colored player, I played a lot of airplane and went from the trees to the airplane was quite a big change. The movie shows the same quality First of all the movie starts with this team which seems to try to hit this "Phantom" guy or whatever, they seem to be a professional team and wear jerseys and shoot mags, autocockers. One boy is playing bushy games. It's not so bad with the film but more so it seemed it was very fun. A group of boys who are good boys are wooden players who do not seem to have a lot of money and have dreams of getting the "best gun". Another team always takes them and despises them because they are playing with blah blah blah. The phantom helps these wooden children to teach them with all this trick, making them able to play the plane and defeat the whole team including "professionals". Why is it very similar to the movie? Without the budget is something big, the color of color paint can not be bad but the budget is low and the movie feels like it was done with the amateur. No big names in this film and acting it very cheesy. The color color view is too bad. They seem to imply that everyone is going to speed with all other tricks. It was just a lousy film in my opinion and does not give a realistic view of what color of color. To be a true color color is not all friends, it's a lot to fight with the bonus "click" and play with the rules. Don't look at this film and then expect to go to the "4 is 1!"
