Written and directed by Neil Young, "Greendale" is more than 87 minutes of video music set on the doxen or also of the author's work. Instead of talk, the film only depends on the Young lyrics, which are very well fitted with social definitions, telling "stories" when actors perform events. As a result of hammy's photo exhibition, the effect is similar to the young people playing some movies at home and expelling them to public use. Although it is alleged to be a "story" that runs through the film, we do not know what is going to thank you so much for watching without interest in the film, the lack of dialogue and the ignorance of the acting acting. All we get for thirty-seven minutes is a group of aging hippies by screaming through an unfamiliar story while Young songs are playing in the last voice on the sound. The whole thing turns out to be an exciting exercise for self. "Greendale" offers off-Hollywood, a small movie budget-doing bad name.
