this was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I still don't know if it was bad, or just satire. One of the films that use every fool who takes pictures that they can think of. Arrrgh. Don Johnson was very good in it. But otherwise it is turned on. It was more than 10 years ago that I saw it, but it still hurts and won't stop in my brain. <br /> <br /> The last line in the film actually counts how stupid. I will not destroy you, you should try the effort to watch this film. But I assure you the time * the * end, and the few in the middle. If you have nothing good to do, and you would like to mention and laugh, then maybe it may be worth your time. Additionally, if you have to go on a date with someone who is not very interested, suggest watching this film together, and maybe leave it alone after seeing it. That's the best price to pay, I think.
