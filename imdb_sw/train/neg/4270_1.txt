This is another odd and irrelevant dreck of Hollywood. Kurt Russell, like snake snakes in a business suit, assures me that he was the best baseman. Ray Liotta as a psychologist is completely predictable and mysterious. Madeline Stowe is a personal cardboard, and makes it a bit of a victim to persuade. <br /> <br /> Every area in this destruction is completely predictable all the way to the end when Kurt plays Ray with an instrument or object, knocking him down and out. Kurt and Madeline then make their final end of the movie agree, and everyone â€” except Russell and Stowe, KNOWS Liotta will come again and destroy the couple again. <br /> <br /> She does, of course, and Russell beat 10 times with her 9mm, which was necessary without unnecessary. This film can also be ended with a bludgeoning area --- Finda dotes of Hollywood on unwanted violence, and more can add, or "strengthen", more than the slobbery they get.
