The movie is just fun as it looks sunny.Sheriff Pataki is a total retard that likes something better than sitting on its fat back making a smoke ring from his puffy cigarette and booze drink when the doctor does like a zombie version of Nicholas Cage stimulates what is called "Blood "which actually looked like the fruit of the punch. Most of the programs seemed to be even worse to call this part of the movie. Some of the characters in this film are total waste of time, the end is bad, the details were fun, and the events were terrible. What else should tell the audience out there? My advice will be getting your Rabies shot if you have already watched the movie. This movie can give you foam in the mouth if you did not get your up-to-date shots.
