Oh dear ... as a British, with a small part of Welsh, a fan of the work of Anthony Hopkins in the industry ... so far, I am desperate. You see I am not a person, who had the best hope. So my opinion is like 'leaves in the wind'. But, is that not so? - I do not have a grinding axis for the business value. I, a full member of a large distribution, go to see the film to be sent elsewhere. And yes, stand up for a moment. But it is not a state of unbelief. If this is provided by an unknown author and director, I would like to think that this 'production' would be experiencing trouble. Unfortunately, not, and I was left with many eyes and frustration. After seeing some of the rave reviews given this job I am very worried .... \ t Regardless of the author, director, studio or even verification of content. <br /> <br /> I advise, like many before me: Do not write and guide the production. It's full of danger. Movies need to be considered in order to maintain the image of loyalty. <br /> <br /> As they say in school reports "It is possible and can do well ..."
