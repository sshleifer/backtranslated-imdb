I did not think this movie was worth any bad script, the worst acting except for Janine Turner, no fantasy, stupid conspiracy, dumb husband and a divorce divorce right. If you have never seen this movie before standing it is never appropriate. The only good thing about it is that Janine Turner, did a good job to do. Terry's husband is stuck on a smart-ass of assassination that has won many cases and even found false killers. She thinks she is smart but really is just a nut. Her best friend has a relationship with her husband and betray her. Good girl huh. Well he is a real peach, not. No day beach either.
