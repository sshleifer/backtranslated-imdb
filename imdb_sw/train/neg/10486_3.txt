My main opinion on this film is how Zwick could find honest actors working on this film? Cast? even for helpers, no one that helps this movie really. I must admit though, Tom Hank's comeo almost made it worth it? what was about Tom? Did you lose a bet? The best comeo of the cinema was Joe Isuzu though - for a classic distance! Cluster is good. The character of Basinger, struggling to be as a Pink woman, makes her way to the Vegas motel for the motel that brings the glory of the cosmetic sales of cosmetics. This happens if Corbett's behavior is on the way to Vegas to give Elvis's suit for a short time that the former wife was encouraged by what else? When both of them are on the way, many of them and Elvis fighters are going to Elvis's meeting in Vegas. Recently, the FBI is participating and begins to monitor what they think is the Elvis winner. Unfortunately, the premise does not mean the movie was good. When you watch this film, think you're back in the first class? while the story lines and promotions are not very important. It is the most amazing thing to look just Basinger to look beautiful in her Lady Lady dress instead of asking why what she does does really mean. The movie tries hard, but it finally falls through a short way. Finally, it is filled with ideas that may be theoretically funny but in practice it was not funny. <br /> <br /> It's not worse, but you can get yourself feel like leaving the building while watching this one? Don't say no warning!
