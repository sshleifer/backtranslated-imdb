This is not a great film like a big children's budget budget. As far as I can say, the villain is a big ass of espresso beans covered with chocolate. This theory seems to have been confirmed by the fact that headlines refer to 'Insomnia'. When the first mention was that civilization had been destroyed by sleep, I thought "Wow! Nihilistic military film!" but no luck. Although you should take into account the experimental film when the ignorant is bound with long, white hair. The Zu people make the same amount of meaning if the subtitles are on or off. That's not a good sign. I saw special effects being somewhere between Ray Harryhausen and Xena: Warrior Princess. Primitive.
