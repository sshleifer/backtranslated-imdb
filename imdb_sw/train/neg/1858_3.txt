The Serial murderer dies in the snow of the snow and gets mixed in the worst of the Frosty's Snowman. Then it continues to kill killings. Interesting plan. Sounds scary. And it's terrible. If you are five years old. Otherwise, it's kind of cheesy. I saw it on the cable and I'm glad I didn't have to pay money to see it. It has a charm and style of a small movie budget that can be a cult film. I am sure it has a reliable fan base somewhere. I'm not just in it. Even though I didn't like the whole movie, there were incidents that I found exciting. Such as the bathroom area and post-bursting area with Picasso memory. It was also enjoyable to see many ways the heroes are trying to kill Jack and he doesn't seem to want to die. In short, "Jack Frost" is a good comedy under budget B-movie, but the worst fear of the B-movie budget.
