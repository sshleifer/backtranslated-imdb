Because 'cruelty' will be the only word available to describe the purpose of the creators of these films. When do you start? In the spout of bchiness, I will start with the worst job of almost everyone in this movie. Delete it. Almost not in that sentence. I can't even imagine one person who was shown well. Although, for all rights, it would be almost impossible to describe these characters of zero tests through success. However, the girl who played Katherine (whose name does not include - I pretend to be missing) is still one of the worst actors I ever seen, just to get to someone who played Sebastian. The story was a bad God. It tried a transparent glass which was first but failed in many ways. In particular, every part of it was meaningless - though I will admit (boldly) that the plot of the plot was very good to its surprise. And the latter was at least a little humorous. But this film is there and the worst I saw. Don't look at it. Not only. There is no value in looking at it. Nothing. It takes only the first fun.
