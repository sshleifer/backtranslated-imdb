Quirky, self, exhibition, Christian Slater - these are all the teasers that make me expect to spend an hour or so "discover" the film's core. Boy, I was desperate. Julian Po has not found it on himself. The film can't feel. I found myself unable to stop even unbelief. Preliminary, previews, the best previews, clear exhibition displays, additional input, clear-display displays - well, you get an idea. <br /> <br /> Allegories do not need to be sent a sledge style hammer. And it's hard to feel anything for Julian Po because we don't know a lot about it. Foolish girl, village capital, religious pastor, childless children - why anyone, especially anyone with long-term desire to reach the sea (the behavior of Slater), decides to stay in such a bad place?
