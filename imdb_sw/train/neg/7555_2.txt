Do not let the premise be a fool - this was one funny movie. The problem - didn't think it was comedy. This story puts you in a better place that has never been. If worse, set-up is not described. You will leave the theater asking "Do you?" I only exceed 2 because there was only a short time of promise, but that ended it completely leaving you flat. Nicholas Cage did a good job as it could be expected in the role, but he had very little to work with. There are odd quirks, and interesting turns everywhere, which had nothing to do with the movie. Let this come from the video before you lose your money.
