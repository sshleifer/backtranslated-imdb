Everything about this film is the washing of pigs. Acting compassion, bad conversation, bad girls. This movie enters into trouble !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The director must be the final bender of the week. Robert C. is completely lost and has no clue about what's going on. Children of college are worse. There is no talent to act at all, to think very stupid, and just under the right dumbbells. Special effects are on the plane. The so-called security near the park is in the country of toy: with guns looking guns, walkie talkies which are free; and a computer system with a layer of toilet paper. if the reserves are under construction and no work; why sadly welcome potential customers until everything is completed. The authors should be the first victims of aggression with producers and workers. The entire film is on the septic sea field on another planet to watch. What's the gem. Faithful should look at this, so they can commit suicide.
