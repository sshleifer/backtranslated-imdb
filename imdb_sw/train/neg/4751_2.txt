First of all I saw the trailer of the teaser Wendy Wu, I was very happy. Brenda's words, one of the most hot girls on Disney Channel, would be performing military art and I was well and so ... until I saw the movie. The action was not well built, the film could not have anyone, the fighting was untrue and played ... with the plot. If you think so much is a wannabe Buffy boy, a girl who is a granddaughter of other fighters who were women, a girl wants to ignore her call and wants to be a queen wife, a guardian whose worm prepared for a great anti-evil. The idea is not just the original, the film is wasting time.
