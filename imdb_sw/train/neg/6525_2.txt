I gave this movie 2, and though I thought it was a fan of false science, I found this film very difficult to take seriously. It was on the AMC one night, and I'm glad I saw it for free. This film is suitable for a few, but not more. Special effects are average of time - not bad, but not great, either. Of course we know more about Mars now than we did at the time, but we can't hold it against this film. The main reason I don't like this movie is because of the story. There were several parts of this film that I wanted would be considered more deeply - a state of injury / state of astronaut, a city of Mars, a creature in the lake, etc. In general, the movie is a long part The 1960's External Limits edition - complete with the end of cheesy.
