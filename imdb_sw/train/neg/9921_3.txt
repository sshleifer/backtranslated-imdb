Behind the hippie of the Strummer was the revelation, but this generally felt like a violation. Fire fires work best around the flames of fire. There were many anecdotes of old half-boring friends and many photos of filling. I love Clash and Joe to compete again and sell their songs so far (FU Mick Jones), but this doc has left me wantingâ€¦ and more related. Using hot flaming fires without proper explanation of who tells you that anecdote loses a viewer to some extent. They should be interviewed alone. Even the voice of the 'DJ radio' of Strummer did not have a bit to connect the film together. And can anyone describe all the flags flying behind the fire pictures? After the amazing "Filth And Fury" I expected the Temple could give. Joe Strummer doc should be the best.
