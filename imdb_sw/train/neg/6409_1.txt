I saw this film yesterday ... I can't believe the comments on this site. Those who give up on one star should be Buffy Traders. Well, I am a buffy fan of the first, but I know the trophies when I see it. With each level, this film is awesome. Technically, most of the time you do not know where this film, even in one place, jumps to POV as mad without reason. There is no log in the video words. Emotional it is heavy because of anger and tries to be a psychological thriller when it combines it. Throw red red lesions in your movie is a way to show "sky". I went out for a long time before the last act, but I was very happy with my friends making MST3K riffs to turn it off. Since dropping Buffy, SMG has been eaten by two successful movies, even if the "Scooby Doo" list on your resume can count. Gellar is a good actor, but he (or his agent) certainly can't find a car. And Mr. Shepard, if you have trouble paying your mortgage, I'll send you a few bucks if you promise to appear on this film again! (Also, the property of Patsy Cline should accuse him for deletion!)
