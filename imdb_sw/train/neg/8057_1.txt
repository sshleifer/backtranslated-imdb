What is wrong with this film? Many things, a lot. The editor tries to look good, and doesn't do anything except mixing the viewer while also giving it to the head of the power head. This layout is full and long from what started as a story (film or film). The layout only makes for a minute less than ten minutes of good news, and this is mentioned by pain up to a small height of the feature film. We all know what happens to things when we put them, right? Exactly. They get thin. In the end, the plot is just a thin paper that you can even lose, if you don't care, which is hard to do while watching this film. Acting is not good at all. The characters are not well written and do not recommend. One of the worst things that are not recommended by this film is that it seems, anyone who was in touch / sound was not aware of what the movie was, or what it should be about (not that I blame him, t think just either). As a result, half of the music in the film is not recommended at all. Also, what was under sex between Eliza Dushku and the main character? Usually, this was to attract young men, but it was very easy. And did the first place have anything to do with the whole film? On any level considered? What? Two angry women did not seem to have anything to do with the film at all, they were just there to enjoy the events. I doubt anyone who will enjoy the film and put together with an amazing and awesome trial of Hollywood as an interesting attempt. But I digress. I recommend this to young observers who are unaware of the most horrific feeling of horror as long as there is sex and get into it (though that may be true for the Killer County, which I saw). 1/10
