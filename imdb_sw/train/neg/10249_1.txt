What can I say about this film except "don't see it". I waited and waited and waited for a moment (or anything) would happen and didn't just come. Look as if two people are walking while keeping a record of more screens on one film. What are they doing? Do they solve the mystery? Are they collecting signs? Possibly, it's hard to tell. At the end of the film, after many radio signals have been rejected (as opposed to PET track) and this gives some lectures, the plot is unlocked and deleted as soon as possible. Some visitors want to return to their home cottage and are very happy that they want to beat the world (I think they don't like to share assets). I think my finishing to publish and see their work of 35 minutes or art (trash!) And decide that they will allow the destroyers to turn them into a 88-minute film. only.
