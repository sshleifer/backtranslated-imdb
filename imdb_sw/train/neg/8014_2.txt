"I've known" Tigers of Wildlife. "It will only show in the big cities, be sure. It is one of these SO SO films, that it is not worth what to do, except for the director! I love those! And all the oh-way-alternative / artsy people are trying to DESPERATELY get" model ". in what earned horses hit. <br /> <br /> There was no plot, no story, no morals, no chronology, and no amusing or even touching. To me, it was a plot of collective events that had nothing to do and another person, and they were all to "show" to show how "art" and "see" they could get. It was a barrier to another young movie, but did not mark each level of humanity as possible. Then rolling credits! I was waiting to do SENSE I waited "good place." I have about 60 independent films on my DVD collection, many of which can be called "art films". You can't be among them. see this film, even if you buy it on a DVD.
