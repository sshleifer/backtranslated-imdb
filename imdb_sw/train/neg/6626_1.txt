I saw the film and I died, because the film was stupid and provocative. I thought the ram gopal varma would work his work but unfortunately failed and the whole film was destroyed and destroyed "sholay". The members and staff were bad. The entire hall slept while watching some film people ran in the middle. The work of amithab bachan is poor, I thought this movie will hit the biggest of the year but this film will be a great flop of the year, certainly. no one has done justice for their work, including Ajay devagan. This film is not suitable for any audience. I bet that this film will define. "IN YOUR MOVIE TRAINING"
