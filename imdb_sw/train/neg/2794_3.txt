Well, because I am a musician I thought, maybe I'm going to look at this movie on TMC, nothing else is good. One of the worst mistakes of my life so far, and only half has been done. I thought it was one of those basic basic movies and crappy plot and acting crappy, crappy efficiency and crappy effects. But not, I even get the joy of it. Even "musicians" were not very good. I was hoping maybe some laugh, but I didn't know if they were trying to throw in one liners or not. But now I have to sit here and look at the rest just to the start of Fiction Pulp. Or maybe something better. And now I stay here to write until I have 10 lines
