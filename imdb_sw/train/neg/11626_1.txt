This may be the worst display I've ever seen. In addition to the destruction of having sitcom on Hitler, it is not just interesting or entertaining in any way. It is similar to the 1950's sitcom in its humorous cornball and emerging situations, but when it can be done as well as in I Love Lucy, it's not just funny here. I think the show was based around "look, Hitler as a takumbling sitcom figure" but only fell flat in every issue. Hitler's boyfriend is hammy that difficult to sit by alone. I wonder what is possible to make the internet think this was a good idea for the air. I thought America had an unpleasant show, but Brits beat us this time. America will not have a mistake about Hitler, though we had a show on the slave of Lincoln, the Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer. Space may never show this display, as it was shown only one place and may never be released on a DVD.
