Carl Panzram lived an extraordinary life and wrote his memoirs on pieces of paper for the possibility of a single person who had ever done anything without love. The book "Panzram: Journal of Murder" by Thomas E. Gaddis and James O. Long, which came from the best of centuries after the death of Panzram, gives a historical status to the first-generation US account to run home to the west and be The cowboy, getting caught, thrown into the boy's house, departure from time to time and thrown into prison at all times tortured and exploited. If Panzram grew big and strong, he tried to take revenge on the wrongs he had done while he was traveling to South America, Europe and Africa, and it didn't matter the people who had stolen, stolen, or killed because we all mean this film takes James Woods with a bad neck like a bad neck , bunda-meaning, bitch son Carl Panzram who is in the film is a "drunkard", very powerful and emotionally, and who has never mentioned. The joy of sodomizing men and boys. The film does not describe anything else in particular about the traveler of the world and a prisoner of work (like robbing former Taft President or being released from Oregon's prison for a long time only gave his word back). In short, I don't think Carl would be very happy.
