*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Continued ... <br /> <br /> From here on the entire movie falls into it. First we meet a sharp plan and the signs we get ghosts and vampires and waswolves and so on. We get a guy with a priority that was slow to talk of endless litter, "two ghosts" that do not use the real purpose and do not always behave with a group of people who want. Someone told me it was vampires (straight out of Blade 2), but they didn't know I didn't recognize it. The proposed boy and the name of ignorance has the same difficulty as Oracle, for a long time and far away. He has a simple explanation of the reasons and effect, it does, and then keeps doing it and doing it until it is caused by stupid. His last line before walking is comparable to the storm "you know what happens to the fabric ..." the line of people of X at the worst levels of evil. Chocolate cakes are sluggish, cliche of pathetic and Monica Bellucci if the wife did nothing but exactly what we expect when we see her. <br /> <br /> Then we get another kung fu fight !!! WHAT? Neo, allegedly, One. He can do anything. He has great power and uses it. Kung aggressive blood all the time. And when he can stop 1000 bullets, he is still cut by the sword and still makes the food of the uncertainty pastor (5). I wanted to see the power of mind. I wanted to see him make wild, more mad *** for people because he could do nothing. I have been the same as before 'wow'. <br /> <br /> The fabled car expels. That can't be bad. Okay ... no, not. Not only what we've been tyold will be. All cool shots from this area are located on the trailer. Each one. So all Wow may have been taken from us so all we get now is a good sequence and, guess what, fight kung fu !!! Well, it's not Neo, but you would think he could describe his new friends about the Matrix truth. At least he taught them something. It's not hard. "Hey, Morpheus, don't worry about what is happening to you in the matrix. It's not true. As far as you know there is nothing true then nothing can harm you." There's going there. Simple. Well, so expelling is not bad. It is never available and it doesn't look like 16 minutes. It's just pretending. And yet, it gets worse. <br /> <br /> Last end for the movie is probably the worst. They have this complete plan involving three employees. They then show only the gentleness of the longest of Morpheus, the highest preachers, the ruler. To make the situation worse, they do not clearly understand this plan that you need 3 teams. You know basically, but you don't know who is doing what, when, so when one employee goes down it doesn't help and you don't know how this will affect what's going on. <br /> <br /> I will count, though, happens so the Trinity can return to the Matrix to set up the end. That's the only reason it happens. Which raises the question, why did they need to send 6 people first? The trinity comes within five minutes to himself! The Neo Journey between the Matrix (to say) is dealt with similarly to lazily. Oohhh !!! She runs in one of Smith 100! Woooooo !!! That should be taken a lot of thought. Now only those on the belt to fight no standard and are over time. Man, it's a great finale !!! And then Builder! <br /> <br /> Remember everything I said is bad about Oracle and the foreign man? Add them and make it twice, that's how the builder says. The only potential of him is about establishing the cliffhanging climax. <br /> <br /> And then it blows! Let's look at the Neo option. Choose one door and all people die (except 27 !!!). Choose another and all humanity dies !!! Considering the choice is something that this film tries to explore does not give the same hero. If he had a choice of humanitarian park and missus to die or Save the missus and kill humanity there is a potnetial for domestic suffering and tension. Also, with the Trinity being the center of the fall, the ability of a real cliffhanger that would have made the most important to see three. But no. He has saved no one or saved a missus. Now, the worst thing about the original Matrix was Neo death and then back to the end of life. A perverse year everyone was very angry and how Jar Jar was ignorant that the end of Matrix made him look at Steven Hawking. "Oracle told me I would like to One, and I love you" .... Come! What? The whole world has lost how horrible? What does Wachowski do in a series? Well, they make the end of the original look better. How? Well, to do almost one thing again (just swapping characters) just so bad I think my fa and r keys would be worn as I continue to write off before I was bad. <br /> <br /> And the cliffhanger is not just a cliffhanger. It's a reminder. Basically, this film is just bad. In fact I didn't want to be bad, but it's. Bad in many ways. And doing the worst things, this is not a budget that is not enough. It's not a very short film. It's not a film that has run out. It's not a film where great influence has come from outside. This is a particular film Wachowski planned to make and fortune Warner fully behind them. And that's what makes this so bad. At least Rancid Aluminum can say that there was no time or money available. Matrix Reloaded. The worst movie ever made? Probably not. The despair and erase film that has been made. It is not available. <br /> <br />
