My wife and I had great hope for this film, but it was a great desire. It was the original version of America's Magoo. A compassionate father who fails everything he tries to. fishing, hunting, obviously deals with his family for its wild fantasies. His "vision" is not only ridiculous but in the process he sleeps with his son often on different things. Words cannot describe how bad this film is. Children and wife are realistic that makes the film worse. I don't have a sense of humorâ€¦ unless you like to laugh at other people who are making their own fool. I don't know how this can come to the prize. Save your bucks, not the rental value.
