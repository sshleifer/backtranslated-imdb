This film should be the worst I saw. The name of the film deceives the audience in thinking there is perhaps hope. The most relevant film line of all time, and the act is just poor. The name 'Zombie Nation' refers to the number of zombies when there are actually six. This can not be divided as a terrible movie due to the introduction of cheesy 80 music when the zombies attack. The zombies actually talk and act like human beings in the film and the only distinction to make that looks like something out of La Roux video. If you have the opportunity to buy this film and then do it, then copy it.
