A small script, the development of a small character, a small camera. Long-range incidents, high headaches cause jerky zoom, high-level actors in the forest to do something. Until you shine on a 12: 12 evening screen, you can move forward with nothing, because there are three hunters that we don't know about doing anything. In order to be fair, the film has a string music which was interesting, so maybe a music video would be a way to go with this. Unfortunately this was not there, and what was supposed to be a few minutes of twenty minutes is placed more than faith. Forget about "Trigger Man", I know I'm trying. - MERK
