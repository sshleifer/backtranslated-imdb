I was looking at this film according to the preview and making it received, but after watching it I was very disappointed. Slums are a completely hidden film mixed with Todd Solondz's kind of awesome family without Todd's. The story comes along with every area is worse than the last. Maybe I lost that, but if this film is an example of every girl's growing experience I am happy to be a person.
