After hearing the raves about this film for years, I finally decided to hire and watch. Let me begin by saying that I'm happy that renting was free from the local library. This step was slow, stimulating, untrue and conspiracy. After 2 hours, I had just crossed the city of Texas in Texas and put the group of characters out of their misery. I realize that the taste is self-sufficient, but I believe, I don't know all the sounds I heard about this film. Dallas gave a good description of life in Texas as this movie. Buy only if you want to understand how film studios can pay enough money to viewers to convince people that the movie is bad.
