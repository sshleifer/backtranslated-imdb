If you are a kind of movie-goer who enjoys the original content and suspicion of mind ... then look elsewhere, children, causes Sleepwalkers really sucks. Usually I am more sharp than that, but ... wow ... this was bad. I love it especially when Charles gives Tanya a trip to his home, decreases, and then appears to go home. Where is his car? Otherwise, not just, people. I really want to be more special, but the words flee. Cat flying over the people. The boy is being maimed. Cheesey describes the proverbial "idea". Not just see. Waiting, I take back! Look for Stephen Stephen's author to come as a boy who owns a tomb. He is very good. Even with the appearance of visitors and Mark Hamill and Ron Perlman, the King gives the best performance of the film. But, beyond that ... wow ... BAD.
