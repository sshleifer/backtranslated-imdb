Well, unfortunately I've got this DVD and I found it was very bad. First, the characters exploit. I mean, come, as a dork one in a orange hat who calls himself 'Orange Sherbert' is the best idea of ​​these creative guys can come to character, then they should definitely be in the area of ​​making a film. Bad sanctions "," bad interviews ", and essentially no" wrestler "one on all this disk and beaten with any charisma. <br /> <br />" Fight "in Splatter Rampage Wrestling is not more than these idiots gently and playfully They bouncing together on the trampoline. They make sure they combine together all the time, too, and make the experience as possible as during childbirth than "death fight war" <br /> <br /> Basically, Splatter Rampage Wrestling is a good attack attack Just behind the wrestling clone. Only, instead of blood, weapons, violence, and WRESTLING, we get a trampoline, an interesting child, a voice of TERRIBLE, and another person called Orange Sherbert. Try this DVD.
