I chose this video after reading the text on the box, the story seemed to be good, and it was Keanu Reeves! But after 5 minutes of watching, I noticed how frightening her acting, she walks and chat so stupid at all, it's fake and not to lobby. It is not there, almost all the actors are doing so very badly, the only acceptable work was by Alan Boyce (David), but that man commits suicide and never sees him again, you can't even know why he did it! Everything about this movie hits low quality, I can't believe how that thing is offered! I was tried many times to stop watching, I actually did, half of that way I decided to stop looking and turn it around, I came to the IMDB to look at what other ideas about it, I saw a zero view (not surprised), so I decided to insist on dealing with pain and returning to finish then come here to comment on it. The only thing to go (for me) was the head of the Rock Rock school, constantly playing guitar and singing, but that's not good. <br /> <br /> Acting bad and leading ... bad movie.
