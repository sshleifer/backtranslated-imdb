Chesty gringo Telly Savalas (as Frank Cooper) is a US-Mexico "Border Cop". He is the example of the father to Danny De La Paz a small migrant (like Benny Romero), who wants Mr. Savalas to be the best person in his expected wedding. Savalas is hard, but Eddie Albert (as Moffat Commander) can be more difficult. Worse is what you need to stop striker Michael V. Gazzo (like Chico Suarez). Solidarity may come out. If you have the possibility of hearing "Kojak" and "Oliver Douglas" to announce the stimulation to be deformed, you should stop the "Border". If not, you may not have a stomach for "true" area of ​​the bull. Although it does not last to be very valuable, Mr. De La Paz and Cecilia Camacho (as Leina) steal the show.
