Similar this film had a terrible premise. To be bad according to the films that they had experienced in the surgery, they still have money to buy big robots and beat them. Each country decides rather than investing in building their country, rather than fighting with robots no one can afford. Here is the best idea, it depends on our many resources, malware, to fight our battles. Everyone says about the director, what about him. She makes a good film, makes a bad movie. There is no reason to give this movie credit because of the director, perhaps he was asleep? I really enjoyed this film, because it was so fun and ignorance I was laughing. In fact I had a good time to look at it, well without a cowboy consultant who turns out to be a killer (believe no one will see this person as a killer, so it's a surprise, however it's a disability) What kind of training jungle training jim. I was sad to see that Mst3k did not do this. I give a rating of two stars however because there is nothing that can be as bad as "manos hands of fate." Budget does not matter, I have seen many suitable movies that have no budget as a cube. The story of the story has never disappeared and I found it best to act in school games. Surly could have been eleven years old from play between middle school. Get it, it's a fun movie to watch.
