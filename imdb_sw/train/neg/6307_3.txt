I will give you just 3 because it showed the history we need to know about, to prevent it from happening again. I agree with comments from the gentleman from Britain. Movie was very good. All pieces, no real plot. Historical and technical Inaccuracies have increased. Check out the technical specs on DE 529, or any of the Everts Attack attackers, and you'll see what I'm saying. I now have its black history of the United States, and Im will be called the only racist by saying this, but this ship's history is not great. They did the escort work, dismissing the "submarine" that happened to be the hulk they had made. Sorry, but black people did more in WWII then this silly movie gives them credit. This film makes them like whiners. Let the name begin, I'll be able to handle.
