It looked at this on DVD in native language and English registration. If the subtitling was too bad or the real dialogue does not have many stories and give any character development. There are few HK stars in this but the film does not like their presence to be better or worse. It's just bad. Colorful colors and colors made on CG are attractive to white and beautifully colored but can be a burden before long. If anything makes me think of a child's movie and its unusual barrage of cg, fight with scenes, and plot crap. I am sure I realized what was happening in the film but the whole story was very good.
