I can't believe I lost my time with this movie. I couldn't even call it movies. It was very bad without suggesting. I love the low budget movies and powerful flicks but this is what I made bored. The worst job and the worst act made it furious. You wonder what these people thought when they spent money to produce this film. I wonder what I was investigating to the end. I recommend this film to anyone. What? How did they do this? Are there viewers who like this type of film? You must exist because you can find this next to any video store. But why <br /> <br /> deserves to be forgotten. <br /> <br /> If you like bad movies this is for you.
