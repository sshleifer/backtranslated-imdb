The words leave me. <br /> <br /> And that's not normal. Well done this could be good, funny spoof B-movie sci-fi, but sadly, it didn't have to be. Regularly in the theater are the most skilled actors who are very hard and innocent with dogs such as breakfast. I can only approve the opinion of the original auditor - go to the clean bathroom. Really do everything except watching this film. <br /> <br /> Good: The nose of Lucy Beeman. Error: Everything else. The most interesting line: "This does not go anywhere". If every plastic surgeon can meet that fate.
