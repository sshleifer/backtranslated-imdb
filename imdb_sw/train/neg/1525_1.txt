I watched this weekend as if nothing was over, it would be more entertaining to chew my feet and probably not painful. I urge anyone to look at this just to see how the movie may be bad, it really was deliberate. I am calling every attempt without a fun, so incredible way, which was so bad that it was not of faith. This is the film that makes Spiceworld look like Goodfellas, I think I have no? Do well during air and think again. Fear, quite terrible. If this was not a prank then the director and any other person involved with this should be removed and beaten after being forced to watch this film again.
