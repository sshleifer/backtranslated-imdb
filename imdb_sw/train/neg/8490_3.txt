This was a good attempt on something but it is very proud and it stimulates an increase in low budget activities. The use of actual sets works but for some points it fails to sadly. They used well a small budget I think. I just want the story and most of the acting was the best. There are many places where you can see what they were ringing and would be good if they hit those but they didn't. The story of confusion and distrust. Also bad DVD transfer. It is not good for me to watch the film in one session. This I had to close. It was very scary. I can make movies slow. But just get them out of some feature. Visual, wisdom-wise, acting, etc. This was reduced in all departments so it has never been added to experience. Perhaps the second attempt of the film manufacturer will be better.
