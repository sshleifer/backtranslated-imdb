It got this in the IFC yesterday, and can't believe the good views! Did I alone have thought these "women" were anything? Kate tells Jed that he can run because he thinks he is a social pillar, but he throws him out! Then they decide to be lovers? And she has been very destroyed on her death, she does not go to her funeral, at least, to tell her family "good news"! By the way, how did America come to be the head of a good UK school? Janine should be fleeing the power of misuse of her power, but nothing happens! And she wind up the boffing con she entered for questioning! And little said about Molly, the best! <br /> <br /> For Janine and Molly's guilt you feel on Jed, please! It's the fault of the big punk itself turned out to be the road! Where is the crime on the poor Gerald, who gets puked on? If I can just do the same with bozos behind this "movie"!
