** HERE BE SPOILERS ** <br /> The government has continued to develop the UniversalSoldier program, now called UniSol. The soldiers are now strong and can take more damage than ever before. However, the government has slowed down, this project is risky and a large mix of all of them feel, so it takes action to ensure its own safety. He is persuading them to control UniSols and start running. The only person who can leave is Deveraux (Van Damme). <br /> <br /> This movie is about one thing. The planned fighting. The story is bad, and recently closed in all fights. Whatever happens, and wherever they go, they fight. Unfortunately for this film, it's not fun to watch a war where you know one part of it can't be damaged. Typically you are certainly a hero will win, but you still want to feel the fight between the two fighters alike. It is not where a person can not perish and can not lose. Then the fight becomes just a stretch of time. You wait until the final clash when Deveraux demonstrates the way to beat his invincible enemies. To reduce my opinion further, the sign of despair and uncertainty of the worst movie is how much to cover women hide. In fact, not many of them, because the characters are many people (there is at least one woman UniSol though), but almost every woman is shown without unnecessary and at least one bra at once. The woman leads to this, but we also go through a trap club (using less computers) and more unscathed women. These times do not give any story and there is just trying to try the boy's boyfriend. <br /> <br /> So, in conclusion, the boring struggle. No more, no less. Maybe, maybe down ... <br /> <br /> 2/10
