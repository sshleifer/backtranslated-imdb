From Star "MITCHELL", From the director of "Joysticks" and "Angel's Revenge" !!! These are trademarks that can prevent me from seeing this film. And the worst part is that all the information mentioned above is true !!! Ugghhh ... Joe Don Baker eats every five minutes in this film. It's like the bad remake of the "Bluff of Coogan"
