If it was not enough for those around the time already, we have here at the center of the GODFATHER from the director of IL CONSIGLIORI (1973) which I had looked at earlier this year. The marque value is closed at this time is Telly Savalas who comes into the case regularly and looks back, instead trying his flowers and wearing beret in the style of French authors! Apart from not looking at Sicilian down, he games no emphasis on any kind except his drawl draw. Antonio Sabbath, then, makes for an invincible gangster - far from being able to lead; His relationship with Savalas, who becomes a father to the eyes of the eyes, also does not know (especially since he feels romantic with the last boyfriend)! Besides, for a gangster group, there is a very important point of talking with no one but it is possible to be remembered (though the clinic put in the clinic is well maintained); Additionally, Francesco De Masi scores are used but nothing else. Unfortunately, the basement-basement DVD I rented will begin in the middle via credits so that none of the members cast - or even the film title - always listed!
