There is nothing new here. All the romantic-comedy attributes, even under the taxi sprinting to the airport to stop the woman from flying away. The only thing to preserve this is the act of Alison Eastwood & some of the little characters (blink and you miss Gabrielle Anwar), who certainly was happy. Turn off when the pair is happy, and you will not have to go through the inevitable pain.
