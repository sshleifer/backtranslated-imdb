The World's view in the film which has been done by NASA recently compared to historical weather data at Apollo 11, and show a good match between the direction of the cloud in the video sequence and the real rainfall record that day. This may seem to undermine the entire point shown on the film which the "Worldwide" picture is a small part of the planet laid by the spacecraft window. I'm waiting for Bart Sibrel now claiming that historical weather data is caused by NASA, although of course it will certainly involve them and also replace each of the copies of the magazine stored with weather maps, and those those with personal hands are still a problem. Ah, answer: "Trying to despise this film by mentioning NASA's weather data I would like to be a pleasant, but powerful and wasteful argument. Footage and evidence in the movie? one said something about mosquito swing and swallowing a camel. Do you in any way feel that this might be used for what you are trying to do here? :-) This film is full of uncertain evidence against the claims made by the US government to be a message The month was successful, and the man is now the true masters of the world. The objects are almost never seen. Just look at the movie, and I lovers say you will see different things than before. ‚ÄùFirst, the weather conditions do not come from NASA , it comes to organizations that have met all over the world. Secondly, weather data weakens serious claims in the film. Third, apart from being "full of uncertainties", the remaining claims in the film are completely destroyed. The original piece of secret, so edited it and added its own interpretation. Unfortunately for him, his source film is a public domain, and Sibrel's bits have been altered against his claim.
