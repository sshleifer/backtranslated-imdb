I like to kill the germs The Philippians are very happy to see, I had to watch this film as it was one of my favorite books by Shaun Hutson. I have met him and I would like to hear him as this film was as horrible as he said it was, after saying that I was still dying to see how bad it was / was and for gruesomely, and no one has a clue what that reason is. The only health worker Mike Brady has a possible solution, but his theory of the killer slugs laugh with the authorities. Only when the body count begins to lift and a slug expert from the UK begins to spread around and begins to appear as Mike had the correct idea after all. <br /> <br /> This game is to win more than you ever seen a movie! Slugs in this movie are fast (Then normal) and looks like they distribute the speed of events! This video is not like a book at all, the book was more than ten times, ten times more and it had more stories! I didn't like this movie completely! As I am a great fan of book slugs and second book so-called so-called ground! Two books are Great <br /> <br /> Read the book and watch the film, you can love more then I give 2 out of 10
