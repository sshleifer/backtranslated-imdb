Two films are useful for misleading people to God, this and 'End of the Event'. One has an important and hurtful message, another is like one-dimensional as a religious movie can get. Unfortunately Paul Anderson continued with the Sacred Sacrifice movies, he had something that was going. The nightmare in the night is not restricted by many clear films of the free film (acting, story, dialogue, and influence) and it is obvious that the purpose of the film is from the beginning. The Christian film industry has not learned from the failure of this, so we hold on to Omega, Left, and other stress movies. Their basic feature is that they are very concerned about selling their messages: "Get saved, people!" that every second thing to convince the audience on the head and the Bible. Overall, I can't believe I even write a lot about this movie is not effective. Skip and go back to Sam Neil playing out of his eyes. 1 out of 5.
