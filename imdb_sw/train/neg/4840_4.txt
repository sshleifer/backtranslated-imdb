All this film should have lasted 45 minutes - maximum. Although an exciting concept / theme, it didn't grow like a story. Once the idea of ​​a brave woman (stupid?) Who was brave (cowboy?) Was brought, and this happens very early in the film, the rest goes back. The profile was not considered, and the location and politics features were ignored. There was a good understanding of the complex problems caused by soldiers in the foreign environment, and problems to distinguish between friends and enemies. But the way that the unit worked! Private displays were good, and special effects were sufficient, but not enough to overcome the lack of content.
