This was the first I had seen (far from Jafar's return) and I was considered honestly before I looked at it to be close to the original. I was shocked. <br /> <br /> Story story was, essentially, the first script with a few more characters and the situation turned out. Ariel and Eric have daughters, Melody who is dissatisfied with life on earth. He wants to be a mermaid. However, Ariel has taken her time from her daughter because she wants to protect her - and when Melody sees that she is angry and angry. And she then decides to run, and she becomes a mermaid. So she is very attractive around, and Ariel emerges to seek her as kind. <br /> <br /> Stories are not heard very bad, but clichés and repeat the situation from the first movie is just too obvious. And adding the fact that Melody, in general, very angry, and the movie is approaching failure. There is also a whole load of other new-Tip characters and Dash to be both of them. They are not so bad as the characters in them — try just imagine Timon or Pumbaa! These songs are very much needed, they do not have the same magical energy as songs from nature. Clear animation did not have a whole load of work in it - partly is jumpy, and not many ideas are used for the movement of the characters. <br /> <br /> Another advice - try to forget about the original Ariel Character when watching this film. A good, rebellious, ignorant child has 'grown up' to be a wife, wife and mother, and his mark of the red mark is closed. This is much better viewed if you have never seen nature-you have nothing to compare with. However, all for all, it would be worse - not the same as some other sequels, such as Cinderella II. But not in the same league as the original. But for your collection if nothing else but if Disney will continue as this will lose all their big fans.
