If you want to watch a real-quality film 'get' the Eden system. This amazing film should cost $ 50 to do. It sets a thin script of rows, rough rows of rows, lights and works of the camera, and a stop motion, a mache paper which is quite laughable (it looks like sometimes used a boy in a rubber suit and / or glove region for monster - all were equally terrible. All executives say their line as if they have never seen them before and read teleprompter. Special effects are more lousy ways. And the sad thing is that they hit the original head of 'Tyranasaurus Wrecks' which counts exactly what you get for 90 minutes. That is what happens when you find the bottom of the barrel you break through evil below. <br /> <br /> I loved every minute.
