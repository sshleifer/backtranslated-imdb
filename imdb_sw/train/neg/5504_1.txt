There is no reason I can understand why this film has been made. <br /> <br /> Why should Hollywood continue to delete one bad update of the next post? (Articles for sure: Mr. Magoo, The Avengers - bad!) Christopher Lloyd, who I usually enjoy, was miserably miscast in this position. His manic example of our loved ones "Uncle Martin" is quite clear that he is not happy to be near the criminal. His run, buy, grimacing and histrionics gives us no reason to keep his character except as the character of the cartoon's direction. <br /> <br /> The director must have the idea that the immediate movement, shouting the debate and "taking one" slapstick had similarities to the comedy. It seems to have told them ALL to do as they had red sores in their pants. <br /> <br /> Fault must go with a non-active script. I think the author used "It's Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World" as an example of a good script of comedy. As a manic like that classic 1963 is, it's far more than this claptrap - in fact - suddenly looks very nice to compare. <br /> <br /> What is more sad about this movie is that it should seem written written to appeal to young children. I don't know just what their children were made. Surely there is no care for the baby, the child bearing the card I know! When they had to restore "My Dear Martian", why didn't they add an incredible charm of the classic nature? Unfortunately, IMDB.com cannot focus on "zero" as a mark for its readers, that's the only point that comes to mind in describing this efficiency. One good thing that came out of this film, participants and employees were paid - I think.
