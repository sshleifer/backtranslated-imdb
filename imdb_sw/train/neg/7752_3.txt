The film refers to the sabretooth on loss in the amusement park where young people are hunting fierce hunting. Since there is no law they break into the building and begin to be killed. Deaths are cheesy and are dumb. But at least it had a better effect then sabretooth. I paid three because Stacy was in it and I loved Sabretooth movie. I thought it was okay but other deaths had been lit. There was a quiet event that two young men of a kiss and a sabretooth kiss came out with a boy leaving his daughter behind to forget that he had an impeccable evil. Then the sabretiotine gets on the crop and bites the children leaving. The last death with the owner was the graphics of the fake look. Even that death was foolish because the tooth of the statue passed through its mouth and depended on it as it would help and there is a place where a goth girl loses her communication does not get, and it looks like they don't need. Film is idiotic and waste time.
