The cluster is amazing and some acting, especially Sally Kellerman and Anthony Rapp, it is interesting ... but this film is almost unnoticed. Music seems to be from a free website of free royalty and words like it was written by the rhyming dictionary opened on the curtain. Singing song is important. I think they can have a picture of singing and singing music under itâ€¦ Talk is stupid and true. The movie works best when it is actually talking about real estate but unfortunately it often goes into the dark green farcical squares. I found myself looking at me after the first minute of twenty minutes and after 40 asking 'when will it continue.'
