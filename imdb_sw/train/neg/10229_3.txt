I emphasize this on my observation of one place I saw last night (9/27/06). I don't think I'll look at them again. Acting was quite timber, quite predictable plot, the end ended unrealistic - I mean who will believe 30 million sentences for the death of restoring drugs and the last cancer? The leading actor (Victor Garber) appeared to be worried, almost embarrassed in his role - perhaps discovered how bad the text was. I am fully aware that the game scheduled for this season is very poor, but certainly can find the best authors. Maybe they're out of writing to India or China! I'll make a bet we won't see this coming season!
