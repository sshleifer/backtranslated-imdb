It is not the worst start of the program - but it is a mistake in the face and enforce the actual rules. The worst part of the series is that it tries to sponsor itself as a reality - and it's just something. Men and women who give their lives to enforce the law are more worthy of this. What is, medical school in minutes? Charo do you exist? Charles Grodin assisting with the hip importation? Yes ... show less respect. Even the citizens of Muncie offer the app as set out. Police Academy = Gym High School? Serious damage (how many times can they use a car-to-car car for Taco back?), The effects of cheesy siren (the same loop added ad nauseum for each 'call' if the number of rolling or not), and last, but not more than security officer issues than you can shake the stick. <br /> <br /> If I want to see the police work organized by the wise warriors, I would like to watch RENO 911.
