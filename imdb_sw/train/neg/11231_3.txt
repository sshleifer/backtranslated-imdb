I love low-budget films and I am very optimistic about this. But this film is static. Never think the value of production, which is very suitable for its budget, but pacing is deadly. It is true that these people think so little, but the film fails at the most basic level. It's boring. Editing is glacial and pacing stores. It should be 65 minutes. The best thing about Dr. Jekyll is Mr. Hyde who doesn't seem close enough. He had great potential. Instead we have to suffer through the Baltimorean-Brits voting through the endless definition. It feels like a backyard water game. <br /> <br /> The best efforts of everyone in production, but this tired story require a kick in the pants and a new budget of funky budget should be a good cleaner. Instead it is just remead the withered.
