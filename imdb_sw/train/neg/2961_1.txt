I was doing the children of three children at night and their mother gave me this to show that they were taking it on Wal-Mart a week earlier. All three children got physical disease when they looked at it. I am sure it's a pizza they ate, or something that they all took from school, but it really can be this film. It's absolutely disgusting. How someone can produce this litter of garbage is more than me. Fortunately, I exhausted the film when I saw that the children did not respond and act wonderfully. For any parents outside, I strongly advise you to stop allowing young children to see this film.
