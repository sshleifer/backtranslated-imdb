I think this cartoon is one of the worst cartoons I've watched. I would recommend this cartoon to people under 5. I had liked to show this show when I was 4 and 5, still I was watching when nothing was. Now I am another 5 and I would do my homework rather than watch it. Cartoon was a little funny but insufficient to make me burst out laughing. Now I am an old man who is fascinated by a witch of not being tested. I started looking at a doctor who (12A), Torchwood (15) and Sarah Jane Adventures (PG). I am interested in what to do with Doctor Who I do not care about 5-year-old cartoons. This cartoon did not last long only with the 6th season, it was deleted because it was low for viewers but some people say it is because the authors lost their thoughts but for the show others have at least 8 seasons.
