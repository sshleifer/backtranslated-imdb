The Backback starts to look at, and the death of the brutal scene and the killer wear the killer. The mask itself is also good, and looks almost the same as that used in the 1990 "Granny" film. From that time the film is boring. We have a few deaths, which are also good, but not enough. The cause of death is very good because they are frenzied with blood. The story behind the film is really interesting and would have worked well if it was not interesting for the most part. <br /> <br /> I would like to avoid this unless you are a hard collector - it's not enough here to even make it an average flick.
