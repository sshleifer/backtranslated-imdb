Basically, the wife's wife and 3 daughters are responsible for honesty. Cluster is amazing, acting is good, and music, though sometimes fierce and without guidance, it's very cool. The problem is a plot. The dentist removes his wife behind the opera before the show (has a small role) and then walks again to give him something, but he sees him and another person. Some of the movies are involved with its angst on this section, its hallucinations to see and change-ego eyes (Denis Leary, formerly sick of her) and fear her in dealing with his wife maybe she will "do something about it." The last, but I would say that the film does not go anywhere and the end is like hitting the race. The characters are not available: Why is he deceiving? She is a dentist, looking good, good father. The film does not say. Who does it with them? Don't expect any answers for it. Why does he want to continue marriage despite all of this? Who knows. What will all children serve? What? Where does this film go? The best performances by Campbell Scott and Hope Davis (and Denis Leary as a comic aid) vanish with this useless meaning that does not know whether it wants to be a American Beauty or a family film. The root of the root is more attractive. Avoid.
