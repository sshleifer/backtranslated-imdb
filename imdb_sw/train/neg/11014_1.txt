This is the worst films I've ever seen in my life. This says quite a bit, considering some of the decisions I made in filming. <br /> <br /> I've found this on netflix based entirely on the fact that someone I went to high school and doesn't know in it. The top part lasted every 5 seconds and all the movies were happy as having pungee rods run under my fingers when forced to listen to Roseanne singing Big Spender. The skits are stupid and are the worst kind of children's bathroom fun and the locker room, and it's a perfect bright (and poor) Movie Fried Kentucky that you will ask for Big Jim Slade fall through the wall and save us from the folly of "Vince Offer" (anyone who is). <br /> <br /> Unless you are an eye specialist, avoid this bunch of trash.
