Hmmm, the sports team is located in a plane crash, receives a horn on the mountain of snow, and faces a difficult decision to eat the meat of dead companions so that they can survive. Sounds known to anyone? I mention "Alive" since 1993. The only big difference here, of course, is that a big, white, crocodile crocodile shows rarely expel the dead. I think mankind tastes better than yaks. Ignorance: The person in the first place does not have a reliable weapon when hunting Yeti, nor do they have backup. The flight of the flight is quite the opposite. It would have blasted the air, exploded when it was down, or was destroyed. People couldn't live, but hey, it's sci-fi. <br /> <br /> Fools: They were saved, and it's cool. It is likely that it is a good idea to connect some of the impurities to close it. The fire will be as warm as ... WTF: The trial has a cold forming all its face while living and speaking, but odd, no one else does. Fool: One of the boys tells others to find a match and a lightweight, but there are scattered parts of the airline around them. Ignorance: They get a coat and fear, and still there in the Himalayas, they are unable to use hood! Ignore: They look at a bunch of sticks when, I say, there are pieces of aircraft ALREADY BURNING. <br /> <br /> Fools: The Himalayas are known for its storms. It would be common sense for them to collect dirt to strengthen their structure rather than stay out of the fight. There are many pine trees around, branches that make the best insulation. WTF: When you are in doubt, use the hand of the dead person as blue. WTF: If the person knows a lot about the behavior of hibernation of squirrels, bears, and sheep in the Himalayas, then why does not know enough to make housing and set traps from the beginning? Foolish: When you try to grab wild animals, a thoughtless conversation around the trap always helps. <br /> <br /> WTF: Do you know how hard it will be to cut frozen? dead and shade of glass? WTF: The group was already equipped with anti-Yeti weapons while the other two were standing there without knowing. Yeti broke the heart of the boy and healed the girl's head, and the group had nothing. There is love. Yet Yet two yetis and a simple bang to live forever .... or so we think. Mwuhahahaa! The story continues in more idiocy but many actions occur in the last 15 minutes, as usual. Good thinking with the javelini and sequence, although this is a skill (with chain-seen chain) which had no beginning of the movie when they could not even make fire despite that it was near them. br /> <br /> As is the case with Sci-Fi scholars, a couple of love kisses at the end if nothing of horrible happened (not mentioning they ate human beings and did not burn their teeth for several days). <br /> <br /> Last end, however, is a quote lame.
