I have been fond of Fred MacMurray, and though his work had been shortened? I think Carole Lombard is happy to watch. Include two great and interesting stars together, adding top players like Jean Dixon, Anthony Quinn, Dorothy Lamour and Charles Butterworth, to find a romantic script, participants with the well-known Mitchell Leisen and to come to an unfamiliar film. Skid Johnson (Fred) and Maggie (Carole) "meet with the cute" during his visit to the Panama Canal, and spend the next few weeks. Skid is a huge trumpet, so it shares the music work, which is predictably meteoric in its rise and fall. During his skillful music career, he rejects Maggie, who later encourages him to start after falling under the rock. Ah, yes? It is true of the ultimate happy fun, which did not come again quickly. <br /> <br /> The star and director of this caliber should ensure success, but this film is predictable and continues to be so hard to watch when. The previous events set in Panama convince them that they seem to continue forever, and later the skid of alcohol disappears forever in New York. Fred and Carole are trying the best, but the script of fatigue and S-L-O-W leadership do not get a chance. Even the last area, which Maggie has urged Skid to rise from the ashes of alcohol and despair, is not really true. This movie should appear immediately to look at previews from the star MacMurray and Lombard. However, I make sure that the check will appear take about 48 hours.
