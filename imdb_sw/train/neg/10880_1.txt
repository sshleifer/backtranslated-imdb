This is certainly the worst movie I saw, and I am interested in big movies (and good). It is possible (only) managed a variety of young humor if it was a regular language-in-cheek - or a ROCKY HORROR image display, which was really very funny. Other films, like PLAN NINE from SPACE's top, manage to be funny when (apparently) try to be bad. On the part of acting, it seems like they finished the brain-dead youth and asked them to ad-lib all production. Compared with them, Tom Cruise looks like Alec Guinness. There was one definition of respect - that of the wider ghoul-busting wider on a motorcycle.
