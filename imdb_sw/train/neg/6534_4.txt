Sci-fi adventure this is not the best and no more meaning. I agree with the statement that bad sci-fi is comical. The amazing tinting of pink and unusual typical effects makes this a favorite for late, late, audience of late show. Researchers of space on Mars Mars fight with strange monsters as amoeba and other strange creatures. The beauty of winter. Release includes Les Tremayne, Naura Hayden, Gerald Mohr and Jack Kruschen. Get good and enjoy. Don't feel bad if you push for a while. I agree to add this to the list of cult groups to lose.
