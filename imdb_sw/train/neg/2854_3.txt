Dreyfuss has a renowned master who lost his mind, but now he has "done." Lane is her girl who has been around her number (Goldblum), who thinks she has something to go with the sister of Lane (Barkin). Why anyone can focus on all supported stars (Burt Reynolds, Gabriel Byrne, Kyle MacLachlan and even seen by Richard Pryor) can't help this plot, as Dreyfuss will show that it is "fixed" and tries to kill almost everyone in front. You know, not if you didn't know what came. The first ten minutes were nothing but the boys are trying to tell the Goldblum stored when Dreyfuss comes out, but I will save you all trouble: skip this film. The real reason I took this movie is because I have been on Diane Lane a little bit recently and I've tried to see all his movies. The real removal to me is not just a terrible plot, but also the fact that he does not show up to fifteen minutes of the movie (although we hear about it all through the movie). Even a half-cast fan can not help him enjoy this film. The places where the suspects were supposed to be found found me laughing what went on. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 stars.
