I have seen INCUBUS after waiting 20 years unusual to see it and well, certainly did not have worth waiting for him all this time to see. INCUBUS is strictly on-the-scale of the film: an invisible killer / farmer is raping and killing women in a small town. <br /> <br /> The movie goes like this: the movie is opening and killing; then blah blah; more blah blah blah; then other killings; even more blah blah blah; keep blah blah blah; but other killings (strange, huh?); blah blah blah, etc ... <br /> <br /> The film is totally predictable from beginning to end. Even the "big" red sauce used in the film did not influence the age of 5 years. And I found an incubus secret identity when I saw that character, so when the "surprising" surprise came, I was not surprised or surprised. In fact, it was so amazing that I continued to hate the days after seeing the film. It is so evil! However, the film is for-number that the "rock rock" chain is one of the shortest moments to stand out in this dreary flick. It is a place of standing not because it is good but because it is awesome and useless: a movie that plays on a large screen shows a video time as a rock and a boy wearing a red leather trousers and cutting off many of his false hair, this has been changed by The events of a girl who are attacked in the movie movie washroom and incubus. The best thing I can say about this film is the movie, which I liked. But apart from that, there is almost no mention of value on INCUBUS, except that it is hilarious without option.
