The kind of hard to believe that the film from this book can succeed in destroying its new! The plan is designed and impossible. . . starting with setting tons of guilt for a small child to avoid his pain! Then we have a fully characteristic of at least six and perhaps more people (including kings) linked to crime everywhere. Then we have a wife who looks at the length of the ferry trip from the comparison to the fun by hitting a very short time on the impact. Too bad mother and coo mother, helped, abetted and supported by a friendly friendly group of friends! Transferring settings from the island along the South Carolina coast, did not help the story although it might help the film's filmmakers. The most beautiful buildings that seem to be the house of the house did not seem to fit a small suite for a small enough require carts and small ferry services. Kim Basinger whom I love so much is a thin pain in this film and certainly her hair is ten years old. There is also no chemistry at all between it and either of the male leads. I did not like the book that was taken but read it all. The movie I had to go back and forth, had to leave at any time when the saccharine music was too much. Unless you would like an unreliable story, acting wood, a mixture of religion / mythological / allegory my advice is this jump. Oh and maybe a little escape, but he did not have a caring father with a life jacket for a small child on a small boat? The best part of this film is a good environment
