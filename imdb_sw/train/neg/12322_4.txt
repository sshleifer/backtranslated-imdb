If it appears to be the overall essence of these views, the film has an amazing animation (I watched it on the blu-ray) but it is not quite useful with any real depth. <br /> <br /> First all the characters are pretty evil. I found the situation in Laputa between Agito, Toola and Shunack's chief opposition. Yet perhaps my mind would have been lost and this was to think (Laputa to be my favorite anim√©, original Engilsh dub). The characters do not like the truth and as described in another post they love very quickly, leaving the old Minka jealousy and rejection (he loves Agito, who seems to know this). Yet he immediately seems to forgive Toola last and no explanation of the change of heart than it makes the end ends more "fun". There is also a great lack of definition. If who is really druids? What are people? and who are the most beautiful women / girls who seem to fight with the forest? There is nothing that explains why they are and how they can give the most common human power. Plants derived from the moon still does not fill the buttons about this. It's almost like the wonderful version of Triffids Day. Who / what is called Toola? why are you suffering with this if you are not asked? I liked to love this film but I found the trick of the place where almost as deep as a film like Ghost in Shell or having any real character like Miyazaki. I do not know that but I do the kind of want I didn't buy. My advice? Do if you have several hours to escape, but copy it, or cheap price! Maybe if your new movie for video films and you don't have much to go with you you will enjoy. Certainly it is delightful.
