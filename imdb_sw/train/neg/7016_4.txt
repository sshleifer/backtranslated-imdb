54 is a film about the club's title in the 70th era. It incorporates a good bartender to look good. Female women. The most powerful owner. Divide. When they all came together with the chaos, and the bartender (played by Phillipe) it seems to be the whole of it. <br /> <br /> I will be as clear and honest as possible, while avoiding any clear or incorrect views (if, it's 'ok' film). In fact I get a very sad film proposed and thrown. Every time I sit down to watch the film, Salma Hayek, I always wait to see her beauty, at the same time explaining efficiently and efficiently, but the truth cannot remind me of her worth. I mean, in fact, what has ever been a citizen of people, except its great dance table in 'From Dusk to Dawn' ...? It also goes to Ryan Phillippe, another poor actor who does not give anything on the screen but looks good to fine fines not known as 'act'. Mike Myers, not as bad as these 2, does at least give the film something appropriate. Playing the player, the founder of the 54th Club Partnership. The type that most viewers would hate (ie the work has done well), puts a reliable functionality that gave me the usual pleasure from the flick. But alas, it is not enough to save the film without foundation and flat. Many 'bad' movies I get something from the film, but this has nothing, really. Neve Campbell is not very bad, but he's just 'there'. The story of the story is lighter, it seems the author was walking more in making this fashion and beauty film and forgetting to add anything else. Meaning any. College nothing. Anything. Because as many decorations, they are something that has no meaning, which is just good to find, similar to the base of this bad film. True hour and half-time I would use to do better to do something more, like talking to a 90-year-old relative on the phone about the weather.
