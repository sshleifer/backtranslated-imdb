Rural family - and maybe nod to "ordinary people" - includes a young boy who comes out of it after hurting a big brother in a shot. In spite of the subject matter of emphasis (due to fraud treatment by Christopher Cain), there are some dynamics in this sad story worth examining. Unfortunately, the unique agricultural environment and reluctance of adult actors to replace the situation gives the film a misleading experience. What is Robert Duvall, Glenn Close, and Wilford Brimley at the cast, the film is close to the lowest "Natural" corporation. Unfortunately this project did not get the most important talents behind the camera to get a picture of a reminder, a memory. * 1/2 from ****
