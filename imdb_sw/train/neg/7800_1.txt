In addition to cheap dirt, this shot-on-video exercise was hard to find. It has got a normal year that you would like to expect in a movie of a zombie, but no situation is needed to make it worth while. It is amazing that this is a German video of an amateur, and the version I saw is English-called! Dubbers seem to be American fans (retirees of Germans?) Who can't decide whether they want to play directly or turn it into a comedy. One character (white German, of course) is known by a black man, who speaks with white ebonics! 'Kno wahm sayin', Comrad?
