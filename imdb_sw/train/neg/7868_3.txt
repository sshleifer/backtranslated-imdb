I have seen many films of Guy Maddin, and they loved many of them, but this has given me a headache. John Gurdebeke's editing is also an odd way, and, apart from a round-de-force chain to show a line of heads you are photographing by looking at one thing, doing nothing but interfering with the ability of the contact users to communicate. Something else that I didn't like about this film was that it seemed to be more brutal than former Maddin's work - although its films have had dark elements, its sympathy for the characters gave the film a great sense of humanity. This seemed to be as harsh because of the violence. If I need to add more lines of text before IMD will accept my comments, I will say that the guys playing "Guy Maddin" can manage to face his face very well.
