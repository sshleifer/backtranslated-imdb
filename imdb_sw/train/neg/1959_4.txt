Fairy Tooth is on the spirit of an old wretched witch that gives children his home to earn their other tooth and then takes their lives. The first few minutes will tell you at the beginning of the 1949 story of the tooth story and then turn the presentation day. The horrible mark of evil is very good to be saved by acting. They could do without the brothers of Hammond and a few other incidents, but in general the events of the year were blood but rapidly that had little effect. Eye candy is good for both men. The camera function is good. Talk is just but cheesy. I expected the film to be an open skeleton, a small budget, a slasher and a few things for redemption. I was surprised by the quality of the film.
