I was very scared of this film because of the fact that they saw lies and characters were not strong enough to carry a very good film attempt to fear. The basic idea of ​​the film was surprising but unfortunately it was not possible to stimulate, fear or shock - there was one part of all the film I thought was bad but even that could not save it. I found as the character of Kate and the end of the film as it seemed to reduce and become a bit more at last, the behavior played by Jeremy Sheffield was not much needed for this film and I think the director / writer was taken by a large number of characters to be used without purpose, if he would leave it to primary characters doing more than a solo effort on Kate's part, it could be a job - Jeremy was working on wood to say a little and I felt worried looking bad at the screen of the screen - or missing. Shame the gin. Discouragement.
