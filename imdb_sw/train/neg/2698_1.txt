This movie shows how racist John Singleton is. He shows whites and other communities that are not black as evil in our education system. How quickly he forgives that it is a system of education that has made him what he is and fail at that time. Cube's Cube's character is the image of a black-tempered black man who was involved in many violence in this film. Singleton has never touched the relationship between white and black characters who were trying to reach each other. When Omar Epps says "I need to have my people", the same voice of the racist spoke much. And John, don't think for a minute that Thomas Jefferson's image at the stairwell tower did not have my mind. Good touch!
