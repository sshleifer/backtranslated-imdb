Mountains And Eyes II is what you would expect to have no more. Of course it will not be an Oscar film, it is only a pure entertainment that you can lose yourself for about 90 minutes. training in the wilderness. Only they fight in the entire film, which includes many violence (which is the whole film) as blood and intestines continue to move around everything, and it is also another area of ​​rape that can be thrown to the audience. <br /> <br /> I would like to give mountains 4 eyes out of 10 for clean entertainment, and just that. Even though I look at looking at me more and more as the film went on, because it started to pull because of the fact it kept trying and scoring the audience with a punctuation mark constantly to make sure the audience stayed awake. Mountains and Eyes II is just a decent entertainment, something that passes when you tremble, and nothing else. <br /> <br /> 4/10
