I see that it doesn't mean to comment on this "movie" for a simple reason that has nothing to say about it. It is similar to a decomposed egg that has nothing good to be shown out of the world because of other endless decay The eggs have been before it. But since the opinion is necessary in a very trivial sense ... Film is a word that describes the film designed in the same way as the "other" Romanian-led Lucian Pintilie who insists to describe what is called "Romanian Truth" after Communist era (1990 to present). There is no suggestion for people outside Romania as others (who recently have an amateur camera, a lack of conspiracy, lack of quality journalists / etc., a good noise as a direction and even art-like): see & enjoy " This film (as I know) but do other IMDb members with good intentions, do not write online reviews for them to mislead, anger and ultimately lose their time. On the other hand this film (among others) has any value, one of the education for it sets an example for: "How not to make a film."
