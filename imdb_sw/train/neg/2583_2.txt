The other American Pie film has been dropped into our home and this is the worst of all. Not suitable for the name of the American Pie. They should be stopped at the "Wedding". <br /> <br /> This movie feels like a stupid stupid film that hit the head of the American Pie. As I watched this I felt like I was looking at a different series. It didn't fall like the Pie of America at all. It has a different humor and is very bad and has many more sexual cases then other American Pie movies. It never suggests. I really don't recommend any of the "American Pie Presents" movies. Just put a good trilogy of nature. <br /> <br /> 2/10
