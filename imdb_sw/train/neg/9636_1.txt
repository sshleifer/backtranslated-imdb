This amazing damage to the production of money is evidence of the rich and famous film that can be as stupid and lose as politicians. From (silly) playing with Tennessee Williams and led (by dead hand) by Joseph Losey and star Taylor and Burton and Noel Coward - this project held on the top mountain mountain plateau in the Mediterranean must be seen as a fierce fire winner when presented Universal in 1967. The result is sad and sad that it is approaching faith. Watching the film is surprising but that is a natural force that has allowed to put up with the fact that real homes are used instead of setting. The amazing antics of Taylor screeching, half a half burton half-sleep, a loony dialog, Noel Coward laughing himself, the story of ignorance and plot devices and the incredible cost of the viewer. BOOM is a disgrace, losing money and talent and clear evidence that they praise the famous people can be idiots such as plebs planets. It's not even fun. Just the worst and surprising desired awesome.
