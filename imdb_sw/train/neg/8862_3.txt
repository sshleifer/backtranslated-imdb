From the time Christopher Lee puts a pair of punk glasses and tries to get into the punk rock club, you know you have a shinker in your hands! This film was capable. Under the sludge there are all the remains of what can be done in a good film, if not interesting. The final product is a real mess, however. In addition to freeous dirt and many attractive women, Howling II wind up to be a laughable excuse for horror films. Christopher Lee gives a nugget of honesty, but even he cannot lift it on the level of decoration. Never ever seen any film in this series, this critic will be forced to admit on the face. We start at the funeral of one of the characters from nature, and within the first ten minutes we find ourselves in Transylvania and a small group of heroes ready to fight a waswolves contract. The film is good tracking, and there are not many places to die. The point is there; not good. One bright drug is a punk band called Babel. Although their song is played often, it's rather interesting. <br /> <br /> Problems with this film are great for numbers. First, acting is worse than sad. Christopher Lee is good enough, but that's where it ends. They both lead Reb Brown and Annie McEnroe are losing everything that you would like for these characters. Writing is bad, editing editing, and amateur orientation. There are a nice couple of effects of special effects, but those with cheesy out far weighs in numbers. Sybil Danning is a good looking, but its acting performance is less satisfactory. Judd Omen looks at his play, but his voice and acting is not worth speaking. Much of the conversation is in an unknown language that may or may not be Latin. <br /> <br /> I liked the main idea of ​​the story. I often enjoy the stories of true believers going to the seemingly impossible battle. One place where a small group of good boys pass through the dark forests and blow down a group of waswolves is an exciting form. Type. Perhaps a great budget or a good director can make the whole film as possible. Star 3 of 10. <br /> <br /> Hound. <br /> <br /> Description of the bottom side: If this is written, censors on youtube.com have not yet removed the end features and Sybil Danning rush off it several times when the Babel song is playing! Find when you can!
