This film was only painful to watch ... not in a great way that makes a cringe and feeling for well-developed characters in a serious situation (yeah, I pretty much made that last sentence on if I went along), but only in the lighter way to two hours. Now, all of you can think of me as a professional counselor who has no respect for Shakespeare or "artistic films" ... well, you would be wrong in both counts. I would like Shakespeare's work, especially Romeo and Juliet disasters, Julius Caesar, Macbeth, and Hamlet, and I have watched a lot of "arthouse" films such as surreal and well made Eraserhead and Fellini 8 1/2. .. but this was more than two hours of lost-in-translation Shakespeare, honey too much (I can understand some artistic scenes some ... but not for every other shot of the movie !!! It was useless to serve no for of the story !!!), and basically just making the film. I had high hopes for this film because it was claimed to be "very artistic" and was dealing with Shakespeare's Tempest ... but this was just an extreme letdown. I released this third film ONLY because of Sir John Gielgud's acting in front (which far exceeds all of the names in this film) and Sinematography / setting design combination as he made a lot of scenes to look like painting in motion ... however, many of these films it would be much better if JUST painting and text book under it. The real desire ... maybe if Zeffirelli has been given the chairman of the director, this would have been better. But this is the opinion of one member, many others can enjoy this more than I do. So, if you can't find this at any time around the video (it's now not on DVD), don't try to go too far from your way to get it ... it's really worth it.
