When thinking about Captivity many words come to mind. Among them are: unacceptable, inappropriate, inappropriate, say, unknown, and unknown. I used to hate these movies from the mid-nineteen years that had been shouting but these knockoffs have been starting to make these films look like classic. They are still looking for a number of people that the other movies have been very successful to do, but now they add a new level of destruction that makes girls aged fourteen who are aiming to feel like they are difficult and hip this is a load of boring crap! What? What has hell happened to Larry Cohen? His name is not associated with anything good since 1993! However, I was still surprised to see that he had anything to do with something bad! Was anyone surprised when the movie's interest was one of psychological? Did no one know when they first saw him? The only person who has never been before his life, has ever seen another movie!
