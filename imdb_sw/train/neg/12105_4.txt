This was a desperate film. People seem to have no guarantees, the leading protagonist Martin Cahil has the liberation values, indeed everyone in it including Jon Voight eliminates sleeve. I will not recommend this film to anyone. Violence is violence, although it has been done efficiently. The file is black, at least printed to fit this category. Desire.
