This is a shame for everyone and everything used to make this joke. I personally don't care about one or the other about Jessica Simpson and her talent or whatever most people are attracted to. Just like this film is something that can't even get a pass through a school of film. Script is aggressive, acting is angry, and the fact Luke Wilson (participant of the "Bottle Rocket") made it make me wonder what hell was thinking about. Made "Old School" to cry loudly! This does not even in the same situation as my DVD "Old School"! Please for any reason do not see this! I see there is a suggestion that this is bad is good, but that's really good. We will stop when you see the singers that can't make the action to try, I hope it will soon end. The worst part is that there are dignitaries (Penelope Ann Miller, Rachel Leigh Cook, & Luke Wilson) who are part of this dump. In addition to the plot, well it is almost nonexistent and so inappropriate and written (yes I know it's another fix) I certainly doubt anyone will remember anything about this. Please do whatever you do does not waste your time, but if you do, feel sad for ACTUAL actors involved for wasting their time to make this bomb. Jessica Simpson you are good, but the singing stick, though I'm not a fan of it. And anyone who makes this film, I would like to put this to your start. 1/10 because you can't give zero.
