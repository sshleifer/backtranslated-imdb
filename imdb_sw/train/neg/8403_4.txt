I have given this only four out of its historical context. It seemed to have been lost for years until it left out of the blue in Showtime in the early nineties. <br /> <br /> Moe is a direct person with Larry and Curly makes like duo. Cooley Spade has several numbers. I think it had nothing to do and work on the ranch. I don't know at all because the plot was not the lowest of the stick in my memory. I correctly remember it is the western comedy of music. Even the Stooge seem to have moved. In general there is nothing to recommend here. If you are not a Stooge fan then don't worry. If you are a fan of Stooge, then close the cap.
