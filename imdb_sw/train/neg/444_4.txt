(SPOILERS IN THIS!) / Rosenstraße is a movie about brave women in the time of Nazi Germany. But it is a very long way, it does not touch and sometimes even smells! There are too many clichés and not a good job. <br /> <br /> Story story (storyline) is bad. As in James Cameron's Titanic old woman remembers the events of her life. Good, now we have an idea of ​​comment. There is another woman who started who does that. Combining is that all remember the lives of other people! Come! This is a lack of knowledge of the basic story to tell ... How can Riemann know about the fate of the girl's mother and her example? For example, the displays are displayed in an incorrect order and you rarely know when it was done. For example the situation when Riemann suggests Fabian. When did it take place? The area has been shown to be set in the twentieth century. Wow. His brother returns from the East Front, has received "Ritterkreuz" which he shows in some cases. So he is a warrior of war and is still a good man who protected his conscience. And he got to know the killings done by the Germans. Even made a picture! And so it goes, cliché after cliché is connecting with this is why the movie doesn't work. <br /> <br /> Basically von Trotta made a chick flick out of something that could be a good movie. And finally it's very simple. Riemann finds a way to get Goebbels on the bed with - ta da! - everyone is free. That is not a historical fact but a good idea with "true stories" claim at first. As "Sass" is precisely BASED on a true event. It is sad but it is true, this is the usual German film these days. It's bad! Macaulay J. Connor <br />
