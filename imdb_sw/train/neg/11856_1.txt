I just saw this film last night at the Tribeca 2006 Festival and it makes me look at whether the concert people actually watch the film before choosing. The movie was very bad - I say that without the intention of destruction or the last - it was bad. The days of Matthew Modine as a leading man is the most effective way. Gina Gershon made an unhealthy and unwanted noise in English - he should be embarrassed to participate in this film. Gloria Reuben had a very little comeo in it - he should also be shy. The script was awesome and we were given absolutely no reason to care about the characters. I am very doubtful this will be taken, but again, Hollywood people are known to make mistakes sometimes. In fact I think the "Kettle of Fish" is a huge clash of the worst movie I saw.
