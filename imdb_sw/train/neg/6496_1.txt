This movie was disappointed. I expected to see a good film. I am the kind of person who starts the movie and does not open to the end, but I was stressing the shutter. <br /> <br /> The reason why I did not restrict it is because I am a big fan of Christian Slater and I wanted to see him acting in it. I really had a speech after I finished watching the movie. This movie was one of the worst movies I have seen in my life. Thank you Christian Slater for keeping humor in it. If it wasn't on this film I would like to get out of my mind. <br /> <br /> I also accept that Anthony Hopkins needs to be connected to action. When the movie was gone I have never found a farm. I was mixed and angry.
