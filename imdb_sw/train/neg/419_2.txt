An invisible person is an incredible movie from 1933, a sharp cutting at the time when things seemed to relax on someone who was not true. Continue, look at the film, you will be surprised that it was made in 1933, it was the first movie of a real special effect. Here 2000, the computer will help special effects appear to play for children, the audience is not affected by special effects, instead of being disappointed if they do not do the same. Special effects in the Hollow Person, the update of the HG Wells story, are the same, but not the main problem of this film directed by Paul Verhoeven, who can remember from Showgirls and Total Recall. Kevin Bacon plays Sebastian Caine, a world-class biologist (yes, I know that it is not a word) but of course it is fighting against top people who threaten to withdraw team funds. So, if the filmmakers who are about to get enough money, they make the final sacrifice and become a guinea pig for entry (perhaps, I know, I used a non-word process). The process has a negative impact, no Caine does not die, but instead it is a horny, armored, young man. At the moment that he cannot be seen, Caine hits a neighbor's neighbor, colleague, former Linda's partner (Elisabeth Shue), and someone who gave her money. Then the unusual thing happens, Caine becomes a new one, "Thing That Will Die." Laughing in the face of all natural things, Caine faces death and mattress in her face, as it takes what it feels like the hours of this creature die, stimulating the end of the movie out. The movie is silly, stupid, and finally laughable with the originality sometimes used, sometimes not. There is a great possibility for a Hollow Person, but of course, none of them are considered. To look more interesting to the invisible person, arrange already on the beautiful black and white movies of the past, and see Invisible Man of 1933. Kevin Bacon still can't be seen when you return, perhaps still alive under the volcano.
