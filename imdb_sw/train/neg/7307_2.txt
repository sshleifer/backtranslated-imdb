That's probably one of the worst films I've ever seen. Events in it are completely random and make little or no meaning. The fact that there is a diagnostic guide I could drop and the case of cabin (I'm SO SORRY). I explain that the bug is hit by a newspaper because it seems to be different parts of the mixed material. e. Kevin karate who loves karate is an old man alone, then there is a young man who is a young and miserable, then a drug addict, then there is a fact that they are attacking a random boy who needs help. then suddenly the main character is having sex with his girlfriend just because he says something stupid about the flight going down. then at the end of the tribal apartheid family was followed by the practice of rabbits in Kevin's karate. In fact it is a despicable thing that they can use racism as a joke in this film. There is no reason for anyone to enjoy this film unless you love Eli Roth, even if it did not like this film. Hating is a strong word but seeing if it's the only word that I have agreed to use it should do. BOYCOTT CABIN FEVER 2 !!!!!
