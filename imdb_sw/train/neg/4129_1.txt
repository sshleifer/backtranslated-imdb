After checking about half of this I had stopped and wiped it, but I endured to the end. This is a movie that tries to be a romantic comedy and fails. Acting is poor â€” it is worse than acting on 80 T&A movies. There are several attempts of humor that fail hard and movies are 100% predictable. Perhaps if you are a young person this attraction will be appealing, but for those who have seen many movies, you will know how the movie comes out after the first 10 minutes. All of your time will be spent on pain waiting for the end of the time. Do not waste your time looking at this.
