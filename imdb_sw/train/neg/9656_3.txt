This film has been made for TV around everywhere. However, it started with good intentions, in collaboration with good sets and real jewelery and clothes. The film has led to the worst in the nose of the particle, and running the sappy television of the melodramatic acting. The characters were so sappy that sometimes I thought that they were almost impaired in the valley of bio goo, and the point was so damaged by the bad county that looked like the soldiers were just standing around and turning to each other. The Germans were shown without thinking that it was painful to watch. The only thing that German officials spoke about how Americans is very strange is. Please take my word for this. I am a great fan of war type, and this movie decides. However, this DVD has an extra feature, it takes a letter from the front lines of WWI, and thus making this lease is not a perfect waste of my time.
