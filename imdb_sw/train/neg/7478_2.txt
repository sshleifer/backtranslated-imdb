When I saw the preview of this film I thought it might be dumb, but it would be at least to be interesting. Well I was wrong. Even though some downstream producers had an interesting message to show about parents who were left alone and re-evaluating their lives, the way they tried to give the message was scary. The first time that fifty had been silent for a couple was normal. But at the end, I could almost predict the stupid stupidity that would happen later. In all the movie I love a total of five lines of discussion and everything else was better, still more than I can say for the film itself.
