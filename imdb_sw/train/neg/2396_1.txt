I saw this movie on TV and I must admit it, I was surprised even though it was. There were many buttons, dirty, and bad editions that the old Sesame Street section would be better to watch. Acting was the same, but please, you can feel the feeling of "OK with Video". Workers / staff made this film a bad melodrama. Yes, there is a message in the film, but wait until ten minutes before you finish hearing. Believe me, you can't say differently.
