Fantasy on Elm Street: A fantasy child, the fifth phase on Sunday's Elm Street series and the worst sequence in the series, even worse than the Elm Street Route 2. I was lucky to find Nightmare on Elm Street DVD box for my birthday and I watched all the sequels. The child of the dream was very bad, of course, I was also surprised since they were doing very well with the last two sequels. But I think they just lost the charm, the story was just ridicule and I wasn't happy with where it went. Alice began to become more angry, she was not Nancy or Kirsten, so she took this film herself did not work for me. Freddy also lost his fear, this was just getting silly. <br /> <br /> Alice is back and she carries the baby, she can't be happy with her life. But Freddy is also back and can't be very slow since he has easily defeated him on the fourth movie. But anyways, he wants his son to be born again on earth. What? Have you ever wondered if Freddy had parents too? That is the Elm Street route: The fantasy child finds out with Alice soon what Freddy's childhood had and that is probably one thing that can overcome him. The highway of Elm Street: The Fantasy Child is all in all the bad movies and insults in a row. I don't think anyone can be happy with this follower. The story was just true, explaining it would be possible to work, but again, it was given the wrong way. I know that if you look at the sequels of Nightmare in the Elm Street series, you should look at it, but I can't recommend it, not worth, at least in my opinion. <br /> <br>> 3/10
