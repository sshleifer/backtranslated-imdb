I watched this film with other friends a few months ago, I still laugh to think about some ignorance. The first events alone alone were hilarious. I can't destroy anything for those who want to see, I don't want to destroy laughter. Without saying all the time I watched this film I was trying to understand exactly what a symbol of what the characters in this film were doing. To the end we all were bored, however, like the first hilarity and the film shock that this randomly dressed. There is no conspiracy and not an example of acting like a prostitute. The characters are on the well-developed as those in the kindergarten "Learn Reading" book. They could even make an area of ​​lesbian uninteresting sex.
