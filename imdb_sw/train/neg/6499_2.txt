What is the soil mess. I saw this with a friend of the past and we all feel that we have a keen interest in many movies, but this is certainly not one of them. When there is very good it can be good ideas / assumptions and there are certainly good performances (under conditions), both buried under improper shortages. Mr. Anthony is also looking for more genes from genes like natural killers, U to turn to similar films such as restructuring, or perhaps he looked at Nixon for inspiration. Say what you want about David Lynch, but at least more often than the spiritual way. His quote says that he made the film as shock says it all. It's not worth your money, bandwidth or time.
