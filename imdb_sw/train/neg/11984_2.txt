Ugh! Another of those "perverted to DVD". I expected some kind of action at least with bears, cats, & such on the lid. I've got NOTHING! Movie bad !. I was obliged to look at this way by thinking that eventually something would happen ... no luck. Now the reason I gave this 2 is because of the environment; otherwise walked. The child was awesome, talking to himself (though I think they could not just run the film with dumb music and no conversation at all), doing his karate position on the trunk tree, threatening raccoon, munching on of worms, and (what dumbass) run string. And he did not want to pull them out so easily ... they catch like fish. At least he fought with the bear (weak) several times. <br /> <br /> What had a flashback item? It made the movie even worse. I wanted to see a live film, not a big bs about a child who is affected by divorce. <br /> <br /> What else can I say? Maybe, maybe they should be carrying baby food or something. At least that would be more exciting. People, don't waste your time on this.
