This is a Western step. James Steart leads all the stars in the northwest, which have been done with great glory. Beauty and dress are beautiful. There are steps and adventure. Stewart has a rich pastor who runs a misleading government in the former Nothwest. <br /> <br /> The greatest deficit is an amazing cynic that Hollywood has always been within the hero. Even when this movie was done, the cynic was a wonderful hero, and one Stewart shows really has a few save graces. He is quick to his two partners, and that gives him a more inclusive of honesty and merit. However, he is so pig for everyone else, it is difficult to take care of him, or accept him. He is like one common sponge of Western characters (cut not bad). Still, small characters are quite fun. Walter Brennan, Royal Dano, Harry Morgan, and others make it worthy to look at.
