I love Morgan Freeman. Paz Vega is an interesting, attractive and talented actor. I am sure that this would be a good movie and something happened in it. There is nothing. It's short (less than 90 minutes). It was 75 minutes long. After an hour of confusion, I evaluated the remaining 20 minutes. It's fun. Freeman plays an actor - who has not worked for a while - reflecting a part that he can play, as a checkout clerk in supermarkets. He visits the supermarkets where he works. Nothing happens. He decides to give him a home trip and go to Arby's, Target, wash the car. Nothing happens. They talk about their lives. Nothing happens. Forever. I do not. But I also did not find Bill Murray losing "Lost In Translation" and "broken flowers". If you like these movies, you will probably like this. Most people find movies like this modern, personalized, or - for the reasons they call me - get interesting conversations. The most common device in this movie ilk is to have a long time to take a calm / calm after actor giving a line that should be meaningful. We know it is because it is followed by two minutes of anything on the screen. Sorry, I must be an expert. I don't. For me, these types of movies are not funny, or personalized, or stimulate thoughts. They are just boring. Why? Because no comedy. No drama. No tension. No laugh. There is no doubt. No action. No look. In short, there are no things I am going to the movies. I can get bored for free. I see strange / quirky characters in real life. I'm going to Target, and fast-food restaurants, and cleaning the car. These things have no film, even if stars do these things. I pay to have fun. <br /> <br /> If you're mad on Morgan Freeman and if you hear him standing on anything, enjoy it. If you want to irrigate on Paz Vega, you can watch and listen to him. But nothing happens, I have promised. Snoozefest total.
