This complaint is correct, for me the biggest problem is that this soap opera also focuses on women. I am similar to these nightclubs, like the Anatomy of Gray, or Betty Ugly, or the West Wing, because there are stories that are interesting even for the release that they will not cover. However, when the idea matches the day's soap for the purpose of just putting people wishing (Taye Diggs, Tim Daly, and Chris Lowell) in sexual tension and romantic strokes, and many difficult situations in a little known hospital, it seems like a Hospital Great ... or a female partner of Baywatch. That's what the people wanted and what they had, so if this is what women want it to be, but the idea that this is a show of the face (or something that men will look for) is true.
