Let's put it this way. I really get this film. I get what the author / leader is trying to do. I understand that the conversation was supposed to be dry and senseless. I understand that the plot thought it was not romantic and stale. That's what the author / director went. Very humor / comedy. For all the same understanding, I still think the movie is facing. It seemed like the author / director was trying to restore Napolean Dynamite with this movie. It had all the same features. Even the main character resembled Napolean. But Napolean Dynamite was really funny. His script worked. This movie is not. It has no purpose. Yes, I come back again. His sole aim is to stop Napolean Dynamite and try to catch that look and feel. The worst did not work.
