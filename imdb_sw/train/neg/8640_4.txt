I was looking for 3/4 of this film and wondered why it had a horrible view here. It was very easy to watch (at 3am). It had a beautiful sand - the role of Kevin Dillon of the festive celebration was widely believed - had charasmatic and cold. The other main characters were not even worse. <br /> <br /> This is your usual movie stalker / suspense. A married couple cannot conceive so they go to a fertility clinic for help. The "social" sponsor of the donor is converted to recipients and, with the usual form of wind, intrusion into their lives. As I said, many films were very good. Of course things do not work in the way he has planned. It's not a bad line of conspiracy. But, the last 15 minutes were just bad. I am very happy with the film (especially at 3am!) .. but, I just wondered how the end was written. In fact I have condemned it! All in all, not the worst movie I saw, but I won't be able to resume (unless I have left the end). The only responsibility to restore here was the role of Kevin Dillon - - one of the best serial killers ever. Try to look around in another way before looking at this. But, if nothing is better, I'd like to try .. =)
