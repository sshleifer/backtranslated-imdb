Come, what is involved with this show, Power Rangers anyways? I always felt that the show, which had originally brought from Japan for the best form, took what was the biggest in Japan, and it became one of the ignorant and useless excuses in the history of the toy business! There is absolutely no point to display this. The bad hair, beautiful dress, ring, etc., all show what was behind the 1990s From two idiots, Bulk and Skull, to "Das", of Jason, Trini, Tommy, Kimberly , Billy and Zack, I just want to say one thing: I CAN BREAK! / Saban brought this from Japan, and then Disney bought this show rights around five years ago. Now the public must continue to be found for this show at the Disney station and such. All I can say again give me rest!
