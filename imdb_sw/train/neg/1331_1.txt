Concentration course is worse than the usual "white male capitalist movie" of the week. This movie is not better than toothache. Jay Leno can act. She is good at her first low movie, Silverbears, which provides performance associated with her character needs. This film is a Leno character, buffoon of purification, not better than Morita's character, a clever of purification.
