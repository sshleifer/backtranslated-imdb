How this film was made by many stars is more than me. This is a very corrupt "ridden" film and the worst of these actors have ever done. It is amazing to me that many of these star lists can agree with this unwanted film. What's worse is the fact that it is carried out nearly 100 million here in the states. It doesn't show even the big stars can pull on bucks, even if the film is awesome. I felt sad for everyone involved in this trick. Billy Crystal worked very hard with what he was given by other stars seemed to be walking that way. Whatever you do, don't put it for good cast because no one could save this.
