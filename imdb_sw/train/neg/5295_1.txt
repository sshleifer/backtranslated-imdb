A young man who seems to be killing himself. Leaving his family and his best friend (Keanu Reeves) ask many questions ... and defend themselves. Good / beautiful, used badly. For this predecessor has been done before 1988 - especially in TV and after School School. In addition to swearing and discussing (therefore the PG-13 level) did not add anything new. The result is predictable and the reeve experiment in the act was sad to look. He is good now but not in 1988. Apart from being his character was dressed as a slob and always looks so dirty it is difficult to create compassion. <br /> <br /> That off the movies is lighter. I saw every scene coming and every "surprise" was telegraphed. I basically couldn't wait for this thing to cross. I have an incomprehensible memory of it at the theater in 1988 and hating (bADLY). It still seems to be heavy about 20 years later. The lesson deserves to handle but it has been done well (for doing well) in many other movies. "Common people" comes to mind. You can fly this.
