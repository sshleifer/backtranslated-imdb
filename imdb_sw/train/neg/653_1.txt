If I could give this film a real rating, it is possible to be in a small number. When I respect the fact that someone keeps making "horror" these films, seriously, people, buying this film ticket is losing money you can be using something more valuable than your time. <br /> <br>> To be a horrible film, there is nothing to be horrible about it, except the idea of ​​seeing how many scary images can affect you in one film. If the mark was high, it would probably have made the film better. Finally anyone who made this version of "Prom Night", found it. Employees may have done a good job if they were not in a scripting course. This was a bad waste of a movie trip. I would like to go quickly and see "Hangouts Lost" again, at least have some plot.
