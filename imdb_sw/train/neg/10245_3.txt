I expected much from this film. Kinda as Lee as Naustradamous as characters but instead of all that I was wasting time with movie boring. I can't even describe this film. It had a wooden acting, a bad script from pieces of the Bible like hurricanes, waves of water and an earthquake. But that was the end! All the others had to wait and hope that something was going to happen but it didn't. This movie is about couples who are trying to find out what is happening in the world as places in China where there was an earthquake and ended up in a village running eight citizens and a priest. The meeting of churches continues to be the center of misshappenings. The whole movie is missleading and boring. One of the worst Lees.
