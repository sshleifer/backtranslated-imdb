I've never seen anything as bad as this movie for a long time. The movie was boring, long term and bad plot. Special effects result in hell - It's like watching the film back in 1999. It's a waste of hour and half of my time. The performance of Matthew Settle was very bad. I saw him in the Band of Brothers playing Lt.Speirs, he is not bad. In fact it's not so bad. But in this film, its acting was not enough lobby, it was very bad and there was any chemistry among other employees. Plus, his eyes seem to be empty if he doesn't feel. It surprised me, in fact, because it was good at the Band of Brothers. However, do not worry even to watch this film. It's a great big time to BIG. Even if you have to kill an hour or two, find something else to do instead of watching this film. Believe me, you'll hear!
