Trafficking by Henry Kendall and Joan Barry (like Fred and Emily Hill) get earlier on inheritance. They spend money to travel. Their lives are more interesting when they start a relationship with foreign Betty Amann (for Mr. Kendall) and alone Percy Marmont (for Mrs Barry). But, they remain as old as they were before. The shouting assistant Alfred Hitchcock tries to get rid of positively (as described in the film, from Shakespeare's "Tempest") "Rich and Strange" to order the trick of the camera. The Kingdom's opening to King Vidor's "crowd" is an important thing. The lower pole may have two people to eat on a Chinese cat. *** Rich and Strange (12/10/31) Alfred Hitchcock, Henry Kendall, Joan Barry, Percy Marmont, Elsie Randolph
