Suppose you have been on an abandoned island ten years ago. Didn't hear the Scream and left when Halloween part 1 entered the movie. Then this film would be an explosion and a completely new vision in a terrifying scene. At the moment, rating 2.7 is located on IMDb and is not recommended for the below. Defeat all the way, if "I know what you did", and who-is-that that last time to the end assures me who-and-why. <br /> <br /> No great surprise, just a nice flick of looking with cola, popcorn and no need to find plot plot, detailed characters. If the rental video was not available for advanced names, you can take it without risk, but don't wait for a good job. I've seen a lot more.
