It is interesting to see what the director tried to do with this film. But the problem is that it is not very good. There was no real thing in the film and when the plot was presented well, all the main characters were little in depth and did not worry for any of them. <br /> <br /> Instead of bland (and sometimes badly bad) the picture leaves a little bit wanting but I think you can't expect a lot from people who are doing just a low-budget film for its heck. It is the right to explore the film and compare it to other films. But alas, one must do. They are, not very good. And compared to others, it is still not very good. But it is not out of its good points! I liked the plot. It was built very well and closed well at the end. Sometimes in the dark real events, it has created a fascinating feeling too. However, finally the film was not interesting. The characters are pretty much unavailable and we don't care for any of them. Any of them can die, but it is possible to erase the last "ministers" since very early.
