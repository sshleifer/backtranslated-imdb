What? It remake og Thing (1982/1951), I think it is, there are many reasons to explore the original films. <br /> So acting is bad, James Spader does a great job Join again with stars, and his bottle of coffee and his strange ideas / movements, but that's about it, other actors don't even know. You can't get a sense of knowing any of the main characters. And the conspiracy of the plot is slow, negligent and, yah know what it likes to delight in 30mins. Logo / music is high, imean there are many people with ubertist out there that would make a mark for coke and credit, but this is a great crap. Some special effects are good, if they were made early in 90. If you like Slimy Visitors, interesting and exciting, do not worry about this movie. Her little mix of Thing, guest 3, outbreak and some of Jerry Bruckheimer / Michael Bay production have gone really bad. Now this mix will be cold as somone knew where they do, and alone in this production that you knew was, no. Even though I found it worse, I could not get this film back to anyone, but if you like one cool night, and you just want to see something, time, slow.
