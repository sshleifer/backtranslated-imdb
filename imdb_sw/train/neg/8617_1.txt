After watching 10 minutes of this movie I was worried, after watching 30 minutes my fingers were ringing - I could not just believe: movies are very bad. In fact it is so bad, that I should watch everything just to be sure (!). At this time, I came to realize that it reminds me of a Danish group called comedies from the age of 60 and 70. The example is as follows: Take one very popular player, perform a script to put this competitor in most interesting conditions, add a joke (especially liners one), and the unique and beautiful young people - that film, and you succeed! I don't know if this film was successful, but unlike the Danish customs that were silent (with very few players) it seems that there is a market for this kind of film in the United States.
