I knew I was going to see a small movie budget, but I expected more from Alex Cox's film. Acting with two leading men was terrible, especially a white boy. The girl should win the Oscar compared to the two. This movie was filled with what I think would be in the joke for the film industry people and a few other jokes that I really understood and made me laugh loudly, which is normal. Without this time of laughter I would give this film 2/10. What happened to Alex Cox who made all the classic 80s? There was a number of questions I had after the movie was over. Why did a Mexican boy go home to someone else at the beginning? What did the woman say she had 100 people were dismissed from her last job? Why had he broken his things when he was hanging around him? I think I would like to go to Q&A after the film, but I didn't want it at 10am.
