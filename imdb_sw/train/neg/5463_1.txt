I saw Arthur (a series of TVs and books) years ago and never was a fun show too much (if you're a fan of this cartoon, sorry if I destroyed for you, but this is really what I think) Many people liked, but I wasn't . <br /> <br /> The school actors seemed to have fought all the time (especially Arther and DW), they were happy each other, but gradually I was tired and a glance of complain to Arthur for everyone and his sister DW (even so the name is written), and the DW was ADHD (or ADD) - as a 4-year-old sister of Arthur who sometimes claimed (which could be why Arthur got angry with what he had to do with his, as a friend of thinking and The collection of animals packed with things), Arthur's friends did as young people rather than what they were in Arthur's books, and parents, well, did not care too much. The great cartoon was the modern life of Rocko, not Arthur (no mistake).
