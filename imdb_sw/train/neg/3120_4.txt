I wasn't quite sure to expect from the "Night listener" and I have never heard until I see him covering the video video. However, the film is very effective when it comes to suspension and tension. Sometimes it draws a bit, but helps keep you wondering what will happen and most importantly: time. As the film goes on, the character played by Robin Williams gets a certain "cat and mouse" spiel to the point where he has emerged and sought the truth and the presence of a 14-year-old child who did not have the abuse ever seen in someone. The Night listener is an interesting story, which is good in creating doubts in the movie and you are very much placed in the dark of who is lying and what really. However, ultimately it is a kind of desire and does not live up to the potential that can be. It does not give you a detailed explanation or preference about the other great character, which would be beneficial and interesting.
