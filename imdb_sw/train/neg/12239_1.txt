When I was eight I was a big fan of fighting. It doesn't matter what federation I looked at. WWE, WCW, USWA. For me the point is all I have looked at. It was my 19th birthday, and I was expecting to pay another for a glance. But this time. I was wrong. Rather that night was one of the best wrestlers from Canada a real man fell to his death because of the stunt did not go wrong. Not much you can do to change the situation. But what happened to the death of Owens made me very much. Instead of finishing pay for each view and doing the right thing as WWE people decided to protect what was coming first and that was money to keep paying each view such as Owens death did not happen. <br /> <br /> I gotta tell you. Vince Mchmaon has made stupid decisions in his life but this was far from a stupid decision that he had ever made. <br /> <br /> With this trick to say Owen would have wanted to pay a pew to see it. Give me a break. When someone dies in a pew to pay for his feelings of stopping. That is the police officer who hijacked a runner or a runner and then let someone die to get home and call it a day if the mans life has never been considered. But nothing is happening. Owen will die and thanks to the records of all the times you have given us.
