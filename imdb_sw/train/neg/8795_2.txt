I saw all the features of redemption in this movie. The only thing I saw was the difficulty of Quentin Tarantino who was considered insane ... There are other attractive women in this film and maybe that's a good quality. In general, however, I have found this film of surgery and ignorance. The hand made by the film and the slow motion and other movie documents I found and surpassed, even scared. In general, music was frightening and more severely recurring and also reminds us of the American military psychology against various obstacles. The various Vignettes that created the film are not heard in their placement and unsuitable and are not resolved in their content and "conclusions." Movie made (not realistic, the word I saved for true art) that left me a bad feeling. Don't believe different people who try and wipe this as a "romantic comedy" although there are definite features of this film rejecting in content, form, and ending any relationship with this type. <br /> <br /> I advise to stay away despite positive views of IMDb and other ratings sources.
