I have finished watching this film. It wasn't ridiculously bad, but I've been very disappointed with it. I'm not sure why someone would make a film like this. It was a little entertainment, but I feel like people who made it were very different about what they did. On Monday, the author had been in charge; Tuesday, the director; Wednesday, someone who gets coffee; etc. It almost seems like they wanted to do different movies, but only had time and money to make one. Another person said that acting was very good, but I would like to disagree. Then again, if the executives were able to keep the face straight when hiding the image, maybe they are better actors than I give them credit to. <br /> <br /> The back of the DVD gives the impression that the movie would have been hidden ... something in terms of the Law and Councils Act or National Treasury. It takes like that, but then, without anywhere it takes to turn towards the bad part of the Twilight Zone, or ... it was what another show that was not good ... The wrong period of Outline borders. <br /> <br /> My main complaint on the film is that it's just played out. There is a bad white man. There is a love interest, which, when he appears first, the wind blows with his hair. Great. Once you realize it is a Christian movie, the end is also easy to see. The movies are not well done, especially in the opening events - the way to keep your foot better. It was not angry with many films, but there was a constant bad shot of an old woman, praying, weapons in the dark room when the lighting caused - a kind of thing that just makes you a little shy to look at the film.
