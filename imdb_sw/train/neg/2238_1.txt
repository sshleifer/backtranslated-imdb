Video quality is bad. The quality of the sound is good. Acting is awesome. The discussion is painful. Lighting is bad. Editor is laughable. I could continue, but without meaning. Snitch'd is a third-rate video of a video made as a feature film. This is the best left to collect dust in the video bargain video bar.
