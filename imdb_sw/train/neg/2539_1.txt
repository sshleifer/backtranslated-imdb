It should be one of the worst films of the 35mm film film that has been released to the public, sequel for the original pseudo-documentary entertainment film "The Legend of Boggy Creek". Wrong script, bad act, etc., Dawn Wells was hoping that Gilligan would come to save him and take this island again to avoid this piece of trap.
