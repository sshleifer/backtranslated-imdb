This is more likely to play what I saw - several times in action without the film. <br /> <br /> A very good idea to set up - South America can provide a reliable background for extreme reaction all-round defendant's feelings. <br /> <br /> But the action! Widdoes is the best Beatrice who performs especially poor. Waterston, a good actor, is not much better like Benedict. The worst performance is in the role of Don John - it makes Keanu Reeves look good. Perhaps the desire to make a caricature along the line of villain who has tied a girl to track trains suited with caps capstone the caps of Dogberry and her men - but acting makes you want to cringe. Starting success includes the area where Benedict fools believe Beatrice loves him - he was capable of being good. But the use of the river and the visual impression of Benedict walking around is well produced. In general I needed to insist on watching but surely he did not look at her. <br /> <br>> very disappointed. Based on the last comment on me is about 40. I have been looking at the features of the screen with Shakespeare for over 2 decades. you are not strong enough because of the truth. I can assume though, from your confusion about young people, that you are old enough where the effectiveness of the past days is more than your taste. My favorite personal way was Rylance and McTeer at London stage. Unlike Widdoes, McTeer, an experienced and charismatic actor, can act.
