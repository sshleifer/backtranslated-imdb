Within 15 minutes, my whole family was rooted in the behavior of Goldie Hawn die, or at least for Steve Martin's attitude to leave him. For 40 minutes, we extinguished it. There are only a couple of movies for the year we are trying to turn out to be very angry that we can't even have a long stomach for a story to be introduced. Naturally I love both Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn, and I remember enjoying the nature of Neil Simon. So I blame Marc Lawrence and Sam Weisman. Mix the director of "Whats Worst That Could Happen" by the author of "Miss Congeniality 2", and I think this is what we end up with.
