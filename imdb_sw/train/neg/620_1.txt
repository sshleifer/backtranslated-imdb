I saw this not too long, and I must say: This movie is awesome. I am looking for fun movies for fun. Scarecreow is not recommended. Scarecrow is stupid. You have a wonderful villain that enjoys screaming if he kills its victims (actually worse than that in this sentence). He has a hard story that he uses to justify his murder. "Everyone takes me. The only girl who thinks I'm not a trailer-garbage likes one of the guys that pick on me I want to kill everyone." Okay, I multiply. But the established of this movie alone is enough to put it under the list of crappy movies. Adding to what I have just said, the mother of the child is a prostitute, she comes to her mother and her current partner finds it, the mother of the mother tells her to leave, the child refuses, insisting she will not leave her home. The partner throws the child out of the grain field. Kills the baby right before the mother, the mother screams in fear, her boyfriend is like, "OMG! I didn't mean!" Then she tells the mother not to tell the police this. Slightly killed under scarecrow, though. Therefore, if any child who gets a murder under a scarecrow, returns as scarecrow killers and revenge. His victims "have never talked like this before ..." (Line of the official Scarecrow ruling) To do the worst, this film was done in 8 days less. That's true, 8 days. I was going to give you this movie 2, because despite itself, it has one or two times the redemption. (They are the perpetrators, so I will not destroy you, if you want to see this trick.) I could be forgiven a bad act, a special tragedy, a script of abysmal, and a bad job of the camera, but I am not only polite for the lack of effort on that level. This video is not suitable if I do it. If you want to see an example of how to make a film, or if you like to enjoy bad movies, if I am, then look at this for your own risk. Everyone else should stay away from this movie at all.
