The boy of this film had me misled. I honestly thought it would be filmy horror film without completely humor in it anything, the boy I got a cool shoulder at that time. This movie was, and I am really, very good. It was not terrible yet, but humor and humor really humiliates this interesting movie. Some of the horrific genocide and murder that were painful were very painful to watch, I was almost laughing how bad it was, but somehow I enjoyed it. These killings are all related to snow and Christmas games, which made things more amazing. POV cameras were amazing. <br /> <br /> The movie is about a sharp killer who dies to a car crash and a truck truck when he is taken to prison. He is later resurrected in the same chemicals with snow printed on the mix. These are the selected ingredients to make a bright snowman striker. He would rather take revenge, as a host of snow, to a police officer who judged him. This game had a very serious act, except Christopher Allport, that's interesting. I will tell you that I am also disappointed that this movie was not afraid, but in fact it is a dark sitcom. They had a good story for a good plot but it didn't happen right. All in all I love the movie at first but now it is very irritating. But this film is the most effective and blackest way than the series.
