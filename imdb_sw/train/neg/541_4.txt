I found this film to be very unusual. From getting so much I found it very difficult to love this film, and now after thinking a little about it I can very explain why. Jean-Marc Barr, though I love him for bits (I think Zentropa is one of the best movies made) is miscast here, and although I can't think of the life of me who would be better, I'm sure someone could take his place easily and make this film work . Everything else is good, but with the beat of a weak comedy (A Meet The Joke Parents is not really needed, filmmakers!) And I like Richard E. Grant as the Great German. It's just facing one thing. Jean-Marc.
