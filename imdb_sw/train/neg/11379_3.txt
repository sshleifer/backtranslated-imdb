When I first saw a small area in some ads, I thought that the show would be a fun watch. Robot little man looks looking kinda cute. The type of animation does not look familiar with some of the classic shows. Before the show was shown, I read through other sources. There, I was shocked. Three children (Tommy, Gus and Lola) say correctly but Robotboy is an exception. It would be great if he had to be shown by a young man. One good example is Robot Jones, a robot character from "Something happened to Robot Jones?" The version is not true. But Robotboy's way is not badly criticized. So, I don't see much.
