When I count myself to be a fan of the TV series 5 of the TV, the original movie which introduced the series was a weak start. Although many features that later grew up with many more restrictions in the series there, the speed of the Assembly is slow, the preparation was not enough, and the thought that incorporated. Such a bad, reputation in the first place is bad. Although the ratings chart shows that many fans wish to stop these problems, I remember the nearly close meeting to find out what was fast becoming a fascinating series.
