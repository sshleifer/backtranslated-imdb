I have to admit that I am a great fan of this show, so you must know how I was disappointed when I saw this film. First, the plot was so bad, I thought it would be something more interesting, like to see what happened to Arnold, or something more, but NOOOOOOO, maniac wants to destroy Arnold's house, among many other places, many people try to stop this. I must admit that the plot was not bad after all, but what motivated it was the action that Arnold and his friends did to stop this maniac, they became friends of spy; they run (according to video game, for God), and even more of everything, it makes a big deal on the bus, things that most people had tried and died, but not Arnold, Gerald and Helga, because they are professionals in video game. Really, my mother, my sister, even I have been disappointed after watching this film, because it was the worst way to finish a very good cartoon. I must admit that I was enjoying the "Hey Arnold!", It was one of my cartoons that are very popular at Nickelodeon, but after this film's trick, I don't know if I'm looking at "Hey Arnold!" as I was looking at the past. Another thing Nickelodeon, and a lot of power I can assure you is not a simple road that would have avoided, I think that the whole city can explode with it, oh, and please, if all your future movies will happen like so, don't make more movies, you give them a bad idea for cartoons that were good. In fact, I think this is the worst way to finish this show, a good show was switched to this film.
