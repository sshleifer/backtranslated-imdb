You can think of a few things in the discussion of the demolition of evil, but Spielberg did not deserve to win any Oscar for this piece, and I think the university was the same in voting. (Other Oscars for better selection of actors and such ... that I don't know about. But it would be difficult to justify, given what they were told to do and what you see in the final product.) Spielberg's way this guide is so accessible, so meddlesome. While watching this film, the difference between the film as Art Gallery I took it was shouting: "Feelings are a feeling of trust that is offered faithfully. Sentimentality is sugar and untrue, a false view of life." This is the highest feeling. During real life for two people have ever started reading loudly, such as Celie and Shug Avery when they are sitting in bed going up to a letter from Nettie to find? There are examples of this type of faux character in all films: all men around around Miss Millie's car and then jump together as a flight group leaves when they are going to drive; Harpo falls into the roofs of various buildings that he works (cheap gag sack); The whole group of readers guided by Jook Joint en masse to the church, as if magically facing the singing of the singers ... continue to proceed. No real ring. I asked myself whether Harpo's name was deliberately chosen because it was the name of his wife, Sophia, "Oprah," back. Spielberg is not on "cuteness." It is not that Spielberg cannot act honestly and emotionally. Schindler's list was amazing, touching me deeply, and I'm very happy to save Private Ryan also for its authenticity, even if the story is a little bit available.
