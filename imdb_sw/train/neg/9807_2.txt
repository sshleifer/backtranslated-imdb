I rarely give a review of the rave on the show or film I do not like IMDb, but Mighty Morphin Power Rangers are just a terrible pain, it's terrible. <br /> <br /> I would like to be interested as this has been a series of animated - it would be better in that way I think, but as a show-action show, it shows 'cheesy' and 'campy' words. The Power Rangers are. A lot of colors, spandex are wearing young war warriors using their military skills. Dress is bad - it looks like something that remembers the fighters and field players and gymnasts of women wear. Acting is surprising, and the fight is so amazing and so lame look, it makes Jean-Claude Van Damme, looking like the same as Bruce Lee, which is under stage by itself. In fact, they seem to jump and play up; if it was a 'Nutcracker' version, or they were doing ballet, rather than fighting. Besides, there are cartoons that include military art and are still done in a fun-but not cheesy way that makes it seem romantic. <br /> <br /> Children show or not, this is just a limp and close to deviation. And although this version has been placed in America, you can be forgiven to think that when you look at some of the warring settings that weren't made in the United States, but instead of Japan; so some fighting and 'bad' were borrowed from the Japanese-only version to be juxtaposed on the American version. <br /> <br /> If you would like this type of thing, then close with Sentai - the same Japanese.
