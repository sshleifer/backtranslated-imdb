This crap is like to paint a dry color. I was disappointed because I was determined to see it. There is simply no sense for this film. If it has never been done, no one will see or care. It is made because of all the great names in it, but if "nobody" was in, no one would miss this film anytime. Overall, I was where half the way through the film I would like to watch Vanessa Redgrave and think, "Quick and die ready!" This is like "Happy Club Club" without any fun of the friggin. It is a "13th Sea" (not just a great name) of mother-daughter movies and anti-weather ... oh to the end finally. <br /> <br /> I am sure they will be all nominations for Oscars ... <br /> - 4 stars for movies and the ability to persuade great executives to do on this junk.
