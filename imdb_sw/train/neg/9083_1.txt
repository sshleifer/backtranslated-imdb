It was very scary. It was not fun to enjoy it completely. Even the place where a girl uses a vibrator, however it is not fun to watch this film. I say again, the place that the girl does masturbating and the vibrator is not even worth looking. Or maybe that's the only part of the movie you watched, the girl just on the bed using the vibrator. Maybe they should have just released one event on the movie, perhaps then the movie will be fun to a certain level. My advice, keep up with that point, look at, re-turn the film, look again, repeat, repeat. Maybe you can have fun for 2 hours that way. This film works with me to spit on your grave and the penalty generation in the worst movie I saw.
