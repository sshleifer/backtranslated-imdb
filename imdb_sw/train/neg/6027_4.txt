I was a Baptist and I know this movie story is trying to tell you, although I don't believe the story again. I will give you a kudos film for being as good as the Modern Life Week Movie. A pleasant, embarrassing task, gradually, the script predicts, music is sappy, and is a bit of melodramatic. And all the people left behind should be pure non-Christian squeakiest, forever. Not one word of curses from any of them. But I laughed loudly when the actor played a person who runs the United Nations "nuclear" as "nu-cu-ler," as Bush. Is there another Christian principle of respect which the authority that since Bush says he, too, is called by God, that all Christians should hide his ignorance by losing the word according to him? LOL! In fact I had a hard time taking a film for weight at all after that. After the event of "nu-cu-ler", the movie began to feel like a planned propaganda, caused. I was looking for a brave thing. True, I was looking for something that would make me think, but I didn't get it here. If you are looking for entertainment without mind, stop here - it's good to kill daylight. But if you're looking for a mind, look elsewhere.
