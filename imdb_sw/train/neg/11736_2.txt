Juma before I saw Iowa, I saw the secret of the School of Art, which a prudent student makes a film and cannot decide whether he wants to be art or abuse. Iowa could be a film he made. I can see the features of the best movie in Iowa's spun kill - Spun and Born Born. However, with skill, these two movies had a good development of character and story lines. Iowa. This movie is facing the end of moving. I admit that it was consistent. This movie is bad from beginning to end and not worse or better in any place. All actors did what they could. Roseanna Arquette deserves more. He shows that he is very talented, very attractive, and very happy. But why he should show in this ball of turd.
