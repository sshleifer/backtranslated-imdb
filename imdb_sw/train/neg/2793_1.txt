This step up there on my top list of the worst movies I've seen so far on Starz on Demand. They seem to take each one to the DVD-craest-fest can get and put it here. Why? Who knows! It seems anyone who has a digital camera and a budget may come up with a terrible movie and put it on TV. To be honest, this seems awesome since when I saw the trailer - but I have given the real opportunity. <br /> <br /> I always try to have an open mind on movies under budget. Some of the best movies that have ever seen are the films that work around their small budget or in other circumstances are needed to make a smaller budget better. This is not one of those movies. <Br /> <br /> You know the plot right now, I'm sure, if you read this. If you have heard about it in Starz on Advice or for any reason you live on this page out of weight. It's about a compassionate and whiny girl we know for every 3 minutes in the music video of "heavy metal". Anyone who puts together must think it seems attractive, but in fact, it's not really good. However, he himself commits suicide. Then he has someone. Then some murder begins. It is not really memorable and it is quite tense and it sucks as much as possible. When the first gun comes out of his house is a very loud sound like a pop pop popcorn. Was the best effect of the sound that could come up with? I could get a good sound effect to use for free, (without copyright,) on the web ... right. now. Do not let other reviews claiming this is a 10-star movie you are scoring. They are definitely being a film supplier or maybe even a director trying to make you think this piece of junk is worth buying. Laughable.
