I expected a very interesting movie. Instead, I got a film with a few funny jokes, and many that didn't work. I did not like the idea of ​​bringing the descendants of Sherlock Holmes and Moriarty. It was a mixing. It would have been much easier if they had a new person, instead of Moriarty raised. Some items were funny. Burt Kwouk was very surprising, as always. McCloud on the horse was funny. McGarrett from Hawaii 5-0 was not like McGarrett-like. Connie Booth is very obvious for accents. She is from Indiana, but played English and New Yorker very well. Unfortunately, it was not widely presented in the script. I expected the most interesting film. Instead, I got a confused movie instead of a bad script. Instead of surprising, since Booth and Cleese were together on this. Perhaps they were about to stop at 77.
