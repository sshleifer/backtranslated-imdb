Horror Movies. About an old old painter who relies on a little girl. Decay. Tatum O Neil goes through its parts, and has corniest lines in the history of the film. Richard Burton appears close to death in this film, and we should believe it looks "Good for sixty". Acting is bad, as is the plot. The characters are bad, as is the story. It is very difficult to feel anyone in this film, except Larry Ewashen who plays with a boy at the porno who plays Tatum, he's a kind of funny. This movie is a waste of time. If you are a fan of Tatum, like me - that's why I made the first place - please don't see this movie. He is very bad in it, and you will wonder if maybe PAPER MOON had a wind. It was not, because the NEW NEWS BEARS and LITTLE DARLINGS are known that they can do well, but still, don't lose this film. And if you're a fan of Burton, hiring something when he was looking good, and not fat.
