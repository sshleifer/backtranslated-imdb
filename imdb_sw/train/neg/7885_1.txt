I believe in keeping religion outside the government and outside the cinema. When I need a sermon, I will go to church, but I don't want one from the film. I don't care about some common themes, (after all, religion is about as much as you can get!) But this movie had a lot of sermons in it that I was quite angry. The homeowner reminded the witches who have appeared in other movies. The bad man even seemed to have a horn. The end of folly: The hero entered the meeting and cried to all the elders, and that broke the spell. If only life was simple. I think when the movies are stupid, they should be distributed to a warning: DANGER! Preach the Existence!
