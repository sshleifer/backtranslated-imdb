Martin Kosleck's unique chronology brings some belief in his troubled character. He damages his discussion with the abnormal sense of origin, and makes Marcel's painter a man of influence. Characteristics can reach as a real person and not too much of the film B. <br /> <br /> Story line is not something to write at home, and many events have decreased. What works is a wonderful chemistry between Kosleck and Rondo Hatton as Creeper. Kosleck's talking, the characteristic of the philosophy is compared to the bottom of the Hatton, the monosyllabic method. Creeper's character has not been made more than the basic monster level, but Hatton shows an unlikely potential development and makes you wonder about its past story. <br /> <br /> This movie was on the Theater very much when I was a child, and so I am very happy for that reason. It is worth seeing once, however, for those who enjoy the Scary Times.
