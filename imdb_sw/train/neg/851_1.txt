After completing the book that day I watched the movie, I knew what should happen. I had great prospects for the film, because of the rating. The only reason I fear this movie 2 out of 10 is that it was trying to try to be a film. I have the great disgusting features of this movie. SPAILERS ********** <br /> 1 Compose. Jack Nicholson did not agree with the character of Jack Torrence. Also, I would not take Shelly Duvall to Wendy. I mentioned Wendy very different. I can see why they took Jack Nicholson though, grin, existing eyebrows, but should not look really 'evil'. He should appear normal, and turn to evil. It also makes one of the worst of the filmmakers. Danny was the same, he needed more life though. He made a way to drink. <br /> <br /> 2. Screenplay. They rejected many things that were in the book, adding things. Some of the content in the book I was looking for in the film was deleted, changed, or handled badly. Some of the things that were in the book I was expecting to see (the flower of the flower, the rocket mallet, the elevator) were not in the film, and it was about 2 and a half !! I was very angry. <br /> <br /> 3. Last. Finally it was completely changed, Halorann died, Jack froze die, Wendy never had no harm ... The Overlook did not hit. At last it was so cold in the book, and the movie destroyed it so horrificly, I was gone. Hallorann never died, but Jack killed him with copper. If they wanted to kill him, at least have Jack uses a roque. You have never seen the mallet of the roque during the entire movie. There are some things I didn't like about the film, but there are things that are right. The angel of the cameras were cold, the blood from the elevator (not in the book) was cold, but perhaps I was also angry that the movie did not go with the book, to try to be totally afraid. I agree to read the book, before you see this film. I praise Stephen King for actually agreeing to sign an agreement against Stanley Kubrik again. I have never done that, I would take all the rights that I could get to comfort the whole day. I can't wait to see 6 hours, at least has a flower of the flower. Rating: 2/10
