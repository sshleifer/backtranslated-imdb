Jonathan's rivers (Michael Keaton) suddenly becomes a widow when his wife dies. Recently, she is close to Dr Price, an Electronic Voice Phenomena (EVP) expert, who says she has received a message from Jonathan's wife leaving Anna through many electronic gadgets. Does Anna try to tell Jonathan something? What? This is just something of something on a large amount of cosmic or otherworldly? It is good to see Keaton in the role of leading, but the story he holds is lowered and uncomfortable with points; it's like the film doesn't know how to answer any questions that bring up, so it convinces the viewer for new, related questions. Keaton himself is a good, well-regarded as a lost widow struggling to communicate with his late wife. She grew up as an actor, allowing the roles of the friendly hackers-hijinks played 15 years or more earlier. He seems a little craggy, and maybe more wrinkles than one can expect, but he loses no lie and panache that he has shown during his quarter of a century in Hollywood. So not that Keaton returns for good performance, it's that the script itself resembles. Written by Niall Johnson, the plot gets more mixed when it is going on, every way of suffering that lives in another terrible way. These are good and good if the way leads to some kind of acceptable sign, something that connects everything more or less together and defines ... something. But it's not the White Voice; I knew a little about what happened to Jonathan than I first saw him. Keaton is the only reason to look at this junk, although it gets good support from Ian McNeice (like Dr. Price) and Deborah Kara Unger as a mandatory love interest.
