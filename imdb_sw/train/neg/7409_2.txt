There are some features that preserve this film as a general catastrophe, but it is shaded by evil holes, holes, deus ex machina cast, stupid chat, weak script, and expected clich√©s ... here is a terrible movie with a story story that goes anywhere in a lot of time. A group of improbable heroes including the first black man (yes, the picture seems to be alive even in Finland), seems to have problems trying to leave the open hospital. There are ghosts that have been very aggressive (very thoughtful), zombies (at one time I thought at least they did not use zombies, but they came), with a Glam-rock Finnish band and demon protests, entering their way. There is also a change of doodle, but it doesn't add anything to the story. A personal and hobby girl seems to be more aware of the situation, but they do not give to the viewer, or their confused friends. Their line includes only good ideas of life lessons such as: "What will happen will happen ..." or "Light can't live in the dark ..." or worse "I need a red crayon ... red crayon." So all the characters (including dad and worried by a good doctor in the form of stress) end up around around them dark floor, and from error or to demons. Often the spirit or group of zombies reflects, and if it seems to be the spiritual simplicity he cannot see a group of six that comes towards it, raising a flashlight and talking, it was just pretending. And it seems that this demon can break through the walls without a lot of trouble, but the door of the elevator opening can not afford it. At the end we find even "all of them were dreams". Or maybe it wasn't. O, the boy I would like this movie was, and that kind of time makes it seem to move to so fast so it looks out just 10 minutes or so ...
