In fact, it is difficult to comment after reading what is here but I feel I must say something. Not particularly looking 'splatterfest' as someone puts it or even 'blood and guts / gore'. I have respect for the families of the victims though I felt that the film manufacturer did not. - They were without name, meaningless and useless. The only tool of Dahmers sexual antics. I watched this film with a kind of curiosity that makes me think 'What makes the boy a serial killer?' as well as ask yourself about the story of Dahmer, which I know very little. People here seem to think that the film is not worth giving birth to the story of Dahmer .. I.E. Its history, what happened when it happened, the results, etc. but it is important! See, I think if you're America you will know all this. We are not all living in America. Describing this story about someone as he was, he needs that at least some history and real events are told / shown. This does not mean blood and guts, there are ways to show horrible things in the film by linking or copying a clever picture without using a year. Without even touching on some of what he did (I realized more about him reading the user's comments on this site!), Movie felt like it didn't exist. Time with time and very little substance. I would like to know if there is a film about REAL Dahmer because for its lack of direction, the speed of speed that does not get flexible, displayed in wonder for homosexuality and a great lack of luck of any last attempt, this movie is normal. I can't recommend to anyone that they waste time it takes to look at it. Certainly 1 out of 10 (for acting!)
