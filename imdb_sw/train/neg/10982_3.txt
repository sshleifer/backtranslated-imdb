Modern time had a good and good time (although it is clear the low budget), but a bad rating based on the foundation base is being poorly developed. The main point of the conflict between the two guidelines is not in the best way. There are few instances where they are unacceptable for this reason, but no deep discussion of how they can be together when seeing a very different world, especially since the work of Glenn has been destroyed in this part of her life (and Adam works enough to be he supports it for a time and money.) Also, several times Glenn is shown badly by the way that he is (asking for forgiveness for his period) when Adam is shown to be good and “traditional,” which the film declares to be "good". at the end. I don't like to be preached like that. I attended a discussion session with the director after looking at the LTR, and said that he presented these battles between them because, if he was in Glenn's shoes (and said that he makes real life related to Glenn's perspective) that he can't have someone else with an opinion of Adam. So, I think she would have to do a better job to explain how Glenn could do in the film. Also, the director said he directed this, his first movie, after reading (Redirecting to Dummies.) Redirect is not bad, but far from the above effort. I have seen the worst, but I rarely leave movies to hear this sad.
