It is a real challenge to make a film about a baby sown by a wild plant and a mother accused of murder but against all this problem is successful. Meryl Streep provides a lively, lively, lively, but with comic knowledge that makes you laugh as much as a mother struggles with the last fear. <br /> <br /> If the comedies on babies are being eaten by dogs are not your cup of tea you may be worried to look at this and, yes, it is an unusual choice of topic for farce but a very little bit of movies has nothing do with that if it aims to provide Streep display for its Aussie accent and facial deviation. Throwing into slam in the media preferences and sensitivity and real apathy or morality gives them the opportunity to do something that is not wrong.
