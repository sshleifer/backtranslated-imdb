I just saw Gretchen Mol in two other films (Girl 6, Donnie Brasco), and did not remember, but did a good job as a stupid girl who asked for pictures because it made people happy. He did not think the truth he was doing was right, even when he left the business and sought religion again. Images that he made were already full of today's standards, and are funny to see men and cameras getting all the excitement, and politicians are showing pornography. David Strathairn (Good Night, and Good Luck) played a big part here. Mary Harron (American Psycho) wrote with the best biopic guide of the most famous pinup ever.
