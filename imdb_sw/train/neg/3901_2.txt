The script is good. The dress was not seen as some from the High Highbury community. Comparing Gwyneth Paltrow with Kate Beckinsale I can only say that Mrs. Beckinsale speaks better with English English than Mrs Paltrow, although in Mrs. Paltrow's acting is the life of Emma Woodhouse. Mr. Northam of course is Mr. Knightley's best of all versions, he is romantic and not all bright-looking and unfeeling as Mr. Knightley in the TV-version. P.S. The viewer cannot see Mr. Elton-Ms. The development of Smith's relationship as it was on the motion version, so one cannot understand where Emma tried to make the Elton-Smith match (instead of pictures).
