True? ???? I know if you are making a political battle you will see but this film was just a trash. Horrible for every sense. It satisfies in many ways. I had the easiest time to accept the US president engaging, fighting a fighter jet, and beat the shot aliens. It is easy to identify a few things that are correct. My jaw dropped when I saw one person says that this film was better in the past 25 years. It had been overthrown, the reduction of seemingly insignificant programs, and had a movie of the truth sometimes. <br /> <br /> X-box, YouTube, ACUPAT services? Does anyone think that these things are not in 2004? Not as much as you needed to do a thorough study, it was only five years before this film. I am a war in Iraq and if you spend one day with a group of babies or EOD squad you would like to see how B.S. This movie is. Compare this with Platoon or Save Private Ryan is hard. Why don't you just throw Commando and Red Dawn there too; I think those can be more appropriate. If for some reason you see an unspecified compound, historical and real distinctions, then this movie can be the same. No extra. If you continue to hear "Buzz Oscar", and you must add your human review, go ahead. For my part, I write a director to see if I can turn back 131 minutes.
