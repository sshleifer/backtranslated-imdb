In many films I have seen Warren Oates, I have come to a definite conclusion, here is one talented person. I first saw Mr. Oates in the 1960 television series Stoney Burke. From then on, I followed his work closely and I felt he had done a great job. That happened in 1974, when Sam Peckinpah gave him a high bills in a film called 'Niletee's head of Alfredo Garcia.' Of course, his great claim to popularity was his great role in the 'Wild Bunch'. I have been thinking he had great power to bring any magic, that's until I've seen him in this flop. The movie is called "Chandler", tax for fisted explorers of the 1950s designed by Raymond Chandler. Because, the synopsis said it was on a hard nose Private self, I was immediately interested. However, I remained patient through the entire film and I found that it was bad, surprising, slow, distorted speed, a mixture that would have a theme or plot should be left in the back of the dark private room. With some of the most beautiful Hollywood stars, such as Alex Dreier, Mitch Ryan, Gordon Pinsent, Charles McGraw, Richard Loo and Scherman Crothers, this film was able to reach up to five, however, announced on the launch and did not go anywhere. . As a result, one of my actors likes to get stuck in a bad car that does not come out. **
