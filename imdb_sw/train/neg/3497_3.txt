Unfortunately for Sara Silverman this show should not be thanked yet. Character quality is not even far away from the situation where you think "oh he is such as i love him" just "he is ab * such". This attribute is quite clear of self-righteous, meaning, b * sarah seems to be difficult to bring this show because she is only half funny one in it.Mood, all the conversations are so born boring and dry is like listening to your grandmother continue with the top of the marble he collected as a child. Sarah's Silverman's program is so horrible that I was thinking of changing the channel so that it looked back to the old couple and something that is surprising because the characters are "evil" and "angry". I am sorry but I do not see a full-blown show and overcome the lines of the story about the fury of anger, bitterness, anger, anger of life and anger as a sister of hell and gay friends who seem like Keanu Reeves and cool anywhere around for funny .I can't stand this show though generally I find Sarah Silverman that "I love her reason she is ab * character character" like at the Rock School, and many of it stand up. I think this show is interesting and characters who think that mean and say and do things for the shock value for example. A regular pube, diarrhea and $ hit in general for a laugh.Sharadi Silverman program tries to be funny and fails it either need a track track or a better writers.Soneone compared to South Park but even around. Sarah's money and will not be a tragic troll that you won't see me being ab ch and always send things like "This show takes" and "Why these aren't deleted yet". as Sarah's Silverman Program if you enjoy it.
