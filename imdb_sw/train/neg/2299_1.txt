Before you start ... I would like to say that I fully believe in God. I believe in Heaven and Hell. Kay now that that out of the way, I just want to say what the world do these morons that call themselves "hosts" they think they are doing? The last time I look at the host has no discrimination, selects the filling sores on the TV, or try to beat their own faith under every evil soul that comes to the center. ALL of these being mad, arrogant, conservative, bible thumping, lover of Fred Phelps Pat Robertson does every day. I'm for free speech, but since when the boy's covering is pretty much says that if you start his best way of life you're certainly sent to hell? This is a perfect example of why religion is the cause of many SOOOO problems. One day in my classroom we had a contributing teacher so we decided to watch television since teaching did not give us any work. And we (against most of us will see) the 700 Club, and of course that Pat Pat was screaming and diving over the Bible, and said Simon in the verses "God says Homosexuality is sin" and I really hear the child going "Hmm I think he is right. " WTF ??? Eagerly, if the host tries to make people think that the other person's sexual orientation is a serious sin, then they need to take the host, wipe their tape, and throw it away from the transport fabric in the middle of the rock.
