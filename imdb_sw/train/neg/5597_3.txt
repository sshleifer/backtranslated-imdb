I will say that at least a movie becomes meaningful, but it's bad. Acting for the most part is not good (just think Sky shows any commitment) and you hear the sensitivity. All exhibitions that are relevant to the most important are very detailed, as when Ng comes from his parents. There are a lot of corny notes, like a tattoo of the kanji on the shoulder of the Sky, magnets on the refrigerator of girls and very beautiful decorations on sets ... and music ... and clothes. True life has never been like this film. The boy says one time "I am gay, not corny." And not understanding. Even the definition is bad, I have prevented it after Ngongea on how she was beaten out of a lesbian play.
