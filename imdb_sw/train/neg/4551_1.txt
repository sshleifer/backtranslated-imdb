I must admit that I don't have a lot of New Age shaped jumbo. People when they "exchange energy" always wonder how much of the kicking up with how it can contribute to the problem of global warming. When energy is "being fulfilled" I always wonder how they could violate the entropy laws and still have no Nobel gifts. When people feel how instinct enables them easily through the hard way of life I wonder how they fail to do something as simple as finding a train station. <br /> <br /> But again, this is not the first movie with holes of conspiracy and many of them get fully acceptable and entertaining. If this was the case with "Celestine Prophecy" I could not burn this movie down, but unfortunately not. Each actor seems to be tired out of his head and can't understand what he needs to do in a place. This leads to "Ah-s" and "Oh-s" many, as I love to do while talking about quantum physics and someone who knows the truth he is talking about and pretending to understand. <br /> <br /> The direction is not updated yet. You can expect something more from a boy who made "What dreams can come", but hey, I thought he was well paid for the job and received a view of New York driver's taxi: "It's your money, buddy." being happy is an adult at all JÃ¼rgen Prochnow. Not only does he have a job, he is one of the few participants in this film that may have a number of prudent cracks in the chatting of the New Life of Eternal Life and the worst. <br /> <br /> This movie is like one of these dinner dates when you know that your date is actually a bad bearing that seems unlikely to be closed. At the same time for a while it seems that the words turn into small ping pong balls that are thrown on your head without breathing until it hurts. If you want to have a good time and you have to choose between this film and connect the safety pin to your device, get my advice: choose the end.
