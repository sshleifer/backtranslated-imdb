Today I've got "All Accepted" on VHS for sale by lease. It was an old and widely used VHS, I had information on this film, but I liked the references listed on its cover: the names of Peter Bogdanovich, Audrey Hepburn, John Ritter and especially Dorothy Stratten attracted me, the price was very low and I decided to risk and sell it. I looked for IMD, and Rating of 6.0 User was the best reference. I looked at "Mick Martin & Marsha Porter Video & DVD Guide 2003" and ?? wow? four stars! So, I decided that I could not waste more time and see it immediately. In fact, I have finished checking "All agreed" and I found a very interesting movie. The characters are made badly, and I spent many minutes understanding their roles in the story. The plan should be funny (personal eyes that fall in love for women chasing them), but I don't laugh at the whole story. Among them, in a big city like New York, is ridiculous. Ben Gazarra as a very attractive and attractive person, and women falling for him as Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas or George Clooney, are very worried. At the end, the major attractions are the presence of dancing and playing with Dorothy Stratten's men, who was killed by her pretty husband after the release of this film, and whose life showed in "Star 80" and "Death Center Center: Story Dorothy Stratten" ; The amazing beauty of Patti Hansen, Mrs Keith Richards later; always wonderful, even fifty-two years old, Audrey Hepburn; and the song "Amigo", from Roberto Carlos. Although I don't like Roberto Carlos, he has become the most famous Brazilian singer since the age of 60 and is called by his fans as "King". I will put this film in my collection just because of these attractions (husband Dorothy Stratten). My vote is four. Headline (Brazil): "Muito Riso and Muita Alegria" ("Most Cutting and Many Fun")
