one of the worst films I have seen to this day. The view of the most beautiful and acting act is not effective. The only positive steps are Gary busey parts but this does not lift the film very much. it extends to the title of the film B and passes the test with the color of the jump. Losing my money though I've got entertainment to start with a disappointment after seeing a few. I don't recommend this film unless you look at it free of charge or gift. (A gift can request a receipt and return to full payment). True BAd. </ 1/1 / / 1/10.
