One of the abundance of slasher which appeared at the beginning of the eight years, Pranks is known only to the early performance by Daphne Zuniga (Sure Thing, The Fly 2); His character dies prematurely, and all the film is impossible. During their Christmas break, a group of students volunteer to open a college building of its furniture. A presumptuous killer, however, gives us an array in the work by fighting a small way for young people directly through a variety of gruesome. Using each stick 'n' slash clich√© in the book, director Jeffrey Kulipa provides a bad and uncomfortable fear that I was asking for characters to be killed, so that I could continue to look for something more. Many deaths (which, let's say, why are we generally looking at this type of film) is short and not just; The only true gris picture comes at the end when the bodies of the survivors have been found by the remaining survivor (there is exactly one that has been damaged by blood? film could be done for more). For the last minute, the film saves itself from the shame of getting the lowest score from me for having a good sense of hopelessness, but this is just one of the producers of slasher.
