This will be temporary. Let me first say that I am mad and not the above things about the people of xtians, especially the elite of xtian. However, this document had a voice of some kind of boy who was angry with his xtian mother by allowing him to play video games. I can not only take it seriously. Describing how CharlesManson saw that it was Christ showing an example that xtianity could produce evil? I do not know it was cheap and child - has led to the opposition that they do not know. Additionally, the author appeared only snobby and engaging. Delivery was more complete. I can't take this document seriously. It can appeal to an angry teenager with a xtian mother by allowing her to play video games.
