Of course that man decided to stop the best movies of all time in my book. This bad text takes a lot of material from the first three films to go even to how people die and what will happen to the future for key characters and basically try to run in three films one by one and fail. It even fails to create a beautiful scenery for one (except the exceptional discrimination in which the music of the music brings to the memory of old films). The only thing we can thank is that there was no Omen V.
