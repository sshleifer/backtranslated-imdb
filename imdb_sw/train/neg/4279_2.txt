I got the DVD "I Dream Of Jeanie" in the $ 1.00 bin in Wal-Mart. When I saw that it was "Stephen Foster's story", as a singer and music teacher, I was seeing it. I didn't know what the year was done for her did not say about the lid, just that it was a remake of 1939 "Sewanee River". Bill Shirley's author's time sometimes hurts, sometimes it is interesting. That person has no testosterone and it's a way to go! I have a hard time believing Stephen Foster thought that the music publishers were offering him permission to publish his songs ... without paying for them! Apart from this idea of ​​ignorance, there is a 20-minute part of Ray Middleton and his black match "Christy Minstrels" making Stephen Foster songs that were difficult to see, to say the least. I can never believe anyone can focus on this suitable movie to revive in our present time. It is embarrassing and should be kept forgetting. Fortunately, Stephen Foster's songs can't forget .... also, the Eileen Christy's look at Jeanie was the highest step in this lowest history of Hollywood history.
