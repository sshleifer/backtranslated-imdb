Why am I watching movies like this? - unless I'm a strange faith of wonders that one day I will see a real gem between these rounds I can't think of one single good reason. This movie was dross from beginning to end - but half a hilarious gold. Where it is in a bad Italian film called dubbed you can get a strong mix of the English language that has been supported like this between the military type of loyalty and the head of the confidential secret files as the "hidden" truth: <br /> < Black Man: Calm is better for us until we can prove that UFOs are not interested in bellicose. <br /> <br /> Host Type: In any event I see your interruption of insults. <br /> <br /> Man Black: Anyone who should force his will is. I plan again the DVD (you know what I mean) was a good half and I still can't make those lines mean anything wise. Another fave line was: "We can be very difficult for those who oppose our interests." <br /> <br /> It is English Jim, but not as we know. The other performances of the best supplier of the movie to me are acting quite off the photographer's character at the beginning. With the most hairy hair of hair IN THE history of everything, the man looked around like a stunning fish on the wig bad until the rapture and forced to look at the piece of Plexiglas and other visitors. Immigrants do not work effectively as a pov-hit camera - hand held camera with a lens of the eyes of the fish - a kind of spooky first time but, often used to lose its power (incidentaly, if it is a Point of View perspective, means visitors always walking out of the back rooms for some reason). <br /> <br /> The film was made "UK". This meant Spanish Italian artists to put several British dishes on several English cars and put the Jack Jack on our card hero's hero ... and that was about him. There is no other attempt to make it look like Britain at all. Lovely love? When Foley's artists did not see that the characters were coming (there was such a word?) They did not start walking on the gravel but now they were in the sand so that their feet could continue to make it "decrease!" sounds. Other than that, another waste of 90 minutes of my life. I hope they prove these UFOs do not mind bellicose soon ...
