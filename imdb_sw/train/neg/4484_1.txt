Once I started to see the posters and heard them talking about this film, I was happy once. Matrix was amazing to see and I couldn't wait to see the second, especially after you started seeing the trailer for other movies. However, when I saw it, I left the playground, just like many other movies on the playground with me. While the action scenes in the movie were strange as always, there were only a few of them. In the first movie, there were frequent clashes that happened, but the second took the initiative to preach (more and unfortunate) of preaching. In general, there was no amount that had no expectations. The machine hit toward Zion with a desire to destroy it (which is not a spoiler, everyone saw it in advertising). The movie talk was quite scary. Unless you are the head of psychology, most likely will not understand more than what is said in the film, and because of it it doesn't matter. It was a romantic movie and showed the events happening in the life and relationship of Neo and the Trinity. Agent Smith, as a bad ass if he was in the first movie, appeared to find all religious naetiy. Personally, I don't need to hear about it or pay money to hear it. The movie was a great waste of my time, and I don't think I can look again first. Talking with the usual and dry daologues from essentially every character has made me lose interest in the film quickly, and a small amount of good fighting events pushed me closer to the edge, and the end of the movie wiping me. Which movie ends and "To End"? How originally they are people. I wonder if the Wachowski brothers had to burn the midnight oil to come with one. In conclusion, the film was bad and that's the end of it.
