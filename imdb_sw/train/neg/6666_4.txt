I really wanted to love this film, but the story is ridicule. I don't want to destroy this film, - don't worry right since you first learned something bad will happen - but here's an example of how this film was not created. Cowboy and "Twig" climbs the village. Cowboy has a mustache bar. Cowboy and "Twig" penetrates into the shot and running half way down the rock. Cowboy is clean shaved through out of all the film. Sometimes between gun fighting and ride down the cowboy mountain has had time to shave, in the dark, behind the horse. <br /> <br /> Be fair, act for the four main characters is strong.
