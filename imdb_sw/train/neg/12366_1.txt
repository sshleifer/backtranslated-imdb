"War of Delivery" is the worst thing that can happen to classic characters created by Chuck Jones. "Loony Tunes" have many versions and different versions, some were good, others are not much but "Jews" are worse. There was no similarity with the original characters and the stories are boring and badly made. New designs are bad and animation is sad. This just shows it doesn't work .This awesome animation of this animation is a complete failure and this should not be anything more than a bad joke. Lame! Star zero
