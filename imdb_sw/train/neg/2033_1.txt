If I could give them less than 1 I'd like to. Don't bother the lease; if someone gives you a DVD to destroy it. <br /> <br /> This is a terrible decision of the film. The total destruction of digital "film". I have found the best on Youtube made by 12-year-old boys. Lommel claims that he has written this, if so he is a common case of a person who has not read in two languages. The story line does not exist, the chat is screaming, the camera function is some kind of experimental test and cut by nonsensical to fly completely unrelated to the transportation screens or some kind of abnormal angry woman. <br /> <br> Usually I can follow a conspicuous plot or see the purpose in the "creative" film - I love David Lynch. It goes far beyond my limited ability to understand or it is quite clear. I think this is "lets you see if we can grab a head that will soon come and make a wonderful impression on it and see if we can grab the bucks work." <br /> <br /> I can't see why Lionsgate even bothered this. It doesn't mean anything, it's bad I can't rent any other to the same director.
