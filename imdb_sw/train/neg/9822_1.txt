There were times when the movies I wanted I would be beaten to death. The only reason I endured all of the movie was because I couldn't believe how bad it was and I think it must be better. This was really a terrible film. I was afraid that I lost what seemed like 4 hours of my life that I would never come back. Two more hours I spent mourning when losing. Please recommend this film to anyone who wants to be tortured and tell them the concerns they will kill.
