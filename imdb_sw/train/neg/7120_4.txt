I saw this film first on MST3K. And though I laughed a posterior off in joke, I wasn't particularly thinking this movie was very bad. Certainly it was a little hard to understand it completely clear budget, but it was a very conspiracy of Hitchcock and I can honestly say that when I watched the non-MST3K version, I was really accepted. This scream sounds for the remake of Hollywood.
