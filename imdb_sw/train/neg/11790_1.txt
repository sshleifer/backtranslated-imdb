Deep SH .. is more like it! Onions are only played in the film. Consider "Mr. Bad Limpet" meets "Leviathan". Very tacky. <br /> <br /> No relationship or development relationship. So it is called "romantic acts" very strongly and predictable. Interesting idea, but an unsuitable script written by LOUSY special effects makes it so clear that you should miss!
