Oh, brother ... after hearing about this dirty film for the years of the umpteen years I can imagine is that the old song of Peggy Lee .. <br /> <br /> "Is that all?" ... I was a young boy when this fish struck the UN I was too young to enter the playground (though I could enter "Goodbye Columbus"). Then the observation of the local film museum said - I was finally able to see this film, but now I was old as my parents when they voted !! The only reason this film was not judged for the unknown sand of time was because of the pollution caused by the release of the US. Millions of people gathered on this stinker, thinking they would go to see a sex film ... Instead, they have found many gnarly buttons, terrible Swedes, road interviews in bland shopping centers, political preferences ... The weak-who cares about sex scenes carried out by the saggy, color-colored actors. It is a cultural image, a holy grail, a historic artifact. anything that was this, motivated, burned, then lost ashes in the lead box! <br /> <br /> Elite esthetes is still struggling to find value in its political spewings of the political pingudo revolution. But if it is not for the regulatory scandal, it would be ignored, then forget it. Instead, the headline "I've Been Without, Listen" The recurring theme was repeated for years as a porno movie title (I liked, Lavender - for gay films, I liked the Room). , Black - for meditation films, etc..) And every ten years or so the thing comes from the dead, viewed by a new generation of suckers who want to see that the "porn movie of the dead" which "r" reform industry film "... /> <br /> Yeesh, disconnect like a blow .If you have to see - rent a video and proceed to a" retired "section, so you can find it.
