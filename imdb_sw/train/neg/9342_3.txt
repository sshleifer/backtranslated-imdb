Remove the release schedule of 1929-30 all of our talkie "Gang", "Winter Tough" has two stories. First, Wheezer and Mary Ann, home alone interesting day, they decide to make taffy. Little Wheezer sends directions to Mary Ann from the radio show show. Problem: Wheezer allows information from different displays and Mary Ann ends up putting soap in the mix! When it is interesting it happens when the rest of the Gang show a taffy - and end up getting all over the house! The second story deals with Stepin Fetchit, a neighbor / Gang host, and its interaction with the Gang. The "Dark Summer," for my knowledge, has never been shown on television, although it is available on the home video. The reason for this is the Characteristics of Stepin Fetchit which reflects bad, ignorant, and slow behavior. "Our creator" producers Hal Roach called Fetchit "knowledgeable woman" and used "Log in" to enter as a series of Comedy's Fetchit series who has not seen the light of day. In fact, Fetchit behavior is irritating many people today, which explains why the film has become an array. Even though there is a short time for all and Fetchit and taffy, "A Winter Tough" is a plodding and ringing effort. As a positive one came from this film, it was that Studios of Hal Roach grew up confident and made experience in doing talkies. Sound in the film is good, and some sound effects are very funny. For this reason, this film partly made the best way to the 1930-31 film of our "Gang". Over 3 out of 10.
