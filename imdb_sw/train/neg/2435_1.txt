I will warn you here: I chose to believe those consultants who said that this was not an action film in a normal sense, rather than a psychological game so you should appreciate it on the same basis and you will be right. <br /> <br> I'm here to tell you that they were wrong. It's exactly right. Well, no, not, not at all; it is very disappointing if you are looking for flick action, they were correct on that. But it is also not very good at all other levels as well. <br /> <br /> Tom Beringer wasn't too bad, I think, no worse than normal; but what had to throw Billy Zane in this? Was the kind of death you want for producers? How to make their film secure? In this case, it worked. If they really had a goal to succeed, then why not lose someone who can act? O, and you can also go to the scribe who knows how to write. Ah, yes, and the director who knows how to lead. As a person who has lived through this mess, he really believes that he will soon redeem himself, I can assure you that you have not done. Merry, it would be a good film.
