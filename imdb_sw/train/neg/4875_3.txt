My grandmother took me with my sister to see this movie when it appeared on the movie in 1998, and so we bought tickets, popcorn and soda for fun, and we went to the playground and sat down to watch the film. When it was over, the audience was very unhappy, remembering that I heard a few people say they did not like it, I did not like it, I thought it was stupid, and inappropriate to see. Eddie Murphy had a feeling in this matter, but apart from him, the whole movie was bad, I laughed I cut these pieces, I also remembered that other people in the playground even laughed. And what I thought was bad to make the animals talk, because the animals that speak are on cartoons, in live movies, they are completely mutt! I said that far from Eddie Murphy's hysterical perversion he brings, this movie is not worth looking, it's rather stupid. <br /> <br /> I have seen Eddie Murphy in a few of the movies and I thought it was funny in those, I just said that he was the only part of this movie, also I have not seen Eddie Murphy in a real "good" movie, The Adventures of Pluto Nash. This movie is not a film that I would highly recommend to see, because apart from Eddie Murphy, maybe you will not go like this, especially because of the animals that speak in it! <br /> <br /> I will give you this movie rating of 3 stars out of 10 possible stars.
