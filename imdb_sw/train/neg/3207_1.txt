Oh my God was so bad! The story was weak - better - and animation was flat and lifeless - even the boy. This film takes considerably very seriously ... unless of course they meant to be funny. I saw this week ago at the London Sci-Fi Festival and all the audience were laughing every area. I think I loved 'you should not learn medicine in Oopsalof'! And I also think they were trying to see how many times they could hit the Nicalo characteristic line 'we would be together ... it's our destiny. Sorry but after the first time, the words lost everything. <br /> <br /> And what was with the apple? I recommend this as a lesson for Americans: You can't live, so please don't try it. You are ashamed.
