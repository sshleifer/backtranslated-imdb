Plot is not suitable for discussion even if it refers to corruption, murder, power and other issues related to thriller. Anime is interesting though sometimes. It is not true but interesting yet. <br /> <br /> Progress is slow as a tea drink. Visual is not stunning, but good enough to ease the eye. Good movie to watch after dinner before bedtime - nothing surprising, no overexciting. Fashion sitcom style. <br /> <br /> I liked Woody's performance - better. He had to fight the deficit of the plot and did a very good job. Some carry it even though they are very unpredictable. It all looks and much better than many TV shows.
