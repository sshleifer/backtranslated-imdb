honestly, where can I start? This was a low budget, HORIBIBLY acted film, it was so cheesy we were all bursting and laughing how completely lost it was! The war with the sword was not even the sword of war, they were playing around with the swords that they bought for the wal-mart and all they were doing were just talking and trying to make it seem like they were struggling !! My family and I had a great movie of one day, so we decided to go to the shop and look at one, and there was a Sawtooth Island film. I mean it looked good but when we looked at home I had to die after the first incident. <br /> <br /> Oh with a plot of film, story board, script, etc. ... it was a garbage group that I even know what the director and producer will even lose their time doing it! But if you happen to fail on this film .. don't get it !!!!!
