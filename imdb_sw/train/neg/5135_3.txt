I think the wind is exciting, so it is a pity this movie does not make more of them. A group of invaders makes an emergency parachute from a plane to a large and cracked farm. One of them may be lost and lose and so others chase him down when he has doubts about the wrong. Acting is a hammy and uncomfortable (they are moving). On the positive side, the director gets distracted from the outside of static scarecrows. It's like Alfred Hitchcock says, "The bomb under the table goes away, and that's wondering. We know the bomb is under the table but not when it leaves, and that's amazing."
