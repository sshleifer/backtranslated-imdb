I was very scared with this wonderful movie. What is the abnormal condition of darkness. With the same color of creepy music. Really promise! Indeed, after ten minutes it begins to send sweat, and it feels uncomfortable, because when you start worrying the worst. This film has a dream of a real dream, and it is the worst-all it comes from. For an hour and a half I have been trying to fight with full patience and sleep, but the voice of pride has kept me awake. Nuit Noire is a real awesome picture - with your eyes, your ears, your mind, and above all: your wallet, because thinking of using the money on the film ticket for this cheap homevideo is a great fear of all .
