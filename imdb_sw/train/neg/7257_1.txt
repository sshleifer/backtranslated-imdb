I anticipated the French-B music. After all, Dhery, Blanche, DeFun√®s were superstars of the film under the French budget of the time. And it's color! But I have a talk in an unreliable 30 hour of real purity. Music numbers are bad, and the comedy is completely boring and stupid. Na songs? What songs? This is just a series of bad numbers, automatically. The only little thing about that is the dirt of women. It was not known then. In fact, several numbers are only there to show us unemployed women. Adds to interactive! And try to find young Michel Serrault, a good actress of French film, for a little part as a musician, in his first movie. Good luck!
