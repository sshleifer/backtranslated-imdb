I admit they have a bad feeling about the movie movies, and sometimes I enjoy a kind of festive season, but when it comes to comedies, they really need to be mad. 'On His Mortal Body' seems to take after a little life very seriously, and fails in my opinion from almost anything I can think of. The story is not realistic, and it has not been able to reveal either comic or sentimental records. The choice of major actors was bad. When Paul Rudd is at least good and looks like a good man, the taste of women of his behavior seems to require great improvement as Eva Longoria seems to be very old (sorry) to him, and Lake Bell seems to be not attractive (sorry again). Romantic story without good reason is due to failure from the beginning. Jason Biggs and Lindsey Sloane were really good but they just had to help. Others are uncomfortable and powerless, and flat movies and cheap gags borrowed from the incomplete TV comedies. There is nothing worthy to watch, nothing to remember.
