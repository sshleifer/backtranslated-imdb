I wasn't like "lucky" as some of the others said on this film: I've never seen anything else out of ... we will say ... "fecund" Sarno's mind. I agree with many: some actors who spend a lot of time and go (go-go) is not really interesting. I kinda liked Fraulein Crank (?) ... was very good, was beautiful! Acting was very good, too, although giving lines in the second language could have many problems. Trying to follow the plot was a great job: there was one, really? I fully agree with other views: for the vampire movie, there is no blood. Yes, if you want to lose blood in a good way, check out such paper as "Fear of Dracula" and (my personal favorite) "Dracula brides". The most exciting place (without fun) is where the gold doctor gets his clothes spoiled by the cloud of bats ... which you can't see! ... bats, I mean. <br /> <br /> Just like waster when cable here in North White White but, for heaven, do not rent!
