Some people seem to think this was the worst movie they've ever seen, and I understand where they come from, but I've seen more. That says, movies that I can remember (ie those that I have not stopped) were worse than this, were very bad because they hurt everything that was involved in watching movies. Movies that are worse than War 2 are the things that make you want to clear your eyes, or hit sharp objects in your ears to avoid having another piece of your soul given by you for awfulness. <Br /> War / War Games: The Death Code is not bad, but it comes very close. Yes, I was a natural fan, but I didn't expect miracles from this. Let's say it was once not a very big movie in the first place, it was just the essence of the boy's 80s conversation and another thought of attraction. That's all I expected for, something wrong, but that would be connected to my geek terms. Was it so much to pray? What? It is not possible to do better than the original War Games, even with the release of video? Well it seems that it was too much to pray. Leave this film. At first it is just bad, as "Oh yes, this is bad, but I'm kind of enjoying, maybe the end will be as good as the original." And then it gets worse and worse, and at the end, trust me, you want to see this movie.
