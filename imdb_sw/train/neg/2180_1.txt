Where to start, there are many and terrible mistakes about this film I do not know where to start. Well, the two wrote this letter. Joseph Green and Rex Carlton, first could not create their so-called mind. I think they split the difference, that's why the main header that causes you not to die, but the last screen says the head you could stop. No one knows anything about medical work. After all Doctors swear oaths "no harm". The murder of a woman for transplantation will be considered "harmful". Plus, something little so-called blood and matching tissue. Rejection will die to Jan in the pot. Plus who keeps the monster working work. What medical school did Bill graduate from, FRANKENSTIEN UNIVERSITY? Old FU, or MAD SCIENTIST TECH? The squad had no name, which came to hell from me. More, surgeon Doctor Bill Cortner does not know how to put the patient sitting? All the tragedy of the movie, it's very strange and unknown, except for MST3K. I GIVE IT TURKEY.
