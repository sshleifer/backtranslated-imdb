I saw the MST3K version of "Deathstalker III" and I loved the movie very much - even "regardless" - I decided to watch the entire series of "Deathstalker". I bought me and II and sat down to laugh. Nothing about "Deathstalker I" was amazing at any rate and when credits were locked I was ashamed and embarrassed that I bought it! Very evil and dirt. I think either "DS 3" was the most clean production or MST3K has been changed very much because I expected something else, that is, stupid and uncomfortable and easy. I was wrong. Even at $ 6.99 it seemed to be money. I did not even open "DS 2" if I would return tomorrow. Now I probably just leave this DVD if I can't come back and nobody wants - including myself! In fact, don't bother with this. Even dirt (lots of lots, btw) are not good for icky.
