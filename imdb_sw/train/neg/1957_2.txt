I enjoyed this movie many times, but I continued to get the feeling that I was watching the children's movie. I honestly think someone wrote a script of pg and then, when hiding the picture, decided to add in some blood, dirt and language. it was great allowed. there are those who believe the magic of children in movies like "babe" (pigs) or "foreign angels" who win their fairy. The parents take to trust their daughter on her ability to see the spirit and use this skill to defeat the fairy of tooth. when I bought this film, I thought it would be the answer to b-film in emerging darkness; somehow manage to make the best film and 1/4 of money, but they don't. they made a bad film and probably lost the same amount of money lost in the darkness.
