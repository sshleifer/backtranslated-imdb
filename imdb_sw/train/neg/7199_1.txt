Why? !! This was a thoughtless, uncomfortable and embarrassing film. The shame comes from being from the city where they did ... Pittsburgh PA! Why did they allow these people to do the BAAAAAD film there? <br /> <br /> When this movie was released earlier ... it was more than a romantic comedy ... with no ROBO-nothing. All have been changed with the honor of Disney. WHAT? They made a strong definition of this common comic character. To see Matthew Broderick offensive to his own movies he was not happy either. Sheesh !!
