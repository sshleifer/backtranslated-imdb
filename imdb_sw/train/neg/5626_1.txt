He got this movie on the tube on Sunday. I thought it was too bad to look at the IMDb to see what others thought. I was not surprised by the amount of ignorant people who enjoyed this fluff. However I was surprised when I looked at the readings of the hated groups only to know that they did not. I was shocked at this; I always look at those who hate them as they always those who hate the movie no matter how good. Somehow this film made it uncomfortable with the opponents saying without it and announcing with the trick that I HAD MOVIE! I know I must explain why I hate this movie but doing so would give more respect to the film than it deserved.
