I feel the feeling that the producers of this mess were out to make West more bitter, ignorant ever. "SENDING" is the lesser word I can think of explaining it. On the joint side you have a beautiful picture of photography with Rhonda Fleming and beautiful. My sympathy goes to Jacques Aubuchon (who played with disability), who did well in the awesome role, written so earnestly that no actor can give fun performance. Production ethics were very good, which once showed an awesome event and screenplay. The things I hated: Stewart Granger seemed a little like the western figure, what is for his British understanding, good dresses, and silly immaculate always-white kerchief wrapped around his neck. It was to breathe through the people of the city and his son were always haranguing and insulting the Granger, and he did not speak or answer again. I know we have to stop unbelief and esteem the West as the prototype values ​​play, but this has been banned in an unreasonable and predictable way, the worst at the end of which the Granger miracle plants, quickly and one-one strives around the region to adopt The bad animals of the animal will pass, and then the plants of Granger himself in the full spot so that they can beat power from a very distant distance to form rock slides to bury and pull bulls and bad guys, it seems to destroy all, except two bad people. Then the worst is everything on the plot, which is loading opera scenes scenes. Nothing was seen in the film: I do not believe what the war was all about. The wicked was driving his car on the market and wanted the cattle to play the grass on the way; I don't see why something couldn't be done. You need a crisis of land ownership with it? Don't bother to see.
