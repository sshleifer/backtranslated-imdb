I saw the IMP score of 7.5 on this movie and on the basis of it decided to watch this film that my partner lost. He said he had seen it before. "It's funny and sad! I cried the first time I saw it," he said. Perhaps compared to other video sounds it deserves 7.5 out of 10, but in comparison to all the other movies I have seen in my life, this is no more than 3. Any movie I can think of what will happen next is not suitable for me. The characters are not believed, how the act is not true and their motives are found. It's about surprising and songs not all good. My biggest problem with sound movies is a lack of craft. All emotions are many more ways and so are not quite true. Any emotion or bond between the characters that are a bit of a trick must be found in an unwanted song. I think I understood that the relationship between father and son was more than one of the more than one of the friends between the parent and the child without being brought through a five-minute song. The comic support of laughter with laughter was not funny or useful (we find it, Laxman is not the most bright tool in shedding). If the movie tries to cry tears in many ways of hackneyed it is not possible, just a little bit of embarrassment. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * + Many holes of the plot count. For the first time the movie was exciting and interesting through sound films is for people who do not look at them as quickly but it's just interesting. It takes a lot of experience to make a film that is exciting and encouraging and the best way to do it is usually to have all the exciting parts in the first half of the film and all the heart parts at the end. It was probably a little more than other sound movies that I saw, but not quite. I was playing a laughing time of film than the places that should be funny. I did not shed tears or feel like it, but I was overcome with a feeling of hatred in the last attempt. I do not recommend this movie if you want to look at something good, I recommend if you want to watch a sound film which is kind of sad.
