I read this review and when I didn't expect Ryan to save the privacy I was expecting a film of some substance. The movie begins too far from the usual history of history and how the unit came to be. But once it's 1944 and you're not sure where everyone is. Restrictions etc. are very poor if this unit is supposed to be Hawaiian / Asian but everyone speaks in very poor to take Harvard English to imitate a Japanese man. I gave this film 3 out of 10 if after 10 minutes I couldn't watch again. The characters were 1 dimensional and although they were most likely based on the real people I had no feelings to them and this has not been neglected about them. A very good TV movie that will be displayed at midnight on the cable station. I would like to avoid and check out for the best efforts. <br /> <br /> This is good news but it was worth telling the best. You mean that the director had seen the brother's band and thought it was enough to sell his movie. My advice, try and watch a brother's band, airmen of Tuskegee, Glory or any film as when the trumpet is destroyed.
