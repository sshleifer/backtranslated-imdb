I saw this movie with the intention of not loving it. I certainly didn't. It is one of those movies that are seen to be done by Oscars alone: ​​music in all films around each single frame, almost no dirt, long-term, tons of sepia tones, defensive head, NO SEX, and every artist who describes what he thinks and concludes in sfx / cgi so we (stupid audience) might. One thing that bothers me though is the fact that they said NOBEL PRICE WRONG! Instead they call the Nobel price (named after a real person named Alfred Nobel) 'good price'. How can one make such a mistake in such a massive production, which is considered according to a true story. It's sham! Did you and others think RON?
