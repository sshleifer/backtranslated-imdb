This movie is one chiche after another. First of all, although they did their part, there is an illegal area in which John eliminates weeds as idiot. Wigs and accents are awesome. They seem more serious than old Beatle cartoons. John is a bad, jealous, homosexual, cousin's slave has been shown as in the Albert Goldman banned book. They even placed the song tracks in normal conversation "was always just two of us"! John didn't mean for his fans like this either. If his death showed us as good as anything. One part of the story is where Beatle's dancing fan recognizes John and asks him to sing Paul 's story. John accused of saying something to "Sure and when I croon why do not get into your knees, wear your wife's ring, and stretch my liggin". That made me niche for the day. Really this movie is amazing in how it tries to be when it comes from ignorance. John and Paul also did not stay pontificating all the time, they were boys with bright light which even during Beatles broke where many more lovers are shown here. Forget.
