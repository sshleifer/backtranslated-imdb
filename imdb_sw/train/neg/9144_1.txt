This film is really bad, eye candy that Ben can only do for everything else wrong with this film. Writer / director / producer / lead producer etc. probably had a good idea of ​​creating a film related to gay marriage issues, family acceptance, religion, sexuality, crime violations and every issue another that makes a homosexual man of these times, but trying to forbid every chapter in a non-pregnant film that is not very appropriate for any reason. <br /> <br /> Script is poor, very common, but dialogue and acting are amazing. Brother-hate brother plays with the campus actor and there is absolutely no chemistry among two leading actors (I think I've got more enthusiasm in ad flakes ad). Acting is difficult, and the discussion has been complicated (the place where the brothers are feeding the detective lines of it was to show). advice - don't do it.
