That is in the worst form of change of Jane Eyre I saw. He doesn't know if the author of the screenplay has ever read the book to Bronte. George C Scott is ignorant and whispering as Rochester - when it's not just an angry fury. Susannah York has a hairstyle of the 1970s I've ever seen in the movie of Israel. The characters do not talk to each other, so the rich banner enjoyed the book that is based on their intellectual and lasting love, gone. The latter is interesting. <br /> <br /> Please, the tax version of Timothy Dalton instead. It is true of the book, it is like having a novel reading. Dalton is as good as Rochester. G. C. Scott is laughable.
