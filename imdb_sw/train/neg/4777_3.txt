The concept behind this film was good. Too bad was not written well. Casting the Sidney Poitier as a FBI agent was a good idea, and did the best work. Tom Berenger, on the other hand, knows only one feeling in his many movies, angry. Kirstie Alley's behavior may be good, and even showed some of the possibilities once, but the author only leaves us to do his job especially the helpless woman. This was totally incompatible with a very independent attitude that was supposed to be. I don't care for Alley doing that. The film should be completed fifteen minutes earlier than it did. The director took the dry cow before the last extraordinary stage. I will put this in my collection only as an example of Poitier displays.
