I am glad some people liked this, but I hated this film. It had a very good idea for the story line, but it ended. It was written badly, badly and badly. It had several interesting points, but it was reduced very quickly, the authors needed to realize what to enter and expand on these bits, as they slept on why she was taken, and throwing cotton. Instead "what is going on?", 5 seconds later they tell you. This movie was not worried, and I was exhausted from beginning to end. I just liked to complete it. <br /> <br /> Going and hiring trouble, or well-planned programs if you want to wait or wait that makes you end.
