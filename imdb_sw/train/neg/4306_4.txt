There is one good thing in this film: Lola Glaudini! Sorry to be very open but true. Worse did not make nude. It would be at least made this mess easier. We see other boobs of ass but there is no place near Lola. And someone, is the Armand Assante old or what? Man looks like a trap! "Results" are the B-Movie that you expect. The story was capable. It's like they had good ideas but they didn't know how to do them. Style looks very clear. Ugly! The tracking was not followed and the final result is the excitement of the bland and the loss of the lame and the cleaner. Lola Gaudini is as good as the vixen through cheap, slutty but even even saves "Results" from being garbage and not a funny garbage, just old garbage.
