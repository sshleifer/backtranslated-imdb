After watching this film, I came to IMD and read some comments, which compared with Lost In Translation LITE. I read that once I could see the critics intended. <br /> <br /> This movie was a poor attempt on the same theme. Interestingly, the film structure is the same, but the PACING is very different. "10 items" run the viewer through a 1-day film line, where well planned "Lost ..." seems to spread for a few days. I am sure some people will see this because it has Morgan Freeman, and they will be disappointed. It seems its best current-day-day responsibilities are to help work in big blockbusters, rather than leading the roles in a $ 10mil film release and indie films.
