What? Are there more meaningless and judgmental movements than environmental movements? For a small shepherd who joined the circus must be as terrifying as joining the actual circus. Although these people usually give out their brains to Hollywood for these important issues, Hollywood teachings can seem fragmented and confused. Fortunately Ed is here to teach neo-hippies in the art of envirojudgementalism. Here you will learn the skills of tapping your finger in front of anyone without losing your smirk trademark. You will learn how to overcome the logic and science for the arguments of fear. You will learn how to stop any human activities that did not interest you by writing as the way of Armageddon. Apart from learning how to lie and face the same, you will learn how to lose charges that have been opened your way regardless of how much hypocrisy. You will be able to use as much energy as Al Gore still when people treat you if you were Amish. The second season was more beneficial as we could visit some of God's Hollywood, holy ones, and verification - that is, judge - their lives. NOTE: This is the only time it is appropriate for envirofascist to judge another because it allows the victim the opportunity to buy on all kinds of cheap eco-toys-so that they can hit the finger in other people's faces. Where does Ed have a shop for us for the third season? Maybe he will teach us how to have judgment when we slept!
