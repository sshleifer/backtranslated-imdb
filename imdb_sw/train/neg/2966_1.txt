I can't understand all the hype about this movie. Okay, if you like a cheap splatter, you would like this movie, but if you would like a good story with good actors - don't look at this. In fact I did not like participants in this film, they seem to be employed directly from the street. Conversations are completely flat and you always know what is coming next. The overall quality of this film has no low budget. When we saw this film (I and 3 other people) we all had a sense, that this movie was made by other people who needed to do so, in order to get their prize in the school of films - with less effort. Another issue that eliminates all the experience is a bad cam (very shaking) and a bad sound, the whole movie seems to be found with a single microphone.
