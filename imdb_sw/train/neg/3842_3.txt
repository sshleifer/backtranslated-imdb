Our teacher showed us this film in the first grade. I haven't seen since. I just watched the trailer though. What? This looks like a first-class movie for you? I don't think so. I was so scared with this film, I could look at it. It was exactly the area with Shirley McClain cutting a little girl in half, and then there was a boy with ketchup! I was excluded from this film. Now today, at the age of 20, I probably didn't have that feeling. I just wanted to share my experience and my opinion that maybe little children should not see this film, though it's PG. Beware of the possible results of this display for children. I didn't even remember what was over, once it was enough!
