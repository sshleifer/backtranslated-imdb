In fact, it's all said about this film and I hate it when you write a review where everyone else has said what it says. But the thing is, I have seen those movies and I work on text text on all the movies I have seen. So, I write something. <br /> <br /> Act is stupid. It is really ignorant how an anchor of the news depicts his grief towards the collapse of the aircraft. Nun is good even with a professional assistant who comes to take care of the child. The three killings in the movie are just weak that you wonder how fools can create this film to be. What? They don't know that even obstacles can be scary. We don't see how granpa has been killed. The dentist and his assistant made me feel that they deserve to die, you have no mercy with them. And tony uncle in the garage dies in a way that would have worked well. We hear him say and we see nothing!
