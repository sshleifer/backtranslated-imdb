Hines and Goforth, the perpetrators of this crime, started on the first step of the foot, and assumed that Wells wrote Gothic fears and that all of its lines are meant to be taken seriously. That's not true. Wells was more than a successor to enlightenment, and its main concern is that Victoria's credibility can leave the UK unprepared for the world of new technologies can produce - good and bad <br /> <br /> second. The terrible results follow - the protagonist is portrayed as a wimpy screamer (I was reminded of Fay Wray in King Kong original), rather than a man struggling to live out the irony of a strange catastrophe; and negotiations The series of 'Victorianisms' uttered seriously that the Welles clearly meant to be considered a joke <br /> <br /> All of this seems suspiciously like Ed Wood and a very large budget to lose on CGI - effects. which in the way is very poor, Warner Bros cartoon factory of the 1940s can work better. (Gobs of the spattered blood was seen as red balloons, I expected them to float at any moment.) Consider the Yellow Submarine as conducted by the EC Comics age. <br /> <br /> But the worst is losing the topic, which the film robs of any reason to exist. Although the creators of this film come back to the story of the time of Israel, they totally lose the unusual way of the Wells' Story predicted a horrible end of World War I - an unknown truth and Wells himself, who, after the war, worked again the theme in Shape Zitaka to come. <br /> <br /> Without any theme, all of us here are a lot of people running around to get right into cartoon balloons, while they're not trying out for high school print writing again for Macbeth alcoholism. Really, this is the worst, most insignificant part that I have found because my friend told me in a cartoon view of Eastern Europe "Wonderful planet" thirty years ago. The film was very deceptive, my friend and I and two general visitors defied the half-way, and sat next to the screens screen, using the film as a light that you could see cards - just its efficiency, as far as any of them our can say. But I already have electric lights in my house, so I don't need to be destroyed for Wells for anything. <br /> <br /> What! do not avoid this film - steal every copy you can (do not pay a penny) and burn each of them. God in His wisdom created us only for this purpose.
