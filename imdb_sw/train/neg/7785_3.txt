I did not know this was a silent sermon movie. I don't care about silent movies - corny humor, flick lights and films, etc. I'm sure that the features of the bottom score I gave. It was about 8 chapters before it was found with interest in this story and I would have popcorn I could throw on the screen. Maybe this invites a sci-fi group? The only thing lost is the zombie area and the brain planting. I went with two other people on Friday night and there were 6 people in all the hall. Isabella Rosselinni told this film - one of the most enjoyable parts of the film. No one left to explain how they enjoyed this and did not accept the unusual way of telling this story. I can't recommend this movie.
