This film is hilarious. The problem is that it is not comedy. One tribal component involves Kurt Thomas who just appears to get a horse-panda in the middle of the village square (which uses to oppose bad people.) Another is a journey into "Village of Crazies." This film has not been made farce, or it may have a better test.
