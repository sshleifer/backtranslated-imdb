Cut off expulsion, this is one of the five worst films I've ever seen. It's not that they did not try it. There was a declaration of honor and some of the elements of the internal structure, good cast, good acting. I don't know when it was wrong, but it went wrong. Some features can be a bad pattern and no basic story, a lot of confusion and lead (which is probably a lot better during blocking), bad leadership and editing. I had enough for an hour, pulling my hair an hour and a half and I was very angry at an hour and fifty minutes fled. There was also worry about all, for when I was with someone who was a heroin penalty. He was afraid that he liked something that was not good for them. That was designed by a beautiful 17-year-old girl who was interested in a 30-year-old junkie. There were tribal points that were a structural attempt, but the final result was non-list and non-final (with variable lines). The characters were colored but had no end, which made me feel bad for quality actors who have not seen enough. Split. I thought that this was the first time director who was interested in his own turds, but he did this before. I am wondering how this and other good things get someone to give them money.
