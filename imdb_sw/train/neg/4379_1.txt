Ok, well I took this film when I slept in bed on pain killers, and let me say, It didn't help any film. The video is about a person who sells a car through a midlife crisis, he loves a car more than anything around it, one day his wife decides to borrow the car. Since I do not want to destroy (not that there is anything to destroy) I will leave your mind thinking "Zany" (and I use that little word) the following antics. I was fighting to stay awake this way for a minute of film, and I would like to say that if you come to a movie shop and you think about being mad, please not, it is losing this printed film. <br /> <br /> Then I could be wrong ...
