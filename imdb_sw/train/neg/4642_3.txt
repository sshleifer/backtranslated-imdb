I saw "Attic Rachel," thinking that I would be for a visceral enjoyment, ride. However, it was not. Visceral, yes, but enjoyable? That would be great, fat, no! In fact, the only reason I have given "3," is due to the fact that Gunnar Hansen looks (for a very short time) as one of the guilty characters of the film. How they once told Mr. Hansen in this piece of work, I will never know you. The story of the story is interesting but not done. The direction is the traveler and acting is mediocre. The only thing that is worse than that, is the special effect. YIKES !!! I have seen the best effect in playing school grade. Give, Mr. W, it's time to change the work ... I hear employers at Mel's Diner! There are very few, well-known, Indian movies coming from Michigan ... and "Attic Rachel" is not one of them.
