This romantic comedy is not so bad. There are some interesting things happening here and there, and there are some characters that don't remember. <br /> <br /> Acting, however, is an amateur (except the bank). While certain scenes are great fun, others are just shy. In particular, I have seen the "romantic" part of the poor story. <br /> <br /> For all, I think it's worth seeing if you like football and romantic lovers. It is not really bad movies, and the end was very good. Don't expect anything out of the ordinary. Well enough if you have an hour and a quarter to kill.
