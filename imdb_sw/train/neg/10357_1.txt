I really didn't like this movie because it didn't bring the message and ideas that L'Engle put in her novel. We read a novel in the English class and I liked it very much, I'm afraid I can't say the same to the film. There was a great difference between the novel and the revised version and did not make any credit for thinking skills which is Madeleine L'Engle! This is why I have put a poor mark. Don't see this film if you're a great fan of L'Engle's literature because you will be very disappointed. However, if you are watching a movie for entertainment (or education as it was my case) then it's a good movie!
