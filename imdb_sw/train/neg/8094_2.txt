As someone who has read the novel and seen the film, I understand why the film was dropped. First, any comparison between the novel and the film is only high. They are two different animals. Theory may be considered as satire, but it comes as a cross between a tragedy and a polemic instead. Any comedic elements as well as those which later formed the basis of the stylistic version of the film are just the event of the author of the uniform size. And they don't have the white suit of the author to think this is another Twain Mark, think again. The most appropriate history of literature would be a specter of Ambrose Bierce in high caps and tails. Tom Wolfe is the same part of the clown and hack, the most celebrity than the author, always looking for a new grist for his personal absorbed mill. It is therefore not surprising that the best production skills and patterns set on the decision of the film were lost since the beginning. Unlike the true satire, which translates very much into the film, the lessons will not be done in the study of all kinds or other forms of human behavior, but with direct attacks on specific individuals - if they are real or emerging - who have somehow he got the author's anger. Any attempt to create an effective story or narrative from the beginning must have a fresh start, without any influence or interaction of the author. When you say that, I also cause an error. Not only aren't able as Bruce Willis and Melanie Griffith fail to measure, but that real talent like Tom Hanks, F. Murray Abraham, and Morgan Freeman are completely lost or are given responsibilities that are just caricatures. <br /> <br> There are advanced equipment available here for the real satire of the film, but it fails to come close.
