This movie had an IMDB rate of 8.1 so I expected more from it. It starts funny and interesting for energy that feels voluntary. But before the film is half way through, it begins to drag and everything becomes sickingly predictable. The characters in a pleasant office in the first three parts of the movie, but we get to know them a bit very well; they are caricatures, not real people. This is the same story I saw a hundred times, just told them here and a little different situation. The point here is I could stomach another predictable love story if only the dialog was not stale! <br /> <br /> The only thing that can be bad is like characters and incompatible with incredible motivation, and unfortunately it was also the case with the Office of Dead Letter. We hope that this film will be completed in the Modern Movie Office recently.
