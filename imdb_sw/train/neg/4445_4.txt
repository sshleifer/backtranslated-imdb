Serum is about a physician who finds a serum that is supposed to treat all diseases with mental powers. Instead it creates some kind of monster that requires eating human body and mind. Doc mad builds zombies out of cadavers and has some problems. There is a very long guide in all actions and events to let you know. Brother's mad doctor gets a car accident and mad mad trying to use his new serum for a boy. The result is not good. This is a C class film with good acting but some leading problems and some persistent mistakes. There are no many zombie actions in this one and the effects, when enough, not special. You can move forward through a small section and get pleasure from out of practical events. Look for dirt and bad language.
