The original "cube" is a fantastic B-movie with paranoia, the character of the meat, and the highest performances. It's creepy, cryptic, and cool. And it stands well, for itself, without a sequel of stupid as "Cube Zero." This third party (!) in the Cube series is a part of the restore (many booby traps are made sadly), the transfer part. It takes the courage to clarify what the cube is - something that has never been revealed in the first movie - but, since the statement it is bland, I would like to be a mystery. There are possible references to the community that are outside the cube, but have not developed more of the ideas about some kind of religious tyranny. Therefore, a little social definition is a flat feeling and not recommended. <br /> <br /> What does it work? Basically no. Acting is only at an amateur, the speed of decrease (how much of this film has two nerds to look at the screen?), And the effects of time, during the rebellion, fail to lobby. In short, "Cube Zero" reminds me of the "Cube" fan-fic, a sloppy clone and sophomoric of a beautiful movie which definitely didn't need a good sequence.
