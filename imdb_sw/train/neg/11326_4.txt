This is one of the two fantasy postapocalyptic movies that Albert Pyun made in 1993 - and it's bad. It seems that all his energy went into "Nemesis" which was a non-stop entertainment, and was looking more expensive. "Knights" are clunky and cheesy, low-of-the-barrel-sci-fi which often resembles video video (new opponents pop up all the time and must be destroyed as soon as possible). The only thing that saves this film from the trash is Kathy Long; not a very beautiful woman, but of course it is a violent fighting machine. Like Kris Kristofferson, based on his age at the time (58), I hope his two-time humor was well paid. (* 1/2)
