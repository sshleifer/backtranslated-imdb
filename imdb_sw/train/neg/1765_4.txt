Okay - the helicopters shots are amazing, and the director used some of the top Barcelona centers. Otherwise ... the production value was struck for the first few minutes and all the film was seen as a week film. Ellen Pompeo was charming and enjoyable, Abel Folk had a deep depth and was very effective, and William Baldwin was ... well, William Baldwin. He had to put up his practice of military art for good use and become a figure of hard-flying action. Some of the cast were better wood, but more than paper. So - if you're nostalgic about Spain - it's a photo card and a loss of action, and a healthy measure of El Greco. If not, skip.
