(Aka: Bloodsucker Leads to Drums) Most of the newborns have had two scenarios have been healed. The film is supposed to be made in Ireland but it looks more like Rome and Adriatic to me. The Gothic Lesbians are invited to the Counter Island for the weekend. Directly they seem to have no heads because of madness around them. It is not scary or bloody and seemingly tight-looking rooms with flood lights even though candles are beaten. Go to the statistics ... (sic) <br /> <br /> Screaming is worse than usual and the plot is used only as an excuse for vigilance and dirt. Guided by the fear of euro actor Alfredo Rizzo, this is one snoozer. It is very interesting 2 out of 10
