I was shocked to see how a slim slide of 2008 won Oscar for the best 2009 image and so it went to see the Hurter Locker. Unfortunately, all that I got for two hours was a bad confirmation that this film had won the prize for off-screen reasons. <br /> <br /> The leadership and visual style of this film are some of the most weak you will find forever. while not busy having the other features of Bourne Identity for the wrong, the negative "shaky cam" picture, shows off all the second-level opera's detergents based on the gate. <br /> <br /> "The plot" is short, the attributes are on development as well as the rejected ideas of Beetle Bailey's artwork and discussion - in cases where the film offers on being "minimalist" and because no definitely returns to one soldier or two in the right IDs - are some of the worst memories. fairly, the actors are doing better in the environment, they are not enough to hide how the project is bad. The whole film feels that it is considered as a kind of "mockumentary" that prevented them from having a sense of humor and thus reinstated as they could more to remove it as a great celebration. When you spend two hours on this film it is two hours you will never go back, and two hours you lose that you will regret your entire life.
