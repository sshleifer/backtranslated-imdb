To begin with, I must show you the fact that you will feel completely lost for more than half an hour. Well, some things happen, but you don't know why or why. When you look at the outside, you realize that it is nothing but a breathing in the field, dealing with adult prostitutes, dead mothers, illegitimate children. . Marisa Paredes just stands out, but she is a good actress, regardless of whether the movie is a clean garbage. The only good things to say about "Fr√≠o Sol De Invierno" is that the beginning of Pablo Malo seems to be good, and has made several images that are very intense ... Well, maybe next time. / <br
