Prospects were high for me when I went to see this film, after all I thought Steve Carell could not make any mistakes from the big movies like Anchorman, Virgin 40, and Little Miss Sunshine. Boy, I was not wrong. I will start with what is similar to this film: for some points Steve Carell is allowed to Steve Carell. There is a short time in the film that made me laugh, and it is due to almost completely giving her a chance to do her job. He is a good talented person, and it is a shame that he joined with what happened, in my opinion, the collapse of the train. Besides, I will discuss what went wrong. The movie begins with Dan Burns, a widow with three girls who are being considered for national advice. She prepares her girls for family fellowship, where her extended family gathers for a long time with them. <br /> <br /> The family is on the list of things that make this a bad film. There is no family like this. It's almost as if they have been sent from Pleasantville or Waachie Beaver. They are caricature of what we think the family is when we are 7. It reaches the point where they tend to worry and just confused. Touch the football, the cross puzzle race, bowling of the family, and the talent of talent NOT THE WORD OF PEOPLE. It's almost sick. Another great thing is Carelle woman should fall for. Looking at her first place with Steve Carell is like watching a stroke victim trying to be restored. What I think it should be unique and original in this lady coming gently. <br /> <br /> It makes me think that this film is being done on another planet. I left the playground wondering what I saw. After thinking more, I don't think it was a lot.
