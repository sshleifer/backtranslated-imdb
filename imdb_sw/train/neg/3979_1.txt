Okay, this has 2 being one of the worst 4 movie excuses that I've ever had to look at. Like all the Olsen movies of the lungs and the possible discrimination of the new york, this film had no stories, gaping basket holes, doing bad work and concealing bad pictures even !!!!!!!!! if you don't think I still hate MARY KATE AND ASHLEY !!!!!! The only reason I looked at this was because I was so tired and nothing else was. I wonder if the twins can't stop making a similar film to a beautiful where they have an unusual stupid adventure in a foreign part and save the day at the same time getting the help of two cute young men who drool on them immediately. The younger ones could have a 4 boy among them or have both of them fall one. Praise in this story was imbecilic and just plain dumb. even a little child can see mistakes in it. Maybe they should be split and start to make a film alone or maybe a film with different types of stories. Anyone who loved this film did not have a mistake - either really ignorant, really fake or not seen any very good movie. or maybe they are smart and have a bad movie option. any way I can recommend this movie to my bad nemesis for a good experience of the film. The only thing is good 4 is the laughter of a fragmented hub in a fun effort to be cool. if you look at laughter is hilarious. basically I gave him 0 or less.
