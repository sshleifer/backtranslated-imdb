What's lost lost. <br /> <br /> This is one of the despair movies I have seen. Normal Roger Ebert does not allow me to drop, but I feel after seeing this movie. It's just amazing to see Elizabeth's bankers in her bra. That's a sad statement about this movie. It had a lot of promises, but it was like a quiet transvestite. This is self-absorbed. I cannot express in detail my pain after sitting through this film, and hopefully I can give you the same desire.
