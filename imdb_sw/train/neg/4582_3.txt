If you want to learn the basics of quantum machines, use your $ 9 in a textbook, not this movie. I am worried that the money I have spent is used to buy Kool-Aid for sending to Guyana. I don't think directors have found any certainty, but it seems like they probably tried to do several: 1) Science can explain everything we do, meaning that our life is deterministic; 2) Science cannot be used to describe everything we do, meaning that we have free freedom; 3) Science is, if, actually, brother; 4) We are God; 5) The world exists only in our minds; 6) Sarah Norman is a difficult task to follow with 7) here, put this small square paper in your mouth and you will see some really groovy things.
