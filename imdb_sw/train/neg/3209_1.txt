I also saw a fantastic piece of "anime" at the London Sci-Fi festival. If you need to look at this, do so with a larger audience after a few beers, then you can win some fun from them. <br /> <br /> I've seen a hilarious conversation, set in my mind is the introduction of Cremator. Animation is bad. It's done badly and badly killed. It may be a good idea for manufacturers to employ at least one person who was not blind. Nothing else to say is true, this film is a failure to each level.
