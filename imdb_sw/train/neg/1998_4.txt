My friend got a voice of No, No, Nanette as a dub on the tape and continued to listen not to stop. After finally in my head at the presentation, I found the impossible songs, especially popular, I want to be happy, but I can't be happy ... But much from the sound of the voice I did not know what the film was nearby. So one day I saw a copy on a video store and I took what was supposed to be a long-term film. I was thinking it would be wonderful, because the sound of the voice was so good. Unfortunately many songs that I liked were not available on the video I saw. Now I have never seen the 1930 version of music but this version was very sad because there was very little singing and certainly no play and alongside that sound was so bad out and you can't understand what people say a lot of time. Only really important elements of this film were the modern style of 1940. Nanette wearing this cap of things with two feathers that put out like the ears of rabbits and Kansas Kitty has this amazing muffle muff which she keeps on her arm forward and then herself wrapped in this scarf scarf. One series of drums is also very small with Nanette doing these amazing things of ballet and a picture of a pin-top girl that stands on it. In fact it is one more bright spot of the film is the artist Guillespe who has a dream of becoming a good artist but now he is sentenced to drawing secret-up girls for money. I like how Guillespe puts it in an old school, and says Nanette when her jewel, a piece of work to do, is sold by Nanette for $ 5250. Isn't it realizing that that piece is her life? Rabbit Hidden / Girl with your ears to a rabbit hat on your hat. When will you study? Why not a pencil just in the cigarette before the men of the ad take the Work off?
