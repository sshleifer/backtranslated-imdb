Well, if you have a few hours to lose, or if you hate your life, I would like to say this film. If anything is good for a few laughs. Not only do you have more, the top inhabitants, but also very special effects may be banned in many countries. To a large extent, 'PG' is very good, once you see Native Porn Extravaganza. I will not give you this film for my lost nephew. You can't even show this to Iraqi prisoners without violating the Geneva Treaty. The plan is a sketch, and moist, and dumb, and stupid. Acting is terrible, and the end is painful to see me really started watering in my eye just taking my thoughts off of idiocy to fill my TV screen.
