I hire a weekenders. It's a disappointment! A stupid stupid attempt on a TV movie. The boy who got the leadership was very weak and when he was riding (he did a lot) seemed like he was eating these colored candies ... and behind him! The wolf's witches were great, although I feel the actor was very dependent on him, for there is nothing to blame him for his behavior. A wise Indian-American child needs to be one of the many pigs that are faced with the hardest. Talk about a sour cow! He shouted once for the whole film, and I think that's because he had sex. Sex was also lame. They may also have shown the curtains to blow, if you can dig it. <br /> <br /> At the end of all, and this is a great hatred of my mine, on the lid and the DVD list, lost listed bright cold teeth on the guy. There was no place to appear in the film. :(
