It's 1978, and that's definitely there are many black players on the team too! Fans will be depressed and indeed 75,000 seats will be filled, and very happy there are many black players on the field! This is made for TV Super Bowl TV available. No more, but it is quite surprising of talented actors who make the appearance (on time), perhaps especially Tom Selleck. Unfortunately any Selleck brings to the screen, comes quickly and "characters" like Dick Butkus. <br /> <br /> It's a silly story about betting super bowl. PJ Jackson is charged with "New York" (read mafia) to make sure the game is approaching with their favor, currently the case of $ 10,000,000. PJ is not guilty, and seems to have a misunderstanding to buy a few people here and there. But things seem to fall for him. Another person, the unreliable Lainie takes charge. For a time, the mystery of murder is not known for sure, but it has been revealed clearly for the ultimate murder that Lainie is a new opponent. <br /> <br /> It's a bad movie, but it looks. Acting is polite, and film writing is the same. At least there was no normal 70s explosive car (they only have a chance here). Keep an open mind on old play and cocaine and live. <br /> <br /> 2/10 (maybe 2.5)
