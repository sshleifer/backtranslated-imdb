I burst around with tears watching this movie. Not from laughing but from memory of the great movie of Rodney Dangerfield. Candyshack was his first movie to steal, Easy Money was with him in the best, and Back to School is the 80th of the classic hub. Then there was Ladybugs and it started to show. Poor Rodney was getting old (Meet Wally Sparks was a little step from Ladybugs but not saying much). My Women 5 Rodney has a Monte (a name that she should love since her name was in Easy Money) who is rich (not always) who loves women and is married as her thing. Now he inherited a large piece of land and since the country was run by Amish, he earns 5 women. This looks like a great idea of ​​a dangerous movie. The problem is ALL. The script is so bad that Rodney seems to be saying one liner for the camera and all the characters who have nothing to do. The movie looks like it was shooting on a video and some really poor stunt mechanism that is obviously not Rodney. Andrew Dice Clay plays gangster who appears to die by saying F (which should be from the film rated R but plays as if it was PG) and Jerry Stiller has a good 2 minutes to come. Do not do wrong, sometimes I laugh at Rodney's joke but the poor man gets very old and very fast. We can see his joke coming from miles. And the film returns the way also PC which due to the 1990s shocking, Rodney's 70 and 80 just doesn't work anymore.
