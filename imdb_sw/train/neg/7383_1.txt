I feel blessed to have what is known as the worst movie Steven Seagal. I knew that I had something special when Steven opened his mouth and someone else's voice came out. In the middle of the film my eyes began to hurt and I was about to fall from my seat and unthinkable laughter. Steven is a Steven (and a continuous voice) and it is not quite possible in his role (as always). What? Hell enables people with small pony hair on the tanks however? He also writes himself in the interests of absolute love and women at least 20 years of his sand. All the characters seem like they were shot in the dark - btw, did you hit this movie in the dark and lighting lights of the lamp lights? <br /> <br /> This is absolutely disgusting for every possible way. Invite all your friends around and make a social event - this is absolutely true.
