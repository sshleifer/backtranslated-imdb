It took part of the GEORGE 2 on the TV recently, but it couldn't find it to watch it to the end. Just bad! I can't even remember the plot. I know that George and Ursula were not George and Ursula's first movie, which was very bad. There's a lot around around, but the direction and editing were so shoddy and choppy, it was like watching outtakes or deleted scenes. Having an early Ape's Ape back voice was not nearly enough to give me a warmth for this. GEORGE 2 is probably the worst kind I have ever seen, and that says something. Jeez, because of the IMDb lines of 10, I keep writing when I have nothing to say about this planned for TV. Disney, hang your head to shame.
