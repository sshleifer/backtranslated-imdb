Oh this was a very bad movie. The girl who plays Jennifer is the same, but I think she makes a bitchy through the movie, not because she is having her ingredients ripped out with a string at night, but because she is thinking of firing her agent by putting in this piece. Faye Dunaway does as he is making Mommy Dearest and ending it with absolutely deception. In fact I can not recommend this movie at all even as a fan of Edgar Allen Poe, I was attracted to the references of his work (sauce, house of Usher-like curses of the family, and buried alive) - however he might have turned into his grave if he knew about This film.
