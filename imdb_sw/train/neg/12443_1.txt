- Let me begin by saying that I understand that the invasion of the stars was meant to be a 50-year-old sci-fi film writer. The problem I have is that there is no work. The community should be interesting and this is not just. Not once once the whole run I made a very good smile. In general, I am easily attracted to, but I couldn't find sliver of entertainment anywhere in the invasion of star creatures. <br /> - I knew I had trouble since the beginning. The two "stars" make the appearance of their screen and one of the magags of the most extraordinary lights - a hose of water that can not control which makes them both wet. These two come as the people of Bowery Boys. Why anyone who may want to act with the Bowery Boys' perspective is more of me. After a lesser start than the amazing, movies continue to incorporate tracking systems, play Indians, vegetable people, decoder rings, and other unfunny bits. It is all full-time damage. I bought this on a double-dated DVD and Girls' raid. This is an award for the Academy Award for comparison with the invasion of the stars.
