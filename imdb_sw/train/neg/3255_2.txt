I saw this film in its first week in 1975. I was 13 years old and at the time I found that it was enough and surprising. I came to discover the world of Doc Savage through the Bantam novels of ancient dust stories. I had no idea before any of the Doc's area, but I have been one of the most popular Sa Sage fans who would like to meet. I read (and still owning) all the books of Bantam, I started to go to the comic book (with Star Trek and Doctor Who and all kinds of fatty events) and I had a good time with every adventure I took with Doc and Article 5. Philip Jose Farmer's Book - Doc Savage Revival Life was a little of the Bible to me and even today I have a very interesting feeling about my Doc. By saying this I agree now many years later that this film has lost the boat. It's a film that doesn't know what it wanted to be when it grew. Screenplay was small and resembles a bit of foliage. These stories from 30 years were short and if one looked at the details of Lester Dent (AKA Kenneth Robeson) for writing, they broke into PERFECT's 3 actions that shouted for screenshots. One could imagine that with George Pal and Michael Anderson in assistant, it would be better. The spoof elements did not miss the goal and the worst time to get there, but it falls. It is a great pleasure to see though they have hired a second string character (boys who were actually a few players and extra before this film) who all get very well. In fact Paul Gleason has become a good player in all kinds of entertainment and Bill Lucking is a non-standard television. All others have fallen on the map sadly. I want to have a copy of this film as the only version of my hero's movie, but I'm afraid I can't look at it as very painful. I would like to say 0 but I gave him 2 out of 10 instead of a certain time of direction of the art (Document to reply to Doc for the end was a good touch) and cast to the three fingers to find time in the sun.
