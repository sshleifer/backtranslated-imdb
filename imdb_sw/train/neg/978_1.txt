I watched this film recently with my sister who loves Sophia Loren. I am a person who calls them a Cultural scholar. I love art in any kind of shape or form. Rambo is my kind of movie, action, kills, blood, fear. If you recognize yourself in this avoid this movie as a blow. No one dies, no action, no dirt, nothing like that. Let me give you an account in a few sentences. It starts with 5 minutes in black and white Nazi propaganda. Every Italian in the house restriction attends Hitler's honor, except for the housewife, the anti-guardian fighter. The housewife who is deceived by her husband, meets the protagonist. He loves to love her, wants to make her love, but a fighter fighting gay is gay. With them they do love for each other. At the end of the day, the housewife reads a book from her boyfriend, and the boy is chased by agents. Finally. Want a short account even? BORING ... That's short enough? This woman would have to use her gun at the beginning of this movie and beat herself, to save the audience from this feeling. On the part of my sister my sister loved this movie. As I said, I am a cultural scholar ...
