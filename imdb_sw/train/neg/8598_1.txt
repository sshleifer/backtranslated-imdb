I just do it! This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen! It was very bad though, it was hilarious. My friend and I have built a lease because it looked so bad. Cheesy old old fricks are good for some laugh. To break the plot, some of the voices were called, the quality was awesome. But I'm sure I had an explosion check!
