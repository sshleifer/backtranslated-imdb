The fact that I did not have music is very personal opinion, unknown to history. I realize that it is an opera and not a document, but some important things are missing, especially if others say lies for it. Abbu Abas was a mastermind of this operation, which was set up and reorganized because of the discovery on the shiph board, to beat 50 terrorists from the prison of Israel, which is Samir Kuntar, an old terrorist whose story can get by searching for "klinghoffer samir" on google. Abbu Abbas was responsible for many other terrorist activities, even though he had no leg of Lauro. Ben Laden never put a foot on the birds that hit the WTC, did he? <br /> *** The possible attackers *** <br /> The movie denounces the acts of terrorists and the effect because of the fear they could live, constantly adding and how much Israel had done to hurt them. However, they have never shown the consequences that the Palestinians have ever caused Israel. The movie uses (quite horri !!! !!!) pictures from sabra and Chatila fear, and nothing says, to strengthen the general belief that it was Israel who was responsible, not to mention that it was Syrian-les Lebanese army who carried out the murder. Acting in general was very bad, but I think what can be expected from opera singers? In another writer I am shocked about how one can defend terrorists kill the hostage because the hostage attempted to incite the innocent innocent victims of armed terrorists, adding that one should not be sympathetic because he is an assistant zionism. Imagine how his wife was unkind, striking on the terrorists who beat her husband and threw her body into the sea. I hope no one in the world is as cruel as he (wink wink)
