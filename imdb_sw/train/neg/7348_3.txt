I was disappointed with this film. The first Waters experience I saw was Serial Mother and I loved it. Then I saw Pecker and I loved her. Then I saw polyester and I hated the truth. The only thing I liked about this movie was DIN. He / He had Hell of many talents. I was really surprised. In general, I will not recommend this film ...
