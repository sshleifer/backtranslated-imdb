How much this film looks like: the future version of Cinderella's story but for the songs and (images of sex rights)! The movie doesn't know what it wants to be very good takes a mess. It looks more expensive than most of Al Adamson's films but not the budget level that the audience has come to expect from sci-fi films. Vendors are very bad and different from Adamson's films, no old B members or actors B. Some music is similar but it is easy to see why Cinderella 2000 has forgotten for many years.
