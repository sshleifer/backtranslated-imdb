I lost this film because I was browsing through a movie of fear for those movies that no one heard and could be gem as possible. I saw this and, since I am a fan of violence and gore, I've got. It has received a rating of EM which means: Older. Thinking that this rare and advanced rating was quite important for violence and everything else, I got. Warning on the box said: Extreme violence, extreme Langauge, and Nudity. "Strong violence" struck my idea. The film ended to be a good flick of flask. It had one or two scenes but I found the worst in PG-13 film. Of course the amount in the movie is not all that count, right? You have a program too. Well, the plot was boring and nothing special about it. Do not rent. I am telling the truth. I can't imagine how one can enjoy so much until they say: "I can hire again." There was a time when you enabled it but I didn't see the film again.
