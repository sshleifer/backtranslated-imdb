First of all, I would say I'm LDS or instead, I am a Mormon. So when I was watching this film, I gave it a course of doubt. I can often find something liberating in every movie I watched. And this was no different. You have no time for redemption. But they are few and are in the middle. One of the first things I saw so much was that it looked like Halestorm was embarrassed to our Church! The LDS church, churches are called "county" and the basketball court is located in the "cultural hall". EVERY RIGHTS are these two names mentioned. The church is not known by name and "standards" is far away and it continues to mention what our church believes. Does it make me ask if directors are LDS or LDS citizens? This film was so great! It can truly be shown to our Church by good light and helps the public not only see what we should give, but also what we believe. Instead it was just an entertaining gently and left too much want. If I wasn't ready to have LDS, I would like to leave the Mormons ignorant, idiotic and embarrassed of their faith. Sorry Halestorm. You can do better than this!
