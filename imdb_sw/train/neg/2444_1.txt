Two houses, one road, one mobile phone, one car, one girl nearby, a boy next to a zombie. This list of links should be enough for a great movie of fear. All you need is blue light, close music and ... done. Not in the hands of Dutch van Rouveroy Director though! <br /> <br /> I would like to prepare "bad afternoon bad" from time to time. The concept is very simple: find additions, find other movie friends, and sink into the worst movies. That evening the peace of dirt is one of the best. Laughs sure! It's amazing, van Rouveroy still defends his film as a good success. To be a witness for this you will need to listen to the audio of the DVD. Again: rejection and laughing guaranteed!
