This is a phase in the popular series of Guinea Pig. A short period of Japanese television show, banned after psychopath admitted that he was led by the murder of a little school girl and show. This short in series is, like all other films in series, usually without any story. A group of boys have given a young woman. They hold him down and continue to ban him to death during his videofilming. They beat him, and pour oil on him, use him pliers and finally, to "love" around, push the needle through his eye. This is more direct than all the movies of Guinea Pig, and the first one. It could have been this film, more than any other, which gave the Guinea Pig rumors of being hot. Indeed they gave the inspiration of the movie Nicolas Cage "8 mm." These films have become quite popular in horrible circles. They have continued to go beyond the polished, but the same film movies like "Bleeding Blood". Perhaps it fills the blank left by Mondo films, which have been made less and become a real TV. It is not recommended, but perhaps convince those who will see anything at once, and wonder why later, I know I did.
