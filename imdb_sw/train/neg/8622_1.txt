Since Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon came together, there has been much discussion about the revival of the movie industry in Hong Kong. Don't believe it. People are now making movies in HK to give new meaning to the word crass. Running Out Time 2 is a perfect example. Ekin Cheng is the name of draw, here, but it uses only many films to idiotically and blowing coins. He blows the coins regularly and again and again. Why? Who knows? Sean Lau plays with a soldier who kicks off a good player. But again: who knows why? There is a good actress in a woman who runs a certain company and should pay compensation or something but she actually looks like she could be in a spa or shopping center than in front of the camera. Nothing makes any sense. No action. No sex. No comedy. All is named: Ekin Cheng. And you know what? Who cares?
