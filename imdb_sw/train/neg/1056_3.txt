Diana Guzman is a angry young woman. Dealing with the uncertainty of passion and lust, it takes his anger on the new goals. When he sees violence changed and focusing on discipline at the camping club, he knows how to find his home. The movie comes from there, as Diana learns to come naturally as well as the skills needed for a successful pipeline. Michelle Rodriguez is very good in the role, especially when sending out the fury of a young woman who has been beaten on both sides and fighting against the only personal situation but strengthening sex. <br /> <br /> Images can use finesse in its direction of all small actors, which are colored in comparison with older, more skilled. There are many breaks in the script, which prevents from sharp tension. The stability of the film is dynamic. This picture is good to see once, if only to see the power of a young woman fully whose feminine is complex enough to include her strength. Its restrictions prevent the inclusion of "see" from the group.
