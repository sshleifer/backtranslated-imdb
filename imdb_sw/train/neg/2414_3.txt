I have seen you see this on the shelves under "new releases" and found the idea of ​​hip-hop zombie flick far too interesting to pass. That's how it was paid in the box, however, and I thought myself, "What a great idea!" With there "Welcome to Oakland" sign on the lid, too. How could I resist? Unfortunately, the hip-hop part continued only as long as the head of the opening. There is no hip-hop music or hip-hop that had a great role in the film. After living in Oakland himself, I know that there are many artists who want hip-hop there, so the budget under this flick had no excuse to have a sound voice. Any number of artists struggling could jump on the opportunity to contribute to this flick. Why did the Muslims of Quiroz not use this advantage more than I? Once the film was in progress, it was a very old zombie movie that was just hit by black and Latino. You might think that this would put an extra slant on the film ... but it didn't. Somehow, the Quiroz Brothers's vision of "urban culture" explodes by driving-by shooting and dropping F at every line in the movie. The quick use of the word "fuck" is probably the most popular character of the film; there were one lines that had three or four words, and no line had at least once. I don't know quite about swearing in the movies, but the feeling here is that it was the result of a lack of thought for the authors (also members of Quiroz), and the script was usually very poor. br> <br /> Usually the film was disappointed. It would be interesting to see "true culture" zombie flick, but "Hood of Dead Dead" does not give up that calculation. Anime in the movie can only easily be white or eskimo or anything else. There was no different flavor of the film. It is just one of the budget run of the rental for hard and evil text, lousy text, amateur direction, bland movies, cheap voice, and nothing to recommend.
