I saw the movie, and I was shocked! Robert Carlyle is not Hitler he is a man who tries to be Hitler sadly. Modern has said, it does not show the truth. In the area Hitler struck the man with his gun. Hitler never hit anyone, he did not want to beat people with his fist, but with fists. Understanding ?? Another thing is: It is very obvious, that Hitler is evil, he was more cunning, than it was shown in this film. No German would be a leader, because he could see that it was bad. So Hitler really did not show his badness to the people. Is there any of you Yankees who watched the film "Der Untergang" or "Dawnfall"? this is a good movie, and awesome actors. And his German film. I think, this theme of Nazi and German, should not be reached as a film by people who know nothing of Germany. People! Watch "Der Untergang": <br /> <br />
