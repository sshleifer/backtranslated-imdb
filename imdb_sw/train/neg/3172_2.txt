This film has been made by fraud, abnormal trash. I love romantic comedies sometimes. Good looking is like eating ice cream for dinner. It's not something you do all the time, but the experience is very interesting that you can ignore how foolish you are. This movie made me think about how I was a fool to continue to stay all his time running. Everything about it shouted for cheap. In fact it looks like they have filmed a lot for some reason. It deals with CGI's interesting and crippled sets, too. <br /> <br /> Writing was clunky. I know that you can usually expect a problem of conspiracy in the comedy of screwball, but usually cares about the service because you laugh. This film is totally unacceptable that you are sitting there and strive for the impossible interaction of the interaction with the very improbable behavior involved. The events were placed on the film to transfer characters from one location to another or to provide a presentation. Indeed, this is how all movies work, but they should not realize that it happens. Inelegant. That's the word that I should send. <br /> <br /> There was almost no one in the movie who was actually recommended. I didn't care who finished it, as long as they all stayed in a hole away from me, and I didn't need to listen anymore to talk about it. Why is the only cool character in the movie, the character of Paul Rudd, want to have anything to do with a bitchy completely, abusing, controlling freak played by Eva Longoria? Also, almost all participants involved regularly took the solution of the sleaziest for any situation. A simple person pretends to be gay for only five years to join (and bathe with) and a woman is attracted to? The more comfortable feeling they could come with was the happiest of the same schmoe where she gets with the kleptomaniac sister of Rudd who had gone to bed the same. Lake Bell and Eva Longoria are attractive, attractive women. Maybe they will find something better to see down the road.
