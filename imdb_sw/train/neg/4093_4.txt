The program and characters are concerned and do not have the reputation of AS "plot" and "character". The main problem is the fact that everything is dark, out-of-goal, and blurry. The fact that Fulci filled the entire movie and the mist does not help. On the other hand, the whole thing is quite strange and filled with sex and abuse. The lack of variation is good entertainment, one of the main characters says they have no friends, however she looks at a new person in the moment of the screen, and has gaggle the whole of women side. Although he demonstrates his anti-social behavior by putting a small arrow on other poor people b ***** d who are involved in his own business! Images of blood or cloud around look more than the characters but what you want from Fulci. Perhaps it ruined his work, but it was no more stupid than Zombie. It deserves to hire if you would like to fight an Italian gory or want a sword and magic or something extraordinary. Can you sleep through someone who can suck into a hole 2 feet from your head and shout for help?
