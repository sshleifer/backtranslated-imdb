Where were his democratic views as well as those of the Republic? After all he worked for 17 years in the body of the government where his influence was slowing. Oh I forgot about 8 years it was 2 national command of the most powerful in the world. The film is delighted to show shots of the Senator Senator Gore asking why a NASA scientist was obliged to change the conclusion on his scientific paper, but he could not ask about the difficulty of Clinton / Gore in a warm temperature. Perhaps also close to the election year, or maybe it would harm the Hillary in '08. In any way he is a sly political and party man to the end of bitterness. It does not provide resistance to humanitarian use, no arbitrary quarantine, no way to the history of industrial development that has led to this point in time <br /> At the end this film was much more about Mr.. Gore yourself than any real problems of our environment. Mr. Gore if you really want to make a film campaign - shorten it and call it true.
