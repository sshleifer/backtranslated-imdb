SNL is very good but people who say this is like watching Skit Short on SNL is a dumb little thought. It's not like SNL, it's just a foolish piece. Andy Samberg tries to act like Jon Heder but fails. Although Jon Heder is just funny in Napoleon Dynamite Andy tries very much and people think he is funny. <br /> <br /> People just funny in movies were Danny McBride and Bill Hader. The only place that was very nice and Andy was a part of the coast. They could make a "Setting Place" very good if they didn't make a minute of falling 3 minutes long. <Br /> <br /> The section that mentions more than H is delayed. They are trying to go too long and half when it looks like Andy laughs when she does ... she is a horrible actor and is not supposed to be in the film. <br /> <br /> This movie is a joke and is for people with mental and brain age of 10 years of comedy. Which is almost half the US.
