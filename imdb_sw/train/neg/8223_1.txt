Of course, definitely the worst films I saw, no questions he asked! These opinion experts may say that this name should not be judged by the same criteria as others, since it is an independent, low-budget film, but a mfmon already? innovationism and limited innovation are afraid. Agree with everything that has been said on this film, for example the weak mind of acting (this is a bad time you take another go to the shooting area, god damn is), something that I found to be the worst is a general lack of intelligence in the script, considering that something exists during production. There was a shortage of discussion and respect for the audience, the girls changed their friends several times and seemed to show absolutely no singing for any rationality or even mind - five girls equal against one little female psychopath? glue on it, why do you? The only thing that can be seen as a certain victory in this name is a non-stop camera at any time so the viewer sees everything from it - which is like the remaining film, a good idea has been done carefully. <br /> <br /> ?? oh and by the way, this film does not get as a Wizard's Blair Project or Cloverfield or any other head published by a hand camera? this is an effect and not a reputation! The use of cunning can be breathing, but in this case it is an excuse for enough movies.
