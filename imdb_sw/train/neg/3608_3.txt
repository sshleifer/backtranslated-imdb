I have a good collection on the going movies, and this was added. Number 274 is correct. The head was with me to go first. University of Splatter. I thought this would be a great movie of fear. I was wrong. Don't do wrong, this is not the worst movie I saw, but it would be better. I love all movies, but this was one that was more than a laugh then afraid. The beautiful sound of sound, bad acting, and poor shooting plans are some of the areas that could be improved. 3 out of ten stars. <br /> <br /> Movie is ideal for a good laugh. If you're expecting one of these movies to laugh, then this is one!
