.... this mini is not available for age. I saw this and it was going on when you were first announced, and as many others were beaten. At the beginning of 2002 I borrowed a novel for WOW and W and R and I was more interested. I decided that I must see again and invest $ 200 with DVD sets. I looked again at both services for pain information and realized I had done things back - I had to buy a novel and borrow DVD. Do not believe it is deleted? Read the novel and see for yourself. Don't think this is a date? Take a picture of an old man who is not old enough to say he announced and watched the answers you get (warnings from those people who are different and looking for fear up to the stomach laughs.) <br /> <br /> this - Dan Curtis himself chose Ali MacGraw and Robert Mitchum. Yikes! Quality production, music marker, conversation - good news turned to the opera's 70th soap and producer / most powerful producer who was on his head. This is set to the completed minute. These two services were good during the initial ads and for those who saw them then, tug in the nostalgic string that reminds us of young days. IMO - this mini does not close up to its reputation and strong desire.
