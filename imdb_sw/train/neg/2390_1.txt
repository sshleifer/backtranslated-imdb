I love all the books of Tom Robbins, so I was very excited and wanted to see a film made after one of his books. I knew that there would be no way that the movie could catch even half of the magic of Robbins, but after seeing the movie, it made me never want to read the book again. The Film Even The Blues Get The Blues does not include eight content in this book, and it seems to focus more on the relationship between the Bonanza Jellybean and Sissy than anything else. With the line of infinite plot in the film, I think that the best actors can be chosen to play characters. Only actors in the film I thought they played their roles for Robbins' s notes in the book were friends of Julian, in their five-minute picture of the film. Those who have not read the book can enjoy the film, but as a big fan of Tom Robbins, this film was nothing but desire.
