Andy Lau star in another string of the striker. Daniel Wu plays Nick who works for fighters and is also close to the drug group (Lau). The movie begins when we look at the police trying to make the drug protection just see it pieces. We then are brought by a young drug girl and her daughter who lives near Nick and her players and fighters, and 45 minutes I have opened the movie and kept the news. You did well and good looking at this is opening the film if I have seen it for a long time. It's not as bad as you just don't care. I mean I wasn't really worried. I really started to do something else to forget what I had in the film below, that's how much I didn't care. I wish I could hate the film but the film is a weakness that didn't make any sense on me (not even something that I could sleep on just for something to ignore). Come on a box called Scarface of Chinese, what after the death? This is one to avoid.
