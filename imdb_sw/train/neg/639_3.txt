The head of the house of the soldier charged with war from the battle is here to be treated with dirty treatment. To have the mercy of the cast of kingship, to act on the bounds of their top talents, cannot redeem the 'Return of the Soldier' ​​due to its unmistakable ability to incite the viewer to emotional emotion. Better, if another auditor noted, coming when Glenda Jackson is on the screen; but even the power of Jackson's power loss cannot pull this film from its cold, it has no heat. Ann-Margret, who is sexually active and often accused of being unable to work, finds her true and deep capabilities lost here - despite speaking to the impulsive Middlesex impression. The hackneyed mark, with the destruction of many television services that are not available on saccharine ceremonies, is in the worst form of disappearance of the script, prevention, and spread of direction direction; except for its symbols and script and corseted script, 'Return of the Soldier' ​​has all the correct bits but it fails to work together.
