The comedic force of Pryor and Gleason could not save this dog from a thin-yellow plot, a weak script, acting badly, and continuing to laughable in destroying this mess together. It has a very short time to remember, but the well cries quickly. As a child I remember this as a Luke's warm car for two actors, but there was always something wonderful about the flow and sense of what was given in each area and how this relates to the general plot. If you look again after many years, you don't ask schlock-a-mania. I don't care very much about racism, because I wouldn't have a sense of seeing the film took the matter gently. Then it is clear to me that the events have been set as a series of outdated, not related to the 2 minutes of the comedy player (whichever is not so good), which came together with the editor after almost all the hole in the watering. Character changes the mood and motivation on the dime, without the rhyme nor reason, between scenes and inside scenes, and make this feel like no one had any idea to get out of the screenplay. Not that it was a responsibility to start with. I feel bad for two actors whose heritage has been destroyed by this epidemic that should not be done. Perhaps my sense of humor has been very refined ...
