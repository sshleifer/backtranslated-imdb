I've never finished the film. You can say that in this case I have no right to go through, especially for bad. But I do, just because I left it because I didn't look again ... I got more than half, and I came there by promising myself something good was around the corner. This film is very exciting, so it is not condemned that I was accused. I haven't read many other reviews, so I don't know if there are other gay people who have been injured that way, but I am gay, and I have gone through "similar revelations", dreams of the day, issues etc.. There is perhaps two times where I actually saw this film could go somewhere, where I felt it could have a certain meaning, or a ratio, but these hopes were lost when the next set of photographed images. I mean, just check the quotes on the IMD page. Unfortunately you can't hear the play, nor echo-ey will explain if you are reading the inspiration, because they are very painless / stupid / lost. I have given three star films, and all three stars have gone to movie movies that have performed a wonderful job trying to convert Archer's fancy ideas into something visible. Remember, I am not the one who decided to incorporate long-term barriers to television ... The unpleasant obstacle has already been made in films such as Gummo Korine ... I think it's very suitable that this film was planned in Sundance (because Archer had The connection to the festival through the volunteer work he did, by the way ...) because Sundance seems to be a single concert which is a major obstacle like this is still accepted as "arthouse". No, not a gallery, I am afraid it is just plain ** house. Don't look at it.
