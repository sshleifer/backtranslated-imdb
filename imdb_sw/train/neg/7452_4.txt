For me, this film seemed only to fall to his face. The main problem for me is the production of Glover as a common killer. I don't know if this grows out of forming or just a character, but I'm sure Glover can show a woman who is influential. He is a good man, and that's obvious in his performances. Other than that the film is running you to the story of the death of murder. No creativity.
