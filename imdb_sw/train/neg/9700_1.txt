I agree with many of the other boys. Losing image and time necessary. <br /> <br /> There is no joke that requires the paper to be written. The only exception from my pov is Olli Dittrich as Pinocchio. ("Egal, i muss eh Waldsterben") This reminds you of old times and RTL Samstag Nacht. It is difficult to describe the performers' performances, because most of them do not even have a good time during the production and just "do their thing". The camera is the same, the plot is interesting, I think you would be embarrassed even if you say this for many beer. <br /> <br /> Besides this I walked all the time, wondering about how the script like this could even be taken for production and waiting for the end. My 9-year-old son enjoyed it, but then he is very happy at this age :-) <br /> <br /> However, the 1 rating here is 1 very point. ..
