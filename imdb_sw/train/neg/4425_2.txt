Film about the Renaissance Harlem and one particular author. It compares the story of a modern day about a young, gay, black, black / black / black / black / blue / black / black / blue / black / black / blue / black / black / blue / black / black / blue / black / blue / black / black / white / black / black / white Well-directed, well written and (for the most part) done well. Also past events have been shot black and white. This is also one of the few films associated with gay men who are unacceptable and sex events (not open and no front). However, I hated this very much. The movie comes everywhere, full of potential characters (including the main character) and (this is a killer) goes to the snail speed. Three times I thought of leaving the theater because I was so tired. But the director was there so I stayed. His discussion after words show this was the work of love and taking 6 years to complete. I wish I would like this more (there are a few films involved with honesty and gay whites) but I can't. Unless you are very interested in the Renaissance Harlem there is no reason to see this.
