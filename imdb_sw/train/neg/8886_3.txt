Not very interesting. It is difficult to give any characters to this film, because there is almost no progress in the plot. Everything becomes clear in the first ten minutes and from there on its color as dry. Acting seems very bad, and reminds me of the old black and white movie of the Maoist period of time on Chinese TV. Although this is difficult to tell for the role of the female, Yuwen, as the story seems to require only a round walk as a mannequin of wood. It reminds me of the star of destroying Gong Li who somehow gained a reputation as a good Western actor for having scowl on his face all the time. Tian Zhuangzhuang 'Blue Kite' film was the best film. But do not show the fact that Springtime in Small Town was placed in 'late 40s. Unlike the Blue Kite, the fact that this film has been installed during the shock does not mean the plot itself, the ruins of the city seem to be not just an increase in nature. I wonder if Tian Zhuangzhuang is just trying to rise the popularity of Chinese films in the West and appeal to foreign audiences who cannot explain the difference between films that are 'good' 'deep' or 'hypnotic' and one that is awesome and useless. <br /> <br /> If any film fits the 'overrated' description, this is it. I don't see the reason here to stop worrying about the state of the Chinese film industry.
