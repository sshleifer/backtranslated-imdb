Poor performances with Sinatra, Martin and Hyer. Non-progressive characters. Surprise speech without a real plot. You choose more than the pancake, and the last more freedom than you can connect in four sequels (ie, if you even consider about these alphabet). MacLaine is the only real asset. The last sequence of "Chicago hood" looking for the character of Sinatra is delicious. Music in the sequence is also poor. And in the last case when Martin's character gave his hat to a woman who called "a pig," he made me out and find a stone to throw through my television screen.
