Another boy gets whacked. Out there to see this other person remove him. He has guardians and they kill the murderer, but the author finds the intention. He goes to the hospital where they took the lost boy. He walks in, with one of the guards, but he doesn't feel. I can't know why. It's not like anyone else is attracted to. He is the only author there. However, its editor breaks him to work on this peak story. But hey, he does it. He is going to see the sister and mother of the killer. A few minutes after departure loses a lot of time - a person blows a trailer - a big ball of fire. Then he searches the guards from the hospital. He sees it on his boat, but after a second minute they get water in a scuba tank because three boys are trying to pull them (and they have a long boat - a big fire ball). The author and hunter whack whack two of men who are trying to pull them. In the next hour another person is crossing the road, there are several muscles in the warehouse, the car runs away with destruction and death, fake suicide, etc. etc. Luse. strokes, all kinds of murder. <br /> <br /> Big things, but what the author and caregiver can't think of what is the original gray boy lost. What motivation? Of course, it can help us understand why the journalist is even interested. Through almost all this is the only journalist. No one else cares about the media. It does not have fire and fire. True, the lost young man was not quite a celebrity. His work was a little bit. He was the only President. Yes, he who lives in the White House. O, and the guardian is a Secret Service. <br /> <br /> What! Is that a spoiler? <br /> <br /> It should be. After all there are no television cameras, no other journalists to publish, no bloggers ... it's just another crime of police ... <br /> <br /> Lemme think ... <br /> <br /> No! Wait! Spoiler is that his wife did it! O ... First Lady. He was p - ed ed because the President was fooling around. And she leaves with it. She is very bright, huh? But how could hell have anyone to have that? Why can anyone bother? After all, one writer is even interested. <br /> <br /> I comment this "1". It was dumb I just needed to look. And just got dumber! That's a real spoiler! But though I have told you, you should see it to believe!
