I love many actors / participants involved in this project so the hate of the movie felt worse than if they used anonymous. The main problem was this film is just a concept made to appeal to the baby's boomers .20 or 30 years Nbc would probably make a movie like this about 90 years. listen to grunge rock music. Soundtrack will have a band like Nirvana, NWA, Public Enemy, Soundgarden etc. The movie like this will be as fun as The 60's and I gurantee you NBC do it. Look at the big problem and pieces when he has bought the networks that are when you live in a certain time when you're not thinking I live in 60 years or whatever ten years are retro trendy at the time. Sometimes someone does something like this should put more weight into the project
