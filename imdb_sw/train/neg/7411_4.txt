An interesting thing that involves the alternative direction in the hospital. Recall - Stephen Kings "Langoliers", "Kingdom Hospital" and an evening session of the evening. With a powerful atmosphere, the setup was good. There was sometimes a very sophisticated time of loop which you always have to appeal to the head. The story had many incomprehensible memories that led me to believe that all the time-hatreds of time - time of visitation / ghosts / ghosts fighting with heavy metal steel will be describing. And that was the dark floor and let me get down. Based on my look at the film provides NO PLANT about what causes events. Sometimes, some controversy is expected / welcome in these types of films. The dark floor was placed at a new level of variable. I did not expect things covered on a beautiful ribbon, but also do not let me left "Huh? .. is it? ... is I dose off? Maybe, I hit the shape flying for errors?" The dark environment left me in a very profound detail that "It was a dream" which is a shame because until until the end of the end I was very on board and enjoy the movie.
