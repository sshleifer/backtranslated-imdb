I watched this film as a preview of the art exhibition of Matthew Barney. He really organized me. I went stuck to the exhibition and, to go back, maybe you should have. <br /> <br /> In addition to the bigger (Bjork) logo and a rich and colorful image, the content was stimulating and predictable. Gee, I really wanted to see someone wearing pearls to see what the pearl writers came. The film was a romantic mix of Japanese cultural references and industrial shots of modern whaling technology used in wanting / harvesting. The film “looks” enough for shock-art to turn your stomach. <br /> <br /> What was the movie's action? While others may say that it is a piece of anti-whaling, one can also say that somehow also prepares whaling. Of course I think it was Barney's attempt to "watch" the audience with his male, male, female, and fetishes. The bottom line: unless you leave the art of Barney, don't worry to see this movie. The message is clear, speed, and cultural records are concerned. If you are after art-shock, you will do well on one of the many "Undead" movies or hunting the old copy of the Hustler and taking on the fecal cartoon.
