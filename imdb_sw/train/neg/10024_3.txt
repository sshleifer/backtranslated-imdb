The first lesson that the creators of the film (especially those led by Hollywood) need to know - just 'style' does not sell. I think Tashan when translating would mean fashion. Second, if you think about the model of sale, that did not prevent you from having a good story. <br /> <br /> Tashan has some stories that can be blocked by a good director. But it's not lighter. For example, all three - Saif, Kareena and Akshay - are narrators in different things in the story. But this setup is not used properly. There may be a better mix and match their details. The action process is from seven years. <br /> <br /> Cheoreography of the film is bad. I think Vaibhavi Merchant just sleeps through this film. Vishal-Shekhar has made a good mark but not this film. Why is Sufi song (Dil Haara) in Tashan? Why is the cool hinglish song (Dil Dance Maare) is not about Anil Kapoor when she is the English madman? Akshay Kumar is a grace saving of the film. But he is in his self. You don't care about this film.
