The left-hand camera was used, perhaps to watch a movie, but the result was so widespread that I started to get only foot disease from looking at it. It seems like a person with brain disease was doing a camera (there is no significant mistake for CP patients, but I don't think you would expect to get a lot of work as a movie writer!) The work of the camera was nausea, and so I persuaded, that the wife and I noticed unknown to stop on it after 10 minutes of suffering. I reviewed later (it was on TV), and didn't get much better. I recommend to give him this miss unless you need to get rid of any bad sushi you have eaten!
