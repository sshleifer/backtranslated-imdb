After seeing the bottom versions of the "Universal Soldier" budget, I hoped and prayed that Van Damme added her position as Luc Devoreaux in the second movie of Unisol. In fact, it seemed that this prayer was answered, but not what I expected. World Soldier 2 is as sharp as reading poems in your local library. No, even that would be more amazing. The order of the struggle is high-score, the quality of Bruce Lee, which is the only reason for liberation in all this pathetic excuse for the image of motion. That is to have an old WCW story of the "guy" Goldberg "playing the villain. However, putting Goldberg as a delicate-set of Seth would have been better. <br /> <br /> We missed most of the movie itself. It is like the school's school pupils scored together. The holes of the plot are bigger than the Kanye West ego what exactly did this film. For example: daughter Luc, Hillary looks like she is 11-13 years old and the first movie took place. Seven years ago. How could that be? Tell me that! The part of Luc's boyfriend was killed away and turned into Unisol is re-goddamn diculous only! C'mon. The director may have spent more time with this film as the first and left all the hidden holes. But oooh nooo! <br /> <br /> Talking about the plot, IT SUCKS! Universal Soldier 2 watered and worthless. Where the joy of weakness that Unisol goes berserk takes again his last thought in supermarket supermarket to think of the Desert of the Desert or something? This was the Millennium morning, you would like to attract more audience if this happened in the form of dystopia / Orwellian of the future cesspit. Corny is an accurate invention to describe this sad, sad, sad. From what I saw: Impact two, Under Siege 2, Robocop 3, and Hell, even the cheap Terminator / no class of moratorium "Class of 1999" is more entertaining than this!
