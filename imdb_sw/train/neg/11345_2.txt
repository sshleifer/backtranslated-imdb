I mean the word "traveler". It seems the film producers forgot that anything interesting is happening. Faith Domergue can do better than this. He should be a strange god, a revenge of Cobra's love for Marshall Thompson (there is an idea, eh?). Instead he is a housewife of fifty years old, and one of them, flat words wearing in all the film makes me think they beat it all morning before Faith had its coffee. On the rest of the rest, they are all so hard "all of America" ​​that the result is delicious. This is the most effective land covered in Val Lewton in "People's Cat". I think the "cobra ritual" should have the name of "contract guarantee of the contract". Why do so many talented people can sleep in their way, though the speed, predictability, occurring like this?
