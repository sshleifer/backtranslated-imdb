By the way, Corridors of Time is a success story because the movie is approaching its goal: the appearance of thousands. But it fails to make them laugh ... Les Visiteurs has succeeded, because the subject was a preliminary way of considering time travel: forget about the future of Zemeckis of the future, here comes the old French, the middle knight of the middle and its close-barbaric way. The proud, many thanks to the old words he uses, Montmirail can sometimes be disgusting but he continues to honor him. Then comes good. No one had seen the success of Les Visiteurs, the first. And it is not the use of a film expert to recognize that the Corridors of Time is made for money. <br /> <br /> General story begins after the end of Les Visiteurs, and immediately tries to justify the good when the required parameters are secondly touching. Description: not the use of trying to return Jacquouille jewelry stolen; What? remember this beautiful red and expensive red that he bought at the end of the 1st period? Where do you think money is? Selling decoration ... And that's just one of the holes Poiré tries to avoid ... and fails. <br /> <br /> Let's take a look at the characters: Montmirail hasn't changed, he's a little more boring. About Frenegonde ... that's another story: Valérie Lemercier decided not to engage himself in this follower to avoid stuck in the role of bourgeoise. And Muriel Robin tries to imitate him in the way I have found so I felt bitter for him. And Poiré does not realize that human beings do not have enough to make a good comedy. Think about a time trip, about digital effects, focus on the story and you will see that there is enough space on the stamp of the letter to write 10 times. is a theme. Movies for young people, let's say up to the age of 13.
