After the success of Part 4, another good was a natural step. However they should stop before starting. Alice, after living part 4 finds pregnant and looks Freddy uses her unborn child to find her victims, which are Alice's friends. A wonderful way of dreaming, very heavy on religious images and acting badly. Special effects are good, but the movie itself is not.
