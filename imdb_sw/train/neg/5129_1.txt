The message of this film is "the most important personality than beauty". Jeanine Garofalo should be "bad duckling", but the funny thing is that she is not all bad (actually she is more interesting than Uma Thurman, a friend who looks like an example). Now, could this film work as "bad duckling" did not attract you? How long will Hollywood leave this hypocrisy? In my opinion, despite the message you want to convey, this film is just ridiculous. <br /> <br />
