As a new red / latina woman I always look for movies that represent the experience and life of people like me. Of course I saw this film in a video store I thought I would enjoy it; unfortunately, I did not. Although the topics presented in the film are interesting and important, the story was not well developed. The film continued to refresh and continue with many characters on the screen come and go without much to contribute to the whole film. If the director did a good job of connecting events, maybe I would enjoy a little more. In fact, I would like to recommend the film as "Add Victor" on this one day any day. I wasn't just very impressed.
