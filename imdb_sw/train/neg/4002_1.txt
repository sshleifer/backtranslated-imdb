The social definition was excessive and the secret itself was built and resolved through a series of unsupported interactions that were not quite reliable. Nothing has changed in Fitz's personal life in the last decade which makes it interesting for far away. I had trouble understanding why she was complaining about her stay in Australia compared to the secrets of her secrets in England. Can't get into the Australian police? It seems like an artificial conspiracy to get him into a criminal investigation. The last series of the previous series was very good and cannot be interrupted, sometimes turning to silliness, and this takes a slot instead of returning to the direction of one series. Sad.
