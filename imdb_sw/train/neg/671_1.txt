Poor acting, no script, no conspiracy, no convincing killer, no doubt, no original set, use one room / bottom bed / person-back-of-the-mirror method regularly and renew it with boring , and not in the shadows, and the fact that NOBODY ever "is killed" (at least not on the screen), which on the other hand causes any doubts may apply from the outside and makes everyone feel the night more cheated for spending money on their ticket to enter .... his awesome movie w / o of LMAO of fear. What you see is what looks like someone who took a ketchup bottle and sprinkled it on a plastic sheet. You should be a guy who was sitting there shouting at the theater and bothering that he was enjoying this, or you would be eating / drinking at that time. True, I have a life and do not bother to write reviews often unless I really hate something, or enjoy it very much. <br /> <br /> But this film is AWFUL and I feel responsible for the type to warn you NOT give your money to Hollywood and encourage this kind of film again! <br /> <br /> It is one thing to rent a "bad" movie on the blockbuster from Weinsteins, the rest of it when you should stay in the playground. <br /> <br /> Also, if you want some nostalgia, don't forget! This is not a remake, nor do you think again. It's not scary, do not share, nor is enough enough to be "funny" as others on IMDb have claimed ... it's just stale and booooring. Here's what you will remove from this film: remembering the peak on the head of Brittany snow that has stopped over the plot, the fact that Jonathan Schaech needs to have a sexual relationship with JS Cardone for "Lost" to have another role as a murderer (because he is afraid of my pastor, and also very good to kill anyone) and for some reason (duh) everyone who goes back to the hotel hotel never comes back. What? What kind of person can not be concerned in prom when they decide to announce the prom candidates and the king and the fierce girl in some way can not show? This is my warning to you. Don't lose you as much money as I did. "Natural" takes it too but it is more pleasurable for the fans of Jamie Lee Curtis, although there is no way as bad as this piece (slowly loudly or proudly, but soon you will see this, you will understand why I say what I say).
