I'm not a big fan of slapstick of Stooges, but I see their interesting history. I have tried to explore things from every time of the Stooge, but the opportunity to see Joe's short look doesn't seem easy; this is the only one I have seen now. Some say that Joe-era's quality and shortcomings are not Joe's fault, and I think it's so. Joe as an actor is far from the worst thing about this. What is so sad for me has been said in another opinion: to beat other boys against the third attack the comedy / Stooges ethos team. Perhaps the style of Joe was shown, and those involved, as very inappropriate - though he had no real conflict of camera between him and others - and this is their way of working around it. <br /> <br /> And what are the names of this and some of the other Stooges flyers? Indeed the lack of creativity goes on there; Is it the kind of thing that the reason or impact of the short market has dried up?
