R Balki is trying to tell you a story that had been described earlier by Ram Gopal Verma in Nishabd in a sad way. This time is mixed with humor mature. Amitabh Bachchan is a Chef and has Indian Cuisine in London. He dominates and is proud and honors his work as any other work. According to him, Cook is art. Still can't make Hyderabadi Biryani well. Insert Tabu who sends the correct Hyderabadi Biryani created by him and soon begins to meet and finally love each other? Amitabh is 65 and Tabu is 35 ??. No probs! But one Hitch! Tabu's father Paresh Rawal !! Couples decide to meet the father with the consent of their marriage. But Amitab knows that Tabu's father is too small for him. And the problems begin? The performance of all three actors is brilliant. The script of the film is very strong and interesting. The film discussion is interesting. But somewhere you hear that your stomach is not well filled. Sometimes comedy is not well known. The film also tries to go for a long time. <br /> <br /> Music is nothing to sing about Track Track. The camera function is good. Director R Balki could offer better from this script. But in the second half he himself appears confused. The situation of "Satyagrah" of the father seemed irritating. But the verse spoken by Amitabh Bachchan during the area is a suitable clap. Overall, Chee Kum is required to have more sugar!
