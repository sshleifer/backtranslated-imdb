Townies are a laziest movie that I have ever seen, and I saw the movie Witch Blair (one and two parts). It seems to be confused in what it wants to be. Not enough to comedy, not bad enough for the game, not enough blood for fear, and not good enough to look. It contains the events of a man who makes karate "slapstick / bloody" so I think, oh this movie will be in the vein of the Toxic and Candidate Trash. Then it increases without warning in the female game about the lost girl, the injured woman (the mind) and the believing mother. Then it strikes itself in just the best part in the movie that is installed as a sitcom without laughing songs. The part I say is TOWNIE alone who is alone in the comfort of the corpse. That was the only part of the movie that gave me any feeling. Others were the waist of my life. Then, to show how CRUEL Wayne is a kind of DOCUMENTARY at the end of Wayne's film (Director) playing Toby (star) to the public. It made me sick. Even though Killer Nerd and Mrs Killer Nerd (two other movies and Wayne) are not the best, they at least think enough you could stay welcome until the last credit. I even like the little Nerd Killer, had other great lines that I still use it to this day. If you like underground movies, if you like low films, and if you would like to watch your feet, they rested, you can't love TOWNIES! <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (out of ****) <br /> <br />
