I thought this was one of the most complicated holiday movies that I have ever seen - others being a Christmas Eve and JACK FROST. All three movies are about death. If you would like to be totally sad, then in all ways watch this film or any of the others. In this film, acting is good and some of the circumstances (away when people die) are good. But, I am worried that a person with clinical problems can see the film by accident and do it yourself! With the "fun after" end, much of this film is a great tragedy after another. And, because of the reasons, SINDI TO LEARN TO BE LEARNED when I look at a Christmas movie (I know this looks followers - after all, not shouting your eyes and hearing what grief all the holidays are right?) <br /> <br /> For the most unfamiliar experience, try a home of forgotten without TREE Christmas, George C. Scott's Christmas or Christmas story instead - unless of course you would like to be sad.
