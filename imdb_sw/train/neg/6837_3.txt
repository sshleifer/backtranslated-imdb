Typically, I do not like repetition films .... PERIOD. But Impact Double has a little more than your ordinary modern revenge. You see, DI has action, precision, foreign sites (ie Hong Kong), assault rifles, and sufficient military art to satisfy your desires by fighting offensive weapons. If you take revenge, there are criminals you would like to throw out of the window-glass window on the top floor of the 40-story building! However, the two impacts of any psychological treasures that harass the conspiracy and gender discrimination, racism, and evil that have invaded the "Eye for Eye" and "Death of 2". The department's Impact Double plot is as transparent as the wrap wrap. Chad's parents and Alex were killed by a group of people who were hit by a group linked to family friends and money or at least what I remember. Description of why boys were speaking in French accents is one lousy. It was not a water plot that made the film worse, but the use of clich√©d lines and comes from another film (from Lethal Weapon to Mrs-Princess) made it worse. But even then two effects are still visible. But why are these moral films such as a crime (for example, a British greedy young man killed in Chad by Alex's parents and that a lesbian redhead ass) would like to hate your fiber?
