I have written at least fifteen months of this small flick of no-published flick and no published, so I must open that person on imdb.com likes this bad movie. The idea that the group of futures can revive the military tank that has set up in the desert for more than a decade, making the machine fight again is difficult. So it is acting and direction. Pass on it.
