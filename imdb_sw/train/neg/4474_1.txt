lose my life, .... The director should be ashamed. why people feel they need to make useless movies never mean to me. when he died at the end, it made me laugh. I had to change the channel often in the film because I was embarrassed to look at the bad act. in fact the boy who played Heath didn't work anymore. On top of that I hope the director has never made another film, and has his payment to be taken with this trick. {.02 out of 10}
