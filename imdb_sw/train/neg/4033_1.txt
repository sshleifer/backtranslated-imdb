It hurts me to write these positive reviews but to do so I just encourage these people. First, just because the film is done on a small budget does not work properly and is not good. In fact, in this case, a small budget is probably a successful film alone because it has prevented large amounts of money from the destruction of one of the holes and holes. Have you ever seen comedy in the theater? Have you ever heard people laugh and think "what dickens you up"? Well even these hips did not laugh. Things were so bad in the middle of my cat took his first bath. This is not a film, this is the kids .... there are no monkeys making pictures that leave you irritated as moving to France. You're going, there's a clown on my door ..............
