This film is an open and left test in Hollywood showed the rule of Reagan as powerless and parliament. Some errors can be made during the crisis, but I'm sure not to the extent that is shown on this high-quality film. My first response was that this film had to be led by Oliver Stone, but I was wrong at this time. There are many other obvious.
