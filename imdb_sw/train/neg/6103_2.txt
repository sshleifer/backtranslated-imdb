Be honest, I wonder with the good votes that this film has received. The film is approaching 81 minutes of life, and the audience should suffer the whole way. There is indeed a good time in this film; Charlie Spradling offers good performance. He is given a very good conversation and he handles it well. Scott Valentine (partner of Merrideth in Family Relations), on the other hand, is a nice looking look. I think the transparency of his performance is witnessing the boy on the beach wearing the proposed chummies and the tiger .... give me a break. Also, Valentine gives us a beautiful picture of fighting a vampire of suffering who loses a day (see a more interesting guide to the vampire of suffering seeing Denice Duff in "Blood Storms: Subspecies 4"). The movie flows slowly and is just mounted punctuated by, and being honest, Charlie Spradling's scenes of dance. This film can only be honored for fans of hard die of Charlie Spradling (which I am, and I still had a hard time watching it!).
