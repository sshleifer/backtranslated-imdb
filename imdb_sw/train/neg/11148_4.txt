This is a prime example of a low budget, winning over what will be a good story story. Let's return Samaire Armstrong (after seeing his work on OC I know he can do well), then read the best script and budget. Specific effects were bad, and especially bad computers were produced, that almost lost me and the first wolf appeared on the screen. With Samaire Armstrong's (caution!) The switch into waswolf was made to stop him first with the bad data of the GCIF before he even started turning (the last human fantasy, and also Pixar made these a delicious, think about figure as nude doll ). The story was interesting, although the idea of ​​damuline in waswolves was not something new. If it has also entered into evil, (perhaps) it is not too bad, and the end of the human nature should have a second line. A small part of the "Waswolf Partner" book that made some of the other characters in spell time was very effective, but could be further expanded to describe what happened in the past. <br /> <br /> Bringing the best script and direction, and I'd like it again.
