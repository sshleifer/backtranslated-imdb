Perhaps someone heard about Alberto Tomba. Former police, former heavenly champion, and now, actor TERRIBLE. "Alex L'Ariete" was planned to be a TV "mini serial", but the Italian television itself refused to show movies on his way. Now it is, you believe, the movie of ignorance. Script is a hilarious (required to be a great movie), something like a 5-year-old child working. But what motivates you is an act of amateur: Alberto Tomba, who really did not trust as a policeman himself, plays a very bad character: a special job of Italian police known in blowing doors opened! ("ariete" is "sheep"). This good man will try to save the young life of a young Italian (Italian Italian girl, married to singer Eros Ramazzotti): good but not quite in acting. Get rid of this and make a claim. Movie which is a disgrace to the Italian movie industry: John Travolta only in the World Attack is near.
