I am a great fan of Italian films from seventy years, and I am not surprised to write a beautiful Barbara Bouchet among my full-time managers, so I entered this film with other hopes. However, it soon becomes clear that this is a very unpopular film that will not go anywhere. Certainly no one will get into this much more expectations, but the fact that this doesn't mean it is not so interesting when you think it's too light and no characters are interesting. As the title shows, the film focuses on 'pride'; in this one case that stole, says and transports items. That is basically all the conspiracy that this film has. The movie has a 'seven-year' style with the idea of ​​being very worried. Sometimes it looks like Boro Draskovic directors and Gregory Simpson were trying to put on some sort of a point, though anything that is not very good. Seeing Barbara Bouchet on the screen is always fun, and that's here too; he is definitely the best thing about the film and the sequence which he hang out of the naked car is the best part of the film. In general, Rogue will probably be appealing to people who love the style of seven years, but unfortunately it has nothing else to offer.
