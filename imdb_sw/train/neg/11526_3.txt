I enjoyed the previous Ittenbach film that I would see, "Burning Moon". But when the movie was bad and inappropriate, "Premutos" looks particularly play to laugh. Although it is very good how Ittenbach did this film without money in its extra time (and the DVD document is worth seeing this), I found myself always fighting and not quickly going to the second location of the year. Certainly, there is a year, and if you want it then go ahead and enjoy it. But show it: there is a huge amount of disabling comedy and the excitement of storytelling. Many are comparing this with the film of Peter Jackson, especially "Braindead". But check what Jackson did in the same budget in "Bad Badte", it's obvious Ittenbach is missing one thing that Jackson has a talent. 3/10 (for good effects and a lot of violence, and for getting more of the small resources - but not the value of money I paid for)
