This movie is farce! The names have been blamed for the plot that is emerging and spreads in something unknown to any literary partner. And they have a bucket to give Beowulf code of ignorance / armor of rainbow. Beowulf does not need such a weapon! In the poem, he shares Grendel's arm with his hands! And I can't believe that the authors did such a thing. The Grendel way is shown to be amazing however. That and cast are the only points of the feature. My English teacher would go foul if he saw this abomination. Unless you are a fan of the problem of "Beowulf," you avoid this film at all costs. And yet, I would recommend it.
