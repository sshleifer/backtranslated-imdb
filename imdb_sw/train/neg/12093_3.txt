Isabelle Huppert is a good actor. The director of "La Pianiste" understands this, giving the viewer for a long time takes the face of Huppert, and these are happy to see. Huppert is not an animation actor - enrolls the sensation and raising the smallest to the eye or blowing a smile. <br /> <br /> Apart from being happy to watch an experienced actor than his work, there is nothing in this movie that makes me want to recommend. (Okay, if you like to enjoy selfishness, sado-eyeschism, and strange behavior, “La Pianiste” can work for you. All these wonderful material there is a true kernel. People who are competing at the highest level - music, athletes, whatever - they start as strange people, and they are created to be strangers to a competitive environment. It is not worth traveling on cinema movies. relearn the lesson of life. <br /> <br />
