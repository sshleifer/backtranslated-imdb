King KONG VS. GODZILLA (1963; which I remember after testing BOMB) was my introduction to the worship director of Honda; this is not better? it's just that I have learned to be more tolerant towards the lowest price! <br /> <br /> Here, we actually get two Kongs at the price of one: the worst and dopey-looking big dark and the robot difference of which looks worse! The simian creature lives on Mondo Island (!) ?? where it is shown to fight with several other creatures, and become friends of the trio of mankind. Typically, it falls to the heroine of blonde (and bland); In fact, the most amazing is the fatale of women in choots and madness of mad madness? named Dr. Who and games to look for anemic and cape are often associated with a vampire! She snaps King Kong and inserts hypnotizes in order to get an X feature, which gets into the cool North Pole; it seems, a large peak unknown with radiation than a mechanical counterpart (and, to ensure its full cooperation, Who even kidnapped three 'colleagues')! The female agent then has a heart change, helps the heroes (one of them, usually, is American nondescript) and who is killed by whom. Then it finally runs and makes Tokyo, where it has the last end with a robot. Doctor runs the next violence in his small? which, at the request of a nightmare dream of Kong, is dealt with largely by a large ape.
