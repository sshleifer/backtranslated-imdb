Unless people seem to buy into this garbage! As shown as "Orel Ethics" has shown, even if you have tried to do more caution, on top of the evangelism you can imagine, it will not come close to the transparency of this show. It's hard to tell what is going on while you're looking at it. What is the news display? Discussion discussion? Who knows !? They start with information on various international stories, but with the seemingly simple points, the information is interrupted by this ordinary person, with a face with a greater forehead than his whole face, mixed and laughing and generally becoming angry. > <br /> Pat Robertson doesn't look like a very bad person at first glance. He is seen only as an old man who is innocent, stuck in his old beliefs (such as our grandparents). But this is a person who has called a murder, who has made friends and donations to one, but the rebels of two murderers, who have used illegal money to run diamond mines, who has supported abortion in China, and who it immediately means that the Baacas (male male Caucasian male) are better than all other races. However, all of this may be interesting, except that it seems to have a fan base enough to put its small concept on air 40 years later (or that, or enough money for some bribes TV executives who do not provide what they show). Idiocy's show becomes awesome when you realize that some people, somewhere, should look and hanging on every word. Even when Robertson has shown how often he is damaged, people still listen to him. I don't know if it's funny or scary. I think a good combination of both.
