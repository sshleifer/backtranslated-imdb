Watching this film was a waste of time. I was tempted to leave the movie, but I refused. I don't know what Ridley Scott wanted, but I learned to be in the army, women find as ignorant as men. They learn to spit, insult and fight, and that is also a waste of time (in my opinion). And, however, was hell the last place in Lybia? Are they still fighting with Gadafi or is it easy for everyone to believe people of Islam are always dangerous?
