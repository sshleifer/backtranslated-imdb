As a great fan of fear films, especially J-horror and also gore I thought Nekeddo burâddo seemed good. I did a survey of the plot, read the instructions, and even look at other pictures to make sure it looked like a good and awesome movie to watch before downloading. So the excitement had been completed and ready to be frightened and reluctant in the wonderful year I was expecting I was very disappointed. The plan was ridiculous and was meaningless and left without a description, the year was a pleasure rather than terrible, and had the effects of the cartoon style? Acting was probably the only thing that was so scared about it. I did not understand the idea of ​​the cactus and the way the mother of the mother was lost in the middle of the sea after following the light, leaving both of them not explaining well, or maybe I did not understand if my mind did not understand what I was seeing. I appreciate how it should be; amazing with a few events (cannibalism wonderful and kissing mother?) indeed they were, I just think they went a little bit and even in a horrible way, they made it unacceptable which made it so credible that the pleasure rather than fear in my opinion. However it is a very entertaining film and I laughed too much with a few friends, but sadly we were expecting not to be so comedy so it has worth looking at the value of entertainment, but not expecting the dark, deeply filming scary and horrible; you will only be disappointed. If this was a horrible comedy / spoof it would probably have a top rate of nine, the peak to be a strange situation when the husband climbed into his wife's stomach and closed his wounds, but if sadly sad I gave one.
