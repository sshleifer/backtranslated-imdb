102 Dalmatians (2000, Dir Kevin Lima) <br /> <br /> Believe in healing, Cruella de Vil (Welcome) is released from prison and puts out the start of life. Things are going well for the Cruella who is busy helping dogs without shelter off the street. When the clock faces Big Ben, things turn. Emotional therapy is interrupted by Cruella is back, and this time he has decided to make this visible coat he always wanted. Glenn Close begins his role as Cruella de Vil and once again is a film show. Every area that has within it is worth looking at this improper sequel, which is more sensitive to repeating the previous film, rather than new stories. It has changed. ??
