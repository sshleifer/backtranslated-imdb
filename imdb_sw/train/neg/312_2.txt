If you have ever seen this film, you will know that! If you don't, and you want to see a typical BAD film, I give you this movie, because it looks like the worst. Therefore, if you are really bored, remove. If you want to know what it is, here is my brief summary: Adam Sandler is employed to work on a cruise ship of a cruise ship with some examples of Ms Universe and five others. Adam doesn't like how one passenger gets all the babies, and tries to take a cheezy joke. But wait! It's just bad! You will have to rent a movie yourself to see how true it is.
