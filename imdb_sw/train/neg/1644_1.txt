Hands under the worst films I saw. I thought anything could destroy the Final Step, but this makes it easy. The movie is about 3 boys who meet on Sunday to discuss their sex journey from weekends. The fourth wife - who is married and - which was part of the group shows and talks about what she and his wife do. No work in this film. Jokes are not funny but are repeated in the movie. The greatest player at the end of the movie is laughable. Avoid at all costs.
