Unless the head should be some kind of spoiler for the wife's change (fiends! Destroy for us). Anycase, if this film has not been done on-to-TV, would, it was very low budget, not written, taken, and hits everything 70 except disco. No one appears, and you may not worry about what happens to anyone in this. It is possible to forget except for bad, bad displays.
