RATING STAR: ***** Function **** Just Misses Mark *** That Little Little Among ** Lagging Back * The Pits <br /> Some plutonium doomed to some very bad people now you have ways to develop A total destructive bomb â€” Josh McCord (Chuck Norris) and his little cocky Deke (Judson Mills, a different actor from the previous film) with the help of Josh's adopted daughter Que (Jennifer Tung) put out to stop them. This was another film that was associated with terrorism year after 9/11 events. Reported in 2001, Norris himself made a subsequent comment on how the film line was similar to what happened in New York City that day, so they would have been in a state of film where Norris and his side - kick kick a certain terrorist dog like anything else . Other than that, it is similar to anything that Norris has ever entered. It makes you wonder what nature did to prove the first good, and if this could get President President 3 can come soon. If you have seen one Norris film, you have seen it completely and nothing new or unexpected happens with this, but at least you know what you get and, if I say, it might be what some people needed to stop steam. **
