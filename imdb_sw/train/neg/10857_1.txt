Check out the film site, a lot of time was placed in doing it than in writing script for this movie. It cannot be too far in its pride. Original story? When? They should have found the script far away from the old covenant, or to deal with a legal repercussion for a bit of horn-tooting. Special effects end? Come, I would do well with Atari 7600 and jug of earwax. Movie theaters? Yes, the funniest home video of America looks still common. I'm sure they had a little money for this head, and really sf isn't really good, or it's very bad now and then, or it's just plain hilarious, but it's a story that makes this film a waste of time and money. 4 stories are connected to one and all of the bits of the bee-seen and done-ready bits.
