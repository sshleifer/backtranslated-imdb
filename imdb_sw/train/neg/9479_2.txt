This movie seemed like it would be better than it had been. The movie is good, the acting looks solid, the conversation was not very complicated ... but twenty minutes in this long area with a Doctor who you know is really sick in the park pretending to be a doctor - and just goes south from there. Over and over, the demon is about to look more severe because of something seen by Godzilla in the curse of demons. There are also supernatural worshipers who wear masks that seem like young people walking from the beginning of Runan's Run. At the end, the movie couldn't save this film. Despite very good performances and actors, the story does not work anywhere. I think "Hellbored" would be the best title of this.
