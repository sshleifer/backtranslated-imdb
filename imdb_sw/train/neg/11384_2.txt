From time to time Europe began to fight World War II, to the end of the war, Hollywood (with massive transfers from the government) made tons of films made to try and get youth into the Army, by making the life of serviceman seen "cool. " That is far away, meaning that the life of the soldiers is not working, you get good food, and you get almost every day to listen to Ann Miller on the radio. I am too small to be involved in WWII, but I think that there is more than that. There is a whisker of the barest cats of the plot, and a group of musical numbers with some of the day's leading actions. I think that in 1943, even most of the community members knew there was more to go abroad than the wacky hijinks shown on this film. While I am sure it was meant to be viewed as a festive entertainment, I can't help but ask if the family and loved ones of the men are fighting, they were interested or ignored and this is a decline of their beloved sacrifice.
