Does the Lanter play a computer game that attacks a terrorist attack, and Ripley, a state-of-the-art computer, designed by potential potential helpers, follows because he will borrow (for hacking) money from a neighboring bank account His neighbor will pay a class trip to play chess in Philadelphia. Near the neighboring neighborhood of the computer, it has relatives in the middle of the east whose bank sends money to the neighboring bank, and Ripley sees a terrorist relationship. Ripley has the ability to ring a missile strike. Oh, oh! This War Games version is faster and more aggressive than the movie War of the War in the early 1980s. Well, the electronic industry has much more to work with these days. Makes sense. So the film makes us an amazing CGI on computer screens, and once Joshua, leading the Ripley, is found to work, we are left to watch computer against computers and human beings, expecting, begging ... ing, OMG-ing, and many things hopefully come out. In other words now we get a film of a planned TV type, and it's Oh Hum Time. Go back to the 1980s and see the original movie War Games. It's better. But, in fact we should ask ourselves: we do the computer and the very mind that one day, in time, will dominate us? Hmmm ?????? .. <br /> <br /> Violence: Yes. Sex: No Hate: No. Languages: No.
