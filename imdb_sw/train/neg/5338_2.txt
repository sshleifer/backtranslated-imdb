Elvis Presley has a "semi-reproduction" of Native American ("Hindi") who advocates its storage from small business. Everyone likes to drink, fight, and make children. Fighting, fighting, and "blowing out" transforms the hand-defining hand "How"? Even though he has renewed, Elvis is more healthy than he was seen in previous films; perhaps, he was ready for his "return" to his famous. Could not be this script for this movie was anything exciting. Joan Blondell tries to deceive Elvis, and the Meredith Burgess in the "color war", should be embarrassed. <br /> <br /> The best text is "Stay away" (in fact, "Green Sleeves" with different lyrics). The most shameful song is Elvis's love song for "Dominic" bull. There are some surreal screens, but you have never had enough trippy to succeed in that kind; though, "Stay away, Joe" can give some laugh if you have a "correct" feeling. Otherwise, stay away. Stay away, Joe (1968) Peter Tewksbury ~ Elvis Presley, Burgess Meredith, Joan Blondell
