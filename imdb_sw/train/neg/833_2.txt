There was not many stories in this film. It emerges freely from the events in the first movie of the King Lion. It should be how Timon and Pumbaa met through their unity. But there is no more than that. It combines certain events from nature, then it's grandparents on how this film has changed their little. But still, is it? I was hoping for something a little more. Instead, all that I am shown to them is an empty plot and a little explanation. I think if you want to see other things in the world of the Lion King, then it is. But more than that, it has little rights for animators. Disney really should stop this direct production to video. In fact it was quite boring and could be used to Jason Statham. "D-"
