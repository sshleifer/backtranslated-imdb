For local viewers I can see how they like this movie. Outwardly, without the interest made, it was not very meaningful. The Germans were shown as inferior to Russians as heroes. Sexual romance was not thought and restricted. How a young woman can 'love' a lieutenant from charging she had a lie. How she could, as described at the end of the film, never married just because of this pastoral pastoral. I told the Germans they were shown as idiots and which was an example in expulsion in the marsh. Several German troops climbed, pushing the Russians down the river. So the Russians hid and the Germans left on the edge of the marsh and stood there listening. I think they didn't want to get their wet boots, but I'm sure the officer would have ordered 20 or 30 men into the water to seek lighting. But that would have ended the story. The Germans also came into the barn where Russians hid in the loft and did not have a fire problem inside the roof. In the worst soldier would have hit the grenade into the loft and did not climb the level of intervention. I saw some investigators who said they were crying at the end. I wonder why? You knew this small band would disappear and did not focus on the heart.
