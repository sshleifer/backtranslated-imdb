I was interested in seeing "Mr. Put it" because I am a big fan of David Boreanaz. I got, however, it was 1-1 / 2 hour nap. The cluster seemed to be fun: Boreanaz is Lance Valenteen, the business owner called "Mr. Fix It", where people who have asked us to help her to find their friends take them. <br /> <br /> Among the problems with this movie is editing, script, and acting. Although I have found Boreanaz's delight in other film roles (except the movie "Crow" he did), this was desperate. Sometimes, his behavior was interesting and others, flat. Supported support reminds me of the opera's day-to-day players. I realize that it was not a big film budget, but some of the cuts in the area and music didn't seem to be the same. My advice: check your own risk.
