PEOPLE OF WASO-SPOILERS AHEAD <br /> <br /> Why do people, during the confusion or the sick or panic in the club, go through the dance floor full of their bathroom way? Who in their right mind will hide under the bed when someone breaks into his room? How often do you remind the visitor's door and when they do not respond to the answer, you open the door, you walk, you shout a few and start to go through his stuff? If you were being executed by someone you discovered was a murderer, what would you do? Are you low-down and hide under a wooden platform or between metal equipment? Run, quietly undoubtedly, up to the old warehouse or other reduced structure? <br /> <br /> I would like to talk about almost any exciting that has come out in the last few years, but since this is a "Return" page, I am really talking about "Return." I saw it free because I work on a cinema movie and do an action to explore all the "awesome" movies. I thought this was a tolerance ... aside from very worn clich√©s. Sarah Michelle Gellar is a real drab and looks kind of "Huh?" through many films. The plot details are provided as soon as the film goes on and is close enough to make it unless there was not enough information as it moved and so I had lost it to the end of 2/3. </> <br /> If you are an amazing fan of death, it is important to see at least once. If there is nothing better in the theater and you want to watch the film, eh, I think it's worth the ticket to the ticket. If you thought the trailer made it look like an interesting movie and you can't wait ... wait.
