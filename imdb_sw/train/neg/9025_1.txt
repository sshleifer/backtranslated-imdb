Sorry - this movie is just the cheapest production. I saw promoting Material and anticipated professional as a "Stormriders" - what I was presented was a Modern Budget-Movie like "XENA" or "Hercules" on TV. No Sky, very interesting, and more anti-exhibition. Some good ideas - not more. I hope I get a chance to make a film like this and then show me how to make it! <br /> <br /> My ASIAN Tips: "MUSA - WARRIOR", "STORMRIDERS", "SHAOLIN SOCCER", "BATTLE ROYAL", "VERSUS", etc.. Nk <br /> <br /> Sorry for my bad English!
