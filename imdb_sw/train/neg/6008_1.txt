If you have made a mistake to see the movie before reading the book, please do not leave on the series. I bought my first copy of any books in May this year, and I have already completed the book 10. I advocate that the movie is a piece of garbage that does not consistently even the smell of the right. When "Left Back: The film" only seeks the story of "Left Back" (book), characters have never been more accurate. A few examples: Rayford never acts on his feelings for Hattie (he is almost when he heard about disappearing); Buck Williams is an angry blonde, a newspaper writer, not a television writer; Chloe is Stanford, and most of the story of Rayford is wondering if he is 'saved'; Buck and Chloe don't meet even later, at a meeting in New York, founded by Hattie; Irene and Raymie have never 'in the book,' rather than the flashback ideas of Rayford; The road is jam filled with wrecks after the rapture that Rayford and Hattie should return to the suburbs ... etc., etc., etc. And so just from the first movie; they are approaching the third release. Please, even if you like the movie, make a booklet a chance.
