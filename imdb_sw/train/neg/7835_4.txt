Man, I wanted to love these. I'm hungry for good television and I'm happy with TNT for providing these “opportunities”. But, sadly, I am in a few I think when it comes to Cinematic Stephen King. As brilliant as the writing of the King is, the anger is that it does not just translate well on the screens, big or small. At least a few (very few), the King's experience cannot be closed with the same results that the stories read during reading. Many people did not agree with this, but I am sure that in their hearts' hearts they must admit that the best story of the chosen King is the color of what they have read. The reason is simple. The story of the average King takes place in the mind-scape of characters in the story. He gives us the thoughts of their inner thoughts, their feelings and opinions sometimes broken or untrue. In short, the King replaces readers where you can't put a Panavision camera. If viewers look at the displayed King, we are left with less than half information than the reader gets. Not too far to say that One becomes a character in the story of the King they read, where One is reduced by a small voyeurism of the same character when being bound. As long as the King writes, Hollywood will try to beat everything that comes from the word of his word, regardless of whether it is necessary. I do not claim filmmakers to try, but it takes an incredible amount of talent and a round-line line of Stephen King's influence that works. Work is the same as converting the lead into gold, or other arcane Zen competitions. Oh well, good luck sometimes.
