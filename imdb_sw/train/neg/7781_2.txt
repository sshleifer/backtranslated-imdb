Bright men, sexy women, lots of lots, and a monster that is unreliable that rises from the depths of the polluted lake. You think "Monster" would be fun ... but it's not true. It is Tony Eisley and John Carradine, however, and in my book that makes it worth viewing at least once. In an interview with "Fangoria" in 1987, Eisley recalled that Herbert Strock had said a lot of the film, but somehow Kenneth Hartford - who only guided pictures of his children Andrea and Glenn (showing characters named Andrea and Glenn, in particular turn ) - received the full loan. Considering how bad the result was, Strock was happy that he had no reputation! "Monster" looks and feel of a movie of mid-late-seventy-seven, that's why I would leave it back every time. As entertainment falls flat to his face, but as a reminder of another age and a damaged form of film making, it is very good. The only thing that was lost is the driving drive.
