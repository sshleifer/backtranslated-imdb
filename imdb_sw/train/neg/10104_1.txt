I just watched the first 30 minutes of this and what I saw was a piece of decoration. The exhibition I saw was not as bad as Wood Wood's movie. No, it was a hundred times of work. Ed Wood has the reputation of being the worst director but not true; ydiot who led this junk is the WORST Director ever. <br /> <br /> The American striker has a German reputation! "Police station" was a desk in the warehouse and the "Police Station" based on the wall. There is a fist fight where pain disappears close to FEET TEN. These police drag women, pull them and lead them to the warehouse. She tells her boyfriend partner waiting in the car. Then comes out of the warehouse carrying a duffel bag. The girl thinks maybe something is wrong, that her boyfriend can be a bad offender who is murdered by these women, but she doesn't know if that happens because - she is moron! The discussion is very stupid, acting is bad, and the characters are acting in a stupid way I ever saw on the screen. It is obvious to the police partner that he catches these women illegally and strikes them into the warehouse and returns to the car with a duffel bag and the body in it, and yet, a lover, present all the time, does not know what happens! <br /> <br /> The film's director is a total hack. I stopped the film for 30 minutes because I couldn't do it again. It should be one of the WORST movies that I have considered and I will never waste time on writing these reviews. It is completely inappropriate.
