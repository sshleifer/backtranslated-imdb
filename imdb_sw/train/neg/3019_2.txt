how can you take a tough-living, the story of the shadow of great liberty and * that * emphasized? It's amazing. Besides, the visual model of the instruction is depression and demolition, the plot is copper, uncomfortable, confused by the movie-rehash and acting is not recommended. This film introduces new characters all the way in the film and is asked in a split flashback - especially out of the sequence - it just looks to keep you good and confused. The film shows you everything that is uncertain and later it says "this did not happen, this happened" - see the apparent murder of the "first women". What have we seen the first, bad events, a series of times? The bright choice in the preparation, a destructive, destructive plot and a leading headache. 1/5.
