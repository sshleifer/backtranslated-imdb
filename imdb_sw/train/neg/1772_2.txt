"Sleepwalkers" is the first film that Stephen King has written script for. From this, with the best Santo & Johnny song that they used as the title of the film, you would be expecting an unfamiliar experience, and ultimately fulfilling experience. Unfortunately, you will not get it. The thing is, maybe they could be a good film. Beginning is exciting with a small sub-village spoon. But the amazing thing happens 20 minutes on the film. Film turns funny because no clear! From then on the entire situation of "Sleepwalkers" has been destroyed. For those who have seen it, who can forget the good old Johnny shouting "COP KABOB !!" after hitting a pencil into one man's ear? But don't get involved, humor has no quality of renewal. I hired again to see if I was wrong for the first time around, due to how the original plot happened, but I was right. Man, what is it. I can't believe that they have the rights of the Santo & Johnny song. I gave this 2.
