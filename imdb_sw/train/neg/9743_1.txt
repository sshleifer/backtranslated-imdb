By this line begins a silly film, boring the UK. Vorelli Great from the movie "Devil Doll" builds a teleportation machine just to have its money cut by Blanchard, a beard man who has something for bow ties with men and a great brows of eyes. When his attempt fails, a good doctor learns that Lembach, a man who controls all the aid in the world, will stay in London for a few days. She is trying to pretend to herself in Blanchard's home with the help of her good laboratory assistant, Sheila. Without saying something that is wrong and sends it as a mouse. Some of the movies are offered to a good orange doctor walking around with London's frightening people and his hand mutated and wearing a diaper on his face. There are some killings, some of the most common paperwork, and finally, the doctor disappears where the mouse is faced with doctors going. Thanks no one has decided to do good.
