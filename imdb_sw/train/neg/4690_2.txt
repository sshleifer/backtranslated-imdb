This British film is very bad, and it is difficult to believe that Glenn Ford is in it, though he sleeps very much that way. The idea of ​​a bomb on the train looks good ... but it turns on this ending train is stopped for most movies! No action, no movement, just train static. The area where the train has been reinforced is provided, so there is no risk for anyone either. In fact, this film can be used in the film class to show how it is not to make the film caused. The real solution is produced by allowing the audience to know what the characters do not know, in fact the truth is unknown to the director. SPOILER: The train actually has two bombs on it, but we are led to believe there is only one. After the first bomb is prohibited, it feels like there is no reason to watch the film again. But in the last minute, the woman, who has no motivation for her actions, shows there are two things. And we are not sure when bombs will leave, so we can't even have a "pipe" tension. 10 or more minutes are used to look at the French wife of Glenn thinking about leaving him, and then he wondered where. He is a desperate attitude that we don't care if he joins him, so when he does, there is nothing emotional about him. Most of the other characters have no personality, and no problems or issues. It's only 72 minutes, but it feels a long time because it is so beautiful and lighter. Don't waste your time.
