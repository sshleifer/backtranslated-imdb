No one tries to change Rob Robins' book for screens. Although the film is good and the performances are good, the conversation, which makes good reading, explodes when it is spoken. Or, to put it another way, no one would suggest that hearing someone else's name is like seeing it on the radium on the pearl. Overall, the cinema hears as a bad falls The book notes - many parts have been beaten up to less than five of their size in the book, with the backstory shape and the current story, and the end is wildly (and unpleasantly) different from that of the book. Many of the plots from the book are lost, including one that makes everything meaningful at the end, and there is more than one reference which means in the book that makes the viewer say "Huh?" Not an appropriate effort, unfortunately - the script should be counted, compared to the book, burned, and all actors were sent to do something better. I am praising Gus Van Sant for a great deal, but even a man of his caliber could make a good film of the book without doing the service.
