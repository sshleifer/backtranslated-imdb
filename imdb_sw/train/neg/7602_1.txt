One of the other speakers explained that almost they came out. If I didn't have my wife, who wanted to stay, I'd like to leave. It's a shame, too, because I think it would be a good movie. But this is the easiest one of the most screens I have ever seen. It starts anywhere and goes anywhere (I would say it goes quickly anywhere, but it really goes slowly ... gently). There are often tips that something interesting can happen, or that it is likely to be deep under one of the characters, but that's all we get - tips. No single money or revelation in the entire film. It's not that I need a good plot of fun ... I would like a good practice of behavior like a second indie bue. But these characters add something. For the entire period of the film does not matter what happens to one of them. In fact, you almost start to hope to die, because at least death can be more interesting than looking at their inexperienced behavior, which is very strange and unpredictable that you would like to think of itself would be compelling, but not. Instead of quirky characters, black-esquire actors in a fashionable fashion, you immediately recognize why it is: a group of talented consultants but emerging, dancing and raising their faces when reading a strange conversation without the feeling of context. All this for two plodding, hours of sharp decline. Anger.
