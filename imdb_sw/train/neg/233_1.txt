This film is an attempt to calculate the money in the success of sex in the city and four weddings and funerals. In fact, if they had sex in a funeral, they could do better at the box office. But the film is between two seats and cannot get up. The publisher of the characters should not have a strong conversation, but never be done in any way to recognize him as a human being. One mistake, a trivial action follows another to develop what goes through a plot, and one quick cash for the entire business damage. Andie MacDowell gets points for doing his little work, but the features of doing it are stolen by Imelda Staunton, as of all things, police investigations (do not have the highest demand there)? Mrs. Staunton seems unable to make a false argument. We could say the same about the author's author. If Notting Hill heard you as it was caused, get away from this. Phonus bolognus on half-shell.
