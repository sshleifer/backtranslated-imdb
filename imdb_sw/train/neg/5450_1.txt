Attempt to ignore. Diabolical lesson and dialogue with acting in real shame. Really the worst movies I saw (on the movie). Nothing in my opinion saves this film to be a general catastrophe. I saw it coming from the movie in Brighton. People were going out and there were many people talking out to the toilets than in the bedroom! Finally there was a boos and contempt from the great crowd, which was very sad as the brother of one of the chief actors were present and looked at the sheep. However the movie was so bad that I can't feel like being sympathetic to them. Everyone starts to start from somewhere with their child to begin his work of work with this real test in the 'Tarantinism' in England. 5 years have gone, but sometimes I am still on the night of sad memories on the movie! This is no free film! I paid 1 if 0 is not available. They should create 'embarrassment' for everyone involved with this short movie. I know some of them have moved to good things, the good thing is that none of them could leave any more than this.
