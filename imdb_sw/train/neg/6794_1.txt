Friday 13th high! There is a worse movie than your hateful series out there. I won this film in university competition, and it was a waste of money even though it was free. Jack Jones star as a very bad singer who tries to find killers or something. At least fifteen Friday never hit me. I would like to have fingers pulled off than to see again.
