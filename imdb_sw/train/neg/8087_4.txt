The movie does not have credence with a helicopter that does not exist until 1950s. But no woman could do what was done here, even a woman before the age of 60 and 70 women. About the only part of the film that you can believe was that Germany would want to know where the landing would be. Beware of the time when the British had taken all the spies but even if they did not, they could not allow anyone to come around like this to assure the Germans that landing would be located in Calais. It's not one big thing that makes the movie work. It is the end of all the evil things that makes the movie fail. Redirecting bad, bad scripts, no attempt to validity (all the time) all combine to just make the movie take off. Common explorers should spread on the wood. Standing comes in and checking whether they are legitimate or not worried about being detected. On this one the game had ended since the beginning. This Spy was doing nothing except spying. Your only way to find something that is trustworthy and causes some charges can be read.
