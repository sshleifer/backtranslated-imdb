Bill Boyd's pastor, Robert Armstrong, and James Gleason are playing Coney Island carnys for the hand of Ginger Rogers, a gal worker who sells taffy salt water. With the outbreak of World War I, those three are trying to implement the ginger from far away. The first half of the production of RKO Pathe is difficult to go, and three men lead to chewing the environment and the most "snappy" dialogue that increases rapidly. The second half focuses on the monitoring of action as the US Navy tracks the cruiser of the German businessman and the U. boat. For fans of just stars.
