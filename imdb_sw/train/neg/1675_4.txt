In fact the plot seemed to be interesting. What? The brutal murder of real life can turn into a very interesting movie? Yes, you can watch "Wonderland" and find out. I had heard of the murder of the Wonderland before this film was released and found to be a true story of real people of compassion. Unfortunately, there is a development of zero behavior, so we can never get a chance to understand why any of this was done or get a good feeling of relationships between the characters. The horizontal dimension was very stimulating. This all leads to an incredible movie. Since Dawn Schiller - a central character as a partner of Holmes - was a producer of partners and that Holmes's wife was a consultant on the film, we should have a chance to get a real understanding in the characters.
