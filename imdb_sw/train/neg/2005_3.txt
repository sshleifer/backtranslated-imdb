It's not that I was surprisedâ€¦ the movies are not the same as the books that have come. I expected to see this film because this is one of your books, though I knew it would be exploiting. I was hoping to be very surprised. However, they came out of the story of the book, and the film did not show how this house was so bad. The end was also different. Lara Flynn Boyle looked horrible due to the worst cosmetic surgery. The act was not quite enough. Probably if the exhibition version was made so that they do not put too much in the life of "made for the movie board", it will be the best flick. If you have seen this film I strongly encourage you to follow this book and read it. I am sure you will be disappointed and expect to enjoy as much as I ever read.
