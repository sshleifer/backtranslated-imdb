I watched this film yesterday and I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <3 /> <br/> Heather Graham and Tom Cavanaugh were supposed to carry this unusual script for five hours (or even so long was true). From the beginning, every single element of this film is not possible. This film has done me several times, but it was not shocked that the director / journalist actually expected us to believe many of the scattered things that tried to beat this film together. <br /> <br /> The film view is Gray (Graham) and its issues for friendship. Things are interesting when she knows she and her brother have worked very hard. <br /> <br /> Interesting, exciting. However, instead of opening this story to be a reliable and interesting thing, the director continues to take Gray into their loss for a concern that is never quite good. Being a LGBT person, this film seemed to have issues of how all gender people think we are doing in the coming process. (I will be embarrassed as a writer of the author.) If it was not for good chemistry between Cavanaugh and Graham (which, by the way, understandable compulsion), I would like to give 3 stars a negative.
