Okay. So there is no truth that many movies around. Recent gems like American Fantasy, Similar Stories and even Toy Story 2 are not usually coming very close. But the boy (!) It does not have this comparison-balanced film. I have no idea of ​​these people thought they were doing. Do donors in this world easily believe to finance crock as ****? I can only see now ... <br /> <br /> Producer - "So we have Joe Fiennes.As cute as a button and was good at Shakespeare in Love. And we have Rhys Ifans, who isn't good but was cool in Notting Hill." We will combine in a real mediocre mark, a few few after Britpop forget, the roots of hemlock and the mind of the fool and hey presto has the worst film of the new millennium. The bank - "I love! Is it any unwanted sex? About the worst obstacle on this side of the devil's own?" Producer - "Yes, we have a lot of those." Where do we sign? ”<br /> <br /> Please.
