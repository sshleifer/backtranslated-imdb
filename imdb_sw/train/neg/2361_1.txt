This movie is the most simple of the series. Although New Line may be just looking at sales, all know why this alone made more money than one before it was due to its 3D end. It was not that the 3-D was good either, because it was 3D 3D with red and blue lenses (draglyph.) It was just the fact that people wanted to see what it looked like. Further that this film was made well! Wrong script, bad characters, acting bad, leading more. This film tries to push the cause of the camp around the point of being "Looney Tunes" episode. It's hard, not for the audience of fear, because it is corny and not threatening, not funny or exciting for comedy groups. Just a full mess with some of the worst goals that still tries to play something around like a camp and have a way to fall for what they probably wanted. I remember most of us who were fans of this series were just praying that you would live at this stage because of the evil you had. This is one of the movies that helped you take the fear out of popularity and fad climbing the belief that the audience wanted to laugh with some stupid comedy than to see a good film and scary horror.
