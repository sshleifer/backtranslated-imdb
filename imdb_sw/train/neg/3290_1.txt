This movie has been deleted! They took something from my childhood, and put it in the outside room! This movie was so bad I wanted to go home and hold my dvd "Dukes" and right corner. The cast was bad! It was not "Children", it was Stiffler and Jackass driving. When the Lord was Hogg evil? When was Rosco difficult? They never did! Lord Hogg was desperate and Rosco was stupid. When did Jesse smoke smoke? Not done! Now don't feel, I am very free and nothing wrong with a little chiba, but he had no chance in this film! The only thing about this movie is the trailers before the movie and the last credit. It was a waste of money and air. Avoid at all costs !!!!!!!!
