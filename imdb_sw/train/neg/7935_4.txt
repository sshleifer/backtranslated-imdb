I blind I bought this film and I am so happy that I paid as I did but I would say that it is at least worth the tax for other cold deaths and make statements. It's not a good movie in any way but I must say that I was very happy. I think it can be called bad-it well. As I said, acting is bad, I feel like I could do a good job, at least, any feeling. Stories are nothing new and well done. I think I just have a soft spot for any enjoy-track film. I would like to say this lease or download it but certainly don't ask it. Not better than one look.
