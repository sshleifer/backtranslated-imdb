There's really not much to say about Las Vegas Lady. It doesn't have enough effect, but it's a little more than a red film of heist from 70 years. The movie is not as clever nor sexy as it tries to be. The program is a retaad of the old fatigue of the hostage of the casino that has been done to die. Except for Las Vegas Lady's case, I think the plot of theft was created by the age of 3. This program involves three women? one in detail and with a clear view puts out the building of the Circus Cicus, one set as a waitress just to cover his cover first place, and one stand around his cleaning. That's very good. Good, huh? Other than Stella Stevens and her previous breasts, some women involved in the plot do not remember exactly. Las Vegas Lady star star Stuart Whitman. When you are not over Stevens, its involvement in the movie is emphasized by one of the idiotic gun rifles that have filmed the film. I liked to love this film. It means that 70s feel that I am always enjoying the fun of Las Vegas in 1975. But the movie itself is very bad for a maximum of 4/10? and that may twist. At the end, Las Vegas Lady is losing some cleavage quite good.
