World Good is not a good film in any way, it's a common way. Perhaps it was different in the 1930s but who would like to see the farmer's life. Not very interesting to me. Yes, Luis Rainer and Paul Muni are doing a very good job but the film was very long. I could tell you at the end of this film for the first act. For a short time Wang Lung (Muni) a small farmer who does not want to be like his own father turns out exactly like him. They all fall in love with their wives as they have on their death beds. The film has full full 360 from one generation to the next. Also, this film did not have a good character or a short time, it was just a matter of what it was like to grow as a farmer during the crisis.
