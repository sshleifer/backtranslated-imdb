SciFi has been very unfortunate to make the best film recently (such as Minotaur or Dog Guard). Grendel should be the base of Beowulf's great epic, however, it varies greatly (and offers very little comparison) that the television broadcasts can also have the name of "thin film Christopher Lambert". I did not expect to be as accurate as the full-scale Hollywood production, but I expected to however 'artistic integrity' not fit into the real story (even if it was slightly altered to open well at two-storyboard in the allotted time). Does the director and producers have any idea about what they did (any research that came into this?). Certainly not, if a man can say from the big star caps that Beowulf and his crew (except for a mullet boy) are dressed. One of the biggest problems I had though it was very looking for Grendel? If Beowulf should fight him, should not be sixteen feet tall and weigh 2 tons? The part of Grendel's death also did not exist any way? In my opinion one in epic was really better than a junk made on the script; for example: Grendel should have his arm tired from the socket and Beowulf ?? not cut into the shade after a burning fire to the burst of an arrow from a visible cross as it weighs 300lbs! And Grendel's mother? What? They only confused him with the dragon at the end of the epic where he eventually dies when he has finished his injuries? And honestly, what hell had that mullet? <br /> <br /> If you want to see this film because its connection to epic? .. not, if there is a truth (not names of character). The only way I could suggest this movie is like you loved the movie Druids (directed by Jacques Dorfmann) ?? although I don't recommend checking either.
