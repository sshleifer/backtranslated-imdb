wow! I watched the trailer for this and though 'nah, this is not for me'. I watched my husband and friend's friends during the trailer, and he knew this was a 'movie boy'. I mean, hallo! The group of barmaids of pigs that dance - another striptease? then, I began to look at it, not looking at all the bad. so I kept watching. I watched it right to the end. it's an amazing movie. if anything, this is a flick-flick. These girls have a view. it's really a movie-feel-good, and a bit of love story. really leaves you with a good feeling .. basically, the story of the little girl of the city makes it so big in the city, after experiencing ordinary capital c ** p. there have been a couple of these, it's almost new urban news. but it also makes you think about your life, and what you have achieved. well, I however. I think it is because all who work in bar conditions are very experienced, not just for me, but for many people I know. Do not believe tractors for this - aims to bring people into.
