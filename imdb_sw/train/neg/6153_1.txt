Then I would like to start by saying that I saw this film as part of the business. I was very tired one day in 1997 and so I walked to a movie shop. I asked the clerk what the worst films he had in the stock was. Without hesitation he took me on "Lucky Stiff." He told me that he could pay $ 1 of the rental fee (he said it was worth paying more) if I promised to watch all the movies. So look what I did, for free ... <br /> <br /> This movie is awesome. God-Evil even. I don't need to go to the compound details, read another review. Nonsense worthless. Acting was bad. I know it had to be a comedy, but the ignorance of the main character was enough. You can try to look at it as something to laugh, but it's so bad that it's not worth it yet. Avoid!
