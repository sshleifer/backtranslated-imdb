I tell you this is one of the worst films I've ever seen. They had a good story to continue, but rather than they had destroyed it. First cast is exactly the same, where the van peeble (crap actor btw) and puff father come from ??? It looks like Carlito has come from a hood, and is used to talk to some of the real idiots. This film does not make "Carlitos Way" any rights. I am so glad that the follower of "Carlito's Way" came first, if I found this first trash, I would never give a chance to a space pacino. And yet, the pacino is supposed to read this story, it has decided to decorate and make a good replacement. Carlito's Way: Raising Strength - 1 out of 10. Carlito - 9 out of 10.
