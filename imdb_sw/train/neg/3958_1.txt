I can't waste too much of this because even though I'm concerned not really a movie start with, not worrying about the borrowed photos and badly made pictures just for the purpose of making the whole mess together and calling it a "Boogeyman" good. More than 80% of this film has been stolen from its foremost predecessor "The Boogeyman", a film that the authors of this garbage did not bother to look because they could not even find the name of the original style of Suzanna Love (Lacy) right. And in addition to the shock of hurting the murderer it is not seen in the original picture and it appears in the new picture, it seems they think their listeners are as stupid as they. 0 out of 10 and I would like the IMD rating system went down, the worst and clear attempts to stop the people's money I have seen, you have been warning!
