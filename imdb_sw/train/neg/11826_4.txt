There is something sad about seeing someone who is good to do something trying to do something very different ... and end up being mixed. I was thinking about Jordan playing football, but it also applies to Steve Martin. <br /> <br /> This movie is suited for efficiency and directed, but the script is stinker. Martin did a good job to fix a common story in the comedy in "Roxanne", but this attempt to bring Victor's game into a modern area is hit directly on the wall of the inability. If you want to see an old story updated by a particular style, the best to hire "Great Expectations".
