Please note that I have not seen a movie since I got it in 2007, and my city is small and not carrying. However, I want to say something about it. I am researching the university on the character of the title Richard Maurice Bucke and you would like to explain that their basic based character on the truth was quite different! Hollywood's views of people with artistic licenses released, Dr. The real Bucke strongly approves the healing process of women, and never did anything like the so-called film. I think it's a language to see critics of various films who write legitimate newspapers who say this film has a historical basis! The real truth I can see is friendship between Dr. Bucke and Walt Whitman. Please do not waste your time on the film and care for the fear that the real women get into the hands of a doctor who is now respected by the film industry.
