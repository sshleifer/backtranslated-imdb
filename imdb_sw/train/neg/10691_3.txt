I discussed it with myself if I lost this or not. I am always afraid to hire something that I have never heard (remember this being in the movie). Great big ... that's the scales. 30 minutes, I stopped watching it. The first few minutes are happy to enjoy, but it is impossible. It's just bad after that. The authors of this film can do little research on future projects if they want to make their movies even less. Or they can only try trying to write something just a little reliable. I give 3 .... 1 for writing (just because there are words) and 2 to be able to find many good actors to accept this film despite reading the script. Oh my god this movie takes.
