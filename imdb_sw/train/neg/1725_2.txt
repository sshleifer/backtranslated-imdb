- The movie opens and meteor falls into the lake. Not known to the people, the dinosaur egg is also under the lake. Meteor heals the lake, turning it into a great incubator. You realized, the egg draws a dinosaur that continues to be a threat to the community. <br /> <br /> - What is quite garbage. It's not that I am interested in the soil-motion soil dinosaur, it's everything else about the movie that bothers me. Acting is angry. These discussions are quite concerns. The comic support is nothing but comic. Logic does not exist. Any ratio between the "scientists" in this film and the real scientist is just the same. I would like to continue forever on the bad things of this film, but you get the idea. I feel safe to call this epidemic "MST3K Required".
