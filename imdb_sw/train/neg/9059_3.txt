I will only be clear on my opinion of impairment. There are clicks of cans in this movie that are basically destroyed. <br /> <br /> This movie gets a few ideas from the classic South, To Kill Mockingbird. I think maybe TKOM has got his ideas from some source… at any point, after looking at this, you will say, “Oh, that's a pleasure”. I think the really exciting thing about these McMovies once you realized the plot of the plot, is to know if they will cling to nature, or try to pervert it. Not much to lose in this.
