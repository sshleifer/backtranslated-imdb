What was it with all Turkish actors? No mistake but I thought it was free for all these administrators. Film did not have a script to test any participants to perform skills or abilities. It demanded almost nothing I bought this film to see Michael Madsen. He is one of my actors who love but this film was his failure to him. Script was very bad. They were not just something to sink your teeth and all the characters were two dimensional. Madsen tried to act like a hard ass but the script and direction did not allow him to do enough with his character to make it more interesting or third. Even the sound of the gunfight sound at the beginning of the film was seen as the sound of colored guns at the start of the skirmish. It was very real and didn't sound like a real gun. Video game had more sound effects than this film. There was a very bad bloke at the beginning of a film that was a member of a robbery. He had this sound of America shouting as a girl's ringing noise as "Lets get F # $ k out of here" and we'll do what man ". He seemed like a girl .. as positive It was a funny look and it made me too laugh .. for a few seconds. Dumb Films Mador poor.
