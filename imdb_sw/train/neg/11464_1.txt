While I do not claim to be a marine life expert, I must say anyone with an intellectual capacity cannot enter into this concept of whales (and even mother!). forced by men! I mean, really! This is a whole plot. Richard Harris must be very difficult for the responsibility to accept this junk. This is a kind of film that is very bad if you pay 50 cents to see it, you would feel like you want your money back.
