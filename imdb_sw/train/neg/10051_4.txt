I gave these 4 stars because it has a lot of interesting features here many have already been described. From domestic violence, to sex and many pockets in it. Outside of the year I certainly don't call this fear if I would have a science fiction. <br /> <br /> It's a mess, depression and hope. When I don't care under the finishing lesson, I am very tired of "young men" who are among every movie. I know you can't get a degree of autonomy of independence today without engaging in hate change as a member of the community, but how if the author / director makes us different than everyone else in the packet and see that PEOPLE OF PEOPLE WORK bad! Right now, if you read this and believe that human beings deserve to die, get out, get the lake and swim until your hands are tired. In this way you will not be nearly directing the next film or writing a second book telling me I deserve to die for living. It's silly, not thinking, and boring.
