I only saw this film, and I must say that it was a great waste of time. The girl who played Eve (Ellen Fjaestad) can not act. He read his odd verses, and had a face-to-face testimony through the entire movie. Rosanna Munter who played Petra on the other hand, is natural. He played his part with great perfection. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS! The story was simple - we have seen it many times, many times before. He breaks, gets another, gets jealous, breaks with another girl and goes back together at the end. There was no surprise, one knew that Eve would break, and Adam could "unite" with Petra. The only thing that nobody came to was was that Petra told Adam to go after Eve at the party. He was all great, which is on the side of Petra viewers have not seen earlier in the movie, and told him to win the heart of Eva, which was good. In addition to Rosanna Munter, there is no one actor who gives an unforgettable performance. <br /> <br /> This is a movie of concern with central artists, so I do not recommend!
