When I beat this film I was first attracted to a basic idea and a desire to see what would happen. I am a fan of animation and you love it when you are connected effectively with live photos. However, the animation of this film was about all I enjoyed. Although it must be understood that the performances of actors were better. View view - including animation - provided an unusual air for a piece. However this was the quality of lost lost among many more images, all the exhibitions and in the script, that was made by head over the head. Many anger over this was the lack of relative importance to the plot. It was seen that the plot was a casual shoe that would give the effect of a reduction which prevented massively from the flow of the piece. A high voice from Felisberto - especially one last - felt like a great attempt to fill the holes in the field that had been ignored on side issues such as something else (and even that was not addressed properly). I am afraid of the whole piece that has come as, for the best, 'first attempt', and a young man who has spent too much time reading DH Lawrence. It's not what you expect from all the time filters.
