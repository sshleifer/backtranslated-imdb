When this was released, I thought this was one of the most inappropriate films made. However, thanks to Martin Scorcese and a few other filmmakers like him, there has been a greater film, wisdom language, than this .... but this is a brutal attack of someone's ears. Hey, I can take a lot, but this was ridiculous. In the first six minutes alone, I heard the use of the Lord's name free of charge and the odd number of words f. I wonder how many people walked out of the reminder to watch this in 1990? I can't be alone. Not surprisingly, some feature actors included Jennifer Jason-Leigh, Burt Young, Jerry Orbach and Rikki Lake. Since this film, Stephen Lang seems to have improved his image, at least playing the "Stonewall" of Divine in "God and Members." Lang's role here is the opposite: maybe the worst person in the film and the character that likes the transvestite at the end of the film. Disappointment, fear, half of the pornography, sad: these are just a few of the criteria that people used - even Liberal critics - to describe this story, even more published in the novel. Of course, some of the most well-known critics, all extreme Libs, congratulated the movie. However, they were isolated. Many critics were angry, with almost all public pay. It is impossible for anyone to contemplate dirt and rubbish like this. I believe in this: no good, interesting characters in this film. This is meant, the film of patients: one of the "modern times" more. That is, unless you enjoy seeing child abuse, drug abuse, young prostitutes, and continuous - two hours of indecency with just people of evil. No thanks.
