The song continues to buy my head. It is not a great song, but it is 80 years old. This film is about a leading singer who "deserves" is killed when he is sentenced to murder as he strikes his girlfriend who sings safe sounds in his band. The lead singer whose name is Billy "Eye" (yes, right) has died after two years and his band returns to the concert just a moment's pregnancy is a singer at this time. Billy feeds her and finally kills all these people and scares the girl and making people around him thinks something wrong with him and that he thinks things. He finally decides to go to the cemetery and dig his grave to see if he is still there. He sees that he is dead but still sees and hears his voice. At the end of the movies we see the reason behind all of this, Billy has a brother named John (right again) and John admits that he was jealous of his brother and that he killed all the people to return to him and place blame on his brother and then take the girl her and shock her because she called him mad. The latter is very cheezy and acting is very lame and wood. But .... I would like that. I watch you for a song. I wish I had it.
