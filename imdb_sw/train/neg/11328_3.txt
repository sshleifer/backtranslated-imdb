Occasionally at the same time I will design a performance / adventure film just as a way to relax and focus on my thoughts without anything important. That's why I have a copy of Charlie's Angel (2000) - not a good film, but it makes me laugh and let me open for a while. One of these days I will be able to buy a copy of Bibi and Machy's movie of Monty Python for the same reason. In any case, I took this film because I wanted to be happy without having a challenge. For the most part, I've got what I wanted. The plan was one of the well-written Xena publications, and Kathy Long's acting was a very social community (not bad for a kick kicker striker and an amateur actress). There were a few points on the part of cyborgs. Somehow they were able to find other good actors to play badly - unfortunately, many of them died quickly. <br /> <br /> Like most of the military films, the more you go to the film, the more emphasis there is on the stage, and the plot (which had no power to start with) dropped almost as quickly as acting. However, more than Kathy Long's struggle, when the whole director dedicates his back. At the end of the film I was just considering the second time just counting how short a short red Kathy Long was the main screen. Unfortunately, there was not enough meat for this film to make satisfactory curiosity worth seeing the second film. If you are a hard base Xena fan needs something to overcome a few hours - in all ways, go to the food store and use 50 cents for rental. There are some similarities between the show and this movie. Just don't expect anything more than being used gently for a few hours. <br /> <br /> Except, of course, you happen as Kathy Long's derri√®re. Then you may want to buy a copy.
