The opening of the opening should show the Legion that comes to Paris on November 13, 1918. The soldiers flee the train - dressed in a uniform that the French Army, including Legion, went to war until 1914! This is a sure sign that the war-led war is about to see Turkey. The French army of 1915, which is fighting in red pants and blue-colored covers, was not working. The French capital of the capital was placed in the "blue scope" and colonial soldiers were placed in the khaki.) Claude Van-Damme (sp?) Remake at least got the most uniform or less right. The truth is very bad when directors are doing these mistakes when they go to all the efforts to find other things better.
