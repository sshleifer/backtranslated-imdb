As you gather from the head, I believe with the whole heart that this movie is the worst movie of the zombie at all. Acting, camera function, writing, special effects and anything else related to this movie laughs. People said that when this movie is done very well and it is very productive but it comes through an intelligent script. Wow. The plan has more holes than I or anyone else can count. For predecessors, why will the government tell everyone to return to work when not safe? I know the government deserves to be bad but does not get anything to kill all the people of the country. There will be no one who can rule! Another thing I wondered about, even though the government told everyone to go to work, why would people go if the roads were full of zombies? What? The zombies hid in the forests and chased the uncomfortable people to help the government in their plan to kill everyone on earth? And how about the end? This stupid fool gives his life to find a few around the shots of zombies. He probably forgot that every camera made in 35 years has a zoom feature. And another thing, why says Hindenburg before he dies. Hindenburg was a common occurrence of very few people. The risk of zombie will appear with everyone in the country, perhaps the world. Don't think someone else will get a small picture? They were also able to destroy the semi-spectacular scene in the film when the soldier looks at the foreign dancer. Why did the zombie hide behind the curtain for five minutes before attacking the girl? Especially when the zombie could come through the DOOR. It's probably just a fan of a movie of a zombie that is not as sensible as I do. Every day I pray that God will increase my ability to brain long enough to recognize me all the nuances of the trick in feeding Masses. Anyway, I think it's amazing that this is the first movie that gave me the desire to hurt physical people involved in production. Hey Trent Haaga, I'm calling out!
