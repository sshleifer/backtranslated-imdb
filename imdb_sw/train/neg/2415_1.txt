... you know others. If you want a good zombie movie, don't give this film. If you want to write a document look at the "hood life" you're in the wrong place too. If you are looking for a piece of film, this is a true winner! Acting is like a flat like a piece of paper. An excellent example of this is definitely an officer examining the car-by. I can say that he made a voice to the 911 user as well as the sound of his voice. If I could hear the discussion of the card box, it would look like this sound. Oh, and the "zombies" did their best sense of snakes which are similar to their general FANTASTIC general (remember to sad ... HOW IN IN THE WORK IN THE WORK IN EVERY TUTORIAL IN THE TIME) Quiroz ...... made do not do any kind of leading. I felt like I was looking at a piece of preference (the same period as the 1990s). The same trend is even one organized by the worst script I think ever have the favor of the film. I have never heard such beautiful lines, like the epic one that started the movie "F ** k!", Since the Ice Grill was another "urban". These are only true work in conjunction with the sound of hip-hop epic! All three songs or so! All in all, do you? What were you expecting from the film "Hood of the Living Dead"? I lost this film with the full intention of laughing every scene, and the boy offers and more! I would like to suggest this to anyone who wants to unite with a group of boys and laugh at the lowest budget fears (yes ...) for the night. Experience a memorable experience for sure!
