Cuba Gooding Jr. is a secret service agent who judges himself on the murder of the US President, I will say directly that this is not the kind of role that this talented actress is known, and this film shows us what. He collaborates with an ongoing journalist (Angie Harmon) to identify the plot around the death of the president, and so on, blah, blah, blah. Even with the cast of James Woods, Cuba Gooding Jr, Anne Archer and Angie Harmon 'End Game' fail to remember, clear and simple; some work is good, acting not all bad and story though clich√©d and done before it can lead to a fun and enjoyable movie - WELL IT NOT! Writing to the script and direction ensures that, at any time does not lead you to a story or give you a little ideas for any characters. It is Boring, Possible and Unable.
