This was an example of the agony of showing cheap, boring and unusual prices offered by Australian TV channels to fulfill local content certificates. The writing was very scary and I am not surprised that the authors are those who are involved in the worst films of Australia in recent Wally Norman records. Nothing about this series of TV was funny - ever - even amusing to gently. It was only tired with BAD and, above all, it was really thought it was funny. It was just a shy look. <br /> <br /> There is something so popular about this show given 10 out of 10 on IMD. Try to find (real) review and (real) Australian viewer of show (did not have many) and impossible. Or mad. There are loaves of bread which are funnier than this show. Avoid exposure at all costs and if you come out of a DVD, remember that the laughter that is worthy was not optional.
