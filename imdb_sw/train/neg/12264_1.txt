You get 5 authors together, each one to write a different story with different types, then try to make one film out there. It's a step, it's an adventure, it's sci-fi, it's west, it's a mess. Sorry, but this film is getting worse. 4.5 offers the highest score. That said, it's a movie like this that makes me think I can write movies, and I can't write.
