I saw this movie immediately, and I thought it was right. Then my friends at work said "Look again, it's better". So I did. And to my surprise, it was WORSE for the second time! There is a word limit, so I'll be able to get a ball around it. The bombs were stupid. Why would anyone on earth make an explosion? -And of the characters here even looks away. Not for the first time, nor even the second. It is, and the last time I look, the car does not get out of the gun, and the fire cannot be removed by a small fire ... is the 3/10 top viewers watching the film? -For the camera is shaky, I can't describe what is going on. The opening of the robot was with my stomach, off the film was no better. Sniper. The brothers of McManus (from "Boondock Saints") would have reduced their eyes, it was stupid. First, why did the man climb a gun where one man had shot? Additionally, why would he use the time to clean the shot, reload, and wait, not be shot, when there was so much confusion around it? -SAS type RUNNING instead of staying and fighting back ?????? Huh ????? What? Soldiers ... gay ... ??? I did not mean the voice of the proud people, but honestly, the area was very stupid. It is too long, but it's too short for a large amount of material inserted into it. Bigelow seems to think that more action, it's better. It seems like he is right - the movie is full of incredible acts of healing there to prevent you from the lack of a great plot. I know observers are long for 163 minutes, but at least this movie did not pull. This film, on the other hand, has, and therefore, it feels again. The only thing that was Renner, who was more useful. But make a confession, let us leave this, and do not give in to feelings.
