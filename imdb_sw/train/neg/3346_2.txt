Cheezy action movie star Dolph Lungren. Lungren is one of the military men when one has got a teaching job. But the changes in the neighborhood and the student's body have cheered him and decides that he will come. Items get rats when they look at a group of students locked up by some of the invaders taking school as a basis for the operation of a car robbery. Her Dolph against baddies in war against death. Leaving the jaw gives us the films of the late hair hair where bad people are dressed like punks and some bad women had hair of daylight. What's a stupid movie. The fact that I can believe that people have done this kind of way, this is a film of action that is likely to be punished for getting prior to the low budget, counterfeiting sets and bad leadership of the actions were seen in the eye of the producers. Look at the late films of late films (without asking) they fall into the turret security (don't ask because it looks more like a prison then secondary school) and cut out its non-constructed form (it doesn't seem like it did in the original shots). What? What has happened to the evil movies? In fact I mixed since this was directed (?) And Sydney J Furie, a very good director who made the film as The Boys in the Company C. Has his ability failed, or did not hope to go and did not even worry? It is Turkey. Can see but turkey no less.
