If you liked to watch Mel Gibson at the Million Dollar Hotel then you can enjoy watching Burt Reynolds in another very bad non-distributed film. I can only verify the version of the DVD so maybe the VHS version is better than wisdom but nighttime movies and dark events have been done so well that everything seems to be red. I first thought that my DVD players were lost. It was not. If you insist on watching I recommend adjusting colors on your TV until black and white. If you can never get through the film. If you do this you just remind the poor students of the film trying to develop a Fiction Pulp style.
