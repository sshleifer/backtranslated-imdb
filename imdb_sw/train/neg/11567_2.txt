I decided to look at this post after seeing the last broadcast on the BBC before the week. I watched it despite the fact that I do not like the kind of items that Alan Hollinghurst writes (sorry for his fans but I think we have the case of new king clothes and the work of this author). I agree that acting is best, being shot well and I was happy for that reason - however - I found that the story of the story was too thin and after looking at all three pieces you feel very much with this empty production. Sexual 'gay' sex in which the media on all things has been done before the TV - several times - so it is not surprising that I am afraid. A perfect score for the production standards but less for stories / content I fear.
