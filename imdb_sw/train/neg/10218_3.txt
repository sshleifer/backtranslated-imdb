** The robbers included ** <br /> <br /> I would like to hear from various sources that this film was controversial and that the end was really scary. What I did not expect is a complete change related to twenty minutes to go. What begins as a western cowboy / indian casual naturally comes from a romantic red comedy 'about Honus (Blue soldier's title played by Peter Strauss) and Cresta (Candice Bergen) who are fleeing the attack on horsemen and Cheyenne. Most of the films are very focused on these two non-mixed people, so it's romantic sex. Donald Pleasance then returns and tramples them all for no apparent reason. They then fled and both were converted to the marine base at the base of the Cheyenne base. As Cresta was married and one of the leaders of Cheyenne survives on the basis of horses and joins them. So far it is normal. Then comes the end. After well tolerating an hour of bad acting involving cliched them / they will not share the storyline, the movie will then change in on the top exploitation involves among other things to decrease and the baby beats behind the head. What can be done with the Wild Bunch at this stage of the film but the Wild Bunch went on the same tone and did not have a very restless freeous break. In other ways, the blue soldier reminds me of the last Summer of Frank Perry which has also been completely changed to end the shock. I did not hate the Blue soldier do not get the end ends but just found it very nice and endless unnecessary. If you want to see a film that is actually slaughtered for the innocent, I would like to recommend Elem Klimov to come and see.
