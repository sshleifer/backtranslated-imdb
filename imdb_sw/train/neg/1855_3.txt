This is the most interesting film I have ever seen but for all rights are watchable and rather funny. I don't think the movie monitors wanted to be your normal quality blockbuster of Hollywood. It is just a stupid film about a serial killer who gets doused in the toxicity of the toxic cause causing a reaction to him and snow (if it is in the middle of winter). Then it becomes a snow player who is enough to stimulate you. This movie is stupid but it's amazing. I can't advise you to go and buy (like I did - the lid was good!) But if it happens to be on TV one night and you retire then mother.
