It's not one of the best displays of pokemon. <br /> <br /> Two of the legends of the story comes to the story. You see how Celebi can be strong, though he turns wrong first. <br /> <br /> Suicune also makes the appearance, not found to be powerful. <br /> <br /> Destroyer didn't I have so many pokemon all the time, except for that? Some events to fight with its pokemon can be better. <br /> <br /> Ash and Pikachu meets with little Oak Professor, although they don't know. Misty I was thinking he had an end but he didn't have a close. I saw this in credit features. <br /> <br /> Don't expect too much here, the worst series so far.
