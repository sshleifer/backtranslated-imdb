I have seen many original Sci-Fi movies since I started looking at them again in 2002 (my first was Sabretooth - which is one of the Sci-Fi Channel entertainment features in my opinion). Their quality is different. Some of them are moderate but respectable (Sabretooth, Dragon Fighter, Never Cry Werewolf, Swamp Devil), some are very bad, and there are some that are really awesome. Raptor Planet is located in the end. The Raptor Planet, a series of 2004 Sci-Fi Channel's original free Raptor Island, is an incredible scenario of the film with an effective and crafty film. The harm that brings dinosaurs to life (a combination of puppetry and animatronics with CGI and stock photographs from Raptor Planet) are some of the worst effects I have seen in a small budget film. The effects of the infection are not even accepted. The plan involves a group of commandos who for some reason (I forget why) to travel on the planet of alien dinosaurs. That's true people, dinosaurs are aliens. Dinosaurs in the outer space. What's next, sharks in space ?! Some of the plot is simple. The human being is taken and eaten. At the moment, we have been expecting this in many films of dinosaurs and novels provided, but this is the first movie to kill dinosaur I have seen where I really was bored with all the dinosaur attacks. <br /> <br /> There are a few bottles in it though. There is one area that emerges that a person is beaten by Carnotaur (developed from the film's preview) that seconds later become a huge raptor. Also, a bit of trivia, this is the area where Steven Baur is shooting at his death scene from the first movie. <br /> <br /> When Raptor Island was not a good film to start with, its masterpiece compared to its position. I don't believe it when I say, this is probably the worst movie Syfy has ever talked about. Available nearby and unknown.
