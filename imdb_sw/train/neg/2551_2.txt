Corrupted by a false lie on the lid, "happy as the American Pie", my partner and I sat in front of the TV waiting comedy ... and this is definitely not one. You may not laugh at one time if you're not one of those Jackass-like ever-teeny mind. It's not even a modern movie, which would at least be something, given that it's about sex ... So, what is this? An improper plot is about a man who wants to lose sex (zero in nature, I remember "losing" one by his group of friends. Other characters (ie girls) just come and go for no reliable reason. Come, there are even new (very simple: "dwarves are fun to ho" ...) Acting is a TV-like (like video shown in the movie) and definitely amateur in the case of many girls ... movie / movie. Amateur, produced poorly, and above all NOT FUNNY. Children and young people would like to watch it with friends because of swearing and sex. Other than that, don't even think to rent this movie.
