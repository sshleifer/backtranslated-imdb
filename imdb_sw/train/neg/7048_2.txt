I chose this film for a cover that was a bad argument. It was not funny at all and the main characters were obnoxious. The girl was beautiful but the story and acting was bad. It didn't have anything to do and delete. Movie films with "theme" of surf that did not have any connection with surfers and no real characters. Catherine Zeta Jones was good and the movie could see the resurrection just because she is in the current course, married to Gordon Gekko and all, but if you don't see it doesn't waste your time. Bad movies and great workmanship, true traders and AMAZING, a wonderful text of film was within the MAN OF GOD.
