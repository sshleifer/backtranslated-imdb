I saw Brigadoon on TV last night (12 September 2009). I am 61 years old and I have been watching the film for a long time I can remember. I can truly say that Brigadoon stands alone as far and away from the worst films I saw. These words were shameful. The local children's club would have produced the best set. The characters were so timber that they probably had a dry smell from the tears of the unfortunate attendants. We must hope that the stars of this film will hide enough to protect you from the shame that they should have experienced and see this film. The owners of this tripe should make great service to the people and destroy all copies of this film.
