This movie was incredible. There were small parts of funny. It goes into my cinematic memory where I think, "Hmm ..... The film had a little funny part, but generally, a good plot of ignorance (or lack of)." / I thought it looked like Ben was trying very little to be a cook boy. And I had no idea how he had made the whole million and still an idiot. Anyways, I would like Ben Affleck. He makes a trick, but hey, I can forgive him. I mean, I loved a girl Jersey, I didn't think Gigli was all his fault, I would like to general. I think he pretends like a child you feel for cuz he can't seem to get right. <br /> <br /> My advice would be to avoid this flick. It was not quite developed in a powerful plot with Catherine O'hara and Jimmy G. was not used as they could be. They deserved the best. In general, this movie is not home alone, not a Christmas story, its Christmas holiday or any kind of unusual. Ever forget.
