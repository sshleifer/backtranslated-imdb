I just saw this film and I have not read the book. The good news of the movie is that in some places it makes you think a little about the spiritual subject, evolution, destruction and your part of the world. However, the immersion of the film can easily break and there is very little connection between the viewer and characters. It is very clear that the book reduces much in this version of the film. The events that seemed to show the unusual situation are happening are almost recognized. Many ideas should be done by the observer to see that the area is unfortunate, and even more to think that it has something to do with a greater purpose. The brightness of the brightness seems poor and is not the best feeling that should be. Do you remember the seasons and Keanu Reeves (in Little Buddha)? This, this is not the same. Many events are not being done. There are many incidents that are not suitable for stories and also have not helped create the atmosphere. The best actors in this film, Hector Elizondo, Joaquim de Almeida and Jürgen Prochnow cannot save. The first 2 seem to have found more scenes than their characters should try the film attempt, and because they were paid more, but this does not work. Many exhibitions are not very important and do not serve the story even. <br /> <br /> Jürgen does well in its events and sells it as a bad person (such as), but the script doesn't help at all. The area where he tries to convince John (Matthew Settle) to join him is just a bad script. Implementation of the area when it dies in an explosion is the opposite of failure. Locate in the movie still can't even comment. Overall this film is a great waist of time, read the book! I haven't read, but maybe it's a billion times better than this, it should be. It is too bad to write my first comment on IMD.
