<br /> <br /> I am a great fan of time-time-sci-fi regardless of the budget, but after watching many awesome movies at night on the cable and video, this should be the worst movies. With special effects of blood (seen as a roast wrapped in an artificial blood or a continuous ketchup shown) and people are running around shouting from the left, then right, then back again. It should be aligned with the location of the earliest convenient store and stopped there and be 15 minutes. It is very, the lowest budget of x5. Many exhibitions were a way, very long. The painter gave a very loud voice as someone lost from the top spoke. This is the only movie to measure down in my opinion than Manos, Red Zone Cuba, Benji, and Godzilla vs. megalon despite their high budget. 10 eliminates, try to stay awake through the entire film in one or better mode, avoid if you were suffering from the brain.
