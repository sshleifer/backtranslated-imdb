This display is not possible for that. . . what it represents and is concerned with. . . The words can not describe how gentle it is. They will say nothing. If the celebrity is even far too far connected with the story and will tell about it. If a dog blows in Tom Cruise's yard they will report on it. If a celebrity dies. . . they will talk about it for a week to the end to a place where public jealousy becomes a celebrity. If a celebrity is being tested. . . ET will report for last MONTHS. There is no end to what this show will report and there is no time elaborate on how long they will consider the story. Is it even considered that legitimate reporting? The report is very bad and also, with strong voices to run and end the unfortunate pause to give important meaning. I can't watch this show without questioning human existence. AND it's one big reason I avoid before evening shows in general. I regret that the IMDb may allow a minimum of one star and not zero or even in the wrong. For this show deserves -10 Stars.
