When I was a child, I remember watching this when visiting a friend of "Uncle" Phil. We're back! Dinosaur's story is a silly cartoon of dinosaur called Rex (shown by John Goodman's wonderful). He tells the young dinosaur little story about how dinosaurs returned to earth to live. He explains that he was part of something that brought them, along with other friends. Doctor / Professor of this film I think they might be responsible for that being behind them, but I don't care about it. Children can love this, but self is also cheesy. John Goodman was probably just a decent thing. Poor!
