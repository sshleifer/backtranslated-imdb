The movie seems to be based on the original Italian movie based on credit but it was no longer written by two famous American American comedy writers. But this one with Charles Shyer & Nancy Meyers does not reduce it compared to their other efforts. The story is about Americans migrating down and out, played with Richard Lewis and Sean Young, who are caught on a lost dog and hoping to get money for money after seeing an advertisement on a return page for dachsund. When they tried to return, they saw the hand closed out of the garage door in a woman's house who believed she was bound to a woman's body that should give them money. They come out and instead to contact the police and tell them the truth they do as they flee from the area they expect to be written for murder. The other characters in the film meet on the train before this and depend on the Car Carlo car to run various items on the story. Other members sent include character characters John Candy, James Belushi, Pastor of Cybill, George Hamilton and others. After the police know about death, they start questioning the main characters and, of course, should work for their lies to find out what happened. No characters mentioned earlier could bring this film from a political situation including some of the most exciting moments of the Belushi / Pastor's couple. This is not a bad movie, not just good. There are many average movies out there and this is just one bunch. Try it, maybe you'd like it, maybe you can't.
