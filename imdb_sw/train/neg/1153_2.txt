Discouragement and offensive. The scribe does not have a real understanding of the nature of man but instead connects clich√©s to the emerging style. Character is not found in detail. These are puppets thrown down on the program that clearly acknowledges the main feature, the mother and daughter's daughter. Anne Reid gives good performance despite being given specific conditions and lines, standing like that by allowing her angry daughter to throw her eye. Script shows Darren (Daniel Craig) as Dr Jekyll / Mr. Hyde without any thought on what, except that it draws cocaine before a large area. <br /> <br /> The author's author could do more with this theme.
