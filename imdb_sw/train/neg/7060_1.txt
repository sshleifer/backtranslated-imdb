This film is awesome. The characters are completely unreliable, and it is not good at all. The plan is bad and some of the class events are worthwhile and they make a look at the concern. In fact the quality of the script and features show that this film is written by secondary school students, only a lack of credibility to the school environment says that, in fact, the authors never get to high school. Acting was often too weak, although much of this was under the script and poor issues, I don't know that any actors could make this film appear. It said the voice track was the same, and the movie was good in places (although editing was bad).
