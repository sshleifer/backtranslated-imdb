I must say as a fan of someone who created Halloween / Fog / Christine / The Thing - maybe his best films. <br /> <br /> Then you got this POS. I can't think that he puts any effort in this as he did and burned smoking. At least his child made a beautiful voice. <br /> <br /> You should check this for a view that was not seen as a film. It seemed like someone else led the same thing. I will not believe Mbapentari put any effort in this even. I was hearing his old school H2 / H3 / Sounds of the Pipe and was awesome, especially at times. <Br /> <br /> He was using a style that no one had ever worked for his films.
