I like Spike Lee has chosen a different title of his film. "Sam's Summer" reflects the feeling that the film is about a good serial killer, David Berkowitz. It is not. It is gritty, a world image of the NYC road during the summer of '77 when Berkowitz gave the city. The film follows several young liars in the neighborhood of Italiano and America, and their impact on Sam's son threat. There is Vinny and his wife Dionna; there are Richie and Ruby, and several other characters. The problem is that these characters do not like. They are constantly depressed, and sometimes can not fail. Lee is the one who puts their high power, chaotic life, which is full of anger, lust, and general trouble. There are at least two scenes of the struggle between Vinny and his wife, great scenes of dance discovery, countless gabfests ... From time to time I kept asking: Where is the film editor? At the same time, with the abundance, the film provides an opportunity to present any feeling of fear or fear that comes from Sam's man, which is very back. Lee is most successful in showing different types of risk, which happens to neighboring groups. <br /> <br /> Acting is a beautiful draw. That, with 70 disco music, and great attention to clothing and design, makes it as if you are in the Italian and American neighborhood in NYC in 1977. However, the legitimacy of the film atmosphere, however, is not close enough to deal with gambling, the overblown script on the lives of people very severe irritating.
