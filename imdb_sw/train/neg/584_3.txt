This film, like the first ("Someone from the Snowy River") has the same characteristics as bad, perhaps even more than natural. Unfortunately, the bad reduces good. Good / beautiful environment, better than the first film. I love those high shots in Australia. Tom Burlinson is still a good man, like "Jim Craig." Bruce Rowland did a good job with music, too. BAD - Once again we find a very stupid heroine "Jessica" (Sigrid Thornton) who is a world farmer and very angry face and manner on her. In this film, we also get a great downgrade in who gives the father. Previously it was Kirk Douglas, who has now replaced Brian Dennehy. Commenting on this, it is a shame that the Walt Disney film will include the use of the name of the Lord free of charge. That was one reason was almost completely under the existing in the 1980s. This film, like the first
