A police officer (Robert Forster) in the criminal crime city has his wife visited him and a young child was killed after he expected to stand in a petrol station. After the killers leave free thanks to the convicted judge and he himself has been imprisoned for 30 days for the court's contempt, he decides to take things with his own hands by joining a group of vigilantes led by Fred Williamson. These types of Robin Hood provide any criminal offenses that the law does not approve of the accusations, and with their help he tries to track those who have wronged him. The only thing out of the ordinary is to be killed by a two-year-old boy, which was a good patient. Otherwise it is a business as usual for this type of e.g. it involves lots of car parts, stripes and stripes mixed with a large number of men. I could do without fighting in prison in swimming involving all the prisoners, however. Also, did they lose money before hiding the last photos? I say this because it is so close to a sudden and slightly closed. If someone knows, give me a bell. In fact, don't bother. Closing: Close under "Unbeatable Play". Next.
