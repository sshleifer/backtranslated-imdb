Not as bad as you have heard. There are some funny places with Affleck and Applegate they have good good chemistry. Assistant, in particular, is interesting and pleasant as Affleck's love. James Gandolfini and Catherine O'Hara are powerful professionals. They are very good about everything. At the end, "Survival" is not the worst movie of the holiday you see. Unfortunately, it is unknown and many comedy is forced. The darkest humor comes out as you like. Affleck tries to be very difficult and worried but comes as sad. The nature of the cartoonish character is brought in great relief when viewed around Gandolfini and O'Hara more muted, reliable performances. Even with the balance of the holiday movies, you can not fully buy in the set-up of Affleck "lease" this family for X-mas. There are also events that until on the surreal in their cunning. The X-mas section is full of humor (the child appears to look at the naked, stimulating pictures of his mother) that are not only interesting or reliable but sad. Do something worse, paint in this film is muddy, almost noirish. The house in which most films are seen appears to be stable and affordable. <br /> <br /> "Saved" is of the fourth interest in the string of the box office duds (Paycheck, Gigli, Jersey Girl, and this) to Affleck. It remains to be seen how the destruction will continue.
