After seeing the remake of 1996, I thought it was a funniest way to see Cruella De Vil to get its punishment for cleaning the animals just for their skin. The whole movie was quite funny, and in my opinion, better than an animated one. But there was no second need. First of all, if Cruela returns, do not give up and let him go again. Just make him remove the prison and that's rap. I thought it was not very funny. It should have only one puppy of the return to return. I would have to be Lucky, for he was more attractive, and instead, having Roger and Anita back too. However, they decided to have a complete renewal and not to add one hundred, even one hundred and two, but only three children, and a pastor who thinks he is a dog (clever). The part of Gerard Depardieu was useless. Finally, Cruella is faced with a lot of ways, the way it also humiliates and the way is also spread to the truth. He saves into a big cake. That was a desperate attempt to physical humor, trying to imitate the same effect from the first. That didn't work. It was very high, and not very funny. I really had pity about Cruella.
