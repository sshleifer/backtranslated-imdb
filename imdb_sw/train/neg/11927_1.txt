Of course, the worst film I have seen for a long time. I endured to the end there must be something here, but no. The plan, while unrelated to the clichés, strikes the extinction; talks that should be the road is only hackneyed; characters have not continued beyond the drawings; The pieces of the set are clichéd. Worse, based on his co-director, photography is just so-so. <br /> <br /> Feedback to another place that focuses on this with Get Carter, Long Good Friday or Kaspar Hauser is a variety of ways; The Saints' lives do not have their invention without leaving deep and shading them. In short, their trick. An uncomfortable editor can decline for a 30 minute minute good, but if it stands it is a six-year film form of a million-pound; run and run for its own preparation. That has received the money (actually just because of the name of Rankin) while other small films are fighting for money that threatens the UK film industry.
