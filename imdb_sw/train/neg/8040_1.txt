In a college dorm boy is killed by a scythe person. Her boyfriend Beth (Dorie Barton) finds her and tries to commit suicide. He is an institution. A year after he is out, he has a new partner named Hank (Joseph Lawrence) and wants to use Spring Break and Hank and four other thoughtless friends in BIG, a beautiful condo in Florida. Usually the killer climbs (for no reason) and starts killing again. <br /> <br /> Beautiful slasher's amazing - an example of how to make a notorious movie of the low budget. For the beginning, much of this film is a free filling of these six video delivery videos, having “fun” (more fun than viewers), drinking, doing hard etc etc. Also there is no shortage here. I don't say a terrible film requires dirt but everything to consider this would help. No death is shown (you hear them), it's just a bit of blood and no one. There is one true truth - but that's not the end. <br /> <br /> With a few few acting performs. Dorie Barton is as bad as the great lady and Tom Jay Jones is lousy like Oz. Chad Allen climbs as Brad and he is TERRIBLE. Lawrence is really very good - beautiful and hunky and giving it all his crap. And Jeff Conaway takes a little chance to do a very good job. The lack of logic has increased - after realizing a friend has been killed by two girls talking about sex; Baston is not a reaction to seeing a friend killed is a kind of funny and what is happening to Lawrence? His character loses without end the end! Evil, ignorant, no gore, no dirt - skip this. <br /> <br /> Rated R for abuse of images and dirt.
