Personally I think this show looks pretty cheaply made. Some actors are awesome. They on make & seem fake. I can always tell him how it will end in the first 10 minutes or less to watch because they do it clearly. Not well written. I like to watch it laugh. You know the word "It's so bad that it's good?" Well, those words are used for this show. I also like to watch just to see if I am right when I think how it will all continue. So far I have been correct every time. It's like a little game I play. It's nice when tired and you feel like laughing on something.
