Camera function - Why does the camera work in this film so it goes? This is angry and confusing. Editing - Flashes of the image was still a very short way. Many other events were too short. Just shining. Sound - back music was a great way and covered the sound. One should not have a renewal and restore to do what was said. Does no one look at these things and make them do again? Please reduce the amount of music back later. Is the adjustment of the relative voice levels of the editor, Julia Wong? The plan had many ways to release. The basic story line was capable. I think the film requires more work. What? Run? Maybe they lost money. Like many movies, it started out loud but it's hit out towards the end. I don't know this, you know you have a story band before you get into the production so why not the end is all provided to be kept in the storyboard. <br /> <br /> Sorry that very important.
