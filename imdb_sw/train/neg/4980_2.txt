I have read the review of this film because it had a low budget, now I took things. The CGI organisms were good but they were made in the worst way. The fight of war was not just one of the battles then one shot of one monster and very interactive at all times. When the monster interacted it looked like it was done in pro paintshop. In my opinion if you have a low budget you should use the models and pupi. They may not see it as a concept but at least interact, see the original Peter Jacksons movies. If Beowulf's characters did natural work but all others were beaten and did not try or forget where. <br /> <br /> Script seemed my confusion. One minute they would be speaking as a modern day setting next to the club's shakespeare speech club. I can't say it should 'ye' and 'be' but you need to get a co-equality so that the lines can be felt if it comes from that person. I realized one part near the beginning when Beowulf quoted the Old Testament which would have been found if he did not use all the films that talk about gods and advertising. <br /> <br /> In short, this film is very polished very little turd, but not down.
