The original book was set in the 1950s but it will not do for the TV series because most people are looking at the 1930s style. Typically, the train train near the end was the 1950 train published to be seen as a 1930 train so that Underground can play in the game too. Keeping stories about the plot about Jarrow March was weak but the 50 version had students who were starting to think about the world around them so I think making them think about the poverty of the monitors is one thing. All things that came from Japp and joined himself were also weak but they had to put something in filling time. This would have made a half-hour show or they could make it a book and make it a better show. Obviously this section is a victim of fashion on content.
