After reading other comments on this film, I would like to share my own opinion that this is a single movie one to see unless you're a total Brooksophile. It's not. If it appears with a primary observer, this film is an unequal story that gives us more neuroses that are not available than one can be found on one set. It's very difficult to watch. Brooks's character (Robert Cole) doesn't like it and it is very uncomfortable for him to take it for himself - root it for him as he misses out of one of the most unfamiliar situations to the next. And she should not make the area high and expect to be taken seriously in a romantic environment. No one can have a clear leaves and needs to turn a child like Kathryn Harrold ---- except, in fact, is Albert Brooks in controlled production by Brook Brook. <br /> <br /> "Movie Romance" has its exciting time ----- but it's pieces and wrong. More often than not, I felt like I was on a trip to a prisoner with someone who couldn't walk and intended to end. It proves the problems that can develop when a great control of the film is reserved for only one person - a non-disciplined person to return from them and see what happens. As many people know, James L. Brooks, who played the director in this film, is actually shown it. Six years later, he gave Albert Brooks a great success "News of Advertising." James showed us how Albert can create a reliable and interesting performance. Albert allowed us to see James (usually not considered as an actor) to make an interesting way of comic in an amazing way. <br /> <br /> Fans of "Movie Romance" will now move to the following comments about it. I tell you â€” there is a lot of pain in the world without finding it on a movie like entertainment.
