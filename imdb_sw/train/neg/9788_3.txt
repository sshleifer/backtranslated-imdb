Not that I do not like children's movies, but this was tears of a few characteristics of redemption. M.J Fox was the perfect sound for Stuart and all the talent was lost. Hugh Laurie can be awesome funny, but it is not available in this film. It is sugar-sugar and can not appeal to anyone over the age of 7. See Toy Toy, Monsters Inc.. or Shrek instead. 3/10
