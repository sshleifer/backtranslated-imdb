This movie was interesting ... I had to look at the college college about India, however, the synopsis tells you this film is about one thing when it doesn't contain very cool, hard information on those details. It is not true for the end to the very point where they are trying to unite all things together. The reason for the year is good, however. Even certainly beginning, you want to look away because the gore is very good. Just watch this film if you want to see a cold winter, because the plot is thin and it will make you sad that you have lost time to hear it. I've seen rumors on other websites about this movie based on real events, however you can't find any information about it online ... so basically this movie was a waste of time to watch.
