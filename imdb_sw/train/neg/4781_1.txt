This can be a very bad example of an ever-propaganda propaganda. Authors and producers should study the thirty-thirty German films. They knew how to sell. Even the leader of the Soviet leader as the leader of the father-god did well. Discouragement. The loss of faith was re-established in the church just the second time for the fathers to be "saved" by Hoover / God was not so bad. Unfortunately, it seemed to run away and not very close. A few shots of Heaven's hoover of angels to the corner of the screen-tap and nodding- would add a lot. The best feature is Hoover only to save eligible families and children WHO was "proven" their value. Unfortunately, some homeless people were shown as they enjoy and even good - but Hoover-God does not help them. The best way can be shots of drinking spirits to show the right to their status. Finally, bright and enjoyable events (after Hoover saved the country from depression) would have rolled out at the end. We can see how Hoover-God was saved not only for this worthy family, but for all who truly deserve. Amateurist in the best.
