They could compete with several actors from the Infernal Affairs, but they could not bring life to the emerging script. There are cases of discussion where two or three lines have been said and cut between each other and there is no progress to what the characters say. You almost feel like each other gives a monologue race and just ignore other characters. Michael Biehn is a wooden, really? Sammo Hung twice? No. Yes the way. Stay away.
