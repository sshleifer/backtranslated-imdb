I thought this movie was awesome. I am Chinese, so I thought everything was very wrong. Many things were wrong. The only thing about Chinese history in the cinema is when Wendy's mother explained her husband about the images ShiHuangDi. I also thought that the fight was very good and fake. Most of the artists and actors were not very good. Some jokes who thought that "funny" were really ignorant. I think this movie should get the worst possible score that can get. Disney has found more information on Chinese history if they want to create a aggressive film. Mulan was absolutely correct. Watch this film if you want to waste time.
