I want to say acting is bad, but I think it was a guide that did it. I've never thought of a lot of Highlander (the director) but that one can be judged in 80 years. <br /> <br /> This, however, has no reason. People are shot when they leave the trenches with someone in front of him! These types of errors, along with an uncertain timeline, the best tactics of war, short cut and bad effects of seeing, make this a little film on all. <br /> <br /> So as many others commented, all of America's cow. The German general is afraid of his American man who was beaten. Be prepared to strengthen a lot, though in small doses. <br /> <br /> Counting, it's not horrible but still a small battle war in all spheres.
