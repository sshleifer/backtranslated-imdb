In this celebration, the 40-year-old Norma Shearer plays fluttery, a social partner in Monte Carlo, who was beaten in a tussle between George Sanders and Robert Taylor. It tries to convince the failure of this film on a lighter script, conversation, or director George Cukor, who never seems to need to strengthen the standard of the film. However, it is the fault of Shearer herself, who wanted to continue playing "young" pieces as long as she could overcome it. Of course, this makes "Dear Kadibodi" become a wonderful pride for the vanity of the old woman.
