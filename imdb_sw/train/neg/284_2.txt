I just today, I have taken this to only 99 cents today store, and still I think I got ripped off. "The Dream of Belief" is a good and non-realistic game of gymnastics and $ 1 is also very expensive for this. This film is only possible for two things: 1. It has Keanu Reeves young. And 2. Guided by Paul Lynch, a man who also made the Night of Promotion. Now go to the film. It's about a girl named Robin (Played with Olivia D'Abo) who was seriously injured as a result of a car accident that also lost her father's life. So the accident prevents him from competing in the gymnastic sports competition, often taken during his classes and eventually meets a wild child named Tommy (Playing with Keanu.) Robin, while not in training, works at the same time, with his mother and assistant, in Laundromat owned by his grandfather's grandfather. Finally he is chosen to compete. Overall, Keanu alone with some 80 interesting tunes is what is launching to give this star 1, and also not one of the worst movies, but still far from good. The DVD itself does not get any medals either appears to be sourced from the old VHS and toward the end, the sound does not happen to balance and when the last credit is close, it seems to be black, although the voice may still be heard. So this could probably be approved as bootleg. The diagram of the DVD has no meaning as seen as recent Keanu and Olivia pictures and history is not related to the film, since it is also not on the film itself, so it is clear the picture. In any case, avoid all costs, unless you are a fanatic of Keanu. I probably won't be executed again. I probably will give you Snob Cinema, who is the chief defendant of YT btw. Hey, if any of you has any movies that you no longer want before them, feel free to give him to put his show running.
