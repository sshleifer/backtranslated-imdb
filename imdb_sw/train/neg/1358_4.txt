The words "Swedish" and "Action movie" did not mix. That becomes more and more and every attempt made in that kind. This is another attempt failed. Lasse Brunell (Shanti Roney) performs military air functions and advanced computer systems. One day offenders threaten to hurt his family as he does not do what they tell him. They want secrets and do anything to find it. <br /> <br /> This movie has an ups and downs. And usually in the cinema of Swedish action no "ups", just "drop". So I think something in this movie showed some quality. Start with good words I can mention that the movie is technically well. The flight footage and helicopter flying is shot well and look very beautiful. Acting is very good. Shanti Roney makes the best performance when Maria Bonnevie is hard and non-natural as usual (i wonder how long the Swedish directors are going to continue to use her even if she has the skill of the wooden board?). Stefan Sauk is laughable as a "cool" special forces man does not go to the detection base. <br /> <br /> And what about the action scenes? With i said on the flight scenes and flying helicopters are good. But apart from that there are not many steps to talk. And that's a common problem with Swedish practical films. There is only enough action going on. Maybe it's a budget problem, maybe it's a culture of culture. I don't know, but it negatively affects the experience. Because in fact, the story and acting is not good for this film to rely solely on that. <br /> <br /> I tested this 4/10 for a quest.
