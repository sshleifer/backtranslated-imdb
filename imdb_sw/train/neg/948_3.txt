I've tried to watch this show several times, but for a show called "That '70s Show," I don't get much away from a few hair and regular memory of the disco that actually promotes' 70s - ten years that I grew up. In the events I saw, a lot of squares and jokes can be set at any time. Remove the novel (considered) in the '70 years, and the show is neither desirable nor desirable. If you are looking to show that more effectively represents the experience of young people in America in the 70 years, in my opinion of humility you can't do better than "Wonderful Years."
