slow, incomprehensible, boring. Three words of enthusiasm that describe the book of the book. That's certainly where the movie should not be made at the cost of the book. The best part of the movie was beautiful, very beautiful. The worst part is to interact with the participants who included the impaired eyes. Editing is both sudden and appropriate. However, despite this, executives worked hard at least trying to feel a bit with a bad script. It was a pity that although it was installed in Peru there was no native of Peru around the set - even on flashback scenes showing Peru in the 17th century. If you have a sense of history, try to avoid this film.
