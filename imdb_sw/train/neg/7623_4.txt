This small show is definitely some ignorant / preinning of the original series. <br /> <br /> Compared to the series of live action this show is a perfect crap. The live action exhibition had a sense of joke and story lines. While the animation series is basically the lowest version of the slight degradation to small viewers but I think maybe children lose this trick. The story of the story in each section is only Sabrina with a stupid and useless disorder and he uses magic to fix it. That is the basis of every idea. The most wonderful period is when Sabrina uses magic to be a Gem and Gem that sabrina. So then Gem becomes a wizard and hypnotizes comes to be his slave. This leads to a wonderful but surprising area was Gem says "just love me now" and it becomes less hands and knees and start kissing feet as he is god. (which is absolutely correct since he is a servant of his mind of the slave) But this spin-off of stupid does not value time or effort.
