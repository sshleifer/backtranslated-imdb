When I recently gave a PETTICOAT NOTICE review, I did not like this film very much though it was very similar. Both were offered for only a few years, Cary Grant and both stars and WWII song. However, the sound and style of the film was quite different. KISS AJIFUNA TO ME, in general, it seemed only as a cheap film - for poor writing, little energy and very large displays - even compared to PETTICOAT. I think that at least the blame for this is a lie in hitting Jayne Mansfield. The combination of many of his talents and a limited ability to do this actually makes this film the look like it came from a 3-degree studio. It's kind of integrating Sir Lawrence Olivier and Marjorie Main.
