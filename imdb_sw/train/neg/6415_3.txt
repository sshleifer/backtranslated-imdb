This was far from the worst movie that I have ever seen in all my life. It was slow, horrible, fearless, not surprising, not strange, not entertaining. Sarah Michelle Gellar was on her play of empty words and fear. He could not sell his character or no one in the picture. <br /> <br /> For those who thought Grudge was a 'right kind' then don't go see this unless you get happy from losing your time and life. I see this movie for free in such a way that I don't want this to come as a partner from someone who has lost 8 bucks on a bad movie. It was free, still beaten, I hated it. Avoid it.
