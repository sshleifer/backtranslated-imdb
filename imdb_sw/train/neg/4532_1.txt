My husband and I bought the Old School Sesame Street for our daughter and I must say, I did not allow her to look at the new TVs, because I am looking for all those who are angry. Baby Bear and Telly? OMgosh, How blond and useless blabber can anyone think about their 'skits'? Elmo? Giving rest not every child likes, again, angry and does not teach my child anything. Mr. Tambi? what is the refusal. I think one time I turned a new show 'for her, she and I were left dumber than before. The show has definitely considered the right direction. I remember Yip Yips, News Breaking News, 1-2 2 Little Dolls, Mumford Wizard, Bert and Ernie, Grover Assistant, every big screen of the OLD SCHOOL SS Sesame Street has been hit directly by weight and difficulty since Jim Henson passed the year 1990. The show again has a skim of education, funny and interactive used. I see new versions of the most irritating and full-time modern education. Path to S.S. / authors have another picture of the parents' exhibition staying out there, unprotected children, so they will come out of their hair. For Manufacturers / Writers: I tell you you clap the old Muppets and start hit the same content as Sesame Street first. The Lord knows I certainly don't want my child to talk like Baby Bear or Elmo.
