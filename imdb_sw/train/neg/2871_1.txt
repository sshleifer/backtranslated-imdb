I hit this awesome movie. I think the worst I've ever seen. I believe the first class can do a better job. The worst movie I saw and I saw some evil. No fear unless I paid 1.50 to pay and that was 1.49 very much. Acting is bad, the characters are evil and the film is a piece of garbage. The home of the slauther house is a very low budget which makes B look like Oscar striker. All I can say is if you want to lose a good evening with a little money to rent this flick flick. I would like to look at the clowns killers from the outside space when the tickets in the bucket of razors than staying through this flop
