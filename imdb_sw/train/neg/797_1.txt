I have lost two hours of my life watching this intellectual plot. I could make the best film with my mobile camera. What? How can they find actors playing on those movies? Movies movies have excellent events and effects ... I would have two hours back ... <br /> <br /> The only thing about the beauty of this film is cast. Even though, their working skills in this could not lift this film approved, the rest were WAY very bad! <br /> <br /> It is a kind of film that I would recommend to use to torture prisoners to destroy them. <br /> <br /> Even more, I saw the translated version of this flick ... Think, the bad movie ... and the worst interpretation ... Yikes!
