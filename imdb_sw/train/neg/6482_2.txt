Disney is still not available film that can not make at least two rows. And this was not different for the Disney people to give a weak story to receive quick payments. Somehow, although I didn't have to pay to see it, I feel easy to look at it. Ariel has grown up now and had a daughter. However, it does not allow the daughter to go into the sea because of the unspeakable threat from the late sea sea sister. So here we go again. The child is infected (of course) and helps the marine witch. After an unprecedented war, he has been defeated by mermaids and human beings live together. Yawn. <br /> <br /> Nothing to see here. Back to your life. "D-"
