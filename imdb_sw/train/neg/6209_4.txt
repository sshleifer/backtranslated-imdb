I am always afraid to take too much to do with the film. Look at a month later and you can see the difference, or dig after 50 years on a different continent and other religious followers to find something that has been recommended for the first time. After staying through the great leadership of Robert Carmichael at his British premiere, it was not surprising to me that I had a question and answer to respond after more interesting than the film itself. Shane Danielsen (Director of International Film Film Edinburgh Film), assisted by the director and producer of the film, provided the shadow protection of the film rather than received a negative general response from the audience. The artists of Edinburgh Festival should not be easy. Only one person came out of hate. The films of the film were very dedicated and constructive from the public as well as the actor and the woman who teaches the M.A film directors. This was not a very 'terrible' film. There was an uninterrupted gender-based violence, but much more than a lot of films (the actual weapons of the weapon was hidden, as stated in the genitals). The audience did not like it because they were sitting for two hours that were boring, where acting standards were not high, where the farm was poor, expected and isolated, and where they were involved with careful and careful decisions on the controversial movie promise. . Instructions for war in Iraq are more powerful, more stressed and stable (without general mention of violence, any deep meaning unknown); and the 'leaf leaf' Marquis de Sade, as one member of the audience puts it, seems to be just an excuse for the development of the plot towards the end. We have a story of a boy who has a certain amount going to him (stands at school with his music abilities) but takes drugs and relies on young people who have nothing or anything that does them and their crime activities are spread by rape and abuse. During pushing, Robert seems to have a lot of violence locked in it. <br /> <br /> The film is not entirely without reputation. Listeners are left to decide how Robert has found the way: Is it the influence of others? Why did all the interest and concerns from parents and teachers not share him in the best way of life? Investigation, there is a very sensitive area where it relies on (if it is too much drug, shy, moral sense or just waiting for it?). A few friends are looking for a woman in the back room, a part standing and installed in the center of the screen. Before the open bones, the DJ's flat is more active and louder for the girl to lose her happy home than any idea for a woman. Finally he is less angry if their activity attracts police. The wonderful Sunday of the fun of the sound of his music even when he knows of rape continues to express his rejection in an amazing way. Robert throws us back in front of us. But all the films, including its great climax of controversial controversy (if not true true) sexual abuse, is not about this level. Some people have had a strong response to it (the intention of the film advertisers: "If they are vomiting, we have been able to produce answers") but to a large extent - and as I can describe Edinburgh's responses it seems to have a report from Cannes - they feel, " Why did managers put us in poor performance of the film? " Director Clay Hugh can talk a discussion but has no development of artistic vision. His answers to the mirror for life to tell the truth about the things under the carpet, even his advocacy that there is a little plot because he did not want to make a typical Hollywood movie - it's all good response to criticism, but unfortunately they do not use the film. its, more to do it by holding the glass when someone opposes, or loses the film while playing with accuracy and score. You want to try and give him any benefit of doubt, I told him for a few minutes after the investigation, but I found him to be mixed as his movie and soon moved to the bar to wash my mouth with something bigger. There are many facts. One feature of the art is to educate, another fun, another to encourage. I asked him if he had a social or political agenda and says Ken Loach (one of the many good names he takes) without going to now to accept any agenda himself. Then he fell on his mantra on his work to tell the truth. I am left with the impression that this was an overambitious project for a new director, or another disingenuous effort to put it on a map to provide advertise for a second job rate / <br /> Andy Warhol could draw a tin of soup and was art. Clay Hugh would like to imitate the main directors who have made a competitive film and pushing the borders. Unfortunately, his ability at this time only expands for the great reasons for the public search.
