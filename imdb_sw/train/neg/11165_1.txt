I mean, in fact ... or i have suddenly lost my sense of humor or this is just a very bad movie. It's stupid, ignorant and not just funny at all. Since I saw the preview I knew it would not be a great movie, I just thought it was bad. What happened during the good old time you can find amazing lines on any movie? When executives did not need to play the role of ignorance in trying to be funny ?. Now we find ourselves with movies like this, Borat, Little Men, Scary Movie 4 where I couldn't find a funny part! <br /> <br /> Just go this piece of garbage <br /> <br /> PS (Sorry for my English)
