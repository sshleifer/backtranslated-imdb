I went to visit one of my brothers in a short time, and we hit the theater, so we would like to think we would go and give this movie go. What an error! This film is bad in every department. I have never heard the film before, and in fact everyone still does not. Not surprisingly, this is just as it gets. It's comedy, so it says, well the only thing is funny is the ability, or its lack, of the director to make the film. Get it so close to Christmas, this should have a low name to cook Turkey around an hour and a half - or even so long, as I walk out. At the end of the film, there will be a feeling like you have been poisoning on a sick Turkey, and you are sad to waste your time on that dribble. Who knows why these things are done. Some people had gone from the hall before the film was not available, and I judge myself for a long walk. I hear that you pay good money to see something of respect, and all that you come out and see is a bad movie of TV that should be displayed at 2 am, in fact, it's bad, when TV should not show. What can I say ... maybe insufficient words can do right.
