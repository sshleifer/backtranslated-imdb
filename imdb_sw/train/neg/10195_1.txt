The author / director of this film clearly does not know anything about the film. I think DP on this project was closed and replaced by a monkey, because every appearance was too dark or had more hot spots than the sun. The story was bad, the characters were directly. For someone, he said that this film has been made for fans of poker and not for fans of the film, that someone makes himself (perhaps he was a writer / director). No fan of poker in this world likes this film. Even your financial person hates this project. Entering the casino and playing a few hands did not give you the experience of writing on poker. Keep your work day. And if it plays poker, then you must have hurt'n.
