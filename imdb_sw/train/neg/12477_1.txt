This is one of those movies that you and a group of friends sit around drinking beer, eating pizza, and laughing. Unfortunately I found myself looking at this alone. My brothers and I used a great movie block and we never went around to see this. It was necessary to back and I thought it was a waste not to look at it. So I did, and I was impressed by how this film was so bad. Now, I love the worst movies, and maybe I would like this if the "hero" was not so much hate. The whole movie I was hoping that he would put that stupid sword down and let someone kill him! He does very small things in the movie. He is a good, hateful, stupid thing. He has less liberty characteristics than criminals do. And what was it with all the naked asses? I mean, I like naked chicks like the next guy, but this film went tad overboard in the department. Well, however, if you like bad movies and you can stand "hero" "then I'm sure you will like this schlock of the film.
