This is the type of film that everyone is responsible for and must be more embarrassed. Still leading, on high acting and conspiracy that laughs and there is no certainty instead of demonstrating violence. I thought when I first saw that maybe it would be a satire of the media and how it shows violence but not. I don't know what makes the film worse. Oliver's stones make his leadership very ugly. From the events where Woody Harrelson's face does not have any meaning or bad performance of Robert Downey Jr as Wayne Gale, who is a journalist who seems to be the most players, this movie is a mess.
