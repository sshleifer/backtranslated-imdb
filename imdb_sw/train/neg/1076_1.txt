This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Branaugh seemed to have many problems remembering his inspiration that he could not give his lines. The program did not deserve the name of John Grisham. It is not surprising that it has never been published as a book or given on a movie. I couldn't even look at the whole thing. I decided I didn't worry who did it, then realized that there is no "whodunit" keeping about!
