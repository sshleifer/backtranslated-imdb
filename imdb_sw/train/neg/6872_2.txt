This version had a good story, but a bad conversation. The main character was terrible. It is clear why this show has been deleted, though, as it shows more of the UPN, I never knew it even existed until it had run again. Many plots appeared to be copied from other exhibitions and movies, causing me to think the producers had no original idea in their heads. <br /> <br /> I've never commented. You need to have ten lines of text. Special effects were not bad for showing the year 2001. <br /> <br /> Gnome was a good character.
