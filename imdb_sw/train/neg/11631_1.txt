Today, I wrote this review in anger at Uwe Boll and Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Hollywood has provided movies according to the day of the darkest of our nation. 911 changed everything. It changed our sense of security. It changed our understanding of human evil and humanity. The most important and destructive thing has changed our world. However, I can not emphasize how to be beaten, desperate, and very angry I am ignorant, ignorant of Hollywood who wants to make profitable profits outside death and destruction. This movie and those like it should cause a quarrel between word-la-mouth between moviegoers and critics; Certainly it is worthy of regular media. Hollywood dropped down. Even lower than those who have performed many acts of degradation and violence. Behind it all is Uwe Boll. I am very angry with this film. Do they deserve to respect the records of the lost families? How do they wonder how they laugh at the lives of the brave men and women who risked their lives to save those who remained in the ruined towers on that horrible day of fraud? Are they trying to wait and at the same time reflect on the national catastrophe in the fury of the cry and the fatigue of the world after 911?!! How ... are afraid ... they? To those who have a bucket even think of seeing this terrible moral values, I say this with a heavy heart for all my strength: Remember. Think again of that day and ask yourself if you are not a good and moral person. Think back on that day, ask yourself if this film is not shy and embarrassing for life that happened that day. Think again of the day of the cries of the beloved family. Think again of that lost life of the two birds. Think back to the other killings that led to the attack. Ask yourself if you have a soul. Think about it. Remember. Respect the life records lost on 911 by not seeing this film completely.
