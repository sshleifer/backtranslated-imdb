I watched this film a few times and I can all say that this is a low-budget waste and that it has nothing to do with the reality of history. The performances of the actors are very poor but are the result of the less likely to act. Anyone who watched this film can now think of Hitler as some of the lunatic things of skinny skin who ran with guns like some gangster Chicago. I can only say that there is the best film about Hitler and Germany in those years and that the planting of evil is very small. I can recommend the fall of the German film that you can see the good performance of Swiss actor Bruno Ganz in Adolf Hitler's roll.
