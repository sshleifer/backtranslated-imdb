It is not that "Ulli Lommel" has filled me with hope, but I must admit that ZODIAC KILLER was able to sink under my lowest expectations. There is a recent trend among young filmmakers to use digital video for their original projects, which is good and good for giving these children the opportunity to work without spending their money on high-quality film shares. But many of these young filmmakers have also joined the theory of filing the completed film so that it can be seen more like cellulodi. The effect is not available, but it helps. A non-video video video works only with the "author" style, because it doesn't look like anything except video. There is a basic problem with KILLER of ZODIAC. Watching the movie feels like watching the opera's day for the killer. It doesn't feel like watching the film. And what even more forgiven is that Lommel is not limited to film film. He should know well. He should know that it is impossible to produce panic (or even stop!). By the love of God this man has been leading from sixty years! He can be the only director who has failed to improve the work of forty years in business. And our luck, wrote the script too! So you can expect faithful acts that do not mean anything, irresponsible behavior, and at least one of the most honest features that will leave you completely uncomfortable. Please, please miss this movie. You will thank me later.
