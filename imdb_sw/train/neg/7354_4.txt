If you finish the hammer I was scared when I should have the courage to watch this film and the next, Holiday on buses. I had seen One film bus and I thought it was one of the worst films I had ever seen. It was full of all the horrible comedy which had British TV screens around 70 years. It is embarrassing to say that there were parts of this film I laughed. I don't know if I was aware of the characters and I was happy with a situation, knowing how they could respond. I saw Blakey especially funny, although I could swear no action in the trilogy does it say his catchphrase, "I'll find you Butler". When looking at the Holiday on bus jokes were starting to wear a thin film and these three films can be compared to the first trilogy hammer, Dick Barton, for the second film made is better (though this is probably The only way that can be comparable). The only people who would like to watch this film are probably the fans of the television series, who will surely enjoy this, and the hammer fills as myself. For producers I would say that this film is not bad and I can really think of the worst practice of the hammer.
