Celia is employed as a powerful experiment officer in the Los Angeles ward, while its evil temperature has become a romantic model in its fetishistic world largely due to the erotic exhibition on CD-ROMS, but when disaster loses "Mr. Vanessa ", a strong Celia, has decided to put her sister's fierce striker, starting a new job as a" sex slave "at a private privacy club where a special house is a" shaft party ". Two FBI farm workers (who are being sent to Vanessa's case are required because of their involvement with BDSM network sites), as well as the investigation of the Los Angeles police killings, are required to investigate crime, while trying to provide security to Celia whose performance The enthusiasm in its new call is very quickly observed by its customers as having a personal risk environment for it.

Gymnastics of the mentioned images are facing a montage of stripes close to the end of the film's original images that are tangentially different from the situation. One end of acting is seen between this slag: Stan Abe as an active FBI agent.
