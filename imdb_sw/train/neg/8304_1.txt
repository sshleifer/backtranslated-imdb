"Christmas story" is one of the most popular movies of many time. ACS was able to take the viewer at a time and place in such a way that very small films have been available. It was beautiful and good that is not available. So I waited (and wait) his line, "Coming Into Family". The film was released several times, just hit for the last minute. When it finally came out, the IRITF was (and is, I think) a total failure. Settings and movies are only suitable, but completely leading, completely lost logo. The film was nothing more than a form of lazy money to make lazy, lazy writing, and abandon acting. <br /> <br /> Journalist, Jean Shepard, who was one of the American people who play human and storytelling speakers, were forced to refer to the fake wit he used in ACS. He further reduced it, and why he did that I would never know. Somehow he could become a furious pride, which motivated himself. <br /> <br /> Writing and working on IRITF is valid and forced. Officials may have seen ACS, but whatever wit and nuance which was in ACS should not be registered completely for any of them. Acting was an embarrassing attack caused by any Shepard humor. <br /> <br /> ACS will always be a real treasure, but calling the IRITF response is accusing all fans of Jean Shepard and ACS.
