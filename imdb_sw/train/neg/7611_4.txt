1 watched 2/28/2006 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Sydney Pollack): - The DVD version I saw "Day 3 Condor" - Therefore, the CIA festival is full of backlaces made for past keeping. movie. The legendary cluster refers to 7 out of 8 members of the CIA study group being killed by Robert Redford's character, codename = Condor, being the remaining one. Who killed them and why? That's how Redford tries to get when he tries to not be a victim of 8 at the same time. On the way, he finds Faye Dunaway's character, originally because he needs a place to hide, and then finally helps him out after a little time of love. This is one of a few of the innocent people in the flight stories but this is not a lot of doubt. The flat shows are not helpful and finished is not enough for the viewers program. Despite having a good director in Sydney Pollack and a group of ancient artists, stories and exhibitions are not supposed to be and therefore the movie is not necessary.
