It was a good story, but it was not well told. I loved the theme and the main story of the story, which was not as clear as it could be. Perhaps there is a lot of lack of control over all. Acting was similar to cheesy, others were more powerful than others and even powerful executives had their time of low quality to act. It took a few months to go through the entire movie because it didn't put my thoughts and flow was very bad. I just finished watching and I'm glad I did if the film finally grows and continues to the end. Again, the good news, but the delivery was small. Do you recommend for a line of story and maybe a little eye candy, and I mean, a little.
