Movie terrible. If there is one Turkish film you should avoid seeing in 2006, which should be Banyo. It is a waste of time. Other than a cheaper couple laughs this movie does not match anything, nada, lilich, nil. The discussion is cheaper, and the sex clich√©s are located on it. The director needs to watch more movies before trying to lead himself. Red-colored women show examples of what they should not do. If you are interested in learning how to do this it is a perfect example of a bad act. The only good thing I can say about the movie is, wait, wait, nothing good I can say about it. I must love to write about this. Jeez!
