The first time I looked at Cold Case was after a year run on Danish television. When you came to the TV you were about to sink into another 4 or 5 US crime that shows you at the same time. <br /> <br /> I saw it and I was provoked to die. Artists concerned with their fair faces and values ​​were back pain. The whole premise that most of the money was given to the team of investigators to solve 10-20-30 killings or even 60 years it seems unlikely. <br /> <br /> While it is also a reason if they have only 50 -60 minutes to tell a story which means that they get a break through just the time to resolve the case and bring justice to family members, if they still live. This is associated with "personal" problems and ties of monitors who are there during the leaves to show that they are not perfect. I give you a rating of 2 stars because of the music i end that is the only reason to look at it .... which of course you will not do if that's a TOO blind because of checking this crap.
