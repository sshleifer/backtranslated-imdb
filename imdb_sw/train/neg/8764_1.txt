This movie was quite tortured. First of all, it's 4+ long hours! Of course, Kargil's war may have several points that were captured and fought, but each of these battles was not shown. So this is a document, not a business film if it is advertised. Certainly it did not seem like this, if enough historical information was not given and there were some errors. The system of war was devastating. I am very disappointed with someone who gave a good series in Border. Each war was the same as the previous. It was so predictable. (This may be a spoiler.) The whole army goes to climbing, five or so five thousand soldiers each one (also using the same words every time), one of the shooting actors shot, someone crying in style, the actor says, "No That will take 6 men from the battle, "then the actors die. That same thing happens again and again. O, and songs are bad and long. The release of the movie is very great for its own benefit. In spite of this long film, there are no well-designed characters. Employees had many responsibilities of service. All dressed and displayed to be the same. Two of them were mourning. It was very interesting. They moved hands and heads at the same time and then let them dupatta them together. <br /> <br /> The list goes on. I know I'm still forgetting something. Anyways, I think I've made that film enough to get the picture.
