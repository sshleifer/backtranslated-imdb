Yes, in fact, it can be a good movie. The love of the flag, (sorry for the poe license, but not the triangle!) Interesting stories, unfortunately tell them. Images are sometimes wonderful, sometimes similar, the picture looks crowded with thin. Sound requires more caution (it does in Romanian movies), light and color filters are sometimes poorly selected. Voice sound is short and does not provide action. About acting ... sorry but the best actor is landlady. Others do small and cannot convince the viewer. Acting is a poe when it should be true, and really when it should be poetical. It is an image for adults, told by children. Bother just as very curious.
