This movie is likely to be the worst films that I have ever seen in my life - compared to the previous film of the worst-god, "Spawn of Slithis," which I noticed when I was around 10. and ignorance dialog, conspiracy plot, mishmashed cutting scenes, even the music was annoying. I left nothing out? Well, the special effects were not bad - but CGI is not suitable movie. I don't believe that I've actually spent money to see this film. If anyone has contact information for Shiung-rae Shim (director), please send in my user name "on gmail," and I will contact him so that he will need a payment.
