The movie had great potential, unfortunately, came off because of the weak stories / implausible stories, miscasting, and general lack of products / substances. One of the most obvious errors is that Sean Connery, who played with an Arab man, did not know how to mention his Arabic name! This may seem to be a small matter but it explains the lack of effort based on the details. The quality of the act was equal to below average. The grace of saving the grace of grace was moving in a conspiracy at the end of the end; and the French song (I don't remember the name). In general, it was a very bad movie where Sean Connery seemed clear.
