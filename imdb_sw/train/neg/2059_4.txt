The girl's girl is murdered and becomes the target of the second killer. Director Brian De Palma is actually on the list of engaging here: his camera spinning around the museum (after a long time on the painting of the ape), divided into split screens for arty purposes, provides off his compound and sequence (again in division of the screen) where two characters are watching a television program about homosexuals, and its stages (first) ends during the rainy season. "Wearing Kill" is enough, especially because it asks us to swallow a lot and we do not return anything. Most of the acting (except Keith Gordon limited) are mediocre and (second) the latter is the arrangement of "Carrie" of De Palma himself - not to mention "Psycho". Definition of dirty acts is like a Hitchcock spoof, not a respect. Interesting in the winter, the final result is half baking. ** from ****
