This is one of the few events (if not alone) with an impossibility error in his story. When dealing with the situation of Ralphie Christopher says he has heard of Pie-O-My death in a fire accident. This is an important explanation because in this case it is quite clear that Christopher knows from the beginning that Tony is the one who should have killed Ralphie. However there is no way Chris would hear on the accident. Who should tell him and when? When he was closed and dedicated to Tony no one else was informed. Tony knows that - which makes it worse! Hearing Christopher talking about the death of Pie-O-My could cause Tony just to the conclusion that Chris himself has set fire. Due to the very effective writing process as told by the authors on the DVD I am wondering that not one of them found the problem there. The story doesn't work that way. No need to add that I am a great fan of Sopranos. Otherwise, I certainly don't pray.
