I think this might be a good movie, and some of its parts are the same ... but in general it's a movie B. Same about the plot, the part is the same but it has a few holes and tips that don't really add. Working is the same, I've seen more of this too. :) At the beginning it sets the standard, and the vehicles moving in the desert, making "cold" but it returns completely through several terraces (in slow motion! Cool!), As drivers have never been seen before ... It gets better from there, but not much. If you use this tax, get another one and use it as a warm-up. Set lower expectations and can work for you.
