This is another bad movie that you should avoid watching. The plan can be "more" than it really is and will be done better as a blockbuster movie. The actor leaves something needed, although you can't put your finger on what it is. This is one of what you look at on the nighttime TV, perhaps in the United States, because you can't get to sleep. See if you want but don't expect too much.
