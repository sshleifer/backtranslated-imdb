Does anyone think that this show helps some people, or just encourages people who look at it? when I go through the way and come on this show half of check out morbid curiosity. I understand that pat Roberson is not all together. what I do not know if his audience is like him or whether they are good people and they think they will have a better life if they listen to what he says. Pat Roberson is a few results. he is an old man who thinks in the past. The fear of judgment is not the same as it was (thank God). now if someone would like to answer my question I will have dodging electric bolts for another period of eternity.
