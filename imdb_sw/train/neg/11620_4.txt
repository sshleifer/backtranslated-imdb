I paid more than 1 because I thought there were some ethical studies in this story and prompted the ideas and opinions from my wife and I. Acting and discussion were mediocre and I must admit that I came out feeling like I was hit on the head with this God , God and Christ are our Savior's things. Movie and story line did not require. If, as I am, you are a Catholic or a Christian who is there to avoid this will make you look. The movie did a good job to show a narrow line between being a good citizen and how one could be a stalker able to focus on what could be.
