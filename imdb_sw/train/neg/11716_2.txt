After watching this I thought myself, there are also a few good writers and directors or many producers. <br /> <br /> At any rate, this is a bad movie. It is scary in the wrong way, but it makes you have teeth and storms. It gives you the sound "this is correct" on the film. Termination is zero. At the moment most of you are probably mistakenly ill-exploited on the computer with computer computers, etc.. This movie is like it in every element. The only thing on the movie is the little girl Emily, played by Eliza Bennett. I hope he becomes great, and do this. The least thing worth something. <br /> <br /> Do you own grace. Don't look at this. There is not even a proper step in it. Total waste of time.
