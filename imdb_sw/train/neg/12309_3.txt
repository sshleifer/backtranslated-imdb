This was a desperate movie. Considering life â€” army life is always good for laugh & star, this movie would fall laughfest. It was worth several bottles, better. Steve Martin has been more funnier than this and it seems that Dan Ackroyd should be connected with great responsibilities, where he can follow Robin Williams and one day winning Oscar.
