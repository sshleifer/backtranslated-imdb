It is not surprising that many who wanted it did not make this film. It's just plain of ignorance and shy look. Bad actors read the verses of cheesy when the gold showroom of shiny gold develops around the diner which looks more like a Disneyland impression. The fighters are fighting with the head who had attacked himself as he tries to stop them from setting fire to the image of humanitarian warfare. Errors of Watts and cast ... ugh ... 10? Dermot Mulroney tries to waste while doing with Maria Hartman looking like a sad smile since 'Mr. Sardonicus'. Noah Wyle reads Bob Dylan lyrics for the evil teacher and the pointer to move and lift a very bad face. Virgin Rick Schroder is caught in the baby's rocket last night before entering the service. Silly, school girls who dress up and walk on 'Shindig' seconds, sing to the key, and actually make it big in the music business. And who wrote this powerful dialogue: "I'm going to Burkley and wearing flowers in my hair" .... "I think I've found someone to buy a stick!" .... "These people are" animals "!" "These people are my" family "as Shirelles sing" Mama Said ". funny.
