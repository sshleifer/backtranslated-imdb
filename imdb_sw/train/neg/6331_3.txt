Mr. Mike was perhaps a good shepherd of all time, so I was determined to see what he could do to control the total creativity on the movie. Sadly, it is not known, though not because the joke is not funny - some (I can say more) among them is, and in fact Mr. Mike did a good job translating its unparalleled intellectual boundaries into the hair. The stress is that technical quality (sets, lights, sound, editing, call) is so God-bad, the movies cannot fail. Some option called "PKO Productions" receives credit to generate, but does not appear to be produced at all; looks more like Mike stole one of the cameras from SNL to set and do the whole thing during the day. I am aware of Mike's goal to tackle the audience, but even that deserves the basic standards, such as the ability to see, hear or understand anything that should be surprising. Still, the DVD is not a general waste: it includes eulogy for O'Donoghue and Bill Murray and the "Favorite Story Stories" of Mr. Mike "from SNL. In addition, the part of the "swimming pool" of the movie is a great place to be checked if you want to evict someone out. 3/10
