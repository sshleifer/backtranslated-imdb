This sword-and-the-story of the "hero" of cruel and brutal war against the evil king is worthless in almost every detail. Acting is awesome from leading to the role of support. To bring, the delight of the player which the director shows the blood to beat the hero around it is absolutely disgusting; nor is he redeemed by any right because of him, for he is as evil as a warrior. The Z-film editor is a lot, including the area where the character "dies" from the sword has completely destroyed it! <br /> <br /> The movie is open bank on the charm of women leads, Barbi Benton and Lana Clarkson, who have surrounded around more naked in the movie. As a 20-year-old man, I do not pretend that the female body on the screen is not interesting. But the treatment of their characters is very serious and sex events are normal and fun, that I can enjoy even this feature of the movie. Most movies of this time's effort can be purchased somewhat with the heart of the light, the tongue-and-cheerful feel (good is the best in this regard), but DEATHSTALKER seems to take it seriously as a fantasy of the hero . No! Avoid at all costs! <br /> <br /> Testing: 1/2 of ****.
