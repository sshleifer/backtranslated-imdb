I, like many other Bachchan fans, have been waiting for the amazing remake of Sholay. This movie was not so. Thank you God did not stop using the name "Sholay" in the title of the film. Ram Gopal Remake is not recommended for name. The function of cameras, places, clothing, dancing at all of the place, all the collective dialogue to make the worst film I saw. You wonder if the actors agreed to make this film because they needed money and Ram Gopal was paying a lot of money for the cast. The only actor who is not paid, ant, was just the same as the first movie. Abishek's role was quite ridiculous, he needed money to pay a wedding for Ash? Save your money, your mind and your time, don't bother with this film or DVD when it comes out.
