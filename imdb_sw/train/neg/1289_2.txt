This was new at all down between the west. The writing is very bad, the characters were not able to emphasize and because it is disgusting or hateful, violence is surprising and technically not very judged. And Tobey Maguire shows us beside his talent, sleeping by his part with those voiceless words and that the raspy sound of it which here betrays onlyismism. 'Panda and the devil' are among my five worst experiences ever, in the west should not be diminished with a bad reputation.
