Although I can see the characteristics that can redeem in this film through the conflict, I really thought that the typical nature of the pain through the structure of the area you had played was too much to ask for many viewers. The big holes in such screens such as has never been described "your father died today" views and mother made it more difficult to try to mean the meaning of these characters. It got the first place in Cannes in 2001 which is amazing to consider. Perhaps the French were filled with hunger for film films that year and they were desperate for something like this film. I understood the long-term events as a viewer to keep viewer as possible but at the same time not being able to relate to the main character went far away from me and protected me from weapons far from the story. This is a film for only a fan of a film film and someone who expects no fun from watching the film immediately. I loved movies such as "Trainspotting" or "Requiem for Dream" - which were most confused but at least gave the viewer a way to edit and inspire. Watching these teachers slowly and silent scene scene after the event just being so redundant that I found it to stimulate - and I wanted to really like this film for each side.
