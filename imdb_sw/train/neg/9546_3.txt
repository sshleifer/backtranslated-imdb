If you thought that nature from 83 was bad then try modern modernization. Can you be the worst you ask? Well ... at least in the first you had Ally Sheedy emerging in the sports bra. Other than updated graphics, modern modern themes (such as terrorists), modern weapons and new sound for sexy Ripley unfortunately this is the same sad tired story. Anyone who saw the first can see where the next place / line in the story was going. And for anyone who didn't see the first ... well consider yourself lucky that you just look at once. Perhaps over the past 23 years Hollywood will try again.
