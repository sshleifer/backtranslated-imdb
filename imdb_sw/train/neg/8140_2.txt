I saw this movie on the science fiction show when it is called "Live night". That title is much less lost than "Batpeople". In fact it will be more precisely called Batperson. This movie is about a doctor who learns the bats I think because he wants to make the best treatment of rabies. This is not quite clear. It is clear that he and his wife visit the cave and gets beaten with bat. Why a scientist needs to visit bats is more than me. You should not be able to enter yourself. Well after asking him and his wife to go on their honey journey where he starts to be good. They go to the worst doctor. The boy sits in the hospital and kills the nurse. Finally the guy kills 3-4 people and his wife stands with him and you should be rooted for him instead of sheriff investigating.
