I was hoping that this film would be a relaxing recreation, like other forms of its kind. However, I was blind and had no laugh at all. Look at the HBO, perhaps, or if you have a free tax deduction and you need a movie to pass the time. But I don't recommend paying to see it. <br /> <br /> The program is simple and straightforward, and can be funny, perhaps, if the script was excellent. Jason Lee can be hilarious, and gets a few laughs here and there, but the movie falls flat. Just don't go see this. Redirect is missing, but why, leading is not necessary. I think its main pullback is that it's not just very funny. See something else, don't waste your time here.
