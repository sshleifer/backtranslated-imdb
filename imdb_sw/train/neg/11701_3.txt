Just another example of why the books of Stepehn King should not be made in the movie. (Even Carrie, one of the best, has been destroyed in comparison from the book to the screens.) The basis of the story surrounds the oil lawyer, always on the food, who "accident" kills an old gypsy woman. In court, with the help of a judge and local police chief, he is leaving, although the accident was a form of his fault because he was not careful when driving. The woman's dead gypsy woman puts a curse on 3, with our main character, Billy (lawyer) to get quick and slow for the day. Although the movie has been taken by the book, in many places, and has your last king ended, the act was closed and felt it had been forced. We went from one place to another without anything in the middle, as well as the practical reading in play. King himself made cameo in the movie (type like Dave Barry), which reinforces my belief that the authors should just sit: the authors. Leave acting for executives. It's not that anyone in this film was great. I have seen great characters in movies where they were better.
