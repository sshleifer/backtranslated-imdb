In fact I expected this plan for two reasons; I loved Jan Michael Vincent and I am a nut nut and have a great deal of love and helicopter. I don't like this app because it takes fantasy to an unreliable level. The world speed record for helicopters was installed at 249 mph and Westland Lynx several years ago. The only chopper that was ever faster was Lockheed AH56A's experiment in the 1960s. <br /> <br /> In short, no helicopter can fly over 275 because of the rotary flight plan. With Bell 222, the "actress" shown on Airwolf was not very fast even with helicopters. And it did not stay in production for too long. There was a film that came out of this time called "Blue Thunder" which was more realistic.
