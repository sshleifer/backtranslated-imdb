Really shows that the hype is not everything. It is shown by what an abhishek enjoyer is and is only filming for his father and wife. Amitabh as always established. Ajay Devgan as always is shitty and useless and a new person is joke. The leading woman is losing as an actor. The pathetic film from a respected director and from the big industry. For movies as I have reduced the amount of bollywood movies I look at. RGV has made too many movies now. Time to find different actors. Hrithek anyone? Sound requires the needs of Madhuri and Kajol back. Every other woman who leads is half of honey wants to be. Pffffft.
