It is one of these traditional dance songs, and I do not see where all this is not 'evil' that comes out. Acting is awesome, follows the same story as all the other 'playing' movies out there. It's awesome! The name should shout and do not look at it. 'How he move.' Since the names of the film can ignore the grammar? At least some of the dance movies had half-dance pictures, these are not even worth an hour. I offer 1 out of 10, because there is no zero. I always ask anyone with an IQ of more than 60 without looking at this, and not losing your money. 1.6 / 10 should tell all. This movie is not recommended to be even made.
