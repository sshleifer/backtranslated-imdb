This movie is awesome. The story involves a woman trying to find out what happened to her sister. The film is subject to its identity, based on Noir / excitement for destruction, and the fear of the scourge of good measurement. The film has a very frustrated structure, for example with regular use of publications without linking these in the story. This program is not progressing well, and this characteristic has been difficult to distinguish between who has played. Some implausibility are available in many films, but the area where the main protagonist goes voluntarily to the usual guest in his home, then accepts to go to the apartment alone (where he says he will get a phone), removing the guns he brought with him, called Police, was very difficult to believe. Some of the movie shows are very poor: we were looking at a 42 "TV" so how anyone who had a small set could work in the events that were taken in the darkest closest to me. In general, the confusion of chaos.
