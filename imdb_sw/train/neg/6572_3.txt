In my opinion, this film's title should be changed from "Just Courage" and "All About Lane". I went to this film observation a few months ago and I was disappointed with the results. Although, I am grateful that the director made a film about 442 men - something that was worthy to handle the film industry - work in some parts of the film was very strong. Marc Dacascos's exhibition, Tamlyn Tomita, and Jason Scott Lee were all older. However, the director should not set himself as the main character in the movie. Chapter Sorry, you're not just an actress. Put in what you do well in - the work of the show. Gina Hiraizumi's performance in this film was also awesome. She should never be given a chance to talk to her looks unlikely to play part of Miss Nisei's Queen. There were other young actors in films who were very good and their performances were extraordinary ... Why were they not done for that role? Another big problem with this film was interactive action. The Japanese and American soldiers do not seem like they were fighting the German soldiers ... not leaving anyone. Certainly this was a low-cost budget, but since this was a war-torn film, it is not necessary to show some real fight? This film was a worthy attempt, but it certainly is not suitable for mass distribution.
