It took 9 years to complete this film. I would like to think that within 9 years someone could say, hey, this film is awesome. I found it best to act on porn movies. The story is tired and played. The child of abuse returns to be a murderer. How about something new to change. Is the child used as a street? At least this would be a new one. Why does everyone with a camera and film ideas (extraordinary film ideas) think they can be a director? I enjoy the fact that they kept this film for 9 years to get it. That shows loyalty and spirit. For this type of car in the future hope can put it on the best script. If you want to see a failed attempt in an indie film from the author / director from Michigan to see a minute of hate. If you want a good movie from the author of Michigan / stick director and the wicked.
