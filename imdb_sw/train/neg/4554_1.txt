Bingo is a game, the name of the bullshit is the name. Regular screen locks and hodgepodge hit the theory of the plot of half of the bread, powdered puritan, and gibberish of new age. Many of the stories are placed on Viciente, the rest of Cristian in the Peruvian jungle. Imagine Rivendell's Tolkien meets with the Star Trek Plate, owned by the supporters of dimwitted of the most mysterious, non-surprising ritual of love and peace. Thanks to the sharp efficiency and bright design of the production (the color of the rainbow "amazing" energy is quite hideous), "The Celestine Prophecy" is seen and you feel like lost in the 1980s "Twilight Zone". True mistakes about church history and emerging names. I can't believe Hector Elizondo admitted to be part of this. Perhaps it was released without his consent, the Bowfinger style. The Lord be merciful to the director, the author of the picture, the author of the novel, and the poor souls who see the movie or read the book.
