I can't believe how they are not available for this film. It's like watching a police academy, but it includes people who don't know what they're talking about, and ... Call them, there is a stupid robot that should be a sidekick. I can understand the suspension of unbelief, but this is a complete ignorance. Not only is the plot of this movie. It is like looking at someone pretending to be a doctor, giving us non-medical words as if they were the head of staff at the main treatment center. With people dressed in clothes that should not be the design of the space. I feel like I am watching the girls' b-b "b, in space.
