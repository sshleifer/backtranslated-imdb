Many people seemed to love the film, so I feel very bad to comment. But after staying for 96 minutes of that, I feel I must do that. Where is heck a plot in this film? I must lose, waiting for the opening story and nothing happened. Indeed secrecy is "somewhat amazing" but they did not build it. I forgot who was half the time, so they did not develop characters. Acting was so-so, it was often reliable, but I was able to see it at all times. So ... without giving anything away, I must say that unless you like characters in the film, there is no real reason to watch this film. I could be wrong, but I didn't understand why there was so little, or too many films. I can't decide who will be, so I tell the judge themselves. I don't know even if the lease would be a good idea, cost and all ... <br /> <br /> Plot: 0/10 Characteristics: 1/10 Acting: 2/10 Total: 3/10 I feel that that's the best, I keep my vote on.
