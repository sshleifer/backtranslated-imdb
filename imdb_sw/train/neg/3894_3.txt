Good Man of Smoke Mix has as an extended part of The Six Million Dollar Man, but with violence and dirt. I know this film is a little crummy but I have seen it impossible not like it. <br /> <br /> Acting with the script is not the best. But the effects are good for the 30-year-old movie and the $ 50 budget - the head attitude takes quite some time to mix but when it does it is amazing; we also have one area of ​​death involving electrocution. The note is also music, it is insane - a medley of cheese-tastic of anxiety. Highlights of interesting things: <br /> <br /> * Interesting for a slow motion nurse who jumps through the glass panels for any reason at all. It is a surprise and day in the life of the cut head. <br /> * Beware of humanoid of melt of psychological damage. He called Steve. <br /> <br /> * Plan a surprise when our hero will take a break from the midday hunt to have a soup bowl and complain about a sufficient kitchen player. <br /> <br /> This movie is just 70 of me hate. It's tacky and trashy but I thought it was a lot of fun. You can do a lot more.
