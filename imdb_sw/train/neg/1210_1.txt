Where to start ... Yes, Messages to bad people: When you first get someone to follow (to kill) who saw the crime you did, do not spend time talking to him to have another chance to leave. Message to the victim: When the strokes speak between themselves and talk, use this opportunity to "RUN AWAY", do not hesitate and watch until you hear what they hear. Message to the Director: If someone has a 5 or 10 minute head to start a car or on foot, you can't have bad people on the heels or finish! time and motion do not work that way. It would also be nice to think that a woman does not kill brutally (4) men to help stop the bad relationship at home.
