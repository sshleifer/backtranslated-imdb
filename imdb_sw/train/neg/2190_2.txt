** Spoilers Possible Before ** <br /> <br /> Jason (a.k.a. plants) Evers is a brilliant brain surgeon who, along with Virginia Leith, is involved in a major car accident crash. Leith declines and the doctor takes half of his house and raises his head in his laboratory. Outside the house was allegedly closed to the Tarrytown property of Lyndhurst; The laboratory events seemed to be hit on someone's floor. The bandaged head is stored in "laboratory equipment" which is close to low cost for Ed Wood. Some library music? High level of the movie? Later he turned into Andy Milligan's BODY BENEATH. The head of Leith has a great metaphysical discussion and another of the misrires Ever, mutant chains in the closet. At the same time, the good doc is looking for the desired ingredients for the body of his wife's sauce. Finally, in the abnormal muscles, it includes a time-of-time splatter and despair when a monster with a zukini head comes out of the closet to bring the film around. This took three years to open and then, the audience gave us a very bad reception. Out of this, PLAN 9 FROM THE GREAT EXECUTIVE AND A few others, 1959 would have been announced in Turkey.
