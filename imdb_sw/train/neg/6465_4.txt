From Charles this is a decent but this is a good performance base. Marlon Brando stands out. There is a subplot and Mira Sorvino and Donald Sutherland who forget to develop and hurt a little film. I'm still trying to figure out why Charlie wants to change his name. Each film and "Charles" has been very bad.
