This is the second time I have heard it and forced to comment on imdb about the film. At first it was for the most beautiful movie I saw and that was for Memento. To see the Darkwolf is the other side of the size compared to Memento, as on the worst film had a bad luck to see. Apart from two incidents of naked women there is nothing in this film to lift it from the garbage basket. <br /> <br /> Let's see, adverse effects, script published, the worst acting and about 90 minutes too long. My wife and I laughed in many ways to disbelieve it. Surprisingly I looked up to the end, how I did that I don't know! FINDA !!!
