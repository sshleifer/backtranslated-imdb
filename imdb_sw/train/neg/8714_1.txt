I can just stop laughing !! This movie is very fantastic and stupid! But, don't worry that, it's very fun! In this film, you don't need to pay attention to anything! Acting is the same - LAME! Dinosaurs are the same - RUBBER (Oh, my I was able to see a stick with a T-Rex head for a short time.) Raptors are similar to Carnosaur 2, T-Rex is also the same, but ... in some cases its head appears kinda is covered and looks like some kind of project failure from kindergarten. The action is urgent, sometimes very quickly, in fact I am talking about quick editing, editing it very quickly, so we can't see the ball dinosaurs, but OOPPS! for the delay, they are the ball! Well, the only interesting things here are to see Rick Dean in this sequel. I can say ... don't rent ... look at TV, and friends, it's a lot more entertainment!
