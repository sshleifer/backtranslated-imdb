The sophisticated, insignificant, irresponsible, is not the last proof that the world can forget about Danny Boyle and its "Trainspotting" films: "Beach" has already taken care of it. What low-budget behavior is just getting its place among those who started very well but were completely lost in drugs, additions, ego, self-deception, bad leadership or anything that was causing the immediate destruction of the director. The cluster is amazing: the two lost (Ecclestone and Bimbo Jenna G - the journalist, perhaps) meets the opportunity and voluntarily start singing and more fervor to the residents of the reserve session than the ability to make decisions. duo - which they have. Their friend - the greatest literate reader - becomes their manager by hitting the shop window and stealing the video camera that he beat in the "action", then shows the tape to other music people who show interest in this trash. Now, I know that Britain in recent years has put a strange junk, but this is folly; The music makes Oasis seen as Beatles. During the radio studio, duo - Strumpet - changing lyrics in each take and Ecclestone in large quantity tells the guy guys to take or leave, and quite absurdly they take. Not only the general music and garbage damage, but its "artists" are anti-social; THE WORKERS should be calling for shots. It's too dumb. It's very clear. The talk is not required and goes anywhere, and this hog-of-bitches story is useless and useless. It often feels that it is done well - under the influence of drugs. Danny Boyle is a perfect idiot. A small piece of garbage is bad is a shameful look. I.Q. of Ecclestone. it also needs to be asked to accept that part of this lie. Anyone who donated this Â£ 1000 donation should leave the cinema before they finish selling their own clothes on the street corners.
