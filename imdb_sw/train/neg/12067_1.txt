You know the film will not go well when John Carradine explains (a.k.a. reads a script & plot synopsis) on a funeral procession of his character, just 5 minutes on the movie. The quotation is its last character and bond. It says that his property is divided between children and his servants. 4. Children will divide $ 136 million equivalent, but if anyone should die then that part is divided between the remains. If all children have to die then it is divided among servants. To be eligible, they have to live in family property for a week. It looks like a common plot of real show. <br /> <br /> There is a little bit of text about the status of Traders. They are a strong and powerful family, but the real problem begins with the sinking of the dog. From the opening voice by John Carradine you expect this film will cause the game of Machiavellian cat and mouse to finish moving. It is a slow and useless journey. We are going through a minute to watch people sitting around, playing pool, throwing arrows, misusing "through a bowl of fish", a great conversation between people wearing silk dresses, regular combat, unofficial acrobatics, amazing memorable sounds The faux-German expression, the horrible fears of the 4th grade and the fastest designs. All of these lead to the end and absence. You will be happy to be still alive, but the pain can be very serious to carry alone. Share children, share. Rehabelite Rehab
