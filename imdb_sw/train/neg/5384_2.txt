All hype! The best way to describe films about people who are angry because they can't get their films through an ordinary distributor? So, they do it themselves. Otherwise, the sense of film has no right to content in the film. Story does not exist and can be easy. Acting is poor, but animation and music are very good. Otherwise don't waste your time - don't believe it! However, if you have the opportunity to see the film free of charge, do so. Then you won't need to lose money. Yet, the creators of the film do their best to develop their stories and create publishers for their mini-delivery series. Otherwise, they are one of the incredible wonders that will never be hit.
