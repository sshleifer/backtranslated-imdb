This is an artistic film made in 1969 or 1972 (National Film Preservation Foundation says in 1969 and IMD says 1972). Regardless of the actual date, the film seems to be an indication of this general period - and the camera functions and pop art art that have been in the early 60 - early years of 70 years. <br /> <br /> Film has three simple pictures that are corrupted using different weird cameras. These distorted images are accompanied by music and there is absolutely no dialogue or plot of any kind. This was clear as it was as a form of artistic performance, and as a more functional art, it is interesting for the first time but it quickly becomes tiresome. The film, to make it more transparent, is the total weight and will not appeal to anyone but perhaps those who have made the film, their family and friends and perhaps only a few people hip and "with it" understood by us humans.
