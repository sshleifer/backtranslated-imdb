Former director and producer Allan Dwan, whose great string of films comprises quite completely and often displayed (for example, John Wayne in the "Sands of It Jima") tried his hand at the great music and "I Dream of Jeanie." Linking the song of the most experienced filmmakers and, as it has changed, almost no future, gave a false story and no small story of hate about the author of the great US writer, Stephen Foster. Bill Shirley is a little, lovestruck Foster whose kindness to slaves includes giving money saved to pay for the hospital pay for a young injured boy. His intention is Inez McDowell (Muriel Lawrence) who a little younger sister, Jeanie (Eileen Christy), knows slowly that she likes and very few smith. Foster is in love with Inez who is angry with the 1-year-old Tune Parade Hit, "O Susannah." Enter the player Edwin P.Christy (Ray Middleton) to support the launch of the phases of Foster work. This is for the early nine-year music film, the largest production. The set is amazing in the special Special way to show fake and all trimmings. The singers are not half bad and Foster songs are not possible to destroy <br /> <br /> But this is also a real white antebellum.

Do these black showings around the reality, observers will be convicted for the intervention by the profitable organization. <br /> <br /> "Jeanie's dream" seems to fit into the studio of the studio without surprising death. It has now been raised by Alpha's Video for $ 4.99 only a piece of time and the most exciting and tragic songs on the victims of the largest US crime, slavery. This was what Hollywood was producing two years before Brown v. Education Board. You must convince the hearts of other people who wore a bed linen at the theater.
