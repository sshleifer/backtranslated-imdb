One of the most disgusting films I ever saw. I wanted to vomit after watching it. I saw this movie in my American History class and the purpose was to see to promote the life of the Western farmer in the late 1800s. Oh, and at the end there was a single birth of a calf and I would like to tell you that the birth itself was not too bad, but much of the water that came out brought many people to my class in the bathroom. The story itself was the same. The story of the story is the widow and her daughter and they move to the west to be the guardian of this cowboy's house. They live a life of trouble and is a spectacular view of life in the West in the late 1800s. But if you have a choice, don't see this film.
