Nut case is killing college students, does a new teacher stops spiritual? I don't believe, you don't care. With the title of the University of Splatter, one collects that this movie is not a top art. But worse than Splatter University do not even reach amusing garbage. Splatter U is very bad - the story does not mind, the characters are thrown-away, and the whole movie does not have any idea of ​​the imagination. Without saying no doubts or sky or horrible. This driver is not even enough to be thrown to any dirt (for cheaper fun of both). Therefore, next to this unstable slasher, it offers anything through entertainment (even fragrant) and it is a full birth. Under the people of the barrel - even the death of the fans of the slasher will need to think twice before watching, then alone pay money for this flick. <br /> <br /> BOMB out of ****
