I thought before starting with these movies that could be good, but when I started and I found it very bad. They said the movie is being done in Afghanistan but I think 95% of the movie is beaten in India. you can see Indian cars made. you can see lars drink bisleri (Indian water mark), Indian written on the road, you can also see the temple in Afghanistan * hahah * its amazing things and much more that prove that they are not shooting in Afghanistan. I think a person should not waste his time watching this film. The clean time when. I would recommend to do something else rather than watch this film or it might be a heart is a good idea but not to watch this waste of time
