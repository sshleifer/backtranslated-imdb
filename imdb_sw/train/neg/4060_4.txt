CAT O'NINE TAILS (Il Gatto a Nove Code) <br /> <br /> Flash ratio: 2.35: 1 (Cromoscope) <br /> <br /> Sound type: Mono <br /> <br / > (35mm and 70mm prints release) <br /> <br /> Blind journalist (Karl Malden) feels an external laboratory outside the laboratory's genetics laboratory and later includes a colleague (James Franciscus) to explore the series the killing of laboratories, without pretending to love themselves to the mercy of the killer of the mind. Lost in production following the unexpected success of its first world leader BIRD AND PLUMAGE OF CRYSTAL (1969), Dario Argento became pregnant with CAT O'NINE TAILS as a diagram of a giallo in the same line as a precursor his, putting on celebrating Hollywood actor Karl Malden - clean from his appearance PATTON (1969) - with a starring Franciscus star (THE VALLEY OF GWANGI). Unfortunately, the film that causes - which advertising claimed to be 'ten times more than to emphasize' than "Birds" - is to follow for desperation, to be photographed and styled, but also plodding and does not mean general use. <br /> <br /> Malden and Franciscus are very visible in compassionate roles, and the movie singer Enrico Menczer (TIME TIME) uses a cromoscope pan to bring the hi-tech world where the dark environments of Argento continue, but a small component involving Catherine star of Euro Spaak (LIBERTINE) if the romantic interest of Franciscus is a little more than an unwanted padding. The highlights include the unforgettable encounter with a black-colored killer at a crowded railway station (edited by a sleek guarantee by a video group of Franco Fraticelli), and a part of the night that Malden and Franciscus are looking for an important clue into the grave and falling for prey killings. But despite the brightness of the watch, the film runs gently from one place to another, standing quietly without actually coming to the boil. It is not surprising that the "Cat" has failed to replicate the flight "flight" when it was released in 1971. <br /> (English version)
