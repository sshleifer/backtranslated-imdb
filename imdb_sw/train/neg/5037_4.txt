Plot = Melissa is a new girl in the city, she is fifteen years old and her birthday comes for one week. Since Melissa is good, every young man in the city wants to come to her, but a few who can get her interests to secretly die. Since honest reasons I really wanted to watch this film is because Dana Kimmel's Friday Pt's 13 was in it which is not a good reason to run and see the movie. When I started looking, I found that "Sweet Sixteen" is not very good, it is very real and stimulating and fair does not go anywhere. After more than an hour, only three murders occurred and the story has never been made in any way possible. Movie looks good and beautiful pictures and good guides but as with many other slasher comes from 80 years, the movie is experiencing extremely dark sometimes. Acting is very good though Melissa's attitude is easy to listen to, although she is a perfect slut. The line of the story is not quite garbage but it is the only way to get you interested, the only things I liked was Melissa she was stunning and Dana Kimmel who is really sweet and beautiful in this film. <br /> <br /> All in a very fine flick slasher flick which does not go anywhere I would definitely without suggesting for fans of Slasher.
