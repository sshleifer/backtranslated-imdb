The DVD version consists of two passages, the Caesar parricide in juncture. In addition, the language was Spanish without subtitles. Therefore, it is difficult for me to explore this film because because I didn't understand what was said. <br /> <br /> Cleopatra is a historic icon, part is very complicated and I've found that for a visitor, Leonor Varela looks just. He needs power but also a very supportive spirit. Timothy Dalton as Caesar is perfect and their love is the main thing of the first part. Therefore, it is not a real document, not a story but a great love. <br /> <br /> After the parricide, the new partner comes (Marc-Antoine) but the taste has gone: we always remember our first love. Therefore, I have found the second part of evil and their evil destiny has not been told to power. However, production is elegant: the set is large, decorated with taste; Morocco lives in an unfamiliar area and clothes are very beautiful. Producers have a lot of money for sure, but they don't use anything on special effects. They are poor (blue screens, ships, Sphinx) that are funny. At the end, I would like to hear in French or English in order to make sure the views on these two movies.
