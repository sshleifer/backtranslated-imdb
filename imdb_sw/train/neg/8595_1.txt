Lucy Alexis Liu and Cillian Murphy are the best actors, who certainly can increase any challenge to implement. Unfortunately 'Checking Spies' (2007)' provides just one for all actors and viewers: it's not sleep at the time of an intellectual, highly predictable and unreasonable story. Watching Trackers (2007) 'tries to be complicated, but comedy is forced, it is highly targeted to the end of the full shock. <br/> <br /> After one-third of the film is still nothing that can catch even many viewers, such as the friends of the director and their relatives, even they explained, without actually telling the truth. I am sure everyone who wanted to do it or had to do it as an old Neil girl did when she showed him the old B&W film he could not take care of. 'Checking Trackers' (2007)' does not exist anywhere near the group B, falls somewhere between Q&R, like-scripts? and - Blocking questions! The director knows what he does! In fact, if his aim was to kill the viewer die, he has done a very good job! Looking at the explorers (2007) 'was the perfect waste of time for Lucy Alexis Liu and Cillian Murphy, to refrain from letting you waste your time! Rating: 0 out of 100.
