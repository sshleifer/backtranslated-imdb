If you can or do not feel, there is no real fighting between vampires or zombies in this film. One can then ask why the head suggests such a thing, but in fact it is the right kind because there is nothing else about this film that made any sense. There was no story or plot, just things happening. Acting was very bad, worse than the safeauto business. Not only was there a clash between vampires and zombies but I think there was only one event with zombies even in it. Their decision was seen as used by a 8-year-old girl. The area was normal and departs and showed one of the characters fighting zombies away and hitting the hedge (I do not know) but they used the effects of the syringe. This is undoubtedly the poorest movie I ever seen in my life. The only circumstance that I cannot totally curse anyone involved in the production of this film is as if I have learned that it was completely released at age 11. However, even with all the opposition I give here, I would like to watch this film only based on the fact that it could be a bad movie more ever, and because of this is quite comical. Even just counting errors in it should keep you.
