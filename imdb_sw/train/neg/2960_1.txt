That is, of course, one movie the worst one made. No move here. This is it. End of the story. Myths are young and moral moral, seemingly created by three-year-old was fascinated by dinosaurs. The whole concept is just plain dumb. It is impossible for a person to come up with something stupid and think it was entertainment. Jokes are also completely disabled. If you haven't seen this film yet, consider yourself lucky. If your curious morbidly of how bad this movie is, please don't make me explain. Words cannot explain how this movie is quite bad. This is not just bad as being a bad movie. Even those who have a partnership, if not worth the entertainment. This. . . This is. . . Ugh! Think of the worst story chosen and multiply the extent of its evilness by 5,000, and it's not yet close to how this movie was bad. After issuing a single Pokemon logo, giving this feature of the film looks like a few things of love. That's very bad. Are producers and directors even taking film classes? Because this is a perfect example of how to make a film. It looks like a color-colored player made this film. If you rented this, please return and request a return. And don't think about hiring again.
