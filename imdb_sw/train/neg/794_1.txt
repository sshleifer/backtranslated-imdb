Unless you have already learned with pop stars who become stars in this film, set yourself up and don't read this after you reach the end of the next sentence. DO YOU WELCOME TO USE THE FILM AND TO LOOK AT THE ELSE SOMETING. But if you insist on reading, think: <br /> <br /> Driving with a young Japanese image of a young "living" caused out of time that cannot fail until you shout. <br /> <br /> Nothing in this film is suitable. It is an endless series of people who describe different emotions, from joy to anger, from joy and tragedy, to NO VISION OPTIONS. We can see definitely something big "surprising" happening, but we can't give an event of reasons because there is no backstory. <br /> <br /> When this film is over, you will be sick and tired of the faces of stupid, lanky stars, girly hair. You will be rebellious by spending all the time watching the smile, sneer, crying, looking secret, being "bad," and other useless words they hit on the face. You are going away until you mention this piece of laziness as "soul" of any of its "executives" should have you over the shadow of the fact what the trailer and the comments of not having much comment on this site they will not tell you: "Children who repent," meaningless people will love this film, many of them young girls with pathological worship for anything else. Freud would have a day of field. Unless you are one of these "uninformed" fans, keep in hell away from these abominations.
