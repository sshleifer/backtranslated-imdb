Someone needs to send this Uli Lommel guy to return to MOVIE SCHOOL. Who ever told him He knew how to make a film? Can only anyone make movies on these days? In the past, it is always required TALENT before someone can make a film. After watching this BTK-disabled movie and others he did, it seems obvious that the poor guy has about many business making movies like me. I really think I could make movies better than LAME-ALL. This film can never do with the BTK killer, except the names of the victims and the killer. That's it. Where did this person get the great idea that BTK killed people with mice and other crap on the film? This is a typical example of someone trying to persuade people to watch their movies according to the word "BTK" because of the features that have been successful. Unfortunately. Just a movie killer that I would consider WORSE is that the "DAHMER" film is mature. The child pulled a lot of cigarettes and made me cheaper. Anyone who made it needs to be shot.
