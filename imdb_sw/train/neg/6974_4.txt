The blue Monkey is actually mentioned in the film but not in any way that makes any sense possible. At the same time, other children walk to the depths, to explore. They start talking about what they get down and one of them (the girl) says she likes to find a blue monkey. Yes, yes, that's it. In general it is not available for the story, just a sad relationship to the head, and there is no idea why he would think he could find a blue monkey in a hospital warehouse. I am ashamed to remember but someone should remember to think!
