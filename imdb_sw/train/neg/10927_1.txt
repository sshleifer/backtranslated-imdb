The review of this film was very hot when expectations were on the sky: a large budget, tons of popular faces, a funny idea and a great executive everyone likes. The end result is disaster. The amazing journey of Alice Tremblay is fascinating in a fantasy world that fails every way to attract the audience (I have never heard of laughter in all the presentation), through a narrow-page story of a story with one dimensional characters without one spark, not a magic sign that liked it fell. 90 minutes of films here are rough and the position of position and other good actors are struggling to come as professionals in an element that certainly cannot be seen that it is a great idea on the set, alone on paper. 'L'Odyss√©e d'Alice Tremblay' is a collage of comic drawings, linked to a layer (very) thin of beautiful ideas. Avoid or perseverance will hate you.
