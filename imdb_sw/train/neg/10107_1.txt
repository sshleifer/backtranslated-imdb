Last weekend I bought this zombie movie from the bar bin and I watched it with other friends thinking it would be the budget version of the "Land of the Dead". <br /> <br /> Boy, I was not wrong. It looks like they used the best part of their budget on the art-art, which greatly distorts the fans of the zombie type. We looked up to the point where zombie chicks come alive and get a car with some yuppie who is in the middle of the talking business anywhere on the mobile phone. In fact they are talking to a young man before the girls kill him; but as soon as they started driving, I couldn't stop my unbelief. Some people feel that the film "bad, it's good", is a liar. I did not finish the film, but one of the other comments says that somehow they become police at the end of the film, which is interesting that I haven't looked at all the way. <br /> <br /> This is worse than "Zombiez" NOT TO SEE!
