I didn't have a great feeling and offering the Dante season 1 in the "Homecoming", it was not a terrible story, but it was a strong political and undead statement. Screwfly's scenario is the story of a world-based virus that leads to human trafficking by women. This period starts well with a short film describing how the way to fly with knives killed by scientists. Then there is a short area where a person is caught when the bodies of women are found at home. I think this should show the beginning of an outbreak, but it is unknown for this reason it has never been rebuilt. This period is going on when you start the blah blah blah. The worst period. Okay, except for chocolate.
