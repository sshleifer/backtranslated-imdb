Wow, this film was just bloody. SO bad indeed that even though I did not pay to see it, I wanted to return my money. <br /> <br /> Movies is not about something known. It is a mish-mash of sci-fi cliche that has been well done by many skilled filmmakers. Exhibitions, especially with the guidelines were high on Ed Wood's delightful kind of way. Commenting on Ed Wood, he could boast of the conversation. It's just taciturn with no hint of irony or feeling of humor. On top of that, it doesn't mean, neither plot, or missing. The vision of seeing is the same, but it's not enough to go "oh wow, it's cool" and they just seem to be healed so that it can be "cool" instead of a good plot. The voice sound was another mishmash of things that didn't put any kind of feeling. Again, it seemed as if the director was just giving songs in the film for the "cooling" effort. It brings me to my last point. Maybe if the director really worries about the plot, story and dialogue instead of trying to "be cool", he didn't want to make a dorky cliche 'of short film. <br /> <br />
