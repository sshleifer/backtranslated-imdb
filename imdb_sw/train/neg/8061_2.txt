I would like to start by saying that Casey Affleck is a very talented actor and I respect his job very much. I wish he was in the most movies that showed his talent. For this he said, The salvation of the soul was a very bad movie, very bad. It's very bad <br /> <br /> I would like to say that I put all blame on the poor script. Affleck is a very talented actor, Wes Bentley had an excellent performance in American Beauty, Melissa Sagemiller did well, and Eliza Dushku is now a girl in Hollywood. I don't think any of the participants has entered the script, and I understand why. Say that this film is of a kind of horror is overstatement. It had a deficit and it turned out you could expect, but did not lead anywhere ... except for the most confused. I have only seen the end of the weather, because it didn't seem to have any meaning or actually answer any questions I have about the story. I would like to give this film a good review, but I can't. For all honesty, the only thing I think you will get scared about this movie is that you paid for.
