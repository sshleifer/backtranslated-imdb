This is a bad decision, the poor remake of the Bimalda of the classic Bineda. The story is based on the book of Sarat Chandra of the same name and is a disruption of nature. Well someone can appreciate a certain degree of creativity but not a creative innovation. Acting with everyone is affected by the whole movie is sham. The choice of Shekar's fatherly misuse of Lolita (Balan) appears to be cheaper and destructive and damages the spirit of the original story. Again the area where Shekhar (Saif) blows Lolita is not far from the flow of films and characters, it is a very paper journal, and could be avoided easily. Also the sex area between Saif and Balan is totally unacceptable to the movie and cheap gimmick to attract the audience. When creative work is not believed in nature and destroys the soul, the work falls off. The song "piyu bole" is exactly the same. Other pieces of silver in the dark cloud of this movie are the area where Saif stands himself and rebel against his father. This is a positive departure from nature and is eligible for a loan. On these shows this movie deserves 3 stars. Song and dance and Rekha is rested and is set. This song is interesting but I remember that I've heard somewhere in the past and if I don't miss the sound it seems to be understandable. Well, they agreed times have changed since then. But then this film is not suitable even in modern time. This is what happens when modern voice-sound developers are increasingly focusing on attracting NRIs and grabbing NRI's entertainment market. The movies take not the Indian property nor any other part of the world.
