This movie is very bad. Acting is very bad except Michael Ironside. I don't find a story. Richard Grieco was the only survivor after a two-stage battle between Mc-two. He comes to the city and is suddenly chosen to fight against the evil people who want the land of India. In the cover he said he was a Indian who also returned to his home-town, I did not hear it in the movie, if so it was not known. Richard Grieco was hell one bad act. Stick and bad. He said his similar lines too. And we would not like to talk about Sean Young, not one of my actors who love very much but in this film plays Indian women who love Bolt (Grieco). He is bright. <br /> <br /> I rented I selected between this and conversion with Amanda Pays. I chose this because Michael Ironside was in the cast. Maybe I should have taken Help. Do not see this unless you think Richard Grieco looks hard on motorcycles and sun glasses. <br /> <br /> I will pass on the list of cast because I have home. I wrote after seeing the film.
