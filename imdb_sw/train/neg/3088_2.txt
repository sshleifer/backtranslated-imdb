The Scummy nightclubs look like bad diners. "Scummy" staff twice as Fontanelles players (how did they talk in this?) Who can only make the bad moves of the 60s dance. A mysterious dream that Rambo.

However, I have found it worse, and the title to fight the area is pure gold, free or otherwise. 2/10 - Jaws 4 was bad then this. At least the film has not found itself.
