It is not just the most expensive Canadian film ever hit BC, but much more difficult, it never gets the light of day. The director even even Canada, but the UK, and the boy shows. We have all been made to a group of dope fiends and more sex morons. The Spirit's sense that Canada does not exist, and this should be the reason we fund this bunk. Of course the British character is normal. Others are a typical crop of sitcom - you can say "Norm !!"? Movie shows appear on the photo card cards with local inner silhouettes. Actors always seem to be fidgetting. Have they been attracted to the viewer, or are they the directors of the movie? Avoid this mess and watch some of Bruce Mcdonalds movies. A real Canadian boy with something original to say movies. You cannot be forced to walk on his films after 10 minutes.
