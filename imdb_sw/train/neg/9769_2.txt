Read this Thornton Wilder to play last year in the eighth grade. I also had to stay with this weak interpretation on the screen. I would like to tell you, not to play hard, it's easy to pass, but someone deserves better shot. Acting was lacking, loyalty-faithfulness to God - was seen as outlined on the card by a group of three-year-olds. If that can't be worse, the sound quality is lousy ... there is a buzz of mind-numbing 'every actor speaking ... and also I can't help but beware that the chemistry between George and Emily, well, doesn't exist. All characters seem very worried to be there. No music. It is black and white, which can be the same but it brings more joy. In any case I think that if you are sure to see this film, which I do not like, then don't try your high hopes. Communities, as well as, are probably better.
