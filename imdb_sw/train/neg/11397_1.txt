This was terrible! It had a horrible story, it was not working, and it was like a remake of the dead dead but not too close. <br /> <br /> It took all my honesty to do it this way, it's a good job I didn't visit another toilet of course I would like! This makes the Horror Star House looks like a great Hollywood Epic screen. <br /> <br /> The only value of this film was the ultimate supply of beautiful women. Not bad among them! <br /> <br /> If you want to allow your friends after a night on the beer then this is for you ... maybe avoid as a blow!
