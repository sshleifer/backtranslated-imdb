The silent show of a man who killed his wife by throwing him down while driving and claiming he had lost. Why was he driving? Why does he still feel able to drive after killing his wife one? This question did not happen to the authors. The story testifies to the psychologist and his broken marriage that is locked in the failed marriage of the driver of the wife's wife. A good mother and a good child is healed by a good measure, and all builds up to a predictable grade and a rejection. Are psychological psychologists taken easily? Writing death that executives are doing better, but are punished for failure. This is similar to Harlequin Romance. Don't waste your time looking at this unless you want it.
