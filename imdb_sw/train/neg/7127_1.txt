This movie was bad to say at least !!! Most of the good cars are embarrassed to have shown on this LAME film. It comes with running from L.A. to Las Vegas to be completed in 45H minutes ... in Ferrari F430. I did so in 1HR 50min in a contract of 4cylinder 140HP 1993 Honda Honda. Hardly ... this film does not justify these cars. Obviously these authors are only and may run under the speed limit with their hands @ 10 & 2:00. I remember seeing about how Eddie Griffin hit $ 1.5 million Ferrari Enzo going to 30-40MPH >>> youtube.com/watch?v=cNVrMZX2kms And ... director ANDY CHENG is greater! He brings shame to his own community. I just wonder how many people that just liked the mouth to get in Hollywood. He started on a film showing Asian Americans in a bad way with FALSE. Asian women >> cheap currency letters. Asian men >> lose gamblers of car and strokes that beat all the time. What is the fear of the Asians? Why do you need to show them often in such a bad quotation? I am very sick through Hollywood every time it shows the Asians because of the negative and false.
