I can never forget the com with the great witch of the ORIGINAL movie Vacation! Line, exciting, and timing in the film is the best! However, this European column of holidays is great allowed. <br /> <br /> In this sequel, Griswalds win the European Holiday on the game show. The problem is that most of the jokes in the film are slightly more gentle, "ha-ha" laughs. For example, Aircraft attendant on a plane asks Clark, "You want your Coke in Can?" Clark responds again, "No, I'll be here." That's true on the only line that is amazing in this film. Europe / Europe's vacation is caused. As the authors borrowed all the jokes from the first movie, they tried to restore the original script, and relied on the left-hand discussion of the series of tracks to the end of the image just to kill time. <Br /> <br /> Worse, comic's natural centers like Randy Quaid like Cousin Eddie and the original children who played Rusty and Audrey from the first good movie is not available. Nor are their chances are not funny, they can not act, and just look like they are through the way over time. There are also a few jokes of sex and views that are not just to play, are in bad taste. La Griswald should be located in Wally World. The place that made them a story! Do not join them in this terrible European adventure. Viewers should watch again the original movie of the holiday instead of this! You will be glad you did.
