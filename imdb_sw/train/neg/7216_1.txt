I love the West. I could watch them every day. "Good, Bad, and Bad" is my favorite at all. I looked at "Silverado" for perhaps only eight days because it was installed on CMT. However, this movie, Shilo Falls is undoubtedly the worst West I've ever seen. Acting was awesome everywhere. They don't tell anything at the end of the hidden hidden vision. The only good place I can think is a beautiful girl of cantina. A very long appearance between the conversation seemed deliberate to do when making a film of acceptable length. This movie was not worth the new rental fee I paid on the local rental store. I felt as if I had been stolen and deserving of a refund if there was something like that. The only reason I have finished is because I hate to see the film to the end. I lost half way because it was so bad. For the director, please work better if you decide to do another. This is the kind of film that has the ability to turn people into the West.
