I saw this film on the History Channel today (in 2006). First of all, I realize that this is not a document - it's a drama. But, one can hope that at least the "fact" key that stories can change may be based on real events. Reagan was shot by other characters were real people. The movie got it right. From there, believing on the truth is quickly lost. I have never heard of this film before seeing it. After being a television reporter during these events, I was surprised that I had never heard anything about the wonderful character of the Secretary Haig as described by Richard Dreyfuss. The whole nation was hearing "I am in control ...", etc., but Dreufuss' Haig degrades the full-time cabinet and cannot control. After watching the film, I began to reflect on the internet on the internet and quickly found real voice zones and the details of a lot of the chat room room that this film makes it again. Surprisingly, most of the "facts" of the film said the White House, Secret Service etc. in general chaos - and the national leadership that is actively living and running the world around the nuclear war - does not do the same. Not faithful! There are internal conflicts, be sure. Haig does evil, its media room is historic and caused by "difficult". But nothing is near the screen shown on the film. There are many errors of writing, but comparing the accuracy of the written and written record of this film asks the question why producers were trying to actually complete. Looking at? Understand? Enjoy? I believe failure on all three borders. It is difficult to argue with others, but one must have a great question about what was behind this uninhabited innovation. And, for my dear History Channel's "Reel for Real" track documentary, there was no mention of any issues that were the main focus of the film - ie events within the day of the Shooting Day. Therefore, the viewer remained to research those without much - if any help from the internet.
