To make the film a dark and fuzzy visibility possible to achieve budget deficit is a strategy that is often used in the scary of small budget films, but this takes a lot away. It's SO very good and fits (and amazed almost completely at night, for boot) that often ends around looking at black screens (though maybe a bad transfer of the video can also have something to do with it). Alas, "bad" is also the best word to describe the plot of the movie. Representatives of the film give us the thought of different horizons (and common) without the logic of logic, and half through you get the impression that they just about abandoning efforts to make a good film of fear; you know when you see characters who are supposed to be at risk of death (or, sometimes, even dead) to make a small discussion ....
