Awisha! Absolutely completely! No plot, no point, no end. It seems like the director turned the camera and then all the workers went to lunch. Everyday. I'm trying to give this video away but nobody will take it. I give you 2 instead of 1 because I like Benigni. Roger, I will need to say fingers under this. <br /> <br />
