Please let me forget. Please. Please. This is the worst film I ever had. I think the film is a contempt for my brain and behind me all who suffer from me sitting and watching this film. I haven't seen what the damage has caused to see and my ability to finish the sentence. It's a trash load! And don't let me start about acting ... Someone else please help me forget !! "Amazing science" - return! Everything is forgiven ... bad I can't even believe. Someone came up with an idea and thought it was worthy to be a film? Someone really read the script and decided to produce the film? Someone read the script and checked for it? Someone saw the film and decided * not to put it on the shelves to collect dust for ever? * These are questions that I want answers. It's not a philosophical question about the tree in the forest and well, you know ...
