Wowwwwww, an hour ago and finally I have finished watching this bad movie! I wanted to open it in the first 10 minutes but I thought I would give it a chance because it had to be better. Or at least have some of the features of redemption, as I thought at least it would make you think a kind of film, or like a real sense, or a well done or something. I can't even get into what is terrible because of losing my time explaining that this "may be demolished" ... IMD, you should be calm on something of vendors and pay more attention to ensure that people who make films and comments are not available to write a good reviews or share some kind of film or something like that. I thought it would be exciting after this awesome movie coming to see the worst hoe rating would have been so shocked to see the top high score ... all the points with 7-10 stars clear must be on some of ALL movie pictures. I am still a big fan of IMD, but think deeply about this rating process because this film should be tested no higher than 3 maaaybbbeee.
