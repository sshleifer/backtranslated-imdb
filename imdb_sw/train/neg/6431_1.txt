This movie is the worst misconception and misleading which was put together with many shy lunatics to work on a TV movie. The story is correct and full lie. There is nothing in this movie that shows precisely Senator McCarthy. It is a scary scandal and surprising that anyone involved with this production has found another job in the industry. Marxist-leninists authors who wrote this garbage did so to attack someone who was confirmed by history and their fear that anyone could destroy communism. Unfortunately for these communist work, Ronald Reagan took where McCarthy left and could not stop him, so the end of the Soviet Union and its allies. Never, never look at this film if you're looking for the truth about Sen. McCarthy. Read Ann Coulter, "Breach" for a better look at Sen. McCarthy. It will also help if you read about what happened to Senator McCarthy by reading http: // www. thenewamerican.com/tna/1996/vo12no18/vo12no18_mccarthy.htm
