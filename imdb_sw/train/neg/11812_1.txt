... however not one of them. Caro Diario was at least a watchable for two-thirds of the time, but a third part of the boring and self-independent movie that gave the flavor of what came in this casual fun. Moretti says he needs to make this film, but he doesn't want, where the viewer feels that he should consider, but they never want to. Italian movies and elections can be interesting, but this is not a film. At one time, Moretti and his friends are standing outside the Communist Party's headquarters, discussing the preparations they are preparing to make with the local leaders, but it is a feature of this film that we cannot see. The inclusion of Moretti's political motives is the events leading up to the birth of his son, and the shots of the future movie of him and the baby and later the new baby Pietro (the film draws us through several years and over one election period). We continue to expect to see a sequence of uncertainties or arguments, but never comes. I doubt one that I could have the patience to stay through the movie Nanni Moretti again. He makes the hour and twenty minutes looks like ever.
