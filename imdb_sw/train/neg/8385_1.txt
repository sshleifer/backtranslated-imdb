Now I have found that by watching this film I lost the most important moment of my life I will never come back. The Thsi film is not just the poor that explains. It reminded me of every sitcom of the black-made color. I'm sorry to watch this film. Flixmedia sees its problem of competing, "White" people love it because it doesn't have white executives. Wife, I think you will find a reason why no one wanted this was because watching the dry color is more than fun and funnier then this bunch of drivel. <br /> <br /> Please stop making the film crap
