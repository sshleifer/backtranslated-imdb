and head like this, you don't expect a great movie of fear. But this was very bad, even with low expectations. The plan is realistic and stupid: the survivor is wearing a Halloween mask, so everyone around him thinks he is another person. This joke can really work for 5 or 10 minutes, but not during the whole movie! The artists are not bad, but their characters are still dumb and story is boring and quite clear. No doubts, no excitement and little bit (very cheap). The little helper of Satan tries to combine fear (...) and comedy and is so slow to it. It was amazing to the end, that I stopped stopped 10 minutes before the end. I didn't care what happened. Amanda Plummer was the principal in the Pulp Fiction, but come in. Which was 13 years ago, and she does not do anything afterwards. So it is not surprising that he had to sink down like this piece. Avoid or warn.
