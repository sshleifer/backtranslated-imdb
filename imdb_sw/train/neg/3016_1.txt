I, like many, are a fan of Tony Scott movies. When this film came out I was very optimistic that it would be like 'Man On Fire'. To find out that the movie is a completely meaningless thing! The story was playing water from going, and Mickey Rourke's choice was not such a good idea. And the whole weapon was also freeous! <br /> <br /> The movie focuses on Kiera Kinghtly. The movie brought some of the worst works ever. <br /> <br /> I would like Tony Scott 'n all, but this takes the whole friggin cake! Sorry Tone, 1 out of 10!
