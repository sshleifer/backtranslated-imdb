........ and one of the worst in it !!! How long was this train? 14 periods or something? I can see why now. <br /> <br /> I bought a part of "Serenity" from Amazon Unboxed. It was my first purchase, so it was free. That's the only thing that is relevant to experience (event?)? I / I will not comment on acting, as this is, I think, new people who had not been working just now right now. At least I have never seen them before any kind of big show, theater or TV. If I do, then I have forgotten them easily. But the special effects were quite awesome. True, this is not a good $$ million project, but the original Star Trek did better than this & which was two and five years ago. I have actually laughed bad guys (harvesters or something like that) as the explosion of a monster-looking Firefly, and the smoke comes out of the engine looking at something like a large rocket. I expected to finally see Wilay Coyote climbing up, while following the walker. MOD's jet / rocket today does not make it bad. <br /> <br /> And that wasn't even worse. The wild-west type of bullet is looking for you if I was looking at a sci-fi film or Gene Autry one. Do not waste your time, do not waste your time ... do ... every 80 minutes of distress called "Firefly".
