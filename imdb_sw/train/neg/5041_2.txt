Ye Lou Purple Butterfly film enters the secret Purple Butterfly against Japanese forces in the war-torn Shanghai. Ding Hui (Zhang Ziyi) and her former boyfriend Hidehiko Itami (Toru Nakamura) find themselves on different sides of the war after a meeting of space. I agree with the auditor from Paris. The film changes the historical, semi-historical clash of the plot, without giving the audience one reason to care about the characters or their reasons. Sudden change is not appropriate as issues seem to be unacceptable and useless. I usually don't care about dark movies, but the absence of light, bone-bone bones, and filmmaking techniques generally make it hard to watch and remain interested. I also agree with the viewer from Georgia that this film "has a style of destroying chaos and claustrophobic movies", but I don't think that supports the movie. The back part of the film is one of the most dramatic events of the 20th century, and I do not believe that you can do any right to edit it as Michael Bay's film. The most exciting times in many voices cannot increase his reign. <br /> <br /> All executives are well recommended. Zhang Ziyi also shows that he has a small form of acting if he uses the entire movie doing what he looks best in all his films, giving birth and looking at the overall look. However, at least he adds various forms for this role by chains and involvement in the worst area of ​​love since Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton in The Terminator. All, a desperate film, especially to see how it comes from the director of Suzhou He. 2/10
