I was thrilled to see the film of Catalu√±a in Berlin. But after the presentation I was desperate and angry. Many blood, a lot of time, many themes for free. The Spanish Civil War, like all the wars, was terrible. Revenge, a very human character, is not very good, is featured in films and games without capacity, as well as relationships between homosexuals and concerns in Spain about Catholicism. But what Mr Villaronga tries, is a pseudo epidemic that can be the worst history of the film. It's a pity to see Angela Molina in this film. I advise anyone under any circumstances to see this film.
