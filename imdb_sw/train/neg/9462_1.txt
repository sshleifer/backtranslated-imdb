Not suitable. PG rating that this movie gets is still another great misstep and MPAA. Whale Rider gets PG-13 but this movie gets PG? Please. Parents do not fall away, taking a primary school child to this movie is a big mistake. There were many times I found myself worrying not just because humor was not good for children, but also because it was not out of blue and no unnecessary. But all that is, Cat in Hat is still a bad movie. Searching and looking for the entire film is just the saving gifts. Kelly Preston good and visible (or hated in this case) Alec Baldwin is good at their roles though Preston is very good for such a role. Children are the state actors and shows, especially with Dakota Fanning. Fanning is a unique feature of the film that has examined me and not given us items on the screen. Did I say there was a cat talking about this movie? Mike Myers is very bad. I didn't like Shrek's voice, and I really believe now that Myers shouldn't be allowed around the children's movie again. Paka's show is the lowest version of Bastard and Power Austin. At the end, the cat should not come, she would have to stay away, but came, even if only a day, destroyed 82 minutes of my life, 82 minutes of personal anger and quarrels. <br /> <br /> Cat in Hat can be the worst movie ever kids.
