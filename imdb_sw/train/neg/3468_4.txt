A film student makes a B-grade actor (a good MOLLY RINGWALD player) to complete a horror movie that his mother (very low Kylie Minogue!) Tried to make 12 years ago. It is an option to plan to say the least, if any Aussie fan of fear knows that the kind of sadness is not recommended for women's directors. The film has a curse on it, because Molly had to kill a psychic killer on the original set. But he is back, because he needs exposure. Unfortunately, the curse is still located and people start dying on the "set." Cut is an Aussie attempt in modern "modern", but unfortunately it doesn't bring anything new or exciting on the table. In fact, it drives half of the film film Wes Craven for 90 years. The entire name of the film-stop "Screaming" (except Aussie-stop - Jane Campion ... see how this is not interesting) and A lot of "this is true or is this movie" La "Nightmare New." The layout is bad, the music is sad, the effects are interesting, almost everything is bad about this. Fortunately, the film may have a sense of humor: one time, a girl who is well dressed in film workers says to the owner of the house they are playing: "Don't worry, we will treat your house if it was our own," he responds, "that doesn't mean to me, you see if you live in a dump! "Ha! And Molly one of the cunning-liners were not enough to regret this lease. "Do you have any coke of food inside here?" (if he is a car of a professor of films) and "Does anyone know where I can buy any tofu?" (The first thing he decides on setting) and "Is hell a my agent?" (oh wait, that's how I thought.)
