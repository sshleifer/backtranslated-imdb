As a great fan of films and David's games Mamet, especially his first film of the House of Sports which also had a star Joe Mantegna, I expected good things from this film. Instead, I found myself irritated by films and lack of trust. Slurs civilians are healed without any feeling or their meaning behind, hoping to establish a color tension that I never did. Identity has been fully revealed and men become "heroes" because there is no apparent reason. Because of his oaths taken as a soldier, the attitude of leadership refuses to make one small step that will not harm anyone and can save lives, and still makes another step that is very strict and illegal, but still refuses to take action. Additionally, a less-dependable small one involving a murdered family has been created only for the action of the plot which was all but announced by the skywriting, and the reaction of the police to those events identified through all the boundaries. Of course, after expecting another exciting stimulus from David Mamet, I was very disappointed to say a little. 3 out of 10.
