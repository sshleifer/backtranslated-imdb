This is one of those movies that can be good. The basic premise is good - immortal people who kill live, etc. - a variety of differences on the concept of vampire. <br /> <br /> What makes it all fall off is the total lack of key characters. Even sociopaths know that you need to keep a brief description if you want to live - see how long you took to capture Unibomber, and that was because the family member did. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the child (and at a minimum, mother) feels like they don't know. A child kills without thought by leaving a witness or a way of life or evidence. How these people could stay alive and unknown for the month is wonderful, then alone decades or centuries. <br /> <br /> It is a real shame - this can be very much as written plausibly, that is, giving the main characters the level of common sense that would be needed to get for a long time. <br /> <br /> Other than that, not showing bad. I liked a bit at the end where every cat in the city joins the house - every time I put food in the hall and see our cat quickly rushing from everywhere, I think of the area.
