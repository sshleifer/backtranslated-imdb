Do you know the films that are locked in the movie? You are there on the top of the house, in the middle of the line on your special sweet spot that you hit three times before you get the right seat - and after what you feel like 13 hours you are still experiencing there, worry and anxiety, thinking â€œWhen F ** is this movie going to END? " (You know the feelings - think of A.I and the Village) <br /> <br /> Well, Alien Q provides a wonderful difference of feeling. I sat there for the first 30 minutes and I wondered when it would have started! Not possible! So "Arty" hurts. This is the first Miike Takashi film that I watched. It seems he makes a film and a dozen and, if all like very much w @ etc. like this, I hope to be the last. <br /> <br /> I'm not opposed to Pretentious w @ etc. David Lynch is top among the top 10 directors but the Alien Q is the cut, the cheapest, and the most beautiful w @ etc. <br /> <br /> As you work now - I liked it.
