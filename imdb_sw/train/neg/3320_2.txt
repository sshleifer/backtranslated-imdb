I honestly had great expectations when I started watching this film, but it was one of the boring films I saw! <br /> First, the speed is very small, so it looks much longer than (and not short). I am sure when Jane Austen wrote a book, made several pages long, filled with details, and did not intend to read people in one day, or could refresh and lose appeals, which "Emma" certainly did. Now "Awareness and Attention" had this speedy error, but at least it had beautiful lines to make it, as well as beautiful performances! That brings me to lose # 2, which is true, acting. While I have not yet emerged primarily for anyone involved in this film, I am sure they have the ability to do a good job, but I haven't seen much in this film. It was like people tried so much to be witches, very hard to be "high class", very hard to be British (well, some of them), so they all came as a group of actors and not like people. 3. Sent, as I said, seemed only as actors, and not really as people who were playing. Maybe that's a good thing, because people played with them is not all good. Why did everyone resemble Emma, ​​for example? Indeed, he was good for the rich, the most beautiful people in front of them, but he was a bad rumor behind their backs. If his friends were "bad", then he had no trouble even going back to their backs. So, why is this girl so beautiful? Why should people tell the story, "just make him laugh?" Of course snob could not even do it right. I have enough problems with Gwyneth Paltrow as Gwyneth Paltrow, and his "Emma" did not change my opinion. Well, it's easy to see that I don't care about this. I am sure it is a wonderful book and all, but some books were not done with big screens, and "Emma" is one of them.
