If others have said, "No, Luciano" is the most important title or answer to this film. For entertainment, the opera singer should cling to sing ..... not that he is a terrible actor. It's just that this film is increasing. The first 25 minutes were good - a good family movie, as it was - but after that it is not just a boring soap opera. According to playing the singer, Pavarotti, as "Giorgio Fini," loses his voice a few times by the doctor, "Pamela Taylor" (Kathryn Harrold) comes to rescue. The singer then fell to the doctor, the doctor fell slower to the singer, the two say all the time and continue on. <br /> <br /> Pavarotti has a smile to win and it's a good person. It's Harrold which destroys the items and after watching it here I'm not surprised she didn't star. <br /> <br /> There is a good environment in the movie to enjoy, beautiful shots of San Francisco and Italy, at least in the first half of the film. I got tired and did not remember much about the second half of it.
