I paid this 1. There is a lot of conspiracy that you can never be sure to plug. Total mayhem. Everyone is killed or near. I am exhausted on the hair of the cross and changing the view. I can't give that field away. They are broken and ignorant. If I paid to see this I would like to return my money. I would like to be more professional.
