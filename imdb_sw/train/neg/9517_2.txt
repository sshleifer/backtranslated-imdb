Vincente Minelli movies often have value for your time; Meet me at St. Louis, Bad and Good. I waited for this film for great interest. But what desire. <br /> <br /> Some Running Run is the scene after the occurrence of fuel. Sinatra is a sad sack, returned from the battle to find a family of desperate family, desperately depressed, depend on the horrible problem as gal persuades him to finish his desperate project. The movie has a great finish which desperate villain grab with Sinatra and MacClane and something desperate occurs. The sequence is intended to be filled with tension but Minelli is not Hitchcock; he gets excited and beautiful, he does not know the event is a clich√© of wheels and characters are highly recommended and not well-designed we do not care that they are being shot. (especially MacClane) But that's the only real video in the project. Otherwise we look at the perpetrators standing around the bars and living rooms get nerves for every two hours. Hell is the other people, it seems. <br /> <br /> Nothing is going on in this film. The problem of soldiers returning to their homes and impunity after WW2 is dealt with in the 'Best Years of Our Lives'. And one of the two Inge crops, 'Beauty in Grass' and 'Picnic' needs to be desperate to get into the last city, with more gentle.
