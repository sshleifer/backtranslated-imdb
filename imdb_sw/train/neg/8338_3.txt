This film is very important because it helped me focus on this: sometimes you would like to be sick ... sometimes you would like to have syndrome ... sometimes, for example, you would like to have a Goldfield ... in that way "you don't remember this film The most interesting ... and above all you would like to remember Adam "superfluos" Sandler ... sometimes, just, would you like ... you planned another movie ... <br /> <br /> Vote for me? 3 out of 10. My opinion? If you are not a fan of romantic romantic comedies or Adam Sandler (... is a dragon without Adam Sandler's cat ... I want to trust you), save yourself ... Someone who can save? Drew Barrymore. ... maybe.
