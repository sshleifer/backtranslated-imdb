TV affects society ... just look at the growing popularity of cappucino stores after a small piece of work started. Besides, real people seem to be good if these people have no problems. Besides, does anyone believe in the fact that these people can afford to live in a good sense of Manhattan to consider what they are doing with life? NBC just loves to insult the viewer of the viewer, even if it is close to the Gump level. I know someone who makes $ 100,000 a year as a webmaster and lives in a small bedroom apartment in Manhattan which forces $ 2200 per month to rent. I would like to see a show called Friends, where is the six worst nobodies in the last job, living in the crummet neighborhood where sireli always cries and someone gets mugged every week ... and then the landlord takes taxes. Now that I'd like to look.
