He looked at this after hearing about the bad situation and wanted to feel himself. Eagerly, even if you read bad comments here you will have a place close to the ability to understand how bad this film really is, though it has to be one of the most beautiful things I have seen! Never be interested in posting comments here before, but this piece certainly certainly. The whole plot is stupid and useless. Brother of the leading character (or Ben or Arthur, forgot what is true, and really not quite clear) wants to stop some kind of gay marriage by killing everyone in front - because homosexuality is hatred for Christians, but definitely killing people is' ​​t. Then there is another crap that was cured in one of the gay gay wife trying to force her back to the gunpoint. This causes anything, but gives us one of the funniest lines of dialogue in all the "film" - "I don't mean, you don't mean! My self-love is a stone lawyer who has been stoned, who reads clearly his verses away from something, he can still use them. ”The gay couple cannot be under the influence of a boy. completely, and her lover who looks like a little man of the cartoon powder of bisto spots. Only fat. And the talented little ones. The whole thing goes with the great oil man on the bed with a pair of boots. Isn't it worth it? ”But nevertheless, we all know how this thing is awesome, so I'd like to show some non-t very much who "film" provides. When fat puts the church on fire and then gives it as a six-year-old girl to the car to get out of it. Hilarious. <br /> <br /> - Mildread! I don't know what relationship with the main characters - sometimes they know him, sometimes they don't know, but he climbs in several cases however. Hilarious. <br /> <br /> - A stone lawyer. He has already mentioned, but he is very funny deserves to mention another .. - Brothers bad dinner of the killers who puts them to his guests. <br /> - Homosexual potion. <br /> <br /> - cats of bad brothers. <br /> <br /> - At the end, which I can give because it should seem reliable. I warn you though, make sure you don't eat time! The head of the main shepherd / director / producer finds honey. It's dirty. <br /> <br /> Basically, Ben and Arthur are indescribably bad, but no matter what comical thing you will see for a long time. In fact, there is nothing good about this excuse for the film, the talent of the director will even be able to make the characteristics of the opening being shocked by writing his own name about 15 times.
