This was the movies I couldn't wait to see! So I finally got and I was desperate. At the beginning, the film said little about New York, just a voting group for buildings, roads, bridges and restaurants. Certainly cannot focus on New York's magic. Another thing that changed my mind is the French movie installed in this film. I realize it's remake, but it's not a French style made! Otherwise, here you will see things that remind you of French movies, such as long and frightening events, no talking or little and of course everyone has a smoking style of French! The story follows a lot of life (too much for my taste) and somehow seems to cling to the end. I feel like he was not dedicated to the characters as it was in the story. The movie was too short to achieve every finally everyone ends up happy. So we can see 30 people for every 5 minutes. And there you have 120 minutes! if you would like to talk about work events and these things are not a film for you! I only give 4 because I love New York and I've loved to be thrown!
