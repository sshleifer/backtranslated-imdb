I find it difficult to understand why this piece of rubbish was full again. The only grace to save in the whole thing is the body of Ariauna in her sexy uniform. His humor should also be counted. He is sure but it will not take the witch of this salvage garbage. However, he must be recognized for his sincere efforts and courage. He cannot say the same to his cole Lilith star and his voice stretch that grows on your nervous system. He seemed apathetic and gave the impression that only his presence on the set was needed. They all say without the performance of Ariauna is actually a garbage.
