I am grateful every second time I lost when I watched this film, in fact. Unfortunately, it is always difficult to turn off the movie after you start watching it. Specifically, when it's classic or what people use to hit the classic. I think this is one of these movies each movie partner should look at at least once, so that's why I watched it. Don't make a mistake, I would like Humphrey Bogart and his wife Lauren Bacall both as actors, but this film was a great deception in my opinion. There is no good plot, no sourness or secret story of romantic love. Well, it is not an interesting mix of these two types. The only thing that caused the tension was that he was not sure whether 'Bogey' and Bacall would sit together at the end or part from someone else. I think that "not having" is very overrated by Bogart was in the best film during the 1940s.
