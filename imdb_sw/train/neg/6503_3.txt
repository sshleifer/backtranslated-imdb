What Hopkins succeeds with this effort as the author and director gives us a feeling that we don't know anyone in the film. However, perhaps in it there is a problem. His movie has a lot of desires and his motives were hard and shrouded from within, but not meaning. No characters. We don't know who it is, so there is no investment on our side. It can be about the screens of the screen with its characters. What? Maybe. So I don't mean that Slipstream is enough; I mean that there is no telling them. Hopkins film is an attempt. With his face, one can make a case that is about the scribe of the screens, who at the time of his meeting and fate, knows that life is hit and missing, and / or success is a blind chance, if he is thrown into a "rebellion" of collisions between points, time, dreams, ideas, and facts. However, it is a non-consistent brain that does not leave any sense of feeling, even in small, large amounts of permissible relationships with its characters. I don't think nippy and flamboyant school of shaky, machine-gun-speed work on camera and editing, but reflecting on the film I'm starting to realize that it had a lot to do with it. There are many movies over the past ten years where cuts or cameras have sound effects as well as other conditions of technical deterioration. I think in this case it was correct because his purpose was to create a sense of dreams. However, I knew anything about Slipstream when I looked, and I came out the same way. And I don't care, because Hopkins had no effort to take care of us. There are satellite movies, and there are movies that sit on a rocking seat and knit, you don't know your presence. Slipstream is the end.
