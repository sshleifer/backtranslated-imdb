I think this piece of garbage is the best proof that good ideas can be destroyed, why do all American activists think that children today want GI JOE's stupid stories of good news? Looney Tunes are some of the most popular characters in history, but they were not created to be Xtreme, i mean to come !!! The smaller is a good example of how the old idea can be made without losing the natural charm, but this piece of garbage is just an example of a stupid corporate decision that just wants to create a low idiotic show that children will love because she! ! children love superheroes right ??? The whole show is just a waste of time when we see new versions of Looney Tunes but this time in a superhero form, this does not sound very bad but the problem is that this show is trying very hard to make a series of series like a batman series of animation, or a new league of rights, results ? A bad copy of the flash (the road walker) or the superman (who else ??? bugs bunny) trouble is that Looney Tunes didn't mean to be wonderful, thought to be funny !!!! as I said before this series, and many people wonder why the anime takes over the world ??? This show tries to be extraordinary and full of action, but that's something that a few series and anime can do, if you want to see a better improvement by looking at the old Tiny Toons advertisement, this is a possible example to bring back old characters, but for good news and respect the original roots. The worst that shows already dead, another wise decision of the company I think.
