somewhere I would like to read that this film should be a comedy. after seeing it, I would call it anything except. The point of this film removes me. All the discussions are very high and wonderful, most of the sets were seen after, and despite all the sexual and romantic content, nothing related to this film ... they all leave me wondering what about this is about! The head of the head can be a source of fun (if not political). instead, we have been treated with cheap, amateur, unwanted drawings and weaknesses for himself. if I want, I'm going to buy jones of grace cd.
