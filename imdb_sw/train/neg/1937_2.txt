The first half an hour or more of this film I loved. The obvious love between Ingrid Bergman and Mel Ferrer was good looking and I wanted to see the inevitable occurrence among them. However, once the incident has turned into Ingrid's girlfriend's house, all fell completely. Instead of romance and charm, we see some parallel characters dopey parallel looks who ruin the film. A female boorish woman and a military partner who were looking for caution of a maid seemed to be foolish - like a small form of the old Boat Boat Love. How charm and elegance of the first part of the film can give way to dopiness is more of me. This film is an experiment with Renoir to retain its success with the METAL GAME, as the movie is very similar when the action takes on the property of the country (like other films). I WAS NOT A GREAT FIELD OF THE GAME, but ELENA AND HIS FOLLOWERS had art skills and original pictures.
