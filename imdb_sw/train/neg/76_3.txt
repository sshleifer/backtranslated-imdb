I saw this at the beginning of the first time in Melbourne <br /> <br /> It is inferior, double-dimensional, inappropriate and, hard to believe it has been given, it throws. Pastors can be approved, but they did not have much to work and given a script of plodding and surprising. For those who may be concerned that Ned Kelly will be over-minded, you can find comfort for the fact that this story telling is completely without a comprehensive literary, completely told on the face and full of casting rates. However, it doesn't work as a popcorn film either. His freezing is far from the kilter and his trick is not found even to the level of the mundane actor. I'm very doubtful Gregor Jordan can sit back and tell himself "this is the best I could do with the material". <br /> <br /> Ned Kelly is an interesting figure, and so is the same as the national answer to him. Probably skilled people, perhaps class hero, perhaps psychopath and perhaps all these things, has ever dominated the Australian true stories for over 120 years. Once again, his story has failed miserably on the big screen. <br /> <br /> That's life.
