Hi, I am a friend of the movie waswolf, and when I saw the name of Darkwolf hitting the shelves I was like "hmm, simple and beautiful name for it at least. Althou ... I wonder why I don't feel of it before." First, the movie begins with tits. Lots of tits. Titi is a very good budget for all the cinema. Who cares about the effect of waswolf, just pay enough executives to get the top shots! <br /> <br /> So, about the wonderful character of the darkwolf (little attackers ahead, but who cares ...) He is your average daily biker. Even look very strong, but as a wise old woman says in the film "she is more powerful and more dangerous than you have before." Just to define the type of biker of the tattoo. Pretty original. I had been looking at the first time using the “eyes of the eyes” INTRODUCTION INTRODUCTION! I mean my god, that "effect-of-red-to-eyes-and-computer" effect has been used since the seventy years. It looks so bad here! And be played and started with Werewolf 3D-CGI. As mentioned earlier, as a bad video game with old. <br /> <br /> And finally, like Iwolf's movies, as I said. They love to always create a story of their own. Darkwolf creates waswolfworld too, about some silly legends of hybrid waswolves and old blood. But. It is almost immediately after creating the rules of cooperation "dark darkness kills any girl who touches" begins to move randomly. That just doesn't mean, why even bother to tell us the principles of murder, when they can not play them ... Apart from the shots of the wolf-of-view is made with a handycam of sony or something, more movies of the floor and walls. Simply enter the beautiful sounds and you have found a great effect of waswolf. Gore is the same place. But the wolf reduces everyone with a clear hand, simply by putting the hand on the victims, not just making a trick to me ... <br /> <br /> In fact, WHO offers money for these hard horkortitles of junk direct video, they don't even funny-kind of bad movies, just sad.
