there was some truth for this movie. I remember the story told 15 to 20 years ago of 4 fishermen to get the body into the water and chose not to go until their journey was completed. I also remember that they were charged with the intervention of corpses (or other payments). I don't know if it was in Australia. Australia's outlook should think we live in a country filled with fighters and serial killers. Wolf Creek and this film would encourage this view. The film itself reminded me of the Simple Plan. But apart from being one of the best Australian films ever, as someone said, I can not be generous. To put it this way, I can't bother again.
