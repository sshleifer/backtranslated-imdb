Until this new season I have become a big fan of 'Mosque'. However, the new season was completely restricted. The new Christian pastor has destroyed the whole purpose of the show. It has always been about living together to overcome discrimination. The new pastor destroys the stability and shows Christians to the worst light. I am not a Christian or a Muslim, but I like watching the show and seeing the relationship between Amar and Pastor. It's no longer. <br /> <br /> Delete it and be done with it. It's not worth seeing again. It can still be saved, but many changes need to be made. <br /> <br /> Restoring old format.
