It's like the head of this thread says. Only the feeling given to me from the cinema is that the behavior of Marlee Matlin was always irritating, so worried, and so pathetic. The first day of his character and character of William Hurt where they were playing were dumb. For all, I've tried to finish watching the movie four times, and four times I've slept. I would like to watch that film with one mind ... beat my trouble with sleep, because all it is doing to put me. Sweet Dreams.
