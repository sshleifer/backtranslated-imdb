I can't think a lot to say about this film. <br /> <br /> This was a bad movie ... I can't tell you even what made me decide to see it. It had a few of the liberty that I don't even know. The plan moved from without seemingly strange. My whole body was a lot of time during the movie because I couldn't wait for something bad to be up and done. At the end of the movie, I found myself hearing more of the removal. <br /> <br /> The layout was poor, acting was small, and the storyline was weak. Francoise Robinson was thrown as an American Native, though he even almost identical to the native of the American heritage. <br /> <br /> If the movie is going to be of this sound, it should be tight - at least. It was not. It was only patistic.
