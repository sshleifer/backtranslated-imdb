Poor Tob Hopper. He explained all the terrible moments of the session "Texas Chaimsaw Assacre". Since all the time everything has done has been awesome. This is probably worseâ€¦ and that says a lot. It's about a person (Brad Dourif) who has the ability to do things (and people) get hot ... or something like that. It is not possible the original idea (anyone remembers "Fire of Fire"?) It is a real mess ... really everything has done wrong! Fun activity (even Dourif!), Asinine script, production values, crappy special effects ... everything is BAD !!!!! You must miss ... it's not good to laugh.
