True, when it comes down, this film is not just interesting. Josh Kornbluth is an funny antithesis, and still thinks he's a hilarious master. The way to send the 17 letters was good at first, until Josh "looks at me, I am wacky" approach began to infesting every area. The priestly diet of Judah may be the most interesting thing I have ever known, and it says a bit, for it has a fierce competition from all other jokes in the movie. And for the amazing use of Pixies "Debaser," I have only one thing to say: What did Pixies do to deserve such a fate? What did anyone do for Josh Kornbluth to write / redirect / generate / star in such a bad movie?
