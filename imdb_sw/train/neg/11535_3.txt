Gillian Anderson is a proud, expelling woman, who takes a job class at Danny Dyer for a night of fun. After a stupid accident in the country, they are brutally attacked.

Certainly I don't know how "Straightheads" got a movie release. I'm not strict. I don't know sex and abuse in the movies, but they should get married to the film and) a good plot or b) Good behavior or c) preferably both. "Straightheads" did not. There is no progress in the field or the characters and much has been left unnoticed and unused. Unfortunately "Straightheads" did not come quickly. It was only 80 minutes long. It was a shame, because there was an interesting film virus here, turning exactly to attract in a plot in the last three. How many times I say this, but it would be good if it was done well.
