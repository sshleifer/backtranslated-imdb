Men's Polchesi's Polynesian drink, fight and make a stream of gender, stupid and unloving. The real life of Polynesian is much funnier than these colored characters, cards. The Samoan girl is not looking at or doing Samoa at all, appeared more like a white female woman who is having sex with anyone with a blow. For the weak as the lines of water stories you can not say anything about acting - even the most brilliant actors could not do anything with this script. It is sad to see that Polynesian actors like to play such a sad advice on a film without a good location, and just two 'jokes' or three. Is it losing money to Kiwi taxpayers, it's a lost opportunity to make a good film about a powerful community. It's best not to make movies as they are bad and useless like this.
