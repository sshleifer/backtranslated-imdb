Yes, my goodness, I have longed for. When I heard the news of the 1963 film Robert Wise, "The Haunting", I was afraid that it would have been destroyed by the abundance of summer movie effects. But, at the bottom, I had faith. In fact, for such talents contain intact ... De Bont and the company will not destroy the film, who previously was a wonderful and awesome movie that will understand the stylish art of the trick. Well, the trick, where now !! My fear has shown ... the promised movie is lost. Yes, the design of Eugenio Zannetti production is a jaw-stop; The cinema is a wonderful picture; and composer Jerry Goldsmith can never do wrong. But, the script puts the best artists to test. At the end, Lili Taylor is always the only actor who can escape with respect ... and that's very difficult. But, the crime of all crimes is that fear is shown to us. We can not use our imagination again, to feel the horrible fears of fear of the unknown. No, we get the effects of seeing US show what we should fear ... and you know what? To be surprised by the wonder they are ... visual effects come as a silly type. And the peak is a wonderful mess ... but things went wrong before. <br /> <br /> Everything in The Haunting is overdone and overblown. I'm afraid there is no real happiness or creaks in this old fragrance house of monstrosity ... just wails. See original instead. <br /> <br />
