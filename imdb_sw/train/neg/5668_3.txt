First off - no flirting is quite ongoing in this film - with Anthony or anyone else. These people do not like - they just do it. Your first attempt to tolerate is to pass for more than 15 minutes of brutal and sexual abuse. This can not be very bad - hell, I would like violations and distortions such as the following inspector, but without setting it, it is ignoring. So it does so through persecution and violence. Then we meet Donna and the movie turns to something around together - not the best - quite different: the picture of the road without heart. There is an attempt to relax for the comedy thanks to watos - generally written with general stripes and broads like Judy Tenuta and Mink Stole (with a few hookers and queens drag, too). They all deserve the best. The photographs are deliberately disturbed, so if you get a motion sickness (or actually any kind of disease) - this flick is not for you. Come to meditate, I do not know who is this Flick for-except gay gay and S & M gay who love scripted unintentionally, have hit the Indy films about themselves.
