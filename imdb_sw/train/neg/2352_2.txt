Typically, sometimes it causes - for me is a summation of the most recent Madhurkar Bhandarkar work - Page 3. He has no attitude - it's not too hard, it is very easy. What? What is the film about? What? It is about reporting the family of the people (called a type of people) who are doing a lot of work and develop their details in life - that they have no time for anything else. And you are either in it or out of it. What? It is that no journalists will never give a daily report. Mr. Bhandarkar remembers that there is a great newspaper and just an extra; maybe the singer to watch who is who and what. Do not mix two. And then there is a powerful play - which will happen in every walk for life. Why have you said at the end of all - anything - just a few unusual jokes are put together in another direction under the film.
