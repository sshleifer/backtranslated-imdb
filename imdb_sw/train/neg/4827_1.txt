If this movie means to discourage people from drugs, it fails. I was ready to start using them while I was waiting for something to happen and nothing had ever happened. This movie is not horror or drama. It's just a paranoia of meth users. This film can win a prize using the word "F" often and so without meaning. It was not good, but I felt like they were doing Meth taking Meth's position they had to pay the debt to someone. Hector was worse and more paranoid than the movie continued and the girl was more optimistic. The end is worthless. The movie did not mean unless you just show how annoying is stuck in the middle house anywhere and head meth. I relied on other views when I decided to watch this film and verification on this movie should be the lowest.
