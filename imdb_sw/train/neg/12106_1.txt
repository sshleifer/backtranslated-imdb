Film of passion, fear. Director Boorman shows Cahill a refreshing home, but living is shown to be honest with nanny, that's exactly right. A cahill investigator researcher has been hit on his car, but he is a rat and sourpuss, and it will not look like a good man, so it is also the same. Beits, the owner of Russborrough House, made their money by using 'darkies' to dig diamonds, so it's the same to steal the worthless art from them and hide it in the bunker in Wicklow mountains. Garda kill her ferrets and is involved in her murder. The standard of ethics is a disease, Boorman is watching a hit film, but they do not have guts to stand up against the gang's crime, who feared the area, and made a wave of scumbags in Dublin. He even communicated with male delegates while doing it. It hates. Hate about him for his fear.
