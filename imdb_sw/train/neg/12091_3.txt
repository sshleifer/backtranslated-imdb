Well, the Cannes artyfartyrati may have loved this film but I'm not afraid. If you would like a type of film where shots stay so long how you wonder if the actor sleeps or the player goes to lunch then it can be for you. Much of this is like this and a short migration in the area of ​​unpleasantness. I did not hesitate or disrupt as other other critics - it is a little and trivial. The only reason I have not given this star is that it is a beautiful time that the film is shooting well. The plan, however, can not recommend. A large part of the film shows only a grateful woman teaching or listening to piano, which can appeal to other people. But don't think this is enough to be prepared for some of the pornography and sexual abuse only to arouse you with a bad taste in your mouth. Not recommended.
