The "Trivia" page on IMDb claims that the filmmakers had triggered them because this film was reconstructed and the label was "easy to vote". If so, the effort was a total failure, since this is one of the most unfamiliar stories I have ever seen in the film - I would like to see it before the plot was "simple." It is a pity that Warren has a very small character to go even that he cannot do anything with login devices. It is interesting to see Caron in '70s mode instead of its Hollywood-era cloak fabric and persona, but it's sad to see him without walking walking through this make-lover-to-his-producer-husband dreck. In fact he would later agree with her and marry the director, instead - who, you will see, was not directed at all, but did the work of 1 or 2 of D. Work on TV from here. That ought to tell you enough there. I will call this "interesting" because I enjoy the American films of this period, and this role adds the Oates' view of the incredible output of 1971 (two - Lane Blacktop, Mobile Fatigue). But the "1940 detective as fish-out of the water in the 1970s. The theme, which is the only thing that the movie says is true, is sold in a very heavy-offered way through. Such a theme would be done more effectively two years later in Long Time's Altman Product. And away from Oates playing guy-bitten errand, three years on, he will give his performance performance at Bring Me Head of Alfredo Garcia. If you haven't seen it, don't waste your time with this!
