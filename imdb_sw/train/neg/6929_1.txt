I read the review on this film and I decided to shoot. I am a good man of mind after all and I have given good reviews for some very bad flicks. If the last attributes are locked in this I meant meaning and something good to say. Here it might be: "This film was very short." That's all I got. OK /> <br /> Okay, OK. The sets and performances were done well and music helped them to provide life-saving loans but the film was painful to watch and unrestricted conversations were removed by good bits. I found myself laughing in this film but how you laugh at your best friend who bothered yourself in front of a large crowd. At the time of the "chicken dance" on the finale I had only I decided to walk and watch the film and let the bodies fall when it fell. I don't know what could save this film. Acting was not bad and it looked like it had a budget but there just didn't have any way to make it appear; even the presence of a good breast. Maybe I had to make a doobie or drink a LOT of beer to get the full experience of the film. Any way, I don't see this film again unless I have been very low. Then I can say to myself "At least I wasn't 'Dr Torture's Tarr.' I am better than the boys. '
