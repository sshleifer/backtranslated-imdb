This is a classic copy of the 1948 of Doris Day, Romance on the Top Sea. Line line is more or less similar but is modern. Govinda has a bright witted fellow who chooses a husband during the journey. When Rani plays a friend of a woman's university who has made a similar clearance. They try to catch out when a real husband and wife are trying to walk in Bombay. <br /> <br /> On the journey, Govinda misses another girl to Sanjiv's wife and spies on her when she loves for Rani's terrible. The lever has two roles of both father and son lawyers involved in divorce cases. Faced for a couple of fighters. It is an unsupported test of natural copies and songs very interesting. Comedy is a stick-stick and do not make one very laugh.
