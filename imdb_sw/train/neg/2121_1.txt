In fact it seemed like seven hours of boredom as well. What is it? What? What about Will Smith that I can't stand up again? I think he also seems to be concerned with the observation and getting Oscar. I understand how this says, but unless he learns new instruction I can not see him win one. He is a great name and therefore generally confused and a talented actor. He is not just. I give him credit to try hard, and be able to right with a drop of hats. That's about it. <br /> <br /> Seven pounds was a kind of eyeroller to me, from the beginning. Calling 911 for calls did not appeal to you in any way. I had no desire to know why he was calling for his own suicide. There was no surprise at all. The best I can say is that Will Smith and Rosario Dawson had respect for the chemistry of the screen. I also do not know his name, but the pastor's wife did a good job and his role as a frightened and beaten wife. Woody Harrelson had a limited time of screens, but I would say he stole the show whenever he was. <br /> <br /> For all, just a very run of a mill mill of the mill. I couldn't help to ask myself all the way why I cared about any of these people. He has never heard the poem for 'Tim / Ben'. Did he kill himself with jellyfish? Was he just living in an accident 8? Geewiz .. not see any coming ... <br /> <br /> 5/10 is very good.
