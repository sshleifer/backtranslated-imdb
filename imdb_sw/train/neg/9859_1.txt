This movie is just a cripple. Time damage and money. Jokes are predictable, characters are clich√© and how they talk about RPG games are not funny too. The problem is that the authors seem to not know how the RPG game works and, most importantly, how to make jokes about this game. Of course there is a group of lost people who play RPG as a freaking retard and total losers. But for me this is not a funniest way to make jokes about this game. The story has no meaning. Who cares about how long the game is played? The main problem in this film is that the authors and participants did not even try to know what the RPG is about to make jokes about it. I felt embarrassed to watch this mature movie.
