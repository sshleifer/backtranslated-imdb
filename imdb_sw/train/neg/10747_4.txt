Blood Blood III is a great improvement on the Blood Camp II if it has more sound in the right places and the rudimentary plot. This time they have come far away from the other two car parks that have been done in a good stage that you can no longer hear of driving cars that should be a distant desert. This time around there is a real show of TV and fake clown scare opponents. This is not a new idea, I have seen at least some of the most horrible movies and especially the same cluster where a real killer turns out but at least this has a plot instead of just a few people with a knife. <Br /> <br /> Unlike the other two in this series is at least good for a few laughs. I loved how there is a sound gun sound if someone gets beaten earlier and how the boom way hits behind people like fantom. I don't know why anyone could make a third bloody film, I would think it would be better to start at the beginning but largely tried with this. Half of the woman who had the nakedness of the nakedness was little for me, it seemed like they tried to keep going to hire other people who could get her clothes for 5 dollars as they did in the second movie. Still not working that machete is used to cut not hit but oh well, it's the movie's Camp Blood what you expect? If you would like to make a film you will find happiness from this.
