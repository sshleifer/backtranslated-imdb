I do not know when they were thinking. And they, I mean anyone even connected with this tragedy.I've seen the worst movies, I've seen many bad movies, and then there's this.but I will say one thing. Anyone who has written a script has eaten it to put what is more possible on the text, on the screen. Not good about this movie, either in a technical perspective or any other view.Wever's allowed to be made and then released should be deleted immediately. A few names are known in this movie. In fact I reluctant to use the word movie.it more like a collection of random scenes that have no connection with another and make less than 0 sens.anyway, I can't see why anyone with any respect will come in It was very cheap, and I have already been cut. if I got this free film, I would have been deleted. 0/10
