I have seen my last part of the thought of the end of the film, but I don't remember any film that made suicide like this. <br /> <br /> The creators of the films were clearly hoping that the big twist would 'amazingly' all of us .... and it did, but maybe not by the way they expected. I was left wondering that Connery, Harris, Fishburn and Capshaw had any connection with this Turkey, alone or together. <br /> <br /> The film up to the last thirty minutes was rather than engaging with the way the story was going on and the nature of the film in general. But once the deviation was revealed, the pits of conspiracy and diversity were strange, the fundamental reason for retaliation was the worst pregnancy and the ways that the hard work of Bobby Earl had been beaten off. What's worse is that once once it was revealed, the remaining part of the film was very predictable. <br /> <br /> Harris gave a sharp performance with Connery like Morgan Freeman for it doesn't give a bad performance, even if movies aren't great! So all in all, it starts well and opens the viewer to the intention. The last 30 minutes are one of the most memorable of the nose in the movie history.
