Everyone who wants to be the editor should watch this film! It shows you about any mistake that doesn't want to edit the movie! My grandmother could do better than that! But that's not the only reason that this film is so bad! (It is really so bad that I can't write a sentence without a fun mark!) If the first part of Les Visiteurs' was a very good comedy of the family with a joke of funny and cult talk, this sequel is a bad recepta of the first. Wonderful parts can be counted by one hand and maybe half of it. Clavier has done more work than the first part, Robin tries to act like Lemercier (because he has chosen him) but that's very bad. Lemercier is Lemercier, Robin is Robin! Even if Muriel Robin is happy with himself in action, he is not on the film because he doesn't work as he did. I know that it must be difficult to replace someone who was good at the role (Lemercier received the Caesar's award for his role in the first movie) but made a big mistake: instead of playing his role, played ?? Lemercier play him role '! For stories, it's just a lot! Of course we knew at the end of the first movie that will be good but Poir√© and Clavier should have tried to write a more simple story as the first part. Gags are repeating, children and ready-vu. No, in fact, there are no more than 3 amazing parts in this. Only beautiful things can be dress with some special effects. So you have only two reasons to consider: 1) if you want to learn how to destroy the bad movie, 2) if you want to waste your time or if you need less time for brain '! 2/10
