Now look, I can't lie to you, but I've just got this movie for $ 3.99 from a friend because it had Danni Filth, the first fake singer of the famous death "Cradle Of Filth" in it. I really expected the abuse and run in the most favorable way, since that's what Mr Filth can be shown as, between the plot line. But dear God, I was oh very wrong. This movie strongly prohibits, time-consuming. Be a low-budget film (haha, wait, make ZERO BUDGET), this certainly hasn't got the best of Howard Stern music and the special effects of Spielberg. No, it is one camera, bad horn, and bad blood events. Take the example when our star and violence comes, Mr Filth, kills violently mugger. Grab on the throat, and the blood comes out, but oh my, it seems like there is a packet of fake juice on a person's shirt. You will hear two films in all films, but with aerial camera and photographs of photography, you enjoy the overall song DOWN. <br /> <br /> My last comment: Do well with it. It's blood, gore, breast, and hey, even a strange story to go with it. So, if you like the worst hatred, around the voice (yes, no words in this film), then in all ways, buy it. But if films are not yours, then avoid them. Don't waste your money.
