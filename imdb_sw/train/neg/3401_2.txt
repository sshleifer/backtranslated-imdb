I lost this film after hearing about the debate on that is not taken into account at the Academy Academy, but after looking at it, it's easy to see why it didn't. In spite of the beautiful photographs, the film is moving forward, despite any difficulty. The plan is about a young boy trying to negotiate with the death of his parents for what might or may not have been an accident (an unknown film about this), and how his grandfather told him story stories. Fairy stories have only bits of interest in the plot, but they are very short, and they don't seem to have any action. The first story of the fairy particularly facing a young man tries to find a magical flower for her boyfriend to die in order to save her life, but the delay of the boy to taste the first flower to make sure that it is not poisoning that results for a few seconds late to save his girlfriend - grandfather says that ethics was that the boy was very patient, but that did not mean anything because it was careful and gentle that led to his failure. A perfect example for this film really. Skye is good though, but then Stardust which was released this year is another film about fairy tales held in Skye and photographed well - and it's better than this.
