Martin Weisz, who led "solid Rohtenburg" firm, will take warmth, and Wes Craven, for another shade "The Hills Have Eyes 2". The origin of the original nature, emerging an amazing story with a flashback dog, will be sought forever with this professional police remake (just in name). The National Guard (and women) are taken to the study area of ​​the desert surrounded by mountains filled with mutants. One Sunday soldier is taken. That's right. There is a lot of abuse and rape area, but there is something worth finding excitement. The "traders" of the film are a common group of clichés and natural creatures, a great cry from the original "family" of Craven, especially similar to Brian Thompson from "Cobra" with other Stan Winston creatures have left the "Wrong Turn" shot . Much of the action takes place in caves, sheets "deficit", and is shot by Sam McCurdy. An interesting feature is Wes and Jonathan Craven to add mutant sympathy who skulks around his cave as Leatherface in the original Hooper "Chainsaw". Weisz will be criticized for this wrong desire, but it is not a fault because he does a good job of maintaining an emphasis and deleting some clean conditions from emerging situations. It's not a fan, unfortunately.
