I thought I read somewhere that this was the final production of Monogram, but if it was true or not, because if it wasn't, then it would have to be. It is a very horrible thing that drives John Carradine with gray hair in his hair to pretend himself as an old scientist who is trying to help his young student (Robert Shayne) in raising the dead. Each time their studies are raised, they seem to have a sharp face like marble because they are lying on the lab table (a great deal). Carradine can restore his faithful dog after the death, and the mutt finds the ability to walk through the walls in the spirit of the spirit (wooooooooohhhh). That's about all that he wrote. <br /> <br /> For ultra-cheap-cheap Monogram quickie, this matter at least actually uses to set up more labs than conventional concepts. The funniest laughter in the movie is that the "old" doctor Carradine always describes Shayne "sand" assistant as "muboy" when, in fact, Carradine was actually 40 and Shayne was 45 when they did it!
