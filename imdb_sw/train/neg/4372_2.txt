I LOVE Don Knotts, I would just say that on-front! He is a great and excellent talent in what he does, which shows a nervous shock, lovably awaited and thrown into the position of authority. He is wonderful in this role as Roy Fleming, Astronaut Reluctant, but the film is pretty light, indeed, as a child my brother and I enjoyed watching this with another film. It is still worth watching but in fact it's a film that enjoys more with children. I would like to make it a 100% friendly-family with something that you can sit and watch with your children at night. <br /> <br /> Like all Knotts films, there is a good cast of good actors and you can not help but smile when Knotts offers one of its shakes, open-mouthed stares, no matter how old and jaded you it is. From an adult perspective, one thing I think is great about this film is how it holds NASA in the 1960s - all modern modern buildings, hope, hope, the future! And I wondered how the issue and studie Leslie Neilsen were back at that time. Just a complaint about the story is Roy's love, a bad attitude, a woman who can not vary who cannot give him a day until he will be a big shot - if you are like me, you will be hoping that he will give her a pushing. Beware - you will be making a phone call for a day after watching, it's an interesting thing.
