I really expected to see the Planet of Apes, but it was very blasphemous. <br /> <br /> Settings and masks are good, but that's just a good part of the film. Other things are very troubling. Mark Wahlberg does not work, he is only in the movie, who seems to be a fool. Other pastors are also not very good. <br /> <br /> But the worst step, is the story. It is absolutely ridiculous! For example, monkeys lie on the ground, but humans do not attack, no, they wait until they return! This is just one example of a stupid story, but it will take too long to tell all.
