. . . And that's a bad thing, because at least if this was a film of Troma, it would have a chaos of chaos and a great feeling of abandoning anarchic which could bring my little rating. <br /> <br /> Why we have instead a very tame (rated PG), for a large amount of heat, low budget (Roger Corman produced by an unknown director who was finally unknown) Gremlins (1984) / Critters (1986) -andnabe with a special flat humor, a bit of logic that made Gremlins work very well - logical logic or not, no doubt, no sense of adventure, and no violence or weakness to create for it. Even though I am sure some problems with the film are natural in the script - let's say, no one can give this joke so they can be funny - it looks like a big blame should fall on the director's string, Bettina Hirsch . With more powerful hands, Munchies can be of entertainment. After all, it starts as many films of adventure. Simon Waterman (Harvey Korman) and his son Paul (Charles Stratton) are Peru's archaeological digging. Simon is the youngest of the wacky archaeologist who always floats the theory about the relationship between ancient sites and the alien civilization. For example, he thinks he sees evidence of cutting a laser on an ancient stone. So they are in Machu Picchu looking for more evidence of Simon's theories when they occur in a secret room. In them they quickly find animals that are later "Arnold", one of the leaves of the leaves. <br /> <br /> They take Arnold home to their small desert town of California. Simon, who thinks Arnold is perhaps a stranger, must go to a colleague's speech, and has a plan to tell his colleague that he is finally an example of a stranger. Paul and his best friend, Cindy (Nadine Van der Velde), are left in Arnold's payment, but since they have not met for a long time, they leave Arnold without consideration when they climb the sack. At the same time, Simon Cecil's brother (also played with Korman in the second role), the owner of a successful company of snack foods, has the desire to buy Simon's house and land - it's close to his own. Simon does not want to sell, so Cecil rejects the plan to steal Arnold. Materially comes from control, and munchies, who have a sense of going along with their desires for junk food, begins to lift the city. It reads better than summary than it plays on the screen. The best shots in the film are those with background backgrounds back, as well as the characters they run out of the desert city. Inside, except in the home of Cecil, it looks like non-cheap sets, cheap sets, indicating that Hirsch is not very knowledgeable in preventing and setting settings. Typically, due to the overall destruction of the design, the house of Cecil is quite a gem, closed as in the 1980s style under the brief description, and Cecil's stages, Dude (Jon Stafford), was an opposing command. So, very bad, it's out of the film very quickly. At any rate, Korman is a fun actor, but he comes very well here like Simon than Cecil. Unfortunately, Simon ends up with none of the films. Cecil, who is physically separated from the hair of ignorance and hair, not just the "bad capital" of the film, is one of Korman's uncomfortable, arrogant characters - which was one of its unique features, which are often placed in "Carol" Burnett Show "(1967) skits. Unlike" Carol Burnett Show ", which succeeded to succeed because the directors Clark Jones and Dave Powers had a learning method of pushing the skits only to the brink of chaos, Hirsch reins Korman by way too much, and the Cecil character just does not work in the right way. It is a lot of problems with the director, not the least wonky pacing and editing, which completely reduces the waiting or the most likely of the film. it would have to be a shoe for enhancing the game - like the munchies they treat the old woman on the road - they are put together so much to have a lot of effect. either stands. Where is the munchie in the room of Machu Picchu? The trailer of the film seems to show the answer to this, but it was altered out of the final cut. The biggest problem is that, unlike gremlins, there is no clear reason for the munchies to go from the cute furball, cuddly to dangerous monsters. It just happens. Additionally, because Munchies were saved PG, and the violence remains low, while the creatures in their monster phase, do not threaten. It is also easily used, at least for a while. True, the essence of the film is not a surprise, fear, compelling game or anything else, but humor. It focuses more on the spoof of Gremlins and off-offs offs off countless in his wife. The only problem with that is that the film is not good, though I beat it several times. The biggest percentage of joke is bland clich√©s. Many elements of the remaining items have no sequiturs. Due to the bad time from Hirsch, it all falls just flat. There was a possibility to make a film which during the spoof, it was exciting and frightening, highly hilarious and exciting, of cheesy and worried, both at the same time, the Killer Killer Klowns from Space Out (1988). So very bad, then, Munchies comes anywhere near it.
