This film is a great burden of the pant. Paul Schrader is completely lost in his worst screens. And his focus is on as much as it can be without actually being asleep during the process. The worst thing is Woody Harrelson, who I usually like to get well. He plays "walker", a gay man in D.C. who plays a friendly friend to the American intellectual women. He could not be more than a trend if he had been cut off in the newspaper and moved around by the camera on the popsicle stick. "His southern priority" is that "off the rack" version which decrescendos from the beginning to the end of each row he announced, as that the heat and humidity of the South are still draining it to every ounce of energy he has. It is monotonous. But, it's not very bad feeling in the film. His "boy", motivated by Moritz Bleibtreau, tries to affect some kind of Mid East emphasis which is very strange to give bad lines written for him. He can not win his r despite the fact that in real life he is German, and speaks several languages ​​- one of them is Italy! Is that a good reason to give someone else not to think? From the story, on the screens, redirect, camera function, for displays and titles, this film is bad from beginning to end. The only time to be eligible for this film came from three assistants: Lily Tomlin, Lauren Bacall, and Kristin Scott Thomas. Only these three could do it through this film and their respect for their courage. In fact, all three are excellent, despite being inserted into a very bad film. Unfortunately, no one can be good enough to redeem this endless series. If you like these three actors, look at something else. This movie is not suitable for your time.
