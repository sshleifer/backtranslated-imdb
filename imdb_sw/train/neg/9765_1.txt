I have never given them "those" many times, but if there was any film worthy of this kind of attention, it's "Gas!" This is a fun hobby that reaches some M * A * S * H ​​and it falls completely to his face in the attempt. I see what Corman went - Malcolm Marmorstein and Elliott Gould struggled to reproduce the Gould's disgusting role in the original version of M * A * S * H ​​and the same plot (in the movie "Whiffs"). "- see here on IMD, http://www.imdb.com / title / tt0073891 / for more information). <br /> <br /> Marmorstein and Gould got closer to the copper ring and "Whiffs" than Corman did with "Gas!" but he didn't get there. None of these films even close to the success of M * A * S * H. <br /> <br /> What is wrong with "Gas!"? What not? No one is close to acting at the highest level of the secondary secondary school. Production ethics. Another person here described the heads of the overturning on the getaway car, and there is more than a lack of attention. No work as required in this film, and nobody cares. <br /> <br /> "Gas!" really give me sleep. It is not a sure cure for sleep, but very close. On the scale of the Cinematic Sleep Induction, "Gas!" falls in the middle of the "Last Year in Marienbad" and George Clooney's record "Solaris" (which was itself extraordinary to be worse than Mosfilm's original, despite the unusual appearance of the studio and the idea of ​​keeping the attention of A viewer with a prudent editing. br>> <br /> Traditional editing would have decreased "Gas!" up to twenty minutes. The results will not be meaningful, but no more than the original film. Some movies are too bad to have a compelling quality that makes them worth watching at any time. This is not one of them. Don't waste your time. It's not even worse.
