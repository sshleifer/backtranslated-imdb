The stars of jealousy are even better. Jack Black, Ben Stiller, Amy Poehler, and great Christopher Walken. For such a cast, one can only expect the best. However, for "envy", no one can save this disaster. Tim Dingman (Stiller) and Nick Vanderpark (Black) are best friends and colleagues at the sandpaper factory. All of them are doing a good life, but because Tim has a better performance, he has the ability to afford more than his friend Nick. Nick is a dream who always comes with new ideas for innovation. One day, Nick comes up with the idea of ​​spraying that makes the dog disappear (Yes, I am bad). Falling in love with the idea, Nick decides to produce this product. He gives Tim to invest in his idea and share 50/50 benefits. Tim refuses to think that idea will never be used. Nick's invention, called "va-poo-rize" (again, I am bad), has already made millions. He enjoys spending his money on things like a big house, a horse, a private teacher, and a fancy desert. Tim feels jealous of Nick. So the name of the movie. <br /> <br /> The concept is not bad, but it still gets worse. This movie has some bad conversations and very good performances from each cast. Then again, as I said earlier, no one can save this mess. Even the great Christoper Walken, playing an unhappy character called "J-man", made this amazing film. The movie is bad since the beginning and it just keeps getting worse. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie if: * you like to decorate (no planned pun) * you want to see Jack Black in tux white / / <br /> I say, avoid this film at all costs, but avoid specific as: * you are experiencing the humor of the bathroom * you love animals
