This movie has one feature of redemption. At one time, after a character attacked by a fairy-wielding, his brother asks, "Why your dick on there, Chuck?" After suffering for about an hour of bad films, this almost made me drink to get my nose. <br /> <br /> Some of the actors are not very bad, but all children coming up with PJ Soles should be embarrassed by making this film. The story is weak and no one does what you think (or what the common meaning is required) should. Of course, there are many points of stories that do not add. For example, in one area ghosts of small children should concentrate on moving the physical object so that they can prove that they are, harder because they seem unable to interact with physical things. However, a minute later all takes branches down and beat Fairy Too with them. It seems they can sometimes move the thing and sometimes they can't. Go to think. <br /> <br /> A lot of blood and weeds, though ... few good boobs. But this does not make you fail. <br /> <br /> If you want a film about Fairy Tooth, go to "Darkness Falls". I think it's good, although most of the other consultants don't share my opinion. At least puts the mood.
