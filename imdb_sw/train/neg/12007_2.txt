It is amazing to see how Nikhil Advani can attract people to the theater until that day of release. I mean ..... look at the cast here, promote it better, good songs are good and trailers are good. This makes the house full on the first day, but only when people go and see the film they know that there is no way to earn their money. The house is full of the first day, the movie is out next week. This film, directed by 'True Love' is what they say, did not manage to handle all thrown well. They tried to put in a big star but ended up and even manage to even bring the average performance to anyone. Stories are holes and cheesy, so the listeners can not connect with any of them. It is a great desire for all who love a great star or for that Nikhil Advani after its great achievement of 'Kal Ho Na Ho'.
