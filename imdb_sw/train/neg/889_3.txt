I've never gone to Paris, but after seeing "Paris, Do t'aime" I am mad to visit this city! I've been NY several times and I love the city and its councils. I expected to react to this film, feel like jumping into the airplane and jumping there once, but, see, I see, I regret the time and money I spent with it. There are no stories of love between people or man and city. There are many workless meetings and relationships or people who know and do not work well. Perhaps this shows the attitude of the city, where it is said to have thousands of people living alone. Can't find love in New York?
