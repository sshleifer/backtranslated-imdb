I am so surprised to see this high standard for this film, and for a few comments that there are positive. I saw the movie and it was very broken. I wasn't very happy. It was slow, and it does not worth the entertainment. Even the murderous scenes are lackluster, with real close-up shots of generic stabbings that don't look quite good. And assuming moving to the end is not true, I have seen it coming, and then the end would look like a cliche. This film cannot mention a lot, but with the little that it takes, it is inserted. I will not recommend this film.
