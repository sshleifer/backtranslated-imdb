The plan to fight, offensive and small characters (to say at least) the dialogue generated by this TV production that is not possible to be even interesting for the budget of a billion dollars. The characters are not trusted, for their purposes, actions or their known functions. The plot reads as bad Dungeons and Dragons (TM) hack but with plasma weapons and power fields. There are persistent issues of continuous and ineffective cooperation between the characters with this author, at least, hating them. Avoid as a blow. See any part of the Angel of Darkness and you will be better to act, talk and plot. Yuck.
