Basically what we have here is a little more than a modern remake of the kitsch of the '1970 Line' which was common as this cobblers, also made part of a low-ground Aldwych base. The Jubilee Line platforms now used in Charing Cross as well as Aldwych mentioned earlier, this film has the basis of the same zombie and dodgy killed mad in the tunnels preparing on lost riders who missed the last train - nature is not the strength of this film. It really does not fail. The starting point for the poorest to the greatest of the gory when the small Gollumu nutrium is not fully explained as shown less than the low-development device. <br /> <br /> Franke Polente is less and thin script than run multiple tunnels and shouting every time, in fact it was just like everybody else in this film, out-acted with a little dog with a tame mouse. <br /> <br /> Like the creepy film imposed on the Underground of London is your pocket, or just want to play 'spot area of ​​the tube' they take this on DVD when hits bin bargain. If you are looking for ethnic fear, go give him a copy of the Death Death (given the Animal Meat).
