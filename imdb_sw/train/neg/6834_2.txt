Gee, it's a heck of the movie! ... I said I wanted to be a professional in bad movies from all the decades, so I decided to start with this. It was a good choice enough. I entered this adventure to get lost jewelery and an unidentified exercise, but I didn't see anything like that in the pastel color. I haven't seen so many bad films before, but I've got this feeling that's called "very bad that's good", perhaps because it's so wonderful without fun! First of all, there are things wrong. There is precision regarding the plot, physical accuracy, and not the psychological correctness. Ultimately it is mad as the ass of the Van Damme ass in the blue spandex. A very large line exists and I can't even start talking about some of the hilarious action steps. There is no bad thing to do from everyone who is involved in the fire of the movie, except in some case. Geoffrey Lewis looks at the most pathetic as Frank, which is totally stupid. And, honestly, I was very surprised to see that Van Damme did a good job of playing twins. He succeeded in achieving the voices and feelings in two roles that influenced me. But the movie was very bad and sad part is that it was produced by a large label of photo studio ... which is now bankrupt.
