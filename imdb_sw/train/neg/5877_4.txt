Williamson's emphasis is difficult to walk. He speaks very fast, as he jumps to the rush lines. During soliloquies he does as he speaks to someone, when he should talk to himself. All of this and his bald spot heard me. He was too old for this role. In reading other accounts of Williamson, he probably got this responsibility because he was insane and the director decided to do a bit of life-imitation-art or forced to act. When vendors advertise madness believers! Marianne Faithful is a wonderful beauty and can beat the place of Ophelia and still gets. Seti is dark and spread forward but it looks like a bullet in a real castle especially events in tunnels / corridors where the dead king shines like a great light in heaven.
