Wow is an amazing thing since this film came out for some time I think someone else watched it some days ago. Every way, I watched this film just because it has Nick Stahl, for the record. </> <br /> The movie was ridiculous. Anime dismissed INSANE, were SO Clich√© and STEREOTYPED. This movie had the worst talks I heard. It had a lot of way out. <br /> <br /> There is one place in the movie to see yet, the scene: "A bright heart, a cool gun" where Nick Stahl kills a terrible girl in the shower. (Indeed, in fact they were all worried.) But his acting in the area was better. Looking up his face, remember my American Psycho (a good movie). The area is worth seeing but not worth seeing all the movie for, making yourself grace and not looking at it.
