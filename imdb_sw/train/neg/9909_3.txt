This was not very good west. You have found this nut running around the sun in a buggy and parasol on it, killing people for its own sake. You have this person sitting in the snow cage during the blizzard, cutting pieces of his anatomy which has been frostbitten. Then you have found a woman in the house out in the middle of a bullet that does not exist. What? What is this film? Couldn't Bruce Dern find something better to do? This was a loss of film.
