One can cope with historical accuracy, but this film was just too much. Certainly nothing was close to the truth, and even at that time, it seemed like a fool. In the protection of the ford, it was revealed in an old discussion show, that he was working on the story as he told the real Wyatt Earp, who was old, many years old, and playing his own way. Earp told the director about the hippo, and how it was planned to occur during the return of the basket, so despite what other historians claim, Wyat himself says that it was prepared. <br /> <br /> This movie shows Macho as a honest person, and also his brothers. History does not say that they were or did not. Many people like to interfere with fraud and rebellion in their characters, but that's not new. The truth is around them to be a permanent law of GUNFIGHT IN CORRAL. The men who saw it as work, and believe me, in the old West, you had no time to think about many more things. Characteristics that do not exist, characters are shown to die corral who was not true, all makes this film weak. More failed by the Older, who did not make a Doc-tempting document. He may be more selective than previous for Doc, but at the same time we should remember that the old films were close to the era and close to the real feel. After all, ford received the first information from Wyatt Earp. It has also been reduced by all events that can be predicted to include a Mexican girl. Hollywood was a very Nazi pro in those days, and ready to kill brunette women in the style of predicting to show their securities Hitler idealism. This happens in many movies until eight years. It is not excuse, and it reduces the price of art, however. <br /> <br /> Artists playing Earps are doing well, and Brennan always enjoys. In fact, Maturity can be alone under this flick. However, it is more weak than the old Corral movies.
