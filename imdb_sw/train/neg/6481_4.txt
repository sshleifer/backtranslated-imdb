Since the Little Mermaid was one of my favorite Disney movies when I was young, I was interested in expression. The Little Mermaid (single) is a feature of common animation and everything of high quality, great music marker, and general audience goals. On the contrary, the Little Mermaid 2 focuses primarily on young children, because it is instant, it shows a personal view of the child, music is bouncier and less surprising, and the latter feels like flying. <br /> <br /> Little Mermaid 2 begins when the baby Melody is given to Ariel's family side. Suddenly without any cues to see to help the curves, the main hub takes the child. I laughed, waiting a minute is not funny, attacked by a child! Okay, I will stop laughing. Morgana's crime by day and wind, eliminates enough game since it happened quickly. <br /> <br /> In this feature, Melody seems to be superhuman, which I advocate is how many kids see themselves. This character in the behavior of Melody seems clear towards the end when he fights Morgana without an inch of fear on his face. <br /> <br /> Like the first movie, Melody has many problems with Ariel, except the opposite. Queen Ariel returns to be like her father by stopping him from the sea, when King Triton prevented Ariel from the top. Ariel and Melody all rebel against their parent. <br /> <br /> Music causes more emotion in the first. This end has a bunch of songs, but not many orchestral functions into it. It is good for young children, because it does not take orchestra to attract. <br /> <br /> Last in the first movie was established and strengthened. The end is near the bouncy song and everyone who plays in the water. It is more obviously targeted for children, because instead of being left out and stops being beaten off, this end lets you think, "It's time to fly!" Finally, this film is fun for children, so we should give them pleasure.
