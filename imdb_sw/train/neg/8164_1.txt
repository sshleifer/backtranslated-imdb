I saw this movie on real cinema movies (probably $ 2.00 one) and my cousin and uncle. We were around 11 and 12, I think, and actually in awesome movies. I remember it's very excited to see it because my uncle's uncle leaves us to take a film (and maybe we did not do it again!) And sooo disappointed later! Just boring and not scary. The only thing that I can remember was Corky Pigeon from Spoons of Money, and that big silo, just the man I knew. I have seen bad movies before and this is always stuck in my mind as the worst. This was due to what I can remember, one of the losses of $ 6, as well as losing the film. I have read some of the comments that it says are worth looking and I say, "And each one of them," but I will not bother. Not very bad is good.
