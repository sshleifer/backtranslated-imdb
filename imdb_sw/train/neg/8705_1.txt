This movie is the worst movie I've ever seen ... it is a bad thing. All the time I was watching the semi-expected music to start with the doctor starts playing. (I've seen porno with a better plot) When raptor trying to enter the door I think someone was casting a plastic doll against the door from around 2 feet away. But as I said it is so bad you need to look at it so you can see how bad it is to say that it will not do anything compared to if you look at it. I couldn't look over 30min but if you could stay with the whole thing then you have good ability
