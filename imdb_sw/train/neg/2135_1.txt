Just just trash. I am a great fan of Cusacks, this is the only reason I watched this film, but the only reason I can see for their existence was the renewal, in full and at a lesser degree, their actual roles from Grosse Point Blanc. In addition to this, the role of the film as a political satire fails to sadly to be very obvious even to even more legal there to serve any purpose. And charged as a satirical satire will only be a clear insult even for chimps. Copying, it is obviously a way to defend yourself, but to see if this is not close to Grosse Point Blanc and in the same league of encounter (see if your spirit) of Spartans for political satire, it allows you to leave enough only with this is done in the best fit.
