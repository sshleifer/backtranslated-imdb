Alexandre Aja's Record of The Hills Have Eyes was one of the most beautiful of 2006. Not only was the film remake of fear, but it was also very good too. So, about a year later, we are taken to the remake series. When the original script of Wes Craven is back as a producer and scripted, this film fails to increase the level set by the original and remake. A group of military assistants are standing in the wilderness to consider some scientists and get the race of the mutant family from the first film (at least what remains with some new ones). There's a lot of gore being here. What bothers me about this film is a great lack of reputation. The viewer does not see a girl on what happens to any of these people because we didn't find them. Even the mutants had a certain last time out and this time, no. Gore for gore is useless. There is a need for this to happen to be interesting. Nothing happens here is interesting. And what recently have rape cases in the film? Here we find another one for the real reason. We hope this is one set of mountains that will never be visited.
