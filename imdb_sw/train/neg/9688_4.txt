Greenaway films create as clever, mad and creative. However his style and grammar comes from and reminds viewers of films made during World War I film: the structure of the shape, the use of the middle of the shot, the static camera. It can be good to rub on regular movies and this style but not new. Maybe like another "inventor", TS Eliot, more motivating from the past than to look forward to if the real founder could or could. The worst case of Greeneway is that he cannot write. His discussion and plot structure is mechanical and logical but without the life of another wonderful manufacturer, Brecht. Where this weakness is more evident in its humor, which is understood and wise, so the joke is dead before release. The result is decreasing: if not funny, failed: ask the player to stand up to justify their action if the audience does not respond. Perhaps a good reader can learn something from Freud on humor. Finally, as Woody Allen, Greenaway has led its administrators over the years to work as clones. They say the lines and breeze air, with the head of the narcissistic youth / split the film, despite its design and lighting, is wonderful.
