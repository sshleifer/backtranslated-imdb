I can't say this is the worst movie all the time, but just because there are still movies I haven't seen, yet! This should be an attempt to defend more in making the film at all times! The director emerges with issues like "There Will Be Blood" (although it was not the worst in the film) the whole movie feels like you are looking at someone trying to impress him more than his ability. It is as if he is sitting in his chairman's small chair and he thinks "a good film player who can handle this area?" She does not have anything in it. I don't know if this film can be saved by a famous film manufacturer. certainly some of the great nuggets that would have been beaten, but nothing was given to cooked. The hole where all the players are singing is the worst time in the history of the movie. PLEASE, just have no one beside singing singing, too! " Indeed, MASSIVE FAILURE!
