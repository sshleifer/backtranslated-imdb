... this verson does not eat that bad bard. It is still a minor damage to production, the Dutch uncle of Hamlet is undoubtedly called the Spaniard (as Ricardo Montalban or not under discussion), and Maximilian Schell is winning as never before. A lot of conversation is done in a non-sense manner, and the fact that the MST3K version feels that it should be repeated again that the dialogue is long * duh * does not bother as much more surprising. Many are just acting badly, though.
