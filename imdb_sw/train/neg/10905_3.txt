Guy is a failure. Can't find girls, it needs to build, taken by the most powerful guys, etc. See, see, move forward. I would say that Rob needs to move part of Adam Sandler part of his life. And leave the fields of Adam Sandler. There are two funny sections in the entire movie. I could not even finish the last 5 minutes. I was exhausted. "Animal" is a good film. I often enjoy the movies of Adam Sandler which have the same plot. But this was very trying to attract them. Jokes are very old. So, I believe. This is not a film that most people can enter. But others did, I would enjoy it. <br /> <br /> 3/10
