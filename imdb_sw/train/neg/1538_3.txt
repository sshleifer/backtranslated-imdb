It is a disgrace that a good director like Andre de Toth who included a moving coalition, had no first victory. He would be helped to bring real strength, especially to the impressive character played by William Bishop. As the movie stands, it's a lot of confusion (as described by the expert Chipe). The main problems include direction, cheap budget, and poor script. Power is located in the best cast with an impressive general concept - characters are provided in different ways by matching forces. What is needed is a person who has enough vision to integrate the elements well to re-approve the script in a certain form of solidarity, rather than an unforgettable mess, that is, (try to explore arguments and predictions if you can). Also, a large budget can be compatible with the area that differs from the studio shots, and find out the outside outside of the outside of LA. The real embarrassment lies in losing the best - Hayden, Taylor (before his teeth inserted), Dehner, Reeves, and James Millican and William Bishop shortly before their deaths. Short films show the importance of the artist-and-more vision of the West of non-mysterious, which, in the right hand, would be very much.
