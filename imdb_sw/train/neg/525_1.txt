I looked at the other opinion and was very worried to see that only people who actually worked on the film had suggested. I mean, I hate to say bad things about amateur production, but if you make a bad movie and want to comment on it, drop a little drop. "Horror" is a little more on. This is Boston's primary college production which does not reach the university's highest level. What you would like to expect a group of children to do. Unrecognized movies without much innovation. It is very good if you are interested in it. It is not something you will see unless you are a student at Emerson College.
