I have seen all four movies in this series. Everyone causes more and more from books. This is worse yet. My problem is that it does not obey the so-called book after any way! Directors and producers should call any name except "The Continuing Love of Love." The only thing about this movie that matches the book is the names of the characters (Willie, Missie, Henry, Clark, Scottie and Cookie). The names / age / gender of children are correct. The whole story line is not where in the book. I think it's a great safe for Janette Oke, her books and her fans to produce films under her head that is not correct in any way. Music is too great. Artists do not accept - they have no feelings. <br /> <br /> If you want a good family family, this can do. It's clean. Don't look at it, however, if you are expecting a closed version of the book. I hope that this will be the last movie from this series, but I'm sure that. If there are so many movies done, I would like Michael Landon, Jr and others would put a stick around a natural plot and story. Books are excellent and, if followed closely, would make the best movies!
