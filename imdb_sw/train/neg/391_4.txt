For the first summer seasons, I thought Learner was a show of engaging and exciting. The mix between the truth of the television and the job interview of 16 weeks was creative, and the producers of the show were able to show the relevant show and also "out there". <br /> <br /> The new season 6 is nothing more than a big joke and does not quite do with the business - at all. In the early season they focused more on business-related activities - now the focus is more on the hall where the fighters are expected to do everything to put them on the show (which means false, sleep-talking, backstabbing etc.). Apartment can be a fun watch, but it is entertaining at the bottom stage - Sometimes you wonder if you are looking for a repeat of the old Jerry Springer period. Work in the show is, more, boring and especially showing for companies who are dumb enough to pay NBC for broadcasting. And what about half of the fighters living in the tent season 6? That's just stupid and has nothing to do with business in real life. I don't have any respect for any opponents this season, they all seem like me. In the previous seasons at least some fighters had little loyalty, now it seems like the fighters would kill their mother to put them on the show. It also seems like a big deal of Donald Trump becomes bigger and bigger for each season that passes and becomes honest, I can't see why a person with a common sense would like to serve him. His understanding in the hall room has no particular meaning at times and sometimes seems to like to hide people for what it deserves. <br /> <br /> R.I.P Student. Please NBC, for God, show the air as soon as possible. It's just a shy look. The student was once a big television, but now it's a great shock of oil.
