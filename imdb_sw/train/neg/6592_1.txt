Short summary: This movie undermines everyone who touches. That means you. <br /> <br /> First, allow me to say not purist, and this can be fun for a few minutes. Simulation is not bad. But it is generally light and very unhappy. A few simple jokes are repeated again and again. It is clear that these movies are only available to minimize the previous dollar from Laurel and Hardy now. Producers cannot fully respect their location in the history of the film, or their talents. This was what I enjoyed most. <br /> <br /> Of course, my daughter liked it, so I also failed as a parent;)
