I can't help but think back to the mask: the growing leslie vernon (massively more massive film) while watching this because of feeling real and also a great creative idea. this can be a great film. Acting is ... from some of the same actors. from others ... it's very bad. <br /> <br /> that aside the idea is great and the structure is huge. The story is also very good, although it is often caused due to serious blows to logical mind. Do you never think that although it's right? It's a terrible movie after all. <br /> <br /> I want to see this remade ... I want to be a wonderful film that wants to be. <br /> <br /> however (and you can't sense mind behind the movie for this) this is clearly built on the shoe shoe budget. and fx hurts the film. <br /> <br /> Great movie. ... if you swap the best efficiency with a little fx. Anyone who wrote that should continue, though, a great idea here.
