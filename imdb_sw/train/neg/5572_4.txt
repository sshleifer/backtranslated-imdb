However there is another color excuse for men in rubber suits to fight. During this time, future travelers arrive in 1992 and employ a few people to return them in 1944 and prevent the creation of Godzilla, thus saving Japan later from destruction. But after completing this task, the time travelers are exposed to a group of two criminals whose creature goes to the rampage, and without Godzilla stop it? Eek! It all feels very silly, and maybe it's, but the plot is amazingly decent and the last battle looks good too. Unfortunately, the rest of the visual impact is just garbage rather than fun rubbish, and the movie turns lighter as its predecessors. Look for the joke of Spielberg.
