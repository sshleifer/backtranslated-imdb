I haven't seen anything wrong since I left the movie James Bond "Moonraker" twenty years ago. I was able to stay in the fullness of this just because of Tilda Swinton, but there was nothing he could do to save this animal. As a cross between "Pi", "Orlando", and "Tron", this film has failed very much in every transfer element. The characters were cardboard and they can not delete any kind of sympathy. The plan was not quite reliable. Acting was, except Swinton, amateur. Computer photos were worse than "Tron." Timothy Leary was very bitter. I could continue, but what is the point. The only thing I can say about this film is that Tilda Swinton was in it. I don't know why the caliber actor agreed to appear in such a dud, but he might be proud of it now. Don't lose your money or your time on this stinker. There is nothing worth seeing here.
