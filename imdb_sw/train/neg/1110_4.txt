One hour, eight minutes and twelve seconds on this flick and I decided it was too blind. That was right after Hopalong's drops (Chris Lybbert) on his horse from the tree to join a good man. I was very good with Hopalong Cassidy / Great Bar 20 that didn't translate anything. In fact, the name of Coppola in these features could not do anything to ensure efficiency here, even more than one listed. If you do the end of the film, you will probably raise the same questions I did. What hook and gloves? What is the state of rodeo? Who was the stranger to represent? Why did they make this film? I would probably have continued but my energy was invented. See, already there is a West named "Gun Gunner" from 1950 and a young man named Gregory Peck as a head character. Investigating it will make you feel better if this view makes you feel bad. That I can recommend.
