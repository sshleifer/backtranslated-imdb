This movie was perhaps the biggest waste of my life forever. Acting was sad. Jordan Hinson could not express any emotion. At the beginning of the movie, he had to despair. Instead, he hit his head and his lower lip stopped. He moved with sadness without any tears to the cry area. I was almost angry that from all the girls who wanted to become actors, they had to get rid of him. Everyone else had suffered from working more. It was flat out of terrible. It was also insulting to figure skaters. The Jordan took a month to teach, and threw him as an Olympic team. It is practically hitting the spit on real effort to skaters the figures put into their work. Forgiveness of compassion for the film, and a sad attempt to involve hockey and skating. Don't lose your life. Not even one star.
