Stewart Moss's stars as a scientist who is on his way to work with his wife, and one feels that he was taken for this role by his ability to tell his eyes in his head ... consider the inspection for this. no, not at all, thank you, next! ‚Äù. However, he was beaten with a bat, and then, he either changed or some sort of creation and killed people or .... he didn't. For no one else sees his amazing change, but he seems to think that he is changing because his wedding ring breaks when his hands turn to the claws, etc. With his movie credit has a kind of hold if he is just a nuts or if he is actually transform into something until the very end. This has a good place and a kind of respectable environment sometimes but unfortunately none of them can do with a story of disability and a very serious act. The kind of fun "bad way is good", but it looks more towards just the worst. 4 out of 10.
