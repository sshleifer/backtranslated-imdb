Be honest I knew what to expect before watching this film, and I must say it has the worst job I've ever seen. You do not have time, and at a comedy level is very entertaining, but I'm afraid it is not scary, and ignorance is taken on a new level. There is a lot of unwanted gore, and the plot is on the place. I don't know why the aliens were evil, and why they came even to this part of the wales, (who would go there anyway?) But I didn't care at that time, because I was worried about clothing, and bad CGI. In addition to B movies, you deserve the name of 'bad, good', and kudos for filmmakers, because they probably knew what they did. Long these films continue .....
