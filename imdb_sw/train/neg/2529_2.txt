Bobby is a good child who says very much and wants sex. So he buys van to help in this effort. Acting is blind, comedy is pathetic and script is more than a loosely strung chain of clichés and cheaper prices. The filmmakers wanted to capture some of the outdoor films of some time, but fell a long way. Even Bobby is putting it down on banana skins, because this will mean adding comedic value. I'm trying to find a feature of film redemption. If you would like DeVito, this is another role of DeVito - but he is just an actor to help and there for a cliché value.
