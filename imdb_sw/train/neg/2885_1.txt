I can't say what I think about this film, against the guidelines, I have watched many films, and this should be worse, it's still a very low budget, I think all the money has gone into slaughter houses, because I could do better and b & w 8mm camera with monkeys employees. It was so bad that I registered to leave a comment, because I had told someone, the chance to rent a movie was not available. But this is my 2 cents worth, I would recommend from a poor sap sap who leased and looked at himself. Because I certainly don't lose money on myself again. Now I leave these comments. I hope you won't be done in the rental area when they return your money .. =)
