Man brings his new wife to his home where his former wife died to "crash". His new wife has just been released from the institution and is also very rich! Suddenly she begins to hear the noise and see the skull around the place. What? Is he going again mad or is the first wife raised from the dead? You probably thought the end could not be called. I often saw Saturday afternoon TV as a child. Back, I loved but I was small. Seeing now I see how bad it is. It works very well, written badly, very unknown (even an hour) and has thrown to five people (one to be a director)! It still has good things about it. Music is very interesting and put it in itself with a large empty house and a nearby pool is very good. There is also a short time of horror (I jumped a little when he saw the first skull) and ended up somehow. Both are not really a good film ... but not a general disaster. It consists of the following small worship. I give them 2. <br /> <br /> Also try to avoid the DVD version of the elite with their version (organized by the "Attack of Leaphes Giant"). Standing in the FULL frame and jumps and scratches around. It wasn't even this bad look on TV!
