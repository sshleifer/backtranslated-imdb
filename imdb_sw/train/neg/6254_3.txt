My friend was in a stroke as a FEDS agent (not talking, if I remember). He brought it to the DVD so I could see it. It was "interesting", but it felt like a amateur film. Interested film, though. Really interesting and badly written. Perhaps it was fun to do and share, but it certainly didn't deserve any kind of release. Maybe in Omaha they will enjoy, but the California girl was tired and honestly kind of embarrassing for my friend's participation. <br /> <br /> If this filmmaker has done or does any film more, he should try to have a line of interesting stories, and GOOD executives. I am sure this was a great learning tool for them. I wish you luck in the future, and hope they can improve their films.
