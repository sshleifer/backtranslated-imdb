It seems that most viewer does not know anything about European history, including Germany, Hungary and all Central and Eastern Europe as well as Hitler and Stalin Era. Nuremberg (and many trials have been forgotten throughout Europe) was revenge and the exploitation of the winners. What do you think, why didn't you have American, British, French or Soviet suspects after WWII? There was no US, UK etc. war crimes? No Hiroshima, no Nagasaki, no Tokyo, no Dresden, no Hamburg, no Berlin, no Katyn and so on? The Germans had war crimes too, but in Nuremberg right did not consider real. The main thing was: Vae victis! Germany must be destroyed! (That was also the name of the book in America, 1941.) This film is the American brain of the most frightening brain, with error, lies, propaganda, hatred and injustice. And the first: full of hypocrisy. But it is not surprising ... Why did not have enough Nuremberg process itself? This film is a dream. Total dark after 60 years! Darkness (and hatred and narcissism and lack of resistance) are the real causes of murder in Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia, Serbia, Iraq and so on. And no American criminals of war ... Bravo, America! Sneaky. Even Stalin would be jealous ...
