Sadly, less than ups. The program was very good. I mean, there is nothing out of the ordinary, but it had a story, different from other modern fricks of fear. Another good thing was hit. I did not say that acting was good, because it was not, but every actor / actor was bright and interesting. One of the bottom is that the movie just enjoys after the first 40 minutes or so. These resorts were quite boring. Another down (or you can consider if you want) is impurities. All 4 girls were on a few minutes, and all the boys showed their seats for a long time. It's not that I am against dirt, but this was a terrible movie, not 'The Dreamers'. Unless you deserve to look at someone to remove his swimsuit and run naked for a few minutes, or see a girl getting naked for any reason, or you are a fan of the hard of Debbie Rochon, than this is your movie. But if you are looking for a good movie, stay away.
