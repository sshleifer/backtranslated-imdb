Phew - I have nothing to say. This is a film that can be very good with a group of stone viewers. Some actors reminded me of earlier versions of John Waters. Maybe I must get back - I don't want to dare to water as a director / story. I really loved the lawyer taking over "the full passage of faith and trust". It is "full faith and loan," by the way! This also reminds me of "Conrad's children," where the main actors are also the author, director, film editor, etc.. Most of the activities involved as much as possible are the best left for seasoned film professionals who will be able to technical (even stunt, others can say) pull something like that.
