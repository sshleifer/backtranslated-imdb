I thought this was a great idea but, young man, it had been done well. We get a broad meaning of how difficult and challenging the backstage activities of the show are, but almost no special on any of the work. Manufacturers don't seem to have found any way to tell stories or give viewers "through-line." (Which they will not say they did not try, but having sample artists explain the cycle of the Ring as the app details do not tell us about the work of strengthening opera.) what people do and why. There is a sense of who is, or how different departments of production are effective and working together. For example, several times we hear about some kind of problem - one expects then to see the problem and its results and / or how it can be resolved. But instead of the creators of the film only eliminates something else (usually, the pictures of people who pick things up or talk in the head of the head.) \ T see run under the mortgage install of the show, rather than anything worth looking for its own reputation.
