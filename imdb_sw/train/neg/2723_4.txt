Claire Denis's movies appear to fall into two categories: violence and bloody or quiet and close. "L'Intrus" definitely comes in the first category, but it's not as bad as "Everyday Problem" or "I don't care." Now, since I saw "Chocolat," I have put the stage to see every new movie Denis makes. And I am always disappointed. "L'Intrus" was no different. He still makes a film as personal and moving as the first. You often get the most common Denis: Béatrice Dalle's young but still beautiful who is seen in the film just to show her perfect lips, the gap between her teeth, her severe severity, and several beautiful dresses ; black man from "trouble every day" and "I don't care," Grégoire Colin, and a Lithuanian or Russian girl. Michel Subor's behavior was interesting, but the camera played him so long that I was angry with the hair of the head hanging on his forehead and opened at a time, somewhere in Korea, I think, finally was cut. Surely there is a point - a sharp murder, looking for a child for a child - and there may be a conspiracy, but one look was not there to see it, and two views are, I fear, out of question. For one thing, the mark was jarring and obtrusive (as in "Beau Travail"). For another, the season also changed suddenly, leaving you even more confused about what went on. Oh, there were a few good shots, and if you liked "Friday evening" with its shades of tiny buttons and many passages, you can appreciate the aesthetics of "L'Intrus." Otherwise, clear. I saw this movie in French and I probably missed something important. But the talk in the movie Denis often has more than five pages, two positions and significantly. In "Chocolat" silently; in "L'Intrus," is just bad.
