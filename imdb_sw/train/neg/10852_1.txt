This film is a very interesting film. Violence is bad, acting is ... Well Dan, stick to sing or shout or whatever hell you usually do. The random chicks will wear anything hard to catch goth lads-frustrated in. Personally, I think this movie tries to exploit. Stories and characters We can be very good, if we say to lead, executives and other things of nibby were done well. But the film is just bad, the only reason people like this piece is because they have Danni in it. This film is likely to film B more than ever. And, you believe that it's hard to reach, especially when you compete with Def and Temptation and on crappy excuses for "big" cinema panic. It's not a fan of CoF, and so I see this as another garbage movie ... It's very bad. If Dani did it as a comedy then, good go to him. It's done very well. In addition, however, I weigh it down, because it is interesting. Watch when you have fun, fun, fun mode and you can laugh everything or if you're on top of a variety of drugs.
