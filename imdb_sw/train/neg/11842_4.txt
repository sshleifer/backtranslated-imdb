Kirsten Dunst is very entertained as an actor. You can always tell him "makes" only. I would Izzard though. Plot is boring boring. The viewer has no real relationship with the characters, never knows who is listening, or even caring. Small movie, red, and some laugh, but it's a few and not very funny. Plot does not share or insist for at least. You can see every plot returns miles away. What? What should this film be? Quests? Drama? Who cares? You can't end this film.
