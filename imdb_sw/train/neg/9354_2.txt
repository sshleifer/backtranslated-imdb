There is an important feature of the film that Jobson has forgotten - has the ability to tell stories by showing you. You don't need to tell the audience what to think, because they will see it. The step here is included by some of the most beautiful comments made by the non-viewable public - the five-year-old purple system. And it must be necessary because they are good cast here and some beautifully composed and shot. Perhaps Jobbo felt that the basic story needs little help. And it can be correct, without a basic fidelity: 70s Edinburgh was not quite perfect for the brainy girls with penchant for Velvet Underground and soft spot for the pass category. From the very beautiful and new clothes that the character dresses for the cod mind which tries to integrate all together, it all comes from my taste.
