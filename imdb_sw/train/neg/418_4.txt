One might have the idea that good as a "invisible person" will work well and be dealt with carefully during the terrible effects, but not so. Stories, characters and, finally, the last 20 minutes of the film are about clean as a net-mad scientist from the last 50 years. There are some good moments, especially because of the amazing surprises and the idea of ​​an invisible person around the street. But alas, we are soon back in a little underground laboratory, which means that all the film can not only predict, but plans. There has been many remake of old films or television shows over the last 10 years, and some of them have their will. But it becomes more clear and open to each film that the idea of ​​putting classic ol under the grasses of interested people like Verhoeven (who has his time) is very bad. It is obvious that money is the main issue here: time and energy imposed in the script are not close enough and enough, and as a result, "Sneaky man" is very despicable and clichés, characters of sappy, predictions and lack of detail. However, one thing that was interesting to me, instead of special effects, was to swear. When making this type of film, modern manufacturers want to allow children to see them. So, language (and, sometimes, abuse and sex) are toned down. When the whole world opens, good people go "Oh darn!" and "Oh my God". "Hollow Man" carefully searches for that kind of hypocrisy and characters have the freedom to say what comes naturally to them. I don't say that the most natural answer to something that is missing is to swear - but it makes it more reliable if someone swears. I think we can thank Verhoeven for it.
