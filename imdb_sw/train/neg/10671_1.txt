MST 3000 should make this film. It's the worst movie ever seen. First, you see that the shooter does not have a bank account with no history since leaving the army in 1993 and paying its taxes in cash. There is no way in hell that such a person will be allowed to be close to the president without mentioning the work on the profile. Also, the security head for POTHUS would not be so emotional that he would start drinking in the haze if the President was shot. This movie was monitored. I can't express the sharp that this film was. Each actor was awesome. Even chick in the trailer reserve. I adorn this garbage. It is a waste of time.
