Just right. I just watched the film's load - all with different degrees of quality. I wasn't very sure about what I wanted to explore first. Then hit me like a sack-mouse: Rodentz. Warn people about Rodentz. These destructive stars are empty and it is very painful to stay. And it's about mutant mice killing people. O ... real freaking 'nature. "Gods Food," or "Willard" any? Those were better than this, and that didn't mean much ... <br /> <br /> ** INFORMATION EXPERIENCE ** Accurate here is the story: Inna's science scientist and his assistant try the mouse and their laboratory is in the neighborhood of The crappy and the crappy building and the pastor's pastor are shown a drunk and everyone becomes a mouse to the lost mouse and almost everyone is dead and, oh, there is one big mouse that seems to be futile, but is killed, the end. There, all in one sentence! Spoiler, you say? Ppfff !! I beg different! The second thing we all know is that there is a big mouse, we all know that eventually death! ** THE END OF THE END ** <br /> <br /> Here's a break: <br /> <br /> Good: <br /> <br /> - Go, I watched it for free, but for everyone else. .. hmmm, no. There is nothing good here. It doesn't hurt, doesn't help: <br /> <br /> --Um ... well. gore was good. - All of the cinema movies. CG rats are not as bad as they can be in some shots ... <br /> <br /> Bad: <br /> <br /> - .. and in other shots, CG rats were cheaper. See, if your film has a small budget, perhaps you should rely on CG. Study focus. <br /> <br /> - Acting is very poor <br /> <br /> - Characters can't be awesome - we have a mish-mash of clich√©s and none of them happens well. <br /> <br /> --Booooooooooooring. <br /> <br /> - Made before - often. Stupid story, just stupid. - The giant mice looks like a fat man in a pregnant pregnant belly bad - which was kind of funny - but not enough. to give this film any value. Allowed, untrue, and boring discussions. Every pupil at the college of the toilet drink Tequila from a large plastic milk jugs - and still don't seem to be drunk for anything more than a few seconds. The way to connected and continue, guys. Ugly: <br /> <br /> - This film is bad. Just awesome. Worse than you can imagine. It's not bad even if, for example, "Scarecrow" (2002) or "The House of the Dead." Now these movies are crap you can enjoy. Even if they make you a stupider. <br /> <br /> Remembered Scene: <br /> <br /> - Film-finishing film, completed with unscrupulous heroes and explosions. Because you did not feel quite like the rest of this monstrosity - but still laughing. <br /> <br /> Acting: 2/10 Stories: 1/10 See: 2/10 Star: 4/10 Characteristics: 0/10 Special Effects / Make-up: 4/10 Discrimination / Sexual Offenses: 1 / 10 (I used to go to my child regularly during the film, so I would have lost, but it must be there) Violence / Gore: 4/10 Discussion: 2/10 Music: 1/10 (average time) Writing: 1 / 10 Trends: 2/10 / / <br /> Cheesiness: 7/10 Crappiness: 9/10 <br /> <br /> Total: 1/10 <br /> Watch it only if you like mouse movies and on-based. Wait ... See that. Don't look at it. It goes. <br /> <br /> (www.ResidentHazard.com)
