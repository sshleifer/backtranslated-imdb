I confess - Emma, ​​in my opinion, is one great novel written. It is close to perfection as any human creation can be. Jane Austen reaches the peak of her art here. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is better than palimpsest. <br /> <br /> Comparison with Gwyneth Paltrow's version is inevitable - this version is more loyal to the spirit of the book of the book and more enjoyable to see. There are good things here - Kate Berkinsale (who had played Flora Poste in Cold Comfort Farm, clear Emma's spiritual twin) is a beautiful Emma. Raymond Coulthard makes Frank Churchill decoration accordingly. Production is good, but the interior is very dark. However, there are several serious problems. The first is Mark Strong - first of all, he doesn't seem to Mr. Knightley. This is probably because he has a role as the famous parson of Victor. It's bad out of the tune. <br /> <br /> The second problem is one of the length. Simply put, the film is too short - to get a kind of feel right, it will need to be twice as long. Finally, and significantly, there is a quality of reform. Austen is a dream of an adapter - all talks are ready. It only requires less cuts and well-organized. Andrew Davies seems to think otherwise. First, this is a very complicated film, and the last thing Emma should be awesome. In addition, Davies has seen a suitable re-writing as some kind of bucolic feast. What is the planet, or the small work of Thomas Hardy, this comes from? It's completely out of style and spirit of novel. And I believe it is too proud to try to improve - perfection. <br /> <br /> See the Paltrow version, or see Kate in Farm Fold Comfort.
