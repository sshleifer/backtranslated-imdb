All aspects of the bad night in the movies are available: a dialogue based on bio-babble technology technology, a set of chintzy, a balsa-wood acting, a horrible mark of '80s' of Casio, and a general look that shows anything about Sci-Schedule of the Fi Channel program, in 1993. Although “Metamorphosis” begins with many promises, the film includes in bland idiocy and MST3K-style cheese as Clark Kent wannabe 'Doctor' Peter Houseman (Gene LeBrock) is encouraged in release information on its secret projects. But exploring his invisible experiment, he turns into a defined creature (which bears more than identical to 'Dr Freudstein' from 'House and Cemetery'). The function of FX is very good for low-budget production (although I suspect most of it is considered in the shade because), but in general, "Metamorphosis" leaves behind a bad rett in your guts, despite its hopes to give us otherwise. I can't help but agree with the closing details of one character: "(It was) a terrible thing ... from the past!"
