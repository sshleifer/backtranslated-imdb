This is a movie that depends only on the controversial picture of absence and inclusion in order to get noticed. This conversation is pathetic and the feelings of "sex incidents" are not at all. Work and dialogue are more suitable for secondary school children, but the subject is intended for the entire audience. It is an unstable and unknown movie. It may be a better way if it had a story and more drama. Ah and above that, one more thing: why local monologues are widely used? It makes it as cheap. In all the shameful movies with Romanian movies and older viewers who try to see it. please start using good actors in your movies and stop restoring from musicians (Tudor Chirila) - they can't act!
