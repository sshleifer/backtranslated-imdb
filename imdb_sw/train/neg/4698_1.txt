I mean what group is singing on a mad car? Why are ten of them, It is also the way a little child sing about "being my women" I mean very much! Name is pretty corny too, the naked relatives? just because they remove their pants? HOW CREATIVE.I don't get to what they need to show TV I mean most artist don't really show the TV about themselves, especially the port of the naked brother. How many of them are in the disappearance group. And what's deep with the movie? Jeez Nick uses to be a rock of my age to grow but deeply in the brother's band.
