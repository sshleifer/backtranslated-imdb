Well I can say about this movie is that it's nice to see many Asian faces. What I did not like about this film was that it was full of discrimination of what ethnic groups would do in their role. The Asian girl with no confidence who needs to play with another person to get ahead, a white man is offended by Asian culture and chooses to leave her white world behind a yellow country and "put a real" cabinet driver black. Plus all the coke, tang Shanghai and dunkin donuts placement of the product was a little too clear. The story of the story itself was fun but very much how I thought the story could open. Then again when looking at romantic comedies you can't expect a lot but again I would have wanted to be surprised at least once. Parents are the most beautiful part of the flick.
