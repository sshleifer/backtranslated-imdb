It had a preliminary idea of ​​cast cast (hunt Rutger, not Ice-T), this film could have worked. Sadly, racism had to come to the picture (literally) and destroy. Many black producers could not allow the defendant to be black, so they changed the roles of Rutger and Ice-T. This was just the beginning of the downward film. Ernest Dickerson's view of the 'guiding' room is only guaranteed that this was another cooperative. Teacher shot, close, close. Employees, 'Who's What Is The Way' even uses more than a creative camera. Eric's 'most dangerous game' writing is at least a modern attempt to a common story, but it fails to give us any motivation for what characters do. We are never given a reason, unless "no one will lose these people", why the leader (who again wrote as Rutger) does these things.

A little bit of trivia, there was an alcoholic accident while playing a film caused by F.Murray Abraham, leading to the death of a young driver of alcoholism which caused an accident.
