After reading a very good review of this film I thought I would give you a look and after a very desperate film and I thought I would give you my own review. This is the first one filled with me. First of all I would start scared from kind if there was no way to be intimidating or scary (except for a few attempts to make you unfortunate one that had worked for me.) I would say that this film is exciting if I wasn't really happy either! The film is about a damaged girl who is reduced to a few times. In these times he visits the house he was painting, after each tour decides to add something else to the house to make it a very good male thing to be a young man who is also sick. Since he is a friend of the boy he knows that his creative world is more real than the real world he is. Until he always adds his father to the house, because his dad's father turns bad and the boy must be avoided from his horns. Imagine his attempt to be a little bit of the Night at Elm Street but it's like a beach trip. Finishing my 3/10 hospitality you will hope to stop at least one of you from looking at this bed!
