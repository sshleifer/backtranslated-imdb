I've seen all types of "Hamlet". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <3 / / <br /> <br /> <br /> / But now we're going to take Maximilian Schell on Bard. One, this is the name of the German brand of chestnut TV brand respected by William Shakespeare. But if there is a slow, more plodding, more lethargic and bad-made version out somewhere, it should be performed at the level of the grade school. After seeing it on the MST3K it helps, and Mike and robots take a good jabs boy old, blowing the black and white TV, Shakespeare and wisdom (?) Of the German working English play and making it look like Ingmar Bergman refuses. <br /> <br /> Of course, the best part is the MST riffs. The best line? "I will dismiss the Great Dane", "I don't think so," plot "," Get to meet Beatles "," Hey, Dad, you will join with my science project "and, my personal favorite, during the party -" Garrison Keillor's departure Germany (YAAAY !! ") But then there is Schell, playing a great character of Shakespeare as a department store shop without, not just like to describe. Of course he is a good actor, but here he comes as far as Paul Newman in "Chalice Silver". Have you ever seen that one? You GOTTA check these two bills! At the end, this is one example where it is true that you are better reading just a book. At least the book will be unknown to Ricardo Montalban. <br /> <br /> Just one star for this "Hamlet"; ten stars, usually, for MST3K version. <br /> <br /> Good night, non-sweet.
