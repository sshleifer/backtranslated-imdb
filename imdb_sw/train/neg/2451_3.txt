This film creates more laughter than anything else I've ever seen. True, if you're a fan of Tolkien, just borrow a laugh with your friends. I will not be a million people to deny his mistakes ... all I say is that the film (for me, however) has lost the main points by turning my character, Sam, into the sound of the voice. Shama, shy ... 3/10
