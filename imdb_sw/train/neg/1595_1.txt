The movie seemed to appeal me because of the new kind of Pokemon Celebi. But the plot was out of course and had no interest like other movies. It was a waste of money and time. The same playing of corny with a few boys. The movie was of use to do if you want to make the famous Pokemon. The movie should be better not associated with animes like Dragonballz, Digimon, or Yu-Gi-Oh. Drawing and layout is not any level that is growing at original anime levels. It's a shame even to talk about this film. I bet the fans of Pokemon will be disappointed with the results of the movie and stop on Pokemon. Digimon is more than anime and did not fall anywhere near Pokemon.It is the second movie comes from late 2002.
