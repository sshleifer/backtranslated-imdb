I don't think any player in Hollywood's history lasted as long as David Niven gave them a lot of films that he had to carry with his charm. He was able to do, he got Oscar for it, but many of the material he made was lighter as one ply of two ply papers. <br /> <br /> Happy Go Lovely is a case for sure. It is music and for the most part you will remember the play of Vera-Ellen. You will remember that they are in Scot's clothing as a film installed Edinburgh during their festival. But if you can remember one song from them you should have a picture of the picture. <br /> <br /> The plan is slow. Vera-Ellen is an American guide in music that appears to be coming out of the city of tryout in Edinburgh. He starts in chorus and runs at the end of one day. He gets a lift from the king of the greeting card of millions. Everyone now thinks he is a great millionaire. Doors open if they have never been opened earlier. Millionaires are David Niven and he is going along with a variety of situations that occur with the fault. Cesar Romero has a good time here as a producer of this music. Even though Happy Go Lovely is a lighter and non-bond fluff that David Niven did a lot and got very tired.
