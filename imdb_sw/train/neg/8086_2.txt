When I first heard about the "Sun Crisis" then I had a load of cast, I wondered why I had never heard of a very hit movie before. Then I saw. <br /> <br /> Now I know. For a film that includes outdoor space, the sun, a great desert and many cities, this is an amazing and claustrophobic feature; it feels like everyone is getting closer and so the camera should never smoke again. <br /> <br /> And the result, a good time, is very good; we are talking about the destruction of the planet Earth as a team of scientists and soldiers cannot ignore the destruction of solar energy. But more than screaming, sweat and red light on everything, there is no real sense of emergency. <br /> <br /> Don't make me start about cast. What Heston, Palance, Matheson, Boyle, et al are doing in this film without even stretching to do and feel any for the devices I think of anyone. It makes you wonder who the condos of another who is not paid on Hollywood. such effort. If it had developed the speed of all kinds of films, perhaps I would have to say about the "solar crisis" earlier. <br /> <br /> Two stars. More for lost opportunities and unpleasant action. I wonder how Alan Smithee does his job doing junk like this?
