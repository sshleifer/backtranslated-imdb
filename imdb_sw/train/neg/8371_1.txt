I think its good safe to say that this is a very bad film ever made, when I saw a trailer on TV I knew certainly from the second second that this would be a piece of **** and it would be better to avoid, but I somehow was dispersed to see this with friends others, I walked on movies and low expectations but I was hoping there were a few cheaper to emphasize me during this film. The so-called "joke" in this film brings a cringe to the face, they are known more by people involved with the face, balls, a child with a weird and act like a horny gangsta with a common joke of the race we see most often in today's comedies. The film is obvious and the story is not just impossible to believe but it is also predictable and can not. The characters are very angry and caused too much. I don't want to ever see this film **** again, I'd like to take a shot on the foot than displayed on this piece of fuckwood ever again. If anyone I see says they liked it, I would beat them on the face
