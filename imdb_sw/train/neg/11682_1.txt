Now isn't it? Considering all the good work done by danzel, Clive and Jodie, the movie has never been anything more than a frightening copy of the dying tribe. Yes a joke of a couple, there is no predictable events, being honest only when infinite and predicting the loan because the director and editor made a stupid mistake, it is a shame to them to waste time for us. If someone can tell me why on earth they were digging in the hole, who is hell is the Rebe and how they knew in the world that diamonds were in some cell, it could only make my day, but it seems that Spike asks us to take too many things for this and do not lift our eyebrows when something looks stupid ... just the studio label agreement rest and enjoy ...
