I went to this film expecting to be the same as Matrix or Pi. Boy, I was not wrong. Yes, there is a well-written, inappropriate plot in the movie (with CG biological and peptides of boot cells). However, the actual trends of the film are "expert" heads of speech publishing a new age-good feel of a group of conspiracy. <br /> <br /> Of course, it provides stars without enough. There is a bit of actual quantum physics at the beginning. It says, for example, that electrons are like particles and wave, and that atoms are empty space. However, the movie takes substantial (and scientifically), saying that the small atomic effect occurs on large scales too. Talking heads take even more. According to them, the following are true: To Columbus when he arrived in the Caribbean, the locals could not see his ships because their minds could not see anything different. -Meditation can reduce the rate of murder. - With good ideas, you can walk on the water. - Your ideas can change the structure of ice crystals in water bottles. And hey, that's just 40 minutes! <br /> <br /> Watching the film was tortured. This film felt like a film that can show you to join a worship service. After doing my homework, I realized it was basically so. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, this can be seen as comedy comedy (though one is not funny). Save your time and money: don't see this movie.
