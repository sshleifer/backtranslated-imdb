Mmm, does not have a great stack of beautiful pancakes? Maple and fruit vinegar saves up. Take a bite. Mmmmmmm. Take another bite. Another. Another. Eat. EAT it, you !!! Put the stem under your throat until your face turns green with nausea. You have experienced Ally McBeal. I refused on this show in winter '98 and immediately I walked. Such as the stack of pancakes, I made it over. But the enjoyment soon wore off, because the behavior of Ally McBeal (whom we consider to be good and interesting in the first place) soon becomes worse, safer, more sensitive to the complainant. (I will call the female, but I love my wife causes it to spine.) Gags & gimmicks of the show will also be hackneyed, the music of the Vonda Shepherd (which is actually shoved in your face) becomes grating, and odd behavior changes & rewrites makes show in soap opera enough. <br /> <br /> My advice to you is to take this show for a small dose, leaving it soon to be caused (and will be). I did this through the 2.5th season before I enjoyed it. It was good when you were, but if the girl's neurotic partner just turned out to be bad after the invasion invaded. <br /> <br /> And next time go to IHOP, skip pancakes. Command something as healthy as a fruit cup. It will have you better.
