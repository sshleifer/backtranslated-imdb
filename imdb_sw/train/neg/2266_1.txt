Assistant, Jerry Springer's excuse to lose the film that should be restored as a toilet paper recently destroyed my confidence in the film art. First of all, it was done. Second of all, people went to see. Third, some people beat the best film they saw. If a monkey can make a film, I have 100 percent to make sure it will be 1 billion times good. Most of the crappy films have their time, (even Godzilla had several frozen effects) when the film was when I left the theater. The only thing that would probably make this film worse would be like Jerry Springer was a star. If I want to wait for an hour and a half, I will take damage in power. If anyone does not underestimate this film, I have pity on you, your children, and your children's children; however, contrary to Springer's belief, I clearly do not show children who are sexually active.
