Denzel is the only thing that is suitable for this film. <br /> <br /> Maybe once in the early stage this was the best movie. Someone decided to cut the stages and initiatives at the beginning of the film, giving away the story line about the first 5 minutes. That is to destroy anything that builds the fastest and the sound that may have the original film. <br /> <br /> So it first combines you and then puts you away. The actor pushes more than the suspension. Of course there is such a sense of injustice and great anger that movies like this can manage the impression of viewers. In fact, it does so if you are looking for it ... keep it out.
