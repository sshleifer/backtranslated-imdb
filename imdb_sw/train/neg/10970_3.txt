This is strange - except for Australia's colleague who has reviewed this, I can't help but imagine that everyone who submitted the review has been somehow involved in the production of Elektra, based on how generous they were to their reputation. I really am not a fan of the comic-movie-movie change so I haven't entered into a lot of expectations, still I saw Elektra being incredibly underwhelming. What was so disrespectful to me was that there was something big in this film that went without an explanation, which left you thinking "hu, what is the importance of conspiracy?" or "so what is that characteristic character?" I can only hope that these are things that are probably describing somewhat in Daredevil, which I'm not interested in seeing. Besides, the character of the characters in this film seems to make up the face of random time in line with the storyline, and even give me a start-up of a totally meaningless romance program. I am also (still) grab my head on the fate of Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa's character, which seems to have gone without being explained. If I could give a film on this film for anything it would be a good place that was shot, but otherwise I got a little comfort from Elektra. I know we have to stop unbelief of fantasy / action movies, but almost everything in this film was not possible or confused (even with practical film standards) that just bother me. Well, hell, at least Jennifer Garner looks good.
