I wrote a review of this movie more after buying it on a DVD and it was ignored. I tried to look again after reading a few comments made since then. Being a film student and doing the same films of own budget (ie no budget, being hit on a digi camera), I have stood in my original opinion. This is not a budget project for students (and not very good), released on video / dvd to be seen as a winning film (if you read the cover). So cheating the public to think it is not something. I want my money back under the action of business details! Full riddles!
