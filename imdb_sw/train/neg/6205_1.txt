So they were abused by violence and known as patients. Unfortunately, it is better to be afraid, but unfortunately the characters are not designed enough to help us understand why they are going to their rampage (quite possible). This film has a very bad script. We cannot get to know Robert and his actions at the end is just pathetic. Acting is not the best, either, they are bad to be a TV chef and a school teacher. The trend is bad, fast enough to send you to sleep. And what is the school film project? Comments on the film itself? The use of information during the genocide is laughable. These guys clearly that they are elite but do not know in detail. How on earth found Yorgos Arvanitis great for light I never knew. And how they got money to make the first place is the most secret. Worse than understanding.
