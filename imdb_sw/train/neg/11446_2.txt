My family and I tried Underdog last night. And as bad as Underdog is (my four-year-old he liked it), Hot Rod makes it like Oscar deserves the equipment. The only thing that can save this film, is that Evel himself has left for retirement to give Samberg a face to make this film. I will admit however, that the voice of sound was good. I did not know if the film was installed in the 80's, but for many music comes from Europe? Who knows. If I were you, I would like to take it. And just stay at home and watch the test structure on your television station. Or if you are dead looking at this, people under the influence can enjoy it.
