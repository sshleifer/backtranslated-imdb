If this film had a 20 million budget I would just like to know where the money was lost. Monkey can make the best effects of CGI then lost for 3 hours in a horrible vase, although I must accept the machine and martians it would seem real, very cool in the original game of play, and the first games of the PC from mid-90s if the game has ever been made. What puzzles I am where money go? Pendragon films can have a good film with good old models and cameras controlled by George Lucas circa 1975-83, and executives who actually seem to care about what they are doing (or destroyed in this case) for the same 20 million. This is likely the worst movie EVER made! I would like to sit through the 24-hour examination of Ishtar rather than watch this film again. I hated it all! I work. I say this is an EVER film that has been made because of the difference with other bad movies like Plan 9 or Killer Tomatoes, or Santa Claus Winning Martians, these are films that are bad you have a special place in your heart for them, you like. There is no love for this film and no place in my DVD library for it. I bought it for someone in dollars. I put money for the film that has been used for fuel and other badly for employees and staff. Shame on your Pendragon movies! I want my money back!
