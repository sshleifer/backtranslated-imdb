I can't really believe I'm sitting all the way. This movie has a bad job since Killjoy. <br /> <br /> Here is a brief description of the plot: The movie begins with Jojo and the other chick sitting next to the beach, descending on the blonde-haired beach beach "hunk" who looks like he was not on a day-to-day practice in life her. Somehow, everyone knows him, and every child in the movie wants him. OH OH! Here comes the competition! The "hot fire" child and his best friends, who drive a bad pink car. Recently we see Jojo's mother got a job in Australia, which means that Jojo deserves to leave and leave her back friends (oh no, I think I'll mourn). A great storm is coming, and filling their swimming pool with beautiful water. Somehow, because no clear, a little chick falls into the pond, and comes face to face with, yup, you guess, MERMAID! This is where the "story" takes completely. Basically, they want to get a mermaid fall in love with "hunk". <br /> <br /> This is a flick foreteen and a bad act, it makes 80 to look like the top of Oscar-worthy merit. This film has all the possible photos ... best friends, "hunk" that everyone wants, a "bad" girl and a good friend, an old man who fears ... you call it, is there. I took one for many people to watch this. Imagine my hour and 40 minutes sacrifice to you. Please, don't see this film. Do not do so I suffered for free.
