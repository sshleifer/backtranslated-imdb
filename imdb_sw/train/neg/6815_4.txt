Jean Rollin's eight films I saw also are very likely; An exciting plot (as it is) seems to be the first to be a great player to maintain even a minute of 84 minutes but somehow it includes fraud as it continues! The female vampire of the women (prestigious, as promised by the head) is being held in a distant ch√¢teau and only appears to the 'feast' on the blood of the already victims (who are members of the suicide club). caused him, the author-author finally has a villain of man? really the hero of the kinky face with an empty face? It seems clear that the mutant (?!) From the future! Flash languorous and atmosphere as a dream (vendors wear hoods and masks of animals to hide their reputation from the frozen girl) is, of course, the model of all of the film-maker (ditto sea set in {anti} end) and style "Euro- Cult ", as is the bevy of nubile beauty on display. Personally, the most interesting thing about any interesting but intellectual thing was looking at a typical character actor Bernard Musson (who appeared in the last six films of Luis Bunuel film) growing on a regular basis!
