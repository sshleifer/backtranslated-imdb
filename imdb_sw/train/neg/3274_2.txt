Once again, like the Angel of Charlie, Gadget's Auditor and Sound Balls, a television series turns to a full length of film and is destroyed by all hundreds of people they look at. Basically Duke's brother, Luke (Johnny Knoxville) and Bo (Seann William Scott) in Hazzard ward, spend a lot of time driving very fast in "General Lee". But they need to get their action together and leave their family farm to be destroyed along with the whole city of Hogg bad Jefferson Davis 'Boss' (Razzie elected Burt Reynolds) to make the way to a huge coal mine. They get help from their Daisy dynasty (Razzie who chose Jessica Simpson) and Uncle Jesse (Willie Nelson), while being driven by Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane (Lost's M.C. Gainey) and police. Also with star Joe Don Baker as Governor Jim Applewhite, Jack Polick as Deputy Cletus Hogg, David Koechner as Cooter Davenport, Michael Weston as Deputy Enos Strategies and Lynda Carter as Pauline. I think the only reason to give the star additional bonuses is because of the interesting traffic queues, and of course the beautiful body of Simpson (I will accept his feet not Catherine Bach completely, but still!), But instead of being very good. Selected Razzies for the worst pictures, The worst Director for Jay Chandrasekhar, Worst or Cross, The Bad Bad Children's Simpson & "Daisy Dukes" and Screenplay worse. Beautiful poor!
