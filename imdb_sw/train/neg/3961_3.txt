What a dog's movie. Noni Hazelhurst's performance is very good, but it stays in the center of a hostile forest, good direction and wooden acting from a lot of cast. Most of the perpetrators are caused by evil, especially Colin's interruption. <br /> <br /> Very small in this trick. Much of the "character development" takes place in the sound of silly, angst-ridden on and often quite contrary to the character of the characters on the screen. In fact, it's hard to find out who the voice is talking about because they describe different characters and what we see on the screen! What? What do we mean to know Colin Friels (Javo) means to be an unusual, aggressive and unpredictable junkie? One of these silly sounds tells us. Crying loudly, the nature of her character is half the point of film and the only thing that informs us is the flippin sound! The real killer is characters. Everything about them. Their clothes are well managed and they appear pure from the rack, despite the fact that we are reminded that it is always meant to be poor. They all say well for "junkies". Nobody seems to have a real understanding of life on skids or smack and yet this means that the case with most of them. Monkey Grip is not more important than the TV movie TV matin√©e. Crud like this, shooting quite well and technically released, but drama derived from angsty drama which is very easy to be plausible with meanders about for hours without actually going anywhere. At least Noni gets his birthday suit every chance. There is no other reason to tolerate this junk.
