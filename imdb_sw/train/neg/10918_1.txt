Manmohan Desai made an entertaining film though it had no films like AAA, PARVARISH and NASEEB but made craps like COOLIE and MARD and then GJS <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the worst movies made by him to plug it into popular Mard ko dard nahin hota but the film is bad you cringe <br /> <br /> The British takes place carricatures and the film looks so weird Location in the UK hotel is stupid damn <br /> <br /> The film has the most ridiculous as Amrita attack Amitabh and then the whole area with the peak film becomes worse There are more jewelery like a horse image to get life, masks of Amitabh haha ​​and more <br /> <br /> Trends with Manmohan Desai is bad Music is right <br /> <br /> Amitabh does his part in fashion, no different from the COOLIE, the roles of LAAWARIS Amrita Singh is the same as Satyen Kapuu is equal to Prem Chopra is as usual, Nirupa Roy is no longer normal Dara Singh herself is also common
