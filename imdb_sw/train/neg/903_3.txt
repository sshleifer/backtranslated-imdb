1937 "Stella Dallas" and Barbara Stanwyck do not particularly have older people - how anyone thinks the last version of the story story will work now is a real puzzler. Maybe you thought jaunty, bryly brash Bette Midler could do something out of it, but this hoary script failed her. Plot about a female bartender with a child out of marriage, and after years she took a little girl to her father so she will have a shot in a good life, can not escape the desires, past acts and feelings. Midler works best with the film director who can control his shortcomings, but that fails to happen here; Stephen Collins is a stolid like a man who changes his life, but Trini Alvarado has been beaten well as Midler's daughter. This is what was known as "woman's photo", is beaten, but it does not pass because it stays faithful until the 1930s. * 1/2 from ****
