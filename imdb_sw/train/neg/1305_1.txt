"The Sacrifice III: Ogre" is not related before the series is on "Debauchery" and "The 2th Cult is a cold hip horror 1980 classic." Demons III: The Ogre "is very stupid, bored, cheap monster. The confusion about the author is" Demons III: The Ogre "(Lamberto Bava and Dardano Sacchetti is a good writer and fool who inspired William Shakespeare spirit or spirit of demon from the internet The spider's dream is a very popular movie. I bought a special DVD box called "Demons" on 3 different movies called "Demons III: The Ogre", "The Other Hell", and "Black Demons" not opened. The lower heads are costing $ 14.99 from the Best Buy Store in the City of Downey. Why Lamberto Bava and Dardano Sacchetti are a good writer who makes a movie of the closest like "Halloween III" do not have Michael Moner monster but people wear Halloween. I really love the "Babylonians" and "2 Babylons are the best" Emons III: Ogre "is not part of" Babylon "and" Babylon 2 "are the same demons. Thank You Juan Antonio De La Torre
