I rented an AM CURIOUS-JELLOW from my video shop because of all the conflicts surrounding it during the first time in 1967. I also heard that for the first time it had been adopted by American customs when attempting to enter this country, so a fan of the film was taken "controversy" I had to see this for myself. The program focuses on a Swedish student named Lena who wants to learn everything she can about life. Especially he wants to focus on his attentions to make some kind of documentary on the average Swede ideas about some political issues as War Vietnam and contest issues in the United States. Between asking politicians and ordinary representatives of Stockholm about their views on politics, he is having sex with his competitor, classmates, and married men. <br /> <br /> What is killing me about I AM CURIOUS-JELLOW is that 40 years ago, this was considered to be pornographic. In fact, sex and magic events are few and in the middle, however it is not as good as the porno found at an affordable price. While my country's concerns are amazing, actually sex and magic are the mainstream in Swedish movies. Even Ingmar Bergman, certainly their answer to the old boy John Ford, had sex experiences in his films. Thank you for filmmakers for the fact that any sex shown on the film is shown for artistic purposes rather than just shocking people and making money to be shown in movies in America. I AM EXAMPLE-EXAMPLE is a good film for anyone who wants to learn meat and potatoes (no planned pun) for Swedish cinema. But in fact, this film is not a lot of plot.
