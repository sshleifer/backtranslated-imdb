"I love New York" is another entry for VH-1 (MTV Networks) to show the entertainment side of amazing dating, obnoxious, woman. You must be the easiest decision to pick up more dialogue, Ebonics, the craziest rival - and her mother - and give them a show on this web. Many will say, "This is a show". True, it is not as bad as previously shown, "The Love of Love" - ​​but it is very bad. Reminds me a skit from the 90's "Life Life" show where Wayen Keenan Ivory was imitating striker Mike Tyson on the "Love Love" show and took "Robin Givens" to date. Mike talked about how that day was the same, but how the mother felt she went in. This example reminds me of that. Men are chosen and given the names of themselves and the woman that they are more beloved - (I would like to think of an intelligent man who is looking so far a wise woman would allow him - and his mother - to give you a name that is a ghetto, you will see every time you are seen on TV.) but these are real professional artists, why you are bothering. <br /> <br /> It is safe for me to discover what is entertaining on all of this. The fact that this is like a fake like its additions again? 15 minutes of popularity and hundreds of thousands of dollars during the web advertisement? (OK, you can't hate them for trying to make a buck.) Maybe strange - who will be with this woman more than an hour? Or wonder if he and his second show will be on WWF! Any way you put it, is the collapse of the train you have seen many times before so now the value of shock is not available. <br /> <br /> There is no misleading or turning it will make this fall the most interesting train, or any difference from any of the others. Appeals to the most common denominations and to those who call the "end" for reality, this is another nail in the coffin why they should end up, immediately.
