I enjoyed the movie very, emotionally, mentally, and visually. It does not matter to violence or sex or drugs or special effects, and it does not need them a bit, taking into account all the time and words, pictures, and words of wisdom. <br /> <br /> However: [1] Some foreign language accents made negotiations difficult to hear & understand; [2] There is a necessary use of swearing (especially F-word, which is why this movie was rated R). [3] The film matches the sense of humor and emotions, but most of the emotions that catch you in all films, except the last-minute resolution of the last, are not appropriate due to the unrelenting reaction of some of the losses, living in the deepest pain and depression very much. [4] I will not recommend this film because of 5 seconds of natural notes, which did not only add a bit to the behavior of the side that was used, or the film - just hit me on the film and it stuck in my brain through the entire movie and later: the mother of the main character German origin, while watching the old WWII movies, "the roots of the secret to the Germans." There will be no "internal color" or art like Nazi warfare. I don't know any Germans today except skin skins that think the world will be a better place if the Nazis won WWII.
