I will be short ... This film is a shame for everyone except his movie movies. The fact that it is an investigation of the sex tourism industry is only valid until we are "found" in the ongoing dance field. The plan is ignorant no one except the most powerful fan of BAD fears will get anything out. And for the love of God please read that this film is a story of guilt or even empowerment of women because it is obviously not (infant scholars, hell?). this was a very bad film at the Edinburgh Festival (which I saw yet), someone even fell half through the film probably because they could not take over it. this can be seen as the worst layer but I can't find the feature of this film free unless you take it as a fresh comedy. In short, this film is best controlled on a class of class A.
