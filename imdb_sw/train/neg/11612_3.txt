Detective Tony Rome (Frank Sinatra) returns to the screen after self-renamed first, while this is a film played by laughter. During the diving journey, Rome finds the body of a blonde beauty under the sea, its feet as you can expect, closed cement. Rome immediately on the case after being employed by Mount Waldo Gronsky. Rome finds itself at risk if he should explore certain types of mafia, who alters a table with him and himself found to be a great defendant, he must now run and hope to resolve the case alone. The port of the port strives to sell us the crows of cripples and make us believe he is a good detective, oh and not to mention having an attractive sex with Raquel Welch, but he fails in amazement, in this fiction project. The false dhoruement that surrounds every woman is quite surprising, every woman in the film is the head of the dither, who likes to paint in front of the camera, Douglas's director is undoubtedly worthy to enter the burst of their ass every time they erase their back muscles. There is even a homosexual practice of homosexuals that is praying for faith, this was a film made by "real men" to "real men" to prove their sexuality, it's shambles of shame.
