I can't stand true performances and this is worse than that of Paris Hilton, and certainly it's her company. But you are "chased" or "employed", for how many seasons now? After watching the show I do not want to work for a guy with his ego and all and I think watching the dry color has more leisure valve. <br /> <br /> I'd like to hear just one person wake up and "Donald I stop and take some of your money and buy a hairdo hairdo". I see he is trying to buy a fame in WWE to fight. I hope she will get hurt so I no longer need to see her face of pathetic again. It should be sad to want the evil fame and not be talented and make your own ass trying to buy. I would like to mark this score if I could but it gets 1 and it is not appropriate.
