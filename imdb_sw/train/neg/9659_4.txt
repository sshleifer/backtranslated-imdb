After watching this film I was desperate - not because of the actors, stories or guides - I was desperate for these films. The trailer were pointing out that the vale "have chosen a third way" except to surrender or die (Polish news was felt that they had a choice between their killings or German weapons, even interpreting their name as "bad batta") . This has dropped the right spot and bought the movie. The desire began when I realized that the third way is simply to sit and count the dead bodies and sit and count the corpse ... Then I started thinking "hey, this story can't be easy ... I bet a clever officer will get it The trick way to save that of his soldiers ". Well, he didn't, they were sitting and waiting for something to happen. And so was I. The story was based on the real events of World War I, so the authors could not use their imagination, but even thought I got this movie without removing it and even a little boring. And as I wrote first - it is not the fault of executives, authors or director - their marketing people have reinforced my expectations on the extent to which this movie can deal with.
