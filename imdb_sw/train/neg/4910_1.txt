The word "1" in the head means more than the viewers of this film than victims of crime. At least they should not cling to this incomplete film to achieve its destruction. <br /> 1 should mention: the first draft of the script; 1 takes to be used in every performance in the final film; 1 edit in postal production; I come, visit me. <br /> <br /> Movie is not so much available, it's just that everything about the film is getting worse than the third level, from the goofy script, up to a wooden display. And when you are suffering through this film, with a 2 hour mark you want to eliminate your trouble. For 160 minutes for a long time it seems to be appropriate to be changed to less than 2 hours. <br /> <br /> Entering information on the crippled script and acting serves a little purpose. Even in the worst case, Lake Placid, at least the exhibition of Bill Pullman and Bridget Fonda created from a very weak script, had enough skills to cut it on the movie. In 1 to death, one ends with sadness just when he is waiting to see what happens after the opening of the female suicide preparation. The editor is too bad you have never been brought to one of the main characters, who I think (not told at all) is the DA only seen in one place in the middle of the conversation. It is obviously an area that is created by the viewer descended on the editor's floor. And no one found out that the character that appeared without a place was an unusual film. Do not waste your time with this. My wife and I want to do it. But at least we have created our own direction by commenting on various sites in the film as it was the Secret of Secret Science. "At the same time, in Cleveland ...". !!!!
