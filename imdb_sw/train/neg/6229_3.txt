First of all, let's do a few things here: a) I am a fan of anime- always been like a real thing (I was looking at Speed ​​Racer at all at School Girl). b) I do as many B movies because they are hilarious. c) I love Godzilla- many movies. <br /> <br /> To continue, when the movie comes first, it looks like it will be your usual movie B, under FX, but all of a sudden Boom! anime is coming! This is when the movie goes to WWWAAAAAYYYYY downhill. <br /> <br /> Animation is very bad and cheap, even worse than what I remember from SPEED RACER, for crissakes! In fact, it is cheaper, one of the few events from the film "is clear" remember is when a group of children comes from school ... and they are the same children again and again! FX is awesome, too; The dinosaurs looks worse than Godzilla. In addition, live transitions for animation are not created, dialogue and sound (especially the English dancers I realized) were bad and I was asking my father to take a tape from a DVD / VHS player; The only thing that was standing was making jokes and comments like robots & Joel / Mike on MST3K (you take a season). In fact, this is the only way to enjoy this film and live at the same time. <br /> <br /> Heck, I plan to show this to someone else otaku pal on Halloween for B- Modern Night. Because they are ignorant, they are very painful to look at and hilarious at the same time, I give this film 3/10, upgrade from 0.5 / 10 I would give you the original. (According to my measuring point: 3/10 means very interesting and bad. If you like to count on a third unless you find a fun way, then it will be fun if you count 15.)
