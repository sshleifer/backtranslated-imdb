When Stanwyck's husband was killed on the night of their wedding, he returns to the mountain lodge, where he drives (from) the rock and is saved by the rich driver Morgan. Morgan loves him, and leads to a straightforward marriage, is used for a great asset in Chicago (which appears to be surrounded by mountains!). Stanwyck is being tested for Cortez, but eventually he returns to Morgan, in a big story of the story and does not know. <br /> <br /> This film has very cast (Morgan is actually one of my favorites) and a good director, but the script is mixed and looks useless sometimes. I was ready to celebrate this film but I was desperate. It is still worth looking for a cast, and it is good for anyone who loves 1930 movies.
