This motion picture comes directly out of the Dark of the Moon Full Entertainment. The production company gained popularity and fortune during the first half of the 90s by producing very serious and stimulating movies. The most popular disaster in their operation is "Subspecies", "Seed" and "Players". None of these are proposed by neither is Dr. Mordrid, in fact. Good director Charles Band came to the company suitable for his film. Dr. Mordrid is wonderful and dumb and buesy and almost totally humorless. I only saw because star Jeffrey Combs. I learned that it may have several losses if you are a fan of it. For every beautiful movie, it looks like you've done the lowest. Anyways, the story is about war between 2 ancient witches. One of the best who is here for 150 years is to protect humans (Jeffrey as Dr.Mordrid) and one of the evil one called Kabal. He wants to destroy every kind of human life for some reason I have already forgotten. Combs gets its orders from the consultant. "The man" is just a pair of eyes in space. Very cheesy, that's it! Each time and when the optical light is displayed on the screen but that's about the only kind of special effects of this film. Anything is a piece of shouting and touching and when the two witches finally face, it's more before you know ... I would like to expect that the evil witch will fight a bit, but noooooo. In some cases, you can actually recognize nature and creativity (like for An example of Jeffrey's speech about the influence of the moon on criminals and if you concentrate, you can even get very small but positive things (like a string called Edgar Allen) but in general, it's a bad waste of time and energy. I am a big fan of Jeffrey and maybe he's superhero in my eyes ... but he certainly don't wear a stupid file for it.
