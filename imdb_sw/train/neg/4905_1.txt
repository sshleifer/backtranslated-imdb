I am often disappointed with web movies. Even the flix that attracts the great name of the great name is destroyed by television people. However, this is quite serious. Screenplay is weak and acting, especially that of Tracey Pollan is disgusting. I have come to see my school kids' hockey school and have been treated to do the best work. Pollan does as he reads the script while speaking. When he tries to show fear, anger or sadness, it is too hollow. Because of the overall quality of production I found it difficult to take it. If you decide this brave prepares a great desire. Horrible things will not fear you, sad things don't make you sad, romance won't make you feel warm and fuzzy and likely to be as worried as I saw the end when you come. "First die" says a lot about this film.
