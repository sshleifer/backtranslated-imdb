I don't remember to see another film of genocide / hidden as bad as this. This film, about a medical investigator who examines the death of his friend in a car accident, accepts full of bad movie: a bad act, a pleasant story, lack of doubt, bad humor and no game. I remembered to see this film on PAX, the so-called TV station for preparing low films and budget plans for TV like this. Television films, of course, have no reason to edge or emphasize as Big Screen movies. But, this film certainly causes all the sour taste. The film makers have missed the opportunity to do "Receipe for Murder" a great movie TV; the head gives some argument. So, if you want a good recipe, don't look at this film. This movie alone can kill your TV desire. F / F / F F
