I have seen many Seagal movies, and while most are not great, or even good, this bunch of steamy has revealed the bar to bad movies. <br /> <br /> Plan: certainly true. Something about drugs that makes you all mad and power or something. What? Who are good and bad people? It's hard to say. Many of the films are cutting scenes back and forth among the people in the black glowing rooms on how beautiful Seagals character "Mashall" is. <br /> <br /> Acting: Blows. <br /> <br /> Sounds Dubbing ,,,,,, What was the awesome sound of overdubbing? What? Could they find anyone who heard down like Seagal? May also would have Cheech or Chong to make sounds, it could be at least having entertainment then. <br /> <br /> This game is boring, and totally stupid. Avoid at all costs!
