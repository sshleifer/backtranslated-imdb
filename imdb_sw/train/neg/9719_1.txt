Ummm, please forgive me, but not more than half of missing characters? In the previous novel, Valjean is a prisoner for 19 years for stealing bread and then try several times to avoid. He breaks the parole and is carefully followed by Javert police inspector. Along the way there are many characters who were not in this version. Some mentioned value will be Fantine, Cosette, M & Mme. Then, Eponine, Marius, Gavroche, and Enjolras. The only character whose name is Javert. I was confused and confused in the whole movie, trying to see how it was in any way connected to the Epic Victor Hugo novel.
