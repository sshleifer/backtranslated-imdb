I don't like to lead to Sean Penn very much, and this first job, the Indian player, is not different. The movie has no foundation, it is a color and type of redneck, anti-false authority that for all the trust taints work more than Penn, its recent work even more than earlier. Frank Miller, Robert Rodriguez, Clint Eastwood, Sean Penn, all the votes appear to produce the primary product, because of loyalty loyalty, but end up being, for the most part, the anti-glory, and if the Hallmark cards were a greeting the Angel of Hell, and made me a long time for the Rescue Day, which is a good movie. The work of Viggo Mortensen is a lot, much more reliable here than the East East promises that made by Cronenberg, and that's about it. The movie is meaningless, and it seems to be an exercise, a series of techniques, more than a story. Kudos to Charles Bronson, however, who confirms he can act. I wanted more of Sandy Dennis's behavior. More than 3 out of 10 people for this player of India.
