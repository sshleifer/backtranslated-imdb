If the author / director reads this (and I think you are since you should now be out of work) then you must tell you - I have seen bad movies at my time but this finds the difference of having the worst base. I've heard. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS - Nothing happens! <br /> <br /> Total waste time. I laughed loudly at the end. SIDE NOTE - (if the whole movie was on the coma then does the place where he sleeps with that person means someone to kiss when he was struck out?) <br /> <br /> Fill the trash.
