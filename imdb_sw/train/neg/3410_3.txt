Yes, this film has children who go camping and starts enough if you have children to meet and learn rope. Then it establishes Jinx, a robot that is impossible to exist in 1986 if they have nothing with that kind of artificial intelligence now. The child becomes a buddy and a robot and a robot pays the child's courtesy by hitting a group of other children in the camp in the outdoor space with a limited supply of oxygen and radio that do not have a signal to reach the space. This camp is also very uncomfortable if these children are being trained and the teachers take them for an unforgettable message or do not do the right things. To give them a break, there is there for fun, not to be explorers yet, just to give them an experience of running space is not a military camp. However, you see Joaquin Phoenix for early role. So finally the film trying to be realistic in some places, but with the introduction of Jinx and other things you can also have kids space space on everything else that was happening in a movie like that would have made the movie that enjoys the most at least for me. Perhaps for the other few, who would like to see the face of Kate Capshaw bursting with a strange alien creature.
