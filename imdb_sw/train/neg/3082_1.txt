Good Lord, what did they think? !!!!!! Here's your spoiler warning, although I don't think it will be worth it. You won't see this piece of rubbish yet. The handpuppets group is exposing a group of very stupid people, who may secretly hunt them to try to kill them, and coverings include things to let them live out of their stupid fantasies. In other words, the whole thing is stupid. <br /> <br /> You know it must be bad when even Mike and Bots can't store anything! And they didn't do it! I know, some of their lines were amazing, like that add-on "HIT" sign and hand, but, geez, this was very good sad. All I can say is not Look at this O CRUD. HE DOES NOT HAVE YOUR SIN.
