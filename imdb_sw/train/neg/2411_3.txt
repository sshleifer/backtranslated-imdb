The dead hood is about a little scientist named Rick who lives with his brother in Oklahoma town where drug dealers and prostitutes fill up the streets. Then one night, Rick's brother was shot by a group that drove down the road that he had earlier fought with. Desperate, Rick called his science partner to bring a recent form that has been working that brings blood cells to health. The form has not been tested by man, or even the corpse but Rick has decided to bring his brother to life. He gives the body a double measure of formula but nothing happens. So Rick calls 911 and the body is locked for a return to life and celebrating the human body. Now Rick must ape his brother zombie before the whole hood is transformed into the neighborhood of the dead. The Dead Hood is alive one of the trash. The plan is a direct diagram from Resident Evil, especially angry with Rick's cries for his brother, the gun is fake because when every weapon is running it sparks, creating it just blind. It's just a fake of blood covered on the surface actors. Zombies are also changed. They run, shout, and should be shot in the heart to die! Zombies should just relax, wail, and must be shot in the brain to die! This film is very awesome, the release is the only true time of this film. The Dead's Hood finds 3 out of 10, a little entertainment here and there but it only succeeds as a low-budget comfort.
