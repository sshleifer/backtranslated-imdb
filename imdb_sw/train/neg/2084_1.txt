if they give me the option of negative numbers I could use. This movie was really God-bad. I went to the movies to expect it to be horrible, and somehow managed to exceed my expectations. <br /> <br /> Script was weak, acting was painful. I wanted to walk but my friend was driving a car and wanted to get its value, I think we've been disappointed. <br /> <br /> Growing breast when girls got their great power and changing hair color was just bad. Eddie Izzard appeared simply wrong with the part of the super villain, came as odd and weak. Jenny Johnsons (Uma Thurman) came as psychologically and mysterious, such as Matt's (Luke Wilson) friend Vaughn (Rainn Wilson.
