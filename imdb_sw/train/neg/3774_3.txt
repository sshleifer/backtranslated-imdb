This film is stale, and it lacks logo. It's far compared to the Batman 89 that tries to coppy. Women's singers whose name cannot act, and we see why their filmmaker died. See how this film died in the box office nobody sees this film on TV or. Uncle and father were expecting Batman, and the feelings of film are like Cop Rock. Not eligible to rent 3/10
