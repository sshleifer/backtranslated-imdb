I had examined this Johnny test to try to get humor in it. I failed, terrifying. The Cartoon Network has a tendency to make their performances enjoyable with all viewers, but Johnny's test is "entertainment" in the lower form. The writing is very predictable, and the smell of the run is not too high. Children will love it, and that's about it. Now, this is not to say that it's all wrong. The opening opening of the original was really interesting, but for some reason they took its bones and for example they hit it with a pattern of aluminum model. It is a shame, because it was one of the best things that was going for him. <br /> <br /> Some of the characters can be very interesting, in theory. For a little work, the characters can work well together, but it is also directly. Then again, this makes it easy for kids to follow. <br /> <br /> The speed is too fast too. These events are very much, leaving a little time to write clever. This is a real shame, because there are many interesting concepts that the show brings. On the top, however, the rapid speed will prevent children from losing interest, and in fact it is a total audience target. Overall, the show looks very good on the paper, but it is not good to succeed in being funny or interesting. This is the show I want, but I can't. There is a very unlikely possibility. Children will enjoy it, but that's about it.
