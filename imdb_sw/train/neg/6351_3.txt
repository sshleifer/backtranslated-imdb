Although there was a good job - especially Chloe Sevigny, and Radha Mitchell in half of the comedy - this was not just a film. Saga between the comedy and part of the disaster was bad or sometimes not clear. The viewer was originally confused by the fact that the hand was different in two halves; I thought in ways that were placed in the opening area that people around Melinda would be the same people, just to respond differently (more than "He Said, She Said" premise). However, we have two very different stories with two very different women, both of which happen to play with Radha Mitchell. The two waves to play in the opening area - player and shock - claim to take the same premise and go there, but the two stories are only connected. They do little to support the topic of discussion, which is almost everything that can be seen as a comedy or problem. Nice cast, but a terrible film.
