I can't say enough things about this train problem. It's one of the few movies I've ever tried to walk. It was a bad premature start, the first pregnant woman, but then they tried to make it spoof. What were the real pregnant women doing? This was the worst movie I saw. If it had enough votes it would have been under IMDB 100. If it was possible to give zero I would like, and I would still feel that I had given him a great loan.
