I really did not write these comments. I am a Christian, so I waited anxiously to see this film. It seemed great - a Christian movie with a well-known star and a conspicuous conspiracy (not that I find myself the Bible itself - you can say anything you want to. It is, however, to believe everything in the Bible). So I'm sitting beside my seat to enjoy the preview, when the movie comes and will be able to destroy my feelings in a minute. I had to bite my mouth to stop commenting on the scary and acting when I was in the theater (I would have been broken by the people shouting at the exciting centers but basically uplifted and dropped clearly and predict the tension, I'm sure). Once the last credit started to increase, however, I could reflect. There were many parts of the film I liked - some of the unexpected prospects of conspiracy, some of the effects that were realistic (not counting the Vision that was not well done), and some interesting technical work - defines, puts, that kind of thing. Unfortunately, I have had a different impression that if I read the book of Revelation to the monkey and put the monkey in front of the producer for an hour, I could get the best script. And the music was more fun (even for the fan of the Bond who loves the music of kinda cheesy in practical and biased events). So I would like to be like everyone in the theater - like the people who came out crying and breathing for a strange reason - but I am not a person who would be interested in the author who gives us words on the Bible Head and strips the Christian fabric over it. I need a good plot and reliable discussion before enjoying many movies, and this didn't. Sorry, but I won't recommend this film to anyone. And that's the trouble. When will we see some false Christian lie? It should be out there somewhere ...
