This "movie" is a very bad job! Nothing looks even trying to be true. Plot is weak, act - sad, actors are wondering almost like the first year's production, trying hard to act without any chance from the beginning. What float! It is a waste of time, money and effort for all involved including listeners. Yes, as with any stimulation, here is also murder, corpse and blood. Imagine someone who has 5 minutes ago, has committed murder and knife, and came out calm and exciting, not to be as clean as a grandmother, as if a man's throat is made by a common agent. Also, these killings had to be done by a very weak young woman, and cut her throat! Did you ask him, gently, to bow? The worst of the same kind goes on and stops the audience wondering if this means that the joke that turned out to be bad. Continuing is another big problem as for example: A hungry hungry woman lies in bed, waiting for her virgin-daughter out of the bathroom and after a long time, sleeping (!!!). The next area opens and young couples enter the reception area, asking for guidance for environmental advertising! Not the Word about the Last Night? The same destruction of time even try and write on this "movie" under the low-thought-to-movie.
