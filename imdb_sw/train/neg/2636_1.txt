I saw the film tonight in the free preview of the preview, and despite the fact that I did not pay dime to see this film I felt closed. Women and honors, when it is money and you see this film leaving Benjamin on your seat. Acting is the best torpid; Kiefer Sutherland has his phone in his worst match of Jack Bauer, and Michael Douglas looks like he made a bad choice to leave Catherine Zeta-Jones for a time to shoot a Turkey. Eva Longoria is not a feature; he looks like he reads his lines away from the teleprompter. And if you can't see the "mole" within the first 20 minutes, then you have dropped off this planet from the non-TV world and the lines of the revised story. If you want to see a good secret secret service, rent it in the Fire Line. If you see and buy within this, you will begin to fear the security of the president because the secret service looks and acts as adult versions from 90210.
