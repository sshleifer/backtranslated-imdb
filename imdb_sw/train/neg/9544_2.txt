I did not enjoy this film. I thought that acting was not very good and the story was boring. Is the 20-year-old computer stored on the day? I thought that this was just a little isolated, even for the film. I couldn't figure out why they couldn't just remove it, why don't you enter a sledgehammer. It is embarrassing, but after the original film from 80 years you expect more, what was given. This film can be the 21st century of the old film, it was not. If so you want to watch, don't watch this film! Even if the old computer hasn't saved the day, this would still have, in my opinion, be very flick.
