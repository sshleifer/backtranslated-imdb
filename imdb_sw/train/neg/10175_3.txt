Could not sleep the other night. So I woke up, I was hit on a tube with this movie had continued. The film traders left more than they could chew. Such as talent in the scope as "Forrest Gump" was. But Gump read as a story of a story where an extraordinary lucky man leads through the era. TGMB relies on fatigue clich√©s to tell stories. Welcome to Broadway music where actors should be ham. The purpose of each character was to fill the archetype of silly 60. Criminey, talk about a heavy load. Why not just give him a t-shirts "I Heart Black People"? <br /> <br /> Sunshine: "Don't you love free groovay, man? No, I didn't have my time." Mary Beth: "I want to go to Berkeley, not UCLA square." No, forgive me? There was nothing to square about LA in 60 years. Instead of taking time to show what made Berkeley unique, we just hear this brat on that absence. It cannot remember the name of the little child. He was the only money used to show how other children are tolerating citizens. <br /> <br /> Something is, a piece of pieces should not be this cheesy. Take "Used and Confused." See how we are brought by the soccer hero, Randall Floyd. We are not the first to see him in the football field. In fact, we can't see him playing football. We have been sent to him in the class, we are welcoming his nerd poker associates at the party. The "female" of the female is not usually a chick product entry. It's more organic, bigger than that. It has been cleaned in the women's room on the talk about the Island of Gilligan. Good feedback can grow in mundane settings. But real life is like that. <br /> <br /> Some of the warm comments here will realize that the theme in this movie is still important. I agree! That's why I feel desperate and this piece of Baby-Boomer pornostalgia.
