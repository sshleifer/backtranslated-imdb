The good thing about this is a soft cleaner: Almost no movies about dance music and the club's location (if it has been done) hit movies. And it shines too much energy, from music to be displayed in Ibiza. But the main problem is that it cannot decide what it wants to be. Although you really want to be a pastor in this line is the Wind Wind, the creators also realized that they don't want to play copycat. However, it is completely unsuccessful with jokes because it is not very written and many characters are not developed. And does not arc in its script and lead it to 90 minutes, why not edit down 75? The Department of Production and Movies still trying to save the day (eg Paul's house). <br /> <br /> In an extraordinary and unexpected way all of them have gone to Pete Tong doing the best job as a good game in the nearest line. Especially the events with Beatriz Batarda provides acting capacity. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: it is a mess, it includes a little, but better to spend the night in your favorite club.
