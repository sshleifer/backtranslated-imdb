This original film of Adam Sandler can be comparable to his life as a comic at the same time in 1989. His habit of recognizing the constant sense of his comic mind and confusion about humorous material appears to come more from Sandler than script. Film is nothing compared to its blockbuster films, such as Big Daddy or Billy Maddison. Unfortunately, Sandler had not yet found a way to express themselves in a consistent, successful and remarkable way when this film was made, as well as its character. Most of the "jokes" of the film comes from Sandler with a discussion with himself, usually on his mysterious talent and striking because he is so bad and can't find women. The film is difficult to watch too because it does not respond as a real film. Sandler is talking to the camera and viewers in the film, often referring to a low-film or verified budget. The film is ultimately shy and shy to look at. I immediately wanted to forget even I saw this film after it ended, for fear that if more available on it, it would ruin the work of the Sandler. Go through this video store, I used it for free and it was still time to lose.
