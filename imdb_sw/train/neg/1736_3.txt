Let me begin by saying that I was like Betty Grable, especially from the "Down Down Way", but when she was close to this tragedy, she had "round" and really all the film was shy. Douglas Fairbanks and JNr (who must be discouraged) the story was bad, beautiful colors, and a very long film. It had some old levels in it like Harry Davenport and Reginald Gardiner to try and stimulate interest but without success. The music song was uncomfortable, and I must say one unforgettable voice in any way ... if I was a fan of Miss Grable, I would always have never seen this!
