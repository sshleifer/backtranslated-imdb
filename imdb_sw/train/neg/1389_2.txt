I was shocked at this film. Plotwise was blocked weak on silly: Spirit that could affect the truth in a way to do? The best message for Soul Hunter who was handed over to one of their minor members? And the story of both B and "holobrothel" and charges against the center was very bad at one time I came off the television, "Why are you wasting my time with this?" Basically, "Spirit of the Spirit" did not come into the question of the soul in more detail than the original "Soul Hunter" made. We see that Animals Hunters can make mistakes, but we still have no feeling for their culture. (Are there Females of Female Animals?). The acting was the same, due to the materials they had to do with them, with special effects - especially planetscapes in the first act - they were very surprising. But in general, I'd give him this miss.
