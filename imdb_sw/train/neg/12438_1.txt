To beat the bad guys ... Again it is a line of this film, it shows the very truth about it. <br /> <br /> Home alone one and two, classic film. Home alone three and four, a good film if you are three! Like Sharkboy and Lavagirl, as hard as it tries to be funny, not. Culkin is replaced by Alex D'Linz or anything else. He is a very strict actor and a bland performer, but not quite his fault, the text is called the bland vocabulary and the words of bland. The channels are just copied from the first two and the pigs, and you should be blind to think that these pigs are real. A good option if you are an early school teacher that shows this film a rainy day. And to do bad things, to be thrown away, to see if you don't believe me, but you will be sad.
