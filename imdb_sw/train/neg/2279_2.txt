The boy is what this dud was. It just lasts an hour and I just pay a buck for it so I live ... unlike the whole cast of 1933 clunker who are all dusty now. So, a small village begins to have turned bodies that are closed with all their blood.The local jokes begin to talk about vampires, of course, and a little more after each body found.Sheriff city or constable or whatever he, played by an amazing actor Melvyn Douglas, tries to tell them otherwise. When he says the fact that the dead have one big hole on each side of the neck, instead of two holes around, the people then say it is a great vampire campaign. Responsible insists that vampires are not available and it must be a man who commits murder. But Melvyn doesn't seem to be too worried in any way. She spends all her time trying to get into the swealoe of her sweetie, played by Faye Wray. In this mix is ​​a simple city, played by Dwight Frye, who al seems to have the same role in every movie he did. He also drives the people of the city to beat bats and drink his own blood. Lionel Atwill has a city doctor who seems to try to help the army to resolve the crime. And the boy hasn't ever smoked like an actor. Access is close to the role in this role if he could get it. And Lionel Barrymore is also in this matter… lots of lots the names of the guano as a guano. > br Nyingine >> Nyingine >> >> >> >> >> >> >> zaidi >> zaidi \ t <br /> <br /> For me on the stage of the movie watching Frye, he hits the forest of freaky weirdo city but more of him this film did not give much. And then when you know the cause of strange deaths and see something of special effects that require blood this all you will really be down. White Lugosi made many bad pictures but at least he was happy and interesting to watch. this film as Lugosi hip hop without Lugosi and you get to feel how bad this situation was. If you can't make a 1930 film of dirt at least put Lugosi in it.
