When Rome is up to the point on Getting there. Getting there I found also predictable, accessible and slow, and even today I still consider whether the Olsen twins' worst. However, when Rome's time is not a bad movie, it's not too great. If I had to do it in one word, I would say. It is fun for young people, but I think adults will not have much to continue. The time of Rome has its good points. Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen are actually an honorable actresses, certainly good too. I will confess when I was 10 years old or so, I loved them very much, and usually I am as much as yet. And I enjoyed other movies like Passport To Paris and New York Minute. To return to the goal, all the girls do not do such a bad job, they are really very attractive. Plus their clothing is dying, and the environment of Rome is completely breathing. Voice sound is not half bad either. <br /> <br /> However, where the film dropped it on the plot and script. The script is in many places and has a view of the vu. The program, like many of Kate Kate and Ashley's movies, is very predictable, and anyone known for any Olsen twin work, will receive other common features. Most of the characters are a thin cardboard, and you can't learn a lot about them, and sometimes the speed is not recommended. Sadly, a breathing environment is destroyed by the slapdash camera function, which appears to run every time. It all has its good points, and it really seems. However, for my taste, it is free and unpredictable. 4/10 Bethany Cox
