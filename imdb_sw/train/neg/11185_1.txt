Yes, MTV is a real way to sell Daria. What started as a mentally-minded young man - "a view on everything that triggers and makes a viewer feel better about their young lives" the current is inserted "how you should deal with your problems" -charade. I was looking at Daria at all times and loving. Now, sitting here after watching what is known as "movie" I can just ask what this all was. Daria tells us how to lead life in college? Sorry? Isn't Daria doing everything that what you want to do is the same, as long as it is the same for you, regardless of what the sad world is thinking about? The whole thing reminded me of the "Bites Reality" area of ​​the film shows the document for the first time.
