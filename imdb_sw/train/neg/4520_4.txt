Irwin Allen was good. All of its TV shows had great experiments, or the first part. others were basically hitting off of his other exhibitions. A few Swiss Family Robinson publications were exhibiting their old television shows. The same period of the Swiss Family is the same as part of the Giants Country when a party member needs an appliance operation. This edition had a large budget and very expensive to continue. Irwin lost his touch and TV shows after 60 years. Acting is firm with Martin Milner. Children's stars arrived there with this show as Willie Ames and Helen Hunt. one bright spot is when Irwin Allen includes its epidemic events as a blast explosion and volcanic explosion trick "Teacher of Disaster"
