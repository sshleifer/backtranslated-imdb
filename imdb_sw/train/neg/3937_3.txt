It is hard to believe that in 1997 David Duchovny was on his popularity, with X-Files, one of the best sci-fi series ever, being on glory. Nine years later he is virtually forgotten, and his practice of doing great screens has failed very much. I can't even define why, he is a fair actor, but perhaps his popularity has thrown him into an eternal role that takes a great talent to break. At the same time Angelina Jolie was not well known, and she was fortunate that the film as 'playing God' did not lead her work at the end of death. Fortunately for him, 'The Bounding of the Bones' and 'The Girl, Intervened' were waiting for more than a corner, and when Lara Croft came, his work was launched. <br /> <br /> There is not much to be told about this film. It is the only film of Andy Wilson's screen, and there must be a reason. It is all banal and a lot of what is happening on the expected screens in this story of an old doctor who saves the victim's life at the bar just to find himself working for the group. The remote screen sound is very bad, and the moral text that kills any shades of movie experience from the film. Maybe you won't meet the film but in DVD rental, or on TV. Try to look something better.
