Accepting entries into movies is often a bad idea because it is two different mediums. Do you think it is a great idea to do ZULU in action? Imagine where two of the brave redcoats living in the tent to make up "Blimey there are thousands of them out there" The great movie and playing the evil action action step / knight! br>> <br /> 1) A beautiful drawing that makes a screenshot of a screenshot / knight these roles. This story surrounds a man who was beaten by Palminterri to break into the house to kill a wife who played with Cher and many actions being done inside the house. I could not take these marks seriously though perhaps it was the fault of the script that could not decide whether it was trying to be bad or interesting. Since the story is very strong it is of great importance that the dialogue shines again and again because the strange sound of the screenplay is more embarrassing than anything else and a lot of conversation around sex acts. if you want to see a great interpretation of the play for the corresponding step on the financial screens give FAITHFUL miss and watch 12 ANGRY MEN instead
