You know you're in trouble when your watch movie has other titles. It usually means that they tried and tried to hide Turkey in various markets. Such turkey is a Brain Machine which has seven different titles. <br /> <br /> Its over a secret secret project that you think might be able to use computers to read people but instead it causes people to kill or own, or something like that. It is filled with B-level actors who are sitting in the panels and lawn seats trying to make a script which makes almost no meaning. <br /> <br /> It is a rare type of turkey. Avoid.
