I only saw the Venice cinema concert, and I can't decide exactly about it. We were never allowed to get quite close to any characters to care for them. Maybe that was sure, that we are all in our "bubble", but these people have not had to worry about them or be shocked by their various events. At an appropriate time for more than an hour, the characters were not developed. Short time was dedicated to factory equipment (forklifts, conveyor belts, ferries); and the tiny little toes of children with amazing eyes, that many of the characters made for survival, were somehow more attractive than people living. An interesting attempt, but somehow it has never been connected.
