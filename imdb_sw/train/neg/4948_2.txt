I have always been interested in the drama period, the art form that the BBC has a vibrant in the past. This presentation of "Byron" was impossible. It's still bad! The script was awesome, will not work properly, and all concerned characters. It seems Byron was "a rough and dangerous madness to know", and put all the heart-flutter women. Not in this production. Here he appeared as a tawdry jumped-up a little squirt instead of a fire hero of womenfolk and the Greek liberation struggle. It is said that Byron was walking with the wrong. This image of man was just Limp in the world. I watched the whole hour two and a half waiting something spark in life. Not splutter, nor even light. It was quite tedium, if not downright bored, from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> After the comments that no one ever better Bard's Avon, I also believe that Byron's poetry is over-respected and my mind should be thrown on the back burner, and this drama of his life should be given the same treatment. <br /> <br /> I think the BBC lost its us with this one
