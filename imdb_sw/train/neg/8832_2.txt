I had a very difficult time to do this through this argument. It was very slow and sometimes wondered when the plot of the movie would be alive. This game seemed to be moving slowly and I was wondering when it ended. I am usually someone who likes a good time every time but this does not meet what I wanted. It seemed to have tried to do much from this film. At one time it seemed to be a political turn that I am not a big fan of movies. If you are looking for a slow moving film and without a little plot then this is a good movie for you. For my part I felt I lost two hours when I could do something else.
