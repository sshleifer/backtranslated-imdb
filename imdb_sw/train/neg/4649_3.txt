1957 (yes, that's the correct date) J. Arthur Rank production by James Robertson Justice, Margaret Rutherford, Wilfred Hyde White; Should be comedy comedy, right? Oh, it's very bad. It is one film of gag: looking people trembling before the little alligator. Music is thrown into, inappropriate and neglected. Jeannie Carson is a good player and a talented singer. But what was he doing in this film? Diana Dors here also, give oh-so-daring shots for use in the preview. His acting level is not bad, but he is on the film to give someone to enter. Must, one must do something waiting for this film. The movie is sold to VHS now and people on e-Bay. Avoid cost and waste time. Comedy without laugh. Music without song or dancing.
