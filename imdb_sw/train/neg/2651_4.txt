The first 30min of the flick was choppy and hard to know what was going on (unless you read the book - which I did not). <br /> <br /> If you can connect to the first half, the second half is sweet - unpredictable, yes, but not even sweet. The only way that one shot would have been thought was given in the early 80s, not 2005. I would like to know why Keaton chose this role, part of it would be better to be thrown by more player at the level of other actors to keep balance.
