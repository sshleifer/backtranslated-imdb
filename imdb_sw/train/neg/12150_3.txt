Feeding Masses is one of the most popular zombie movies that will be after your hard earned dollars. Advice? Keep your hard-earned dollars and let's just say that the good Theater the old man took one for this team. What do I think about the plots? Zombies takes. This time though, for nature (?) This film is held at Rhode Island, and being honest I don't know I've seen a flick zombie located in Rhode Island. The TV station, controlled by the government, should investigate the usual "advertisements" so that civilians should not think there is any problem in the world, that is, those who do not look or go out, however. I will say though some of the advertisements announced by this station are the most exciting part of this film. In fact there is some story for this but I don't bother with it because over time you may not worry or sleep. At any rate, this has a lot of bad statements to throw up above all "all the preview" stuff that finds trotted out before the camera. Believe me, you can find many other things to do with your time than to watch this. 3 out of 10.
