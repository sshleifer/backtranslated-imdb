It was obvious that this film was designed to appeal to the audience of Chick Flick, which I sat for very few and was more excited. However, this was a very offensive attempt by Heather Graham to be a Ryan Ryan who (who was angry as hell for his own right). His acting was overdue and it seemed to be overanxious compared to his colleagues who had shared their roles. This film can be more, as there was a suitable budget setting, artists and a good story line. My wife and I agreed that this was 'Muck' at the end, as the film ended on pain pain! Good luck in the future, hope Miss Graham looks at a variety of films that she is in Hell.
