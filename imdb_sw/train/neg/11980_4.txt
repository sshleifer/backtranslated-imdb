This had been damaged by a few short cut matches. <br /> <br /> The opening game was to lose Legion of penalties, but I think the only way that they could overcome the damage was double-DQ. Otherwise, Mr. Perfect would have to keep more time. Kerry von Erich, I-C field, lost here. And this was the third ppv where Perfect workbed. Remember, before that you never lost a match. <br /> <br /> The second match was very good, maybe best at night. Ted DiBiase and Undertaker were excellent, while Jim Neidhart had one of the most important aspects of WWF, with a pinch of Honky Tonk Man. Koko B. Ware continued its tradition of putting the new heel (remember Big Bossman and Yokozuna?). This was a shadow of the work of Bret Hart's special, as he returned from two to one and almost survived the match. He and DiBiase have set up a fight to fight, making us forget that the action of the match was the DiBiase of the boring and Dusty Rhodes. Even though the vision was the first team to have all its members saved (and only two since '87 have four victims, this match had no wing. This was the longest match of the night, and Jake made his repeat performance of '88 when he was left alone with four men and ruled. I think he could smell better. Nowadays, the match would have finished the way around. One of the short SS matches has also been the most amazing one. The most wrestler of the lowest wrestler, Tito Santana was a wrestler of the nightmare, to paint the color and pinning Boris Zukhov, Tanaka, and even Warlord in the final live matches. It was amazing to see him too much, then go back to his normal work. Sgt. Slaughter also did well, overcoming Volkoff and Bushwhackers, but that was not surprising. Titus was. <br /> <br /> I think the only action of the live match was Hogan and the Warrior to win together. <br /> <br /> This show was boring and match too short. The beginning of the Undertaker was cool, but Tito Santana that's why I will remember this.
