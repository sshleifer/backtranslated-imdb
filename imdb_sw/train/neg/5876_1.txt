I had to compare two versions of Hamlet to my Shakespeare class and unfortunately I have taken this version. Everything from acting (executives provides more of their direct lines to the camera) for camera shots (both intermediate or almost near shots ... no scenery shots and very little back ground in shots) were quite awesome. I looked at this on my spring break and it's very safe to say that I feel I had had 114 minutes of my vacation. Not recommended for any stretch of ideas.
