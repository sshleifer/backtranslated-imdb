Acting, other reviews no matter, were done well. Brad Pitt is responsible for the responsibility of suppressing the Austrian player completely. Another job is good. This story would have to beat riveting, but somehow, it disappears - a person does not know the truth or cares about the characters shown, and so the story, which may be quite strange, can not draw in this audience. The beauty of the landscape and the cinema, the most wonderful story, the most important events that were created in the world we live in - but I can't, try as I can, engage in this story. As a fan of Brad Pitt who is not surprising (I see he is one of the top executives of his generation), I expected * to love this flick - and yet, has left me cold. It can be a failure in me, but I am sure to go to the end of this film, leadership, text, production, editing - somehow, they lost me. It's a shame, because it can be good. <br /> <br /> Good act, wonderful story, well beaten - should be good. It was not. Perhaps it's important to look at, just to make your own mind about it - but don't wait too much, and maybe you won't be as desperate as I was. To a large extent, beat me.
