This is the worst evil of home movies that I have seen! See section 1 and two, but don't let anyone say that this is better than the first! I mean, in fact, it creates a film, then do it with the same characters and artists, and then make another series with DIFFERENT characters and actors! I mean, it would be the same if this would not be a "movie only" movie, but they made it only home cinema. Culkin is too old now, so you think stop making orders! Beauty, this movie makes me SICK! Buy 1 and 2 parts.
