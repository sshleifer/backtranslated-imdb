This film is also Zadora special! When looking at it, I remembered the classic cartoon showing the Hollywood star; in the need for an additional role but the fear of being common to the 'B' movie or a smooth smooth roles; who says in his surrender session "Of course I am not usually doing the work that needs dirt, but if necessary for film ...............". This memory brought a very bad picture of the same cartoon which also shows in the same session saying, â€œWell, it is not usually to take any responsibilities that require real work, but if it gives me enough to increase my status as sex signs ....... ........... ". This is probably the right, the worst desire is the book of Harold Robbins; based on the story of the story too. They also do not receive improper attention, and perhaps also (who once won the acting in Butterfly) deliberately engages his part instead of trying to act in the unpopular place. Critics often say first to artists as a problem whenever the film is misleading, but this is very bad; The authors and director are often very guilty parties. The real problem with "Lady Lonely" is that the screenplay, like the original book, looks at the sensation rather than the drug, and nothing can help with this. <br /> <br /> The publisher of this film is bad, but if the story could be made more successful with the best script, the operation of the teuter and effective acting must necessarily remain a question of personal judgment. If it was given, my audience scope depends on whether I look at my personal opinion, or to assess how much the film succeeds in giving what is required to do. My personal rating will be two out of ten; but somehow this film will probably give its best donors, and be judged on this basis the quality of four out of ten will be wise. Being in a sense of help, and wanting to make it clear that I did not blame Him for my despair, I will give the fourth IMD score.
