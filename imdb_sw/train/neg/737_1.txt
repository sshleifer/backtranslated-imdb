WEN! I just got this film from my friend, who bought it for 1.98 at Walmart, and felt he was taken! It's more interesting, many events have been done in front of green screens, acting is somewhat improved, almost as if they had no script. Martians are CGI, which looks like they were made by the pastor, or movie produced by Fan. I can't stress how this DVD was so bad! <br /> <br /> Example: In one of the scenarios, martians disrupt the rural women. She goes from a woman in front of a green screen, a woman's CGI copy. Changes seem completely, and when he is killed, you can see that it is a computer figure, look like something from the game back in 1990! <br /> <br /> As far as possible, avoid this movie as a blow! You can download two tractors from their site, and see how god-bad is true!
