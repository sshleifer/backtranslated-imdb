How often do we have to see horrible movies and killer in the player's mask? Bleed program is kinda natural but the movie itself is a complete failure. For one thing the discussion has not been made well, it is boring and it loses a lot of time on extraordinary details, acting is bad, and so on. I want my money back, this lease reduces more than skunk.
