I have read Reveler's novel of Ben Mezrich a few years ago and last night I came to an accident to see this. Though it has been years since I read the first story, the difference between the novel and the movie is humongous. The most important features, which have done anything is written out or have been changed to bad. <br /> <br /> If the plot seems interesting to you: go and get a novel. It's very much, much better. Yet 4 out of 10 since it was difficult to stop watching because of Ben Mezrich's primary plot.
