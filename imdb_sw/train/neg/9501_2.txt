This is the "House of Exorcism", but many people have compiled this film with the microphone of Mario Bava, "Lisa & Devil", which describes the highest level of this, "House of exorcism." When "Lisa and the Devil" was shown in the film festivals in the early 70's, it was a great success. The audience responded well to this amazing Gothic film. Unfortunately it was a little before time, and it was considered to be very odd, and not commercial enough for large expenditures. No distributor would buy. The producer Alfredo Leone decided to edit 'Lisa', apparently with a series of chainsaw, by removing half of the original film, adding new scenes, which he made two years after the original product! It is important to note that Bava did not have a few things about these new additions, so the "House of Exorcism" is not a Bava film. The original product is the slow production, the dream, the classy. A few minutes on the film, the viewer is given to this world of dreams, suddenly we see Lisa, (two years old, with a very different haircut), start writing down, making the intestines and epitaphs of croaking like "Suck co co." my k ", etc. Way, huh? And the film continues like this, jump back and forth between the beautiful, visual, and Z of Z "Exorcist" rip-off. Leone was trying to incorporate these horrible events, taking into account such stories. Failed to disappoint. When the election was made to destroy "Lisa and the devil", Bava himself refused, saying that her film was very good to cut. He was right, and it must be very sad for this artist to see all his work being destroyed and fall under the toilet. It was many years before the original "Lisa and the Devil" appeared again, again on the night television. I saw a "lisa" long before seeing this new version, and it was hard to witness one of my favorite films "spoiled" this way. It is important to see only for curiosity. Otherwise avoid this unfortunate disaster as a blow.
