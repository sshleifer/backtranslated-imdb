It's hard to imagine that anyone can get this short of their love if they have seen many of their shorts, but I know that humor is very subjective. I have seen all their sound shorts (far beyond their IMO items) and I have seen this of their weak efforts. This year it was done (1930) Stan and Babe did 15 short with one feature. They were very popular and their boss Hal Roach used full advantage to keep them active. In addition, this was a time of experiment with authors and Stan. I would like to say this was an attempt that did not work. If someone else said, it does not play for their abilities. Many conversations and plot. The best part of this is for a very large sequence with Stan as a subscriber Agnes and Thelma Todd's great talking about "girl" things. <br /> <br> If you want to see boys on their creative and amazing checks Blotto, or Brats From the same year. <br /> <br /> They made a short brief for a very short time that I think they might be forgiven by dropping a few down then briefly. They did something like a 108 film altogether. Very few (except for those made on FOX) were completely defeated but there are some. Hospital, Me And My Pal, The Ghost Ghost, Upper Fixer come to mind as those basically weak. But others let those find something strange to close with all their shorts. It's just a record in my book. If you have seen and enjoy all the other shorts then by all means check this out, but I would be willing to make this bet was low and did not remember Stan and Babe.
