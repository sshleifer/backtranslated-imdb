This may be strong from historical events, and we know that the creators of this television festival took liberty to make it more - I could live with it - but it was a very bad job! I was surprised in the event of the mid-air crisis how everyone seemed calm, someone could be scared, and it was a smooth trip, there was no disruption of the passenger visible - coming! I do not know about the rules, these days some of the safety features of the airplane seem to be a nonsense of OTT, but why take off shoes before an emergency landing, common sense tells me this is not a good idea! Shots of this large airplane dropping out of this rural airport were unstable and fake. In fact it would have been an astonishing eye from the ground around, in this film was incompatible and looked like a model that probably was. The slide escape was seen in the front and central emergency doors, but no one appeared from the outside, though the tone was too low. Captain returned to the plane after landing - why? this was never explained. We know the emergency landing because of being out of fuel, but however there must be oil around the tanks, and the risk of explosion should be a real risk, but the transfer seemed very close, and everyone stands near the foot of the slides of escape instead of getting as far as possible, if I am sure I would do it. There were so many variations, mistakes and actions that were made in this. I would like to see the representation of this game in real time, and with the actual motion of the flight shown. It had the potential to be quite exciting, but of course due to the budget constraints failed, and making one feel that a plane's lost engine was not a big thing, and you could stay safe to a bit of speed, but no real danger! - The fact of the truth will be quite different!
