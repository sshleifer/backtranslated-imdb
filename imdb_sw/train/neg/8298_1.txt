This film was not very entertaining, certainly not there as original or beautiful as a Christmas story. The characters (except the smallest) try to imitate the previous actors, and fail. The neighbors of the hill come from anywhere if they were not part of the first movie. This reluctantly, it may be good and cast previously, then again maybe not because the story is very weak. Skip it.
