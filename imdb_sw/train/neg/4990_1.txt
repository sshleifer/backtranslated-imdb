I can enjoy the citizens of the flick of pleasure, but this is just bad. And it's not bad in a way that you can enjoy seeing MST3K fun. It's too bad if you can't find anything to enjoy about this regardless of how you try. I really feel that I lose 2 hours of precious life on this trick. You can say by checking that no one was asked to act and everyone knows that this film will only cover their work. It seems "Walking Long" has earned enough income that someone decided to overcome their investments. If it's not the worst movie I saw, it's so bad that it has erased the bad film from my memory.
