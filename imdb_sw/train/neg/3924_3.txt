True film, engaging, endless. Director Bellocchio seems to have been recommended by a good face and figure of his actor - and who can blame him? But maybe, just maybe, he should have his little attention in making a good film, sharing. I hate it when the sex film is seen as a "art film" just to be more "respectable". Typically, regular sex incidents are the only reason for this film. Neither nor is it worth staying through all the pictures are strictly delicious. (*)
