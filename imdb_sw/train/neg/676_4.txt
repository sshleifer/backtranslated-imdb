I wanted to see it because of two reasons. One, it was remake of High Sierra and Bogart, two, Bogart's section was played by Jack Palance, who can play great roles and skills, like in the Big Knife. But now I wonder why they decided to beat this remake. The film follows the same plot as Hig Sierra; just here, administrators don't care, the director lost in his mind, and who knows what the producer was thinking. Jack Palance is getting bored watching Shelley Winters and Shelley Winters is asking yourself what he does in this film. I don't even want to compare it to Ida Lupino in that role. And of course, they had to use the dog story again! They would certainly come up with different ideas. Perhaps the color makes it well to see the area where they beat High Sierra, but that definitely does not add any quality to the film. <br /> <br /> It is a waste of time if you have seen High Sierra before. Otherwise, why not see the pseudo-film sound. And I would rather die than see once more ...
