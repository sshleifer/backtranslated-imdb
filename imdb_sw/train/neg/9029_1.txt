This film loses almost every actor's talent in what can be charitable to be "potboiler". With the opening of the 'top stage' all guns are descending from there with great humor and impossible circumstances to follow up until you try to isolate your popcorn. There are many lines of deaths in this movie I thought one time was made by publishing a lost TV series. The role of the Mexican drug of Quinn is laughable and his 'partners' have been broken out of the Quinn-Martin copyrights of the 1970s. Nor did we believe that the wife is falling in fellowship with the first body of fire coming. The 'B' course is the best and the time was lost for everyone involved.
