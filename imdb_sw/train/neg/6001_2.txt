This might seem to be mad for people who remember this show ... But I remembered this as being alive. I don't think I ever saw a cartoon. but the film? maybe. I remember it's very clear. The boy was in the kinda building as a showroom room. He even had a red jacket. It was dark out and turned into a red car and there was this man at the next level looking down. The car / boy went around and hit through the window of a great showroom and out on the road. And then he drove. That's all I remember. I believe that someone else out there remembers this too. If not, maybe I am still mad. But I have no hope.
