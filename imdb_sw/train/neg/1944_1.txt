I grew up with Scooby doo all my life, my father grew up with scooby doo. We just watched the first part of the shadow that calls Shaggy and Scooby to get a clue. What planet is Warner Bros on allowing this air shambles. The characters can be better with my younger sister. Stories would have been better written by my 3-year-old cousins ​​(who are Scooby Doo fans too). Scooby and Shaggy just not !!!!! if anyone but Casey Kasem does the voice of Shaggy not only working for people !!!! believe me. This plan was embarrassing. What Scooby Doo is better. Why change the structure of winning. Hit this piece of garbage and return to the true Scooby
