Before I wrote this review, I returned and re-read the views of others. This movie was a passion for me, since it attracts my two famous players, Gene Kelly and George Chakiris, who have many scores for many wonderful times Michel LeGrand ("Wuthering Heights," "Ice Station Zebra," "Thomas Crowne Affair" "). Dance was stuck, uncomfortable and unusual, songs forgetting to forget, joke stories. Even the most expensive was not very interesting. Just photographing is precisely hold the good condition and spirit. I am glad some people have enjoyed the "Youth of Rochefort," though I certainly did not.
