This is one of those movies that you think the creators will refuse to open because it is so frightening. Obviously they thought that children are ignorant and it is best to absorb the endless spots and think it is entertainment because it's a funny slapstick. What is the car talking to the buttons that say Wendy's, McDonalds, M & M and Skittles? There was no car talking on the cartoon. (Dr) Claw should be bad, not good and charming. Why Ruppt Everet 'Claw' however? Were the authors on drugs when they wrote these scenes? It seems that they were (obstacles) of the Cop Cop, and turned the man into something to fight the android crime. I tried to recover my money but there was a policy where if I looked over 30 minutes of the movie, you don't have a reward. Sorry I watched more than 30 minutes of the hippo. After being told a non-refundable policy, I decided to look at all the hideous trash called Inspector Gadget.
