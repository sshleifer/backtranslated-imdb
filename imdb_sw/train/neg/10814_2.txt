As a fan of "Jane Eyre" I was glad when this movie came out. "Finally," I thought, "someone will make this book a film that follows the story written by the author." Wrong !!! If the casting director was willing to throw "Jane" who was obviously succeeded. However, he would surely find someone who can also do. Where were you among Jane and Rochester? Did you have a spooky trouble of novel when the laughter that went into the night looked from anywhere? Where was the baby who loved and played like her mother? Finally, why was the plot changed last? Someone is wondering if the scribe had read the book. What a desire
