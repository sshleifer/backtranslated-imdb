I've never seen the 1973 edition, more tested. I am a fan of Nicholas Cage (by the way, good acting as usual). This movie probably took five minutes to reinforce the whole plot (I can see it happening on the dinner bed at the dinner party), if you can't imagine the end of this drool in the first thirty minutes you will probably find this film entertainment. That's of late, the terrible rut that Hollywood seems to have found itself with a kind of fear / mystery / friller, can not give the audience a sufficient credit and write a new, smart, fun and fun, clean music and throw it into a few things to trigger a little and then send the final magazines to your theater. At least, he did not have a hand camera hand-held hand.
