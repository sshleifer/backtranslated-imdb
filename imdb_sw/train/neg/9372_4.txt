This is the most common of Universal Horror flick: its technical calculation, if by number, and the cutting of cookie cutting and greatly affecting. The most interesting part of this film is the cast of Runt Hatton, a man with bone disease as a "monster" of the film. His sadness to see this person using, but maybe he used the money they had paid him. Hatton is less awesome than the expected studio, as often I felt sympathy on fear or even losing. Martin Koslack is on the board as a mad film artist, and very amusing in this section. I gladly see Koslack for almost everything; for some reason this person bothers me. The only part of the film that I enjoyed is a wonderful film to take the world of art. Here we are shown the critics of evil who appear to their ability to break artists; this includes a "hero" male who is a "artist" who draws ... do this ... pin up girls. Somehow the work of our hero is reviewed for the innovation of villan. Also exciting is the main striker of the film, who at one time says that he despises the mystery of the hero on art because "such women do not exist" which our heroine responds to the point that the critic is unable to come out. Finally, there is a little bit of a lesson about the heroine (who is an expert on own art) inside the house and the man who guidesâ€¦ quite anti-female and ignorant witness. In general this film is a very thoughtful picture and a few interesting things.
