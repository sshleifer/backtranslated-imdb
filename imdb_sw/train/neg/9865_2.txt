I took this movie in hopes that it would be the same "Few" of the Dead Gentlemen Productions (which is highly recommended, by the way). Boy, it's a problem! The movie is shot in this fake style documentary made popular with the office but fails to deliver. The reason is part of a strong but particularly writing and leading. True, it may be funny to use every cliche pregnancy there on play space games, but here it is done in a way that becomes very predictable. Already the beginning of each area you know what "joke" will be over. But perhaps the biggest problem is that everything is shown up. There is no deception in this film, if it would have a short description "LAUGH NOW" or a less than 80s-laughter laughter screens will not be very different. For other events you can't help to think “Yes, I see why you thought this would be fun” but the way it happens takes all the speed from the joke of possibilities.
