Thanks to the inappropriate, incompatible, and Neil Simon screenplay, with enough direction from Robert Moore, Chapter Two becomes an amazing display for Marsha Mason who received the fourth of Oscar nods for Second Chapter to give the same performance here given to the Freedom of Freedom Cinnderella (73), beautiful girl (77), Audrey Rose (78) and just when I laugh (81); this time only has no child around. Chapter Two is the third and final film of Moore which has previously said Neil Simon's Detective (78) and Death Death (76). Caan is sent, the characters are mono-dimensional, the dialogue is more analysis, and there is almost no setup details. The first half is less-than-attractive, meet with cute, coy romance between Caan blinkered and Mason chipper, and the second half dreary makes you long for the first half. NYC sites along with Joe Bologna, and Valerie Harper very thin are useless, but at least provides trouble to welcome. And in the end and the youngest, there is a very bad song hit during credit.
