This is probably the worst movie, seriously. I could do better than myself, not even better. It's like this film had a $ 5 budget and was lost and changes. Don't look at it. I have never found all the way through this movie, I must have keys. I have this 1/10 because it was hilarious how the producer of this movie wanted to be a terrible film, but actually turned it to a very bad comedy. Basically, a group of girls drove, they broke the head, and the owner of the car followed them. What I saw was gunmen telling the burden of girls to pick up all their clothes, what is hell? It must have some kind of movie of cheesy porn too.
