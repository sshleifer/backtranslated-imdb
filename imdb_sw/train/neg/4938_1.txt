The boat had a huge load of crap I've lost my time looking. This version derived from Geico ads is less than entertainment then 30 sec of Geico. Decoration was half of the ass saying a little, hard to figure out the caveman with white shepherd teeth even after going to the dentist. This view can be as likely to be a good series if they could get healed from advertising, which in it makes for a lousy show. Maybe if the authors were similar to the advertisements of this Geico might be a chance, instead of the experiment did not have a good story line. I offer this 1 show out of 10, I would like to put a zero out of 10 but that's not an option. I pray for a quick death for this show, I would like to give them less than 5 times before the death of a suitable death.
