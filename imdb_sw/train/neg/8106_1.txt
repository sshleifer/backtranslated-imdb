Hardly, Why do American and Frech actors pretend to be Czech and need to speak full English and Russian fake? I am a human being, so I enjoyed the improper shortness - but the flick of smooth and soft flickers would have more than that, and at least I do not make it a artistic. All political information that did not cause pain - has a director when he heard a lie? Acting was also powerful and melodramatic, and the comic exemption was not funny. The characters were very low, and I was not able to identify them completely. Little where I laughed is when they refused actors in pictures of protests in Prague - and they were black and white and then sepia in order to resemble a picture-just cunning. I read a short story of Kundera (not the Light of the Increased Light), and there are good things about his style of writing (though his theme is one male fantasy) - and it should say, the film is not recommended any good quality of the Kunderas style.
