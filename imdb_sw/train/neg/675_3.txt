The city girl Meg Tilly receives a terrible phone from her mother and, because of the disturbance, returns home to dig in her village, only to have trouble: why do all the residents of the house make strange and uncomfortable ways? Radiation thriller, and difficult not to the environment, has a small population of the city going to berserk, which (laughably) comprises two women looking at a public place and Tim Matheson received oral ideas from a girl on the office bench. The picture is silly with words, losing Tilly wistfulness and tranquility on the trash while forcing itself into the corner can not possibly hope to get out. Some of the movie shows by Thomas Del Ruth are good (especially a flame set in the garage), although it is reduced by scrappy editing - and the end of the competition. Simple screenplay has surprises not of its natural sleeve. * 1/2 from ****
