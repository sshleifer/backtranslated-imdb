This is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but I can't remember when I found it worse. I thought this would be about the investigation of the plane crash. What really was a soap opera, and one bad for it. They enjoyed the 'crisis' card severely. At first or so it looks like a shouting match, and some events are healed. It 's possible to spoiler * <br /> <br /> A record of 40 minutes or more minutes (with a black ambulance required by rain) for lost victims were disabled, and I thought it couldn't end up. Avoid this at all costs, unless you broadcast on 'conflicts'. <br /> <br />
