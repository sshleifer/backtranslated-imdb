The first was the best. The second thing was because the conversation was terrible. Although, the story of the story was not bad (in fact, all the lines of the story are good and bad). In all movies, I gave birth a few times. I know that Jackie Chan is a great military expertise, but not a good actor at Rush hour 2. Chris Tucker, too, was not good. And Zhang Ziyi, I can say what, a few lines, acting bad (But that depends on its script). All the characters there were not good. But, some of the things that I like in Rush 2 are always works with a little sex sex. I know that Jackie Chan does not do those things that are best for her.
