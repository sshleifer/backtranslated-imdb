This was a movie about honesty and revenge. Twins have a sense of connecting "twin" which is something wrong with her sister. This movie took forever to form a plot. The program was carried out many times. Acting was lousy for the most part. Once the plot comes together, the movie is approaching. Laura and Ashley are twins who live with a bad father. Dad seems to be interested in Ashley, so Laura gets blame for everything. There is a promise that girls cannot be far away, but as they grow, their lives go in different ways. Ashley gets a job at dinner where she meets Barry, a married man. Of course no good can come of this. The fact that Barry had tinnitus was a bad excuse for a follow-up. I continued to wait for this movie to be better and to have a certain resolution somewhere, but it never happened.
