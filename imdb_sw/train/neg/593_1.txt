This is probably the worst movie I saw. Worse than America's disgusting circles; worse than Glitter - Mariah Carey in the US par excellence par. I can only think that the author and producer were taking a large amount of entertainment, and when discussing the plot they really thought it was a good idea. not. It is a trash that is not from the very intestines of Satan himself (who may have written the best script he had put in his mind). Robert Jones as the Exce Producer, using our taxpayer money (lottery people) on this absurd piece, should be responsible. Who on earth thought would be a good idea to do again Deathline ??? I ask you - camping like Christmas tree, Deathline ... 'Considering the doors' is a classic movie of the worst of England, we don't need to remind you. And indeed we do not have poor, second rate, scripted bad, bad development and bad rubbish like this. All of this from the UK finance organization that brought us the Sexual Sexual Male Sex ... I rest my case. Do not pay any money to see this. It is full and wonderful - one grace saving for producers is that they have a big money money ... our money ... by making it. They should be covered with their heads in shame. It is broken at the bottom, the bottom of this film. It makes me mgr that our national body with the help of the film really thought it was necessary to support. There is no hope for the British film industry when ignorant run the show. Where is Harvey Wienstein? Go back, we forgive you !!!
