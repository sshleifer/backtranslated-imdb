I have started to melt so I will make these reviews brief and sweet as possible. <br /> <br /> There is this astronaut, and it goes up to the airport with two other people, to know? Except for what happens to radiation, and then when they come back ... well, don't worry what happened to other boys, but our astronaut has started to melt! No, not just burn, but MELT! As a string of ice cream in July! Well, maybe not quickly, but you know what I mean. However, it gets red and gooey all, and the fact that the creator makes it very mad. I think he also looked at the book of "mortal man" because suddenly he knows that to stop disappearing, he needs to eat human flesh, so he starts to beat people away. There are other characters, but in a movie where a person watches and melts and melts (and melts), do you? need others? What is important who will follow, and WHAT will remain? HOW long will it take for him to reflect completely? Why was this film made first? WHEN did they get money? WHAT do you sleep when you look? I have been very close, but I still have enough time to tell you that this film is very interesting, although the idea is true and smooth. Shapes are beautiful but everything else is ... SPLAT
