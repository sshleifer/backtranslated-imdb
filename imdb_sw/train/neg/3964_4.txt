With all the stick about this film, I continued to have a clear idea about what I was finally thinking about. And, although it is slow in time, the 90% movie is quite good, and more than a few "old time" causes that makes one and failure. I really thought the movie was best about many of these events. Where Dark Times fail, however, it is at its peak. At the end of the film and denouement is what appears to be MILES APART from its body. The story of the story falls completely on his face and the unreasonable conclusion and, the more I sought, what happened to Emma? - not explained above! The attitude of the bad energy was always good, and finally, I heard a lot. What could be a great horror film that eventually came to an end.
