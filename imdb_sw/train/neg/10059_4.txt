I anticipated a letter of tobacco industry in North Carolina. Instead I watched a man who breaks the fact that his grandfather lost his tobacco kingdom to the Duke family. And this continued to continue. If Mr. McElwee's family defeated the Somalias I am sure that Mr. McElwee will have any problems with death caused by tobacco-related diseases. I grew close to the area where Mr. McElwee's family started a tobacco business; I expected more to rule for McEwee for his family. I learned a little about the history of tobacco in the NC economy and the effectiveness of the government's economy for greater control of tobacco. Most of the movie "Bright Leaves" does not come out - Why if Gary Cooper played Mr McElee's great grandfather? Does the viewer gain any insight into the role of tobacco in the North Carolina economy by depicting the old movie films? We don't.
