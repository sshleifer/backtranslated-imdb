Dear God! I continued to wait for this movie to "start" ... then wait to surrender itself ... and when it didn't, I sat there, I said that: 1) it could be bad, and 2) that I had lost several hours just for ignorance. I was confident that Drew could not have done this bad film ... and a boy, did you? I lost my faith! Don't bother with this! Drew tried, but the movie was written badly, inappropriate to work, and just a bad pregnancy! I can't believe this bad script has been sponsored! It had a million chance to do something with that idea, (the word "concept" is too big for this film even worthy!) And STILL didn't go anywhere! It's just a pity! Where another inspector thought it was not worse, he beat me! Because you believe me, if it's worse I would like to blow my scissors before it is finished!
