Color **** **** <br /> Completely of course, one of the funniest comedies has been created for screens. It is impossible to take any of this seriously. It would take a great novel to list all the ways of comedy in it. In the days of his plan of glory, Carol Burnett and the company, who often took the film, used this in ways that were hard to imagine. Carol played Jenny who suddenly got a mild cough disease and once a treacly music came and everyone looked around the place she appeared. Harvey Korman played Oliver and locks locks and almost loved Ryan O'Neal. The only funnier than this little, is a real film. <br /> <br /> What! Death zone at the end. Jenny looks like she is dying to die ... she is dying for her childpower to enter and give her a little color. And in fact, we all know how many times hospitals encourage a loved one to sleep with them at the end of the patient. The last part with Ryan O'Neal sitting on the bench in the snow reflecting his future in the movie business is the classic instant. He had a lot of worry about. He no longer received from this.
