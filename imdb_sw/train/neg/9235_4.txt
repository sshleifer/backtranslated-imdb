This woman never stops talking in the movie. He embraced every line, and delivered it all without natural feelings. It also has the most uncharming lisp, and the pitch of its voice looks like nails on the board. This film has very Betsy Drake, and it is not enough Cary Grant, who took what remained of the film.
