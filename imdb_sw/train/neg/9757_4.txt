It's not the biggest film to remember Paul Naschy and. Gaston (Guillermo Bredeston) is probably the worst tenant I ever seen. Zorro would be ashamed! His only rescue came as the competition was very bad. <br /> <br /> This film is described as adventure and fear. Forget the fear - no. No dirt, no blood, no creatures; The Robin Hood event against the bad Baron (Paul Naschy) who wants to be King. The main feature of the film was Graciela Nilson, who had only four films for two years and lost our sad loss. Where did he go?
