I was more interested in the preliminary inquiry for this film. After all, this is one of the oldest and most difficult stories known to mankind, and it was one of the first epic stories I read as a child (even before Tolkien). I must say that it was YOUR SPIRIT. They did it with a joke and turned it into an opera one of a long soap. Things that were loyal to the conspiracy were kept in such a way that the audience was often laughing at the silly script which was only a oral service for all these wars. It was a great desire to see the hard character like Achilles (who has a wonderful mix of the closest power of the Matrix, the greatest evil and the male lovers in the original poem) to turn to "Fabio beach" for Pitt's art (with a good script and more effort can be turned this into a more complicated figure and original Hollywood Hollywood has ever produced). Actors were really decent, trying to make the best of the ridiculous script. It was losing many talent (Peter O'Toole stole the show, and Orlando Bloom and Sean Bean were concerned). Compare with LOTR or Gladiator and even hold a light on them. Many of the hunks for women run over but not enough to fight the battle for the movie which is on one long battle and siege. I can't recommend anyone to pay to see this story violated through the soil as one of the characters (at least they found that part right).
