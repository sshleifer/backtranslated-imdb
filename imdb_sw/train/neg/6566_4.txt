I watched this film after having a lot of trouble in downloading quickly. And we must say, it is not worthy. <br /> <br /> Parinda was so hyped, that I was actually looking forward to looking. Parinda is one of those movies that fail to meet the standards set by other good Indian films, despite having a good story. It was more sad to know, that the story itself was not natural, it was not based on the classic "On Waterfront". Anil Kapoor was angry, especially when she comes from America. The trends did not always have quality, except a few of the events. Give this script to any of them - Ram Gopal Verma, Deepa Mehta, Mahesh Bhatt, Sudhir Mishra, and I'm 100% sure, they will make a movie of mind from them. I say Parinda was bad. Not only helpful.
