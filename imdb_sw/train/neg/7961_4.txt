Five years after Creepshow's nature, another end of the worst fear is written by George A. Romero and Stephen King: Creepshow 2. This time there are only three stories instead of five. No three stories are original or known. The first story is a great fear, a story of a form about the Indian wooden image that wants to take revenge on its owners. The effects are positive in this story, but it is a very good family to have enough force. George Kennedy and Dorothy Lamour play the shop owners of the elderly. The second story, "Raft", is the story of Stephen King. It is about four young people who spend one day on a wooden mat in the middle of a special lake. Soon children cry out for their life as a blob of water which each of them because there is no clear. However, instead of worrying, children are engaging in bad conversations and dopey's behavior, preventing us from caring specifically about what happens next. There is also an optional humor in this section. The third and final story is "Hitch-hiker", which is actually retread re -ad adapted to Creepshow 2. Original stories, and Lucille Fletcher, was held in 1953 as a film film black film. Then it was adapted to the most popular part of the Twilight Area involving Inger Stevens. "Pastor" does the best of these three offerings, but not his problems. Lois Chiles has a cheating wife, who ends up running on a player, or so he thinks. However, we do not know if we are grateful to him or to judge him. As in most of the most common stories of this kind, characters are only present to tell stories by moving and turning them. Gathering close to stories and viewers seem less out of place. Tom Savini looks like "goes" in this phase. The good thing I did not exist anymore. * 1/2 of 4 stars.
