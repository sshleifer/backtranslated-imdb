I don't like such a patient love as I picture. Finally the film shows Alex's sexual relationship, Kik, Sandu's love of triangles were gentle, confused and envious, eventually Alex got up and realized that they would have no consequences for the future. Tudor Giurgiu's director was in the AMC hall on 12:00 on 10/10/06, and we watched the movies together. After the film told the audience that the intention to create this film which was to show Romanian sexual relations was difficult. <br /> <br /> In my view of sex is always hard everywhere, I don't feel emotion and some effect from the film. The love of the love of Alex and Kiki, and Kiki and his brother Sandu were a kind of close neighboring story. The two main reasons I don't like this movie is, first, the film did not tell us how they started falling in love? It seems that after Alex moved to a building that Kiki was living, then two girls came in love. It doesn't matter. How a girl would like for another girl instead of someone. Too many pieces, you need a picture and connect these stories to your mind. Secondly, the entire film did not have sex with Alex and Kik, that's what I was waiting for ???? However, there were still some parts to recommend. "Loss of the ear" part was of an interesting variety. Alex was willing to suffer the pain of losing ear to appreciate the love of kik. That was a touching event that gave you a little idea of ​​their love. Also, they were sleeping in a soccer field, a conversation showing their love and sincerity.
