Kitten Natividad, the popularity of the movie Russ Meyer, plays Chastity Knott, a woman who has had breast cancer, so she goes to South America to get special fruit (Crockazilla?) Which should have the power to heal. After the decline of some of these fruits (which appear to be a plastic banana in the stalks) the hygienic is given magical secret powers which makes him a top hero, in particular, Double D Avenger. Remember that also wearing a pair of panties like a mask. By writing, it all looks very good. In practice, well, it leaves more than a little want. It seems that Chastity owns a pub and a collaborative partnership breaks because it removes their business so that some vendors (including Haji, also the popularity of Russ Meyer film) go after a contempt. Of course, Chastity is fighting back in the diagram of Double D Avenger. Look at her to make a kind of "Wonder Woman" turn into her dress and also lose her balance due to many centrifugal power. Bad jokes and double-emerging jumping as if they had no tomorrow. For the worldly theme of the world, it comes as a fingerprint of "action action" of religious and adult content, although this time is not uninstalled you may leave with PG-13 during the worst. And perhaps it is a blessing that faded stars are well preserved. This makes Chesty Morgan's films of Doris Wishman look very good at comparison. Appearance special with Forest J. Ackerman but so what. Very fool, and I have never bought another film by Joe Bob Briggs on the lid. 2 out of 10.
