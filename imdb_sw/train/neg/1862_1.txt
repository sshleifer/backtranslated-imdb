It's not just a conspiracy that makes this movie be off for an instant audience. It's a horrible dimension with a bad script and wrong left and right which makes this too agonizing look. Sorry but I don't see 'fun' in this. Just exciting to show many mistakes and stupid links. Well, I wonder how directors think of their company producing when this movie was first introduced. Maybe like a dumb like the sheriff who lives in a full truck full of antifreeze and a blood injury. Oops! What? I forgot to pronounce this sheriff is not only a poor actress but can also eliminate hanging and load antifreeze to strengthen the open body? I think he loved to forget when he won the most unpleasant victory on the striker.
