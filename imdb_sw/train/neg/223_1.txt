Not a 'woman film' but a film for the group. One of the worst films made by a male director about a woman. Director Andy McKay does not know the woman. Unhealthy cities, the style of American Pie humor, unfamiliar story, no sense, unfamiliar story, depicted characters. Vulgar fantasies came to life on the screen. Simplify and definitely not funny. I wonder how three good actors agreed to participate in it.
