Okay, first of all, Steve Irwin, rest in peace. You are loved by many fans. Now ... this film was not quite a movie. It was a "Crocodile Planner" TV and bad text, bad literature, and a bad lead between Steve or teaching about animals. He had an entertainment as a hunter / animal. Millions will miss him. But the whole idea of ​​the movie was a big mistake. The plan was broken, almost nonexistent. Composing was bad. Acting was not worth the primary school level actors. Trends should also be wrong too. If you can't get the best half-performance from your executives, no matter what a bad script, it shouldn't be good at first. I could write the best script. I would never have seen this film. Of course, I looked at $ 3 ($ 1.50 to me, $ 1.50 for my child.) Outdoors with friends who insisted on seeing this instead of Scooby Doo Live Action. My son, who did not discriminate, liked the movie well, but has never seen it again. If you want records of Steve Irwin's records, you can buy his own series on DVD. Avoid this movie as a blow. If I am Steve, I know I didn't want to be remembered for this film. Respect: Avoid this movie!
