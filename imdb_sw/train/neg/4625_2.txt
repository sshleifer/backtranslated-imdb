What? How did 4 of the 16 voters pay this 10 film? What? More than half of voters before giving 7 or more? Who voted here? I can only assume it is especially children - very young children. The fact is that this is a bad movie every way. Stories are stupid; Acting is hard even to think of as acting; characters do not get; and the conversation is terrible. I saw one rainy day at the Sci-Fi center. In a sad case that is repeated again, I give them a book instead.
