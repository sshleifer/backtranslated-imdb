I wonder if there is any sense of meaning in this film. It's a great joke. Good. Its entertainment. You get to see a clever plot of films in the form of films. Priest (a pros) has a good mother for two happy people Salman / Rani who want a child but can't. I wonder how it would be if this game was the real life of a real couple life. Rani seems to be happy with another beautiful woman in her home who has been brought to make a child for her & Salman. He cares about welfare and tries to push her husband Salman to Preity so they can love. What? What will the audience do during Salman's nakhras? <br /> <br /> If the best time of the past, this movie cannot focus. Anger.
