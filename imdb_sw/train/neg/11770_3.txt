'P' (or Club-P) must be called 'L' for disabled people. Every ceremony has a desire and this is what it cannot live according to its great line: "The Thai people are fighting monsters." Instead, this is the story of a Khmer country girl whose grandmother has taught her little magic with a few unusual rules (but specific): "don't go under clothes," "eat raw meat," and "do not accept money for your authority.

You have been warned!
