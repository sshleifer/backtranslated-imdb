For the love of God please don't see this movie! It is a waste of time, the plot is expected, such as romantic events. Trying to create a very little bit, this film and its bad predictable villain are just cripples. The characters have not been created, and many films are fitted with Rome shades, which are more interesting than the real film. Above all, acting is a shame. I know everyone tries to get their niche, but this is really a disaster. I can't believe that someone actually earned even millions of pounds by putting this film on the screen. Don't waste money or time on this film, go to your grandmother or something better instead.
