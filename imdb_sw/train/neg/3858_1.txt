What's awesome, TERIBILE, film! One of the worst movies I have seen in my life. I often like movies like this, all "The boy meets a woman who loves him, but it happens to be willing to cooperate with someone, who is not right to him ....". I expected something was predictable and I had no intelligence. The cinema is always the entertainment mixing the right amount of romance and comedy, but not this! One joke falls flat and "romance" makes me vomit. The title of the head is one of the many characters "please kill me" who I have preached on my television, "female woman" is not very eccentric, more like quirky and awesome. "Another person" is the most intelligent person, mature in this film but also happens to be as angry. These movies appear, you have no way around, don't waste your time.
