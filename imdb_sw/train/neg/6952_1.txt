Stimulate the worst of the largest series. It should not be named Battlestar Galactica, because it's just the same name. So many changes change. You have the characters you have turned from the male to the female, black to the text for all the cylon through "attracting the female audience," when there were powerful female characters who could be more powerful. Gone is an Egyptian feeling. Gone is the world effort. Lack of cylons going to refuse to finish lifting the film, especially when someone is made a fembot. In fact the original show had a lot of cheese, but it had a great follow-up. They tried to hold on to the following but to give them anything to work with and spit on their face because they made their "own story." Change is positive, when they do something better, not just make them.
