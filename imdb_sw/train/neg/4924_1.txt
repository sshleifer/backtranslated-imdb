This film is very bad. Maybe maybe, but it's. It's true. Wrong script, every vampire clich√© in the book is used, and no mercy is given entirely by the nature of the main character ... ie Dracula ole. There have been some real dracula / vampire movies in the past, but this does not even insert it into the "slot". Choose a selection of people who seem to have stopped moving with young people, an increase in dribble of Dracula Lore and mixing in the tonic of religious / surreal-dreaming day ... <br /> <br /> I really can't find the good things to say about this film, if it wasn't so bad that it was made at first place, it seems to have made the English effect of Johnny Lee Miller ... What a problem I heard was crying out. Well, he is English, but he looks like Merika is trying to make an English accent. <br /> <br /> All in all you can also say your money (if you think buying), or renting out, check out, and find out why it's like scary like Tellytubbies. <br /> <br /> PS Though La La is awesome!
