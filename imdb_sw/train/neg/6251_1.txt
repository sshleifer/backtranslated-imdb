Ronald Regan can't be seen connected by showing one character and instead builds a smizophrenic amalgam of old tasks. The massacres of the Keruuans in the North Korea camp officials may be exempt, but during Russian officials who work as consultants for the Koreans while wearing Nazi uniforms are full of jodhpurs and jackboots (definitive clothing returns from WWII flicks and speaking for accents as Great Burkhalter from Hogan's Heroes, well, that's just six types of silly. Don't waste your time on this.
