: Thieves: / / <br /> I was shocked at the Continuing Love of Love. I was waiting for a long time to see it and finally got the opportunity when it also praised Thursday night at Hallmark. I love the first three movies of "Love" but this was nothing like I thought it would be. The whole movie was sad and difficult, there were many buttons, and editing was very bad - in many cases outside the context. I also think the death of the child Kathy happened a recent way and the appearance of Clarks in the movie was not found to be the same. It seemed like no characters wanted to be present - they were all senseless. There seems to be no cooperation between Missie and Willie. <br /> <br /> I think the authors of the script should go further to the book. It looks like every movie that has been made so far only leaves more and more away from Janette Oke's writings. I mean in a film that they said nothing about mine with two boys or Clark hurt because of it. And I think Missie and Willies impact on Kathy's death can be shown and heard instead of hearing. Of the four movies that have been done so far I would like to say that the love of lasting happiness is my little favorite. I hope and the following four movies that are more of the book followed by if Clarks' behavior is in them I hope he has a great place and I hope his part is not bland. I also hope there is more Scottie and Cookie and maybe even Marty but knows what authors of the script will have to store in the next.
