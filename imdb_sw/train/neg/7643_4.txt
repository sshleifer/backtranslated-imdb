Once a huge star of action that has fallen on the surface of the earth ends up in a small town with trouble with drug dealers and the death of federal agent. Connect again with the old co-cleaning town. The bottom button, from time to time to the point of neglect, "act" comedy especially doesn't work. Part of the problem is beating Chris Klien as a former hero of action. he is not bad, but it is not believed as one person who was considered to be a tough guy. As I said it's not bad, he just forgot why his past story is. The real problem here is a combination of script, which is not true and seems to be fake sometimes, and the trend toward the port of gentle. There is no life in how things are put. Its as a director had a list of shots and went to that list. It makes for a non-existent film. And yet the film happens in life, such as on the last show that ends the film. The sequence works, but because the original parts of the film are full of its powerful sand. <br /> <br /> I can't recommend the film. It's worth the shot if you're a fan of actors or is a big fan of free movies in all its forms, but otherwise this is just a disappointment.
