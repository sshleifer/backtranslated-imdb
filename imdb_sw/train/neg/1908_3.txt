However, another man insults and executes the male people everywhere. This attempt to lose in comedy has nothing to recommend. Once again we have an impressive hero 'who' can not find any woman with a desire. It's true! And we are also presented by a friend of 'sympathetic, attractive' gay who is really fat, hitting, an old man whose leadership should get interesting. I did not find an appeal and I am a fat, an old man (but thanks for not taking into account)! Any of the talents that can be present here have been excluded from the bad script, and in fact it is a bad trend. Mr. Sneedeker should be banned from the film, but then he is no different from many other hack working in Hullweed.
