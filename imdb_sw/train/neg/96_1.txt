..Biri, I can! This movie is not a typical snob of the film, unless you want to recycle on your usual movie definitions, like "continuous editing" and "geographical match". I couldn't tell him when I was in this film. The second time they are now, the next minute they think about 70 years of modern SUV driving and wear what looked like 80 fashionable clothes. I couldn't pay attention to the long time since acting was just awesome. I think it has attention because it has 3d that I didn't have to look at. If you are a buff of b-movie, and for b-movie I mean a movie BAD, then this film is for you. It's a home movie and all the impressionable style will continue to laugh at you as long as you can stay awake. If your taste is more with Goddard and Antonioni, however, we leave this.
