This film out there was very clever. It is the theme of the theme and every movie made fear. Valentine makes ZERO's attempt to be natural. What is Valentine? It is a group of people delivering a disability message that was given to the same people a year ago. There is nothing original in Valentine. I have seen it once, and in one look here are some films offered. 1.From the night 2.Carrie 3.Scream 4.For another movie of fear that someone kills someone. I know there is more, but my mind was slowly turning into the sides of the silk so it could not catch them as soon as they came. <br /> <br /> Valentine did not have a chance to become a good movie. How to come every movie of fear should have a "surprise" killer, people you care about because their feelings change every other area. One minute a beautiful girl returns to be B-bad bad, then she is a safe woman, and so on with a child. <br /> <br /> Usually any movie of fear (in my book) can be saved by gore, once again Valentine does not have this. It was like they tried to make it PG-13 but they failed, so they stopped editing. Do not see this conversion, it is removed unless you hate yourself, and you want to die. 1/2 (3) -J.Leonard Rollins
