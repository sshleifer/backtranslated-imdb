I saw this film a few days ago and easily jumps during the horrible places. I must admit, I found it a good honor ... until I started thinking about what the characters were saying. Problems of logic: <br /> <br /> 1. Her boyfriend, who looks very good, didn't make a sound when she was killed. Do you think he might have at least tried to take the killer? When the information is made as a teacher of practice it is "SOOOO in love with Lisa," I was almost crying for the screen. When your best friend's family has been hit by a reader who was in love with him, you do not have the same opinion if you have half the heart. Once Nash tells her uncle how to get into the house and the uncle takes over that there is a danger before, is it not something to do to get Donna, partner, aunt and uncle in the car and drive off, far, then the house with HRT and the power of the police so that the killer does not have a way to go out? <br /> <br /> I would like to continue. And on. And on. Basically, the plot was good, the characters were not adequately verified when they were killed and there were many mistakes. <br /> <br /> HOW. <br /> <br /> This movie can be good for young people, or young couples just looking for a happy night. If you do not take into account all the buttons, it's an unusual film.
