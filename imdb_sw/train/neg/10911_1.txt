I hated this very film and I remember it is clear. It's not even funny. Any movie that depends on the jokes of unfunny sex and humor of racism is not recommended money should do so. In the first half, Rob Schneider drinks the rancid milk. All I could think was "worthy, by making the bad film". Don't waste your time or your money.
