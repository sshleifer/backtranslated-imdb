I walked all the way through this movie. First of all, the idiotic plot has little to do with the story of Parson. Hollywood has tried to create a kind of comedy movie expelling. Imagine "Englebert sings Hendrix". Do not take anything about this film to be correct. The name of Parsons in the head and stealing for his body is used only as planned for the film's low-film film, a clear attempt to grab a few bucks from the legacy of Parsons and fan base. Gram's father had died in 1973 in the past, other international characters are false, nothing related to the life of Gram or death. <br /> <br /> If you're a Gram fan, I advise you not to watch this film. I would not have. It is unfortunate to see something special as a fodder like that. I would like to swear I could hear Gram turning his grave when the movie played. If you don't know Gram's life and heritage, don't take anything on this film as a Gram representative. I can't say bad things about this film. If Gram was alive and saw this film, he would kill himself. Then again, maybe she would be afraid if she knew that this film would be worthy.
