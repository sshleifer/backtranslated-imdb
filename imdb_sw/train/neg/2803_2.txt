Considering the limits of this film (the entire movie in one set - the music studio - just about the total of 5 or 6 executives) should be much better. If you have this limit in making the film, the lights can be very bad? And the participants were horrible, they were speaking hair under acting in the authors, except that it was an enjoyable movie, this did not have a substance. They tried, but they fail the truth. It makes an attempt to independently in several parts, but the lines were released for damage and participants were very bad. And the main character of Neal, they are lovers of love. Obviously, as many as 10 people did this 'film' and they all knew, and perhaps it was a real fake they had, but fortunately these people don't know how horrible around them. This was done in 2005, but all of them seem to be so and are facing a pre-grunge era. Thanks I did not pay to see this (Starz on Demand opens again!) But it was under the name "The Possessed" not Studio 666, no matter what you do with the head, it can't help this. This may be the best movie - there is no excuse to make this bad film when you have a small set of films made by the filmmakers when they have done this, working within the boundaries you should do things that you can control and things you can do better. Instead they thought that central independence would be enough. And the music video, any of which was bad, was so fast in that way. <br /> So 2/10 is the same, if you're on the movie b all b think you will go and see this.
