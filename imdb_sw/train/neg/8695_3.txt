Elizabeth Rohm was a weak actor of all the rules and orders of ADA and her acting is even worse. His efforts in the accent of Texas are amateur and unrealistic. It also cannot call him a lot of strong emotions needed to play the mother of the abandoned child; sometimes when his daughter disappears he can only hear that he will be angry, as if he cannot remember where he left his keys. This is a true story of fact, so it is so bad that angry Actor's acting actor loses much from the message. All others should have enough talent, but they can not overcome Rohm's behavior just put on implementing exactly the South American volatility when every actual act is needed.
