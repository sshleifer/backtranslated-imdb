I can't say that Aag is the most popular film ever made, because I haven't seen every film, but my mind tells me that it could be. <br /> <br /> This film looks like an artistic attempt to commit suicide on behalf of the director, and I believe it has succeeded in his mission. No outdoor actor of this film would risk sharing the same bill as he for all this film will have to carry it. But don't just leave the blame on the director here, there is a movie player, who seems to be a witness to the creator of a home movie of the year. There is a higher score, which hopes to take you to the next place. A man of lighting, who must have taken a cigarette in one hand and a lighting light on the other side, and hoping that a smoking cigarette could add to the light needed in each area. And, of course actors! Some of them are not newcomers, maybe all can be forgiven here. All of the executives in Aag were put together to develop a new start and re-orientation of the most popular Indian film, 'Sholay'. A person should not forget that these participants were not allowed to enter this film, it is a list of A and participants who are ready for something, let's say it would certainly have public and enthusiastic hope ??? So he asks that question, Amitabh aside (for now), do other actors believe their exhibitions even tried to improve nature? What? Amitabh Bachchan studied the script and believed that people would remember his conversation in this films of films? Don't be foolish, of course you did not, this was a public exhibition about how much money that speaks so can make actors walk. I really believe that everyone involved has been fulfilled and what really attempts to destroy the classic film, which only succeeds in polluting everyone's ideas when looking at the original.
