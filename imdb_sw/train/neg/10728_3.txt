The worst movie I have seen for a long time. The first half of the interesting and other related discussions, frightening among the concerned characters in the night bar. The film is subjected to a series of events with a focus on obscurity (reading disgrace) without any observation of redemption or studies in humanity or anything else. I wanted to walk out, but the director was here to show my politics to protect me from showing favoritism. However, when it is valuable (as the director himself saw it in his intro) and I am sad especially when I lost the second half of this. <br /> Save the kindness were the three main characters in the first half of the film, especially the female leadership.
