I haven't seen the first two - just this which is called the Primal Type in the UK. I don't think I will be worried to look out though. <br /> <br /> This is a bad film. Poor acting, bad conversation, cheap monsters. Everything about it is very bad. Many sympathetic characters die quickly and leave you with those who scare, especially one named Polchak, who is a wonderful jerk. No one like that could survive 5 minutes in the army. He lived for many years but I was happy when he was finally given his head - I had night dreams that he was going to live. Colonel was also garbage - all the wounds full and shouting. And Doctor specky looks and acted as he was out of porno. I was waiting to take her glasses, shake her hair and turn on the vamp, but she didn't. It is a pity that, if it had closed the film without end. Roger Corman did not make the best half of the film once?
