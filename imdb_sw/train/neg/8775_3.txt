The LOC can be a well-made movie on how the war of Kargil was fought; it had areas, budgets, and skills that "Save Private Ryan" of India or "Black Hawk Down". Instead it comes as a bloated, at 4-hour try to move the move to the war with the movie the remainder. Even the events of the war were severely beaten, using one hill in all their episodes of war, and spending unnecessary time on a common discussion. Instead of trying to appeal to the Indian public, the best movie can be an account-book-book of what happened to Kargil (like "Black Hawk Down") or even spending time on military view (like "Tora, Tora, Tora") . Even better, it would have used a powerful director like Ram Gopal Verma to write, directly and edit the film. Until then, I would like to see one of the re-changing of this film, and only the relevant parts include; would make the film more visible.
