I grew to look and love TNG. I have recently completed a full look at ST Voyager on a DVD, which may have caused my feelings of hatred and this period, since the differences between style and technique between two displays cannot be more. The idea may have been better if you are used as an opportunity to expand the character of the Riker, which is possible to be treated on VOY. They can have memory records that would be "new" to the audience, instead of modifying old video display. Internal and external changes between "memory" and "now" in this section start as clich√© at the beginning, and very quickly have a failure if the fatigue structure tend to continue. The Bar is not the worst part ever.
