I wanted a Forest copy because I was looking for a special VH1, I think "Where Are Now", and seeing the video box opens the screen during the actor of the Corky Pigeon actor. He played the boy's spirit in this horrible B, but I remember from his Freddy behavior on the show of a TV show. This flick is a great return. There is nothing here. In fact it has taken four months to look at it from beginning to end. I stood upright, putting aside and forget about it, then I stumbled and tried again to find it. Obviously, the angle of this film which was intended to put it away from their counterparts was a common feature, suffering. And clear, here, that doesn't work. I can't stand the male direction. I continued to expect them to look under their palms during a long negotiation conversation to read the false verses. The situation at the beginning where a couple decides to go to a different camp is awkward and open dumb. I think the only positive thing to say about this is the place where a boy falls and breaks his leg, you can see a bone walking out of his body. It's a good summer cooking there. Man, I really think now, huh. Just another non-budget movie awesome as bad as this will be Home Sweet Home.
