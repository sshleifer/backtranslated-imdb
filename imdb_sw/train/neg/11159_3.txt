I saw this movie in 'sneak' preview and I must honestly admit that I don't like the film and Meryl Streep the same. This photo was worse. Half of the theater never returned after breaking half the film. I can't charge them, if this was not a true story he did not need a second half of the picture. Before the film goes ahead for ten years I have been looking for credit to appear.
