The original "les visiteurs" was original, hilarious, attractive, horizontal and almost entirely. LV2 must be a candidate for "The worst match for the best film". In LV2 everyone keeps shouting, while the gag does not work first repeats once 5 times with an unexpected hope that eventually it will be funny. LV2 is a bad parody of LV1, except of course that the disease should be invention. If you just loved LV1 not to see this film, see LV1 again!
