This sad film is the remake of the 1927 film. They should let it remain that way. <br /> <br /> What a big bomb! Douglas Fairbanks shows absolutely no charisma here. Cesar Romero is under the real responsibility and Bette Grable sings to chorus- What I will do in Hungarian! The symbol of ignorance deals with the image of a woman in the castle in 1561 Rome which preserved that day by killing the winner. (Fairbanks) Now, let's continue fast for 300 years later, where Grable, married to Count Romero, faces a similar situation, during the wedding night, there are raids by Hungarian soldiers <br /> <br /> Romero fear and run before the army arrives. He hides himself as a gypsy and does remain in the castle when his playin play enjoys Fairbanks. The latter is worse than the entire film lost when Grable meets Fairbanks to tell the good news - Romero's anger has eroded marriage. This bad film of films was released in 1948. As Harry Davenport, a multi-year-old player in it, died in 1949; this must be his last film. What a bomb to go out after that known work. <br /> <br /> Walter Abel star stars but can do little with such poor text. Dress looks more like those who will come out of stone. I can't understand what Fairbanks was wearing.
