SLASHERS (2 stars out of 5) It is not really a good movie ... but I wanted the idea behind it ... and the film artists had made it look very good with a small budget had to work with. The film is a "part" of a real Japanese show that presents several fighters in the "dangerous" area and has three creeps sent after the kill. The Savior, if there is one, succeeds in popularity and luck ... everyone may be dead. The main obstacles to this movie are that acting is very bad. None of the "real" people seem real. The players who beat the killers are a kind of fun ... because they show cheesy and top-sized modern movie models ... and that's how it would happen if this was a real show. The film makes it all to take one ... there is a single camera that follows its opponents next to the "dangerous area" and everything that appears from its camera view ... but the lights continue to go away and always turn off (hide "cuts" from one take to another, I would like to consider).
