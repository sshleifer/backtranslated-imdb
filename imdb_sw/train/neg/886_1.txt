A few years behind those people who created Paris, J'TAIME, which was odd but enjoyable (my rating was 7), formed this piece of garbage about New York City. In Paris, I Love You (J'taime) created a feeling for Paris and was made in many parts of beautiful Paris. In this current film, I did not remember New York City, I did not feel that I was in the city of my birth. New York has 5 councils, I have seen scenes in The Bronx, or Queens, There is one place in Brooklyn, (Brighton Beach), I saw no scenes in Times Square or Greenwich Village / No scenes of a nice hotel or movies. It has a huge cast, many artists had no views, were caricatures of the lowest type. Just a few moments of interest are the nature of sex or very scandal for many fine New Yorkers which we all know & love .. <br /> <br /> <br /> Some films selected for 'razzie' awards 'it was better. <br /> <br /> Ratings: * (out of 4) 20 points (between 100) IMDb 1 (out of 10) <br /> <br /> In my way of thinking I think that head should be <br> /> <br /> NEW YORK, MORE.
