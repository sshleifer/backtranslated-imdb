With my eyes this is almost a good example of the ego of Hollywood, just beaten by a new movie kong movie. Superman is a great hero of the original and deserves to be treated with respect even though wearing tights. Brandon Routh was the worst superman I've ever seen, since the beginning of the movie you just want to seize the chunk of kryptonite under his throat. He looks just wearing a silly dress. But enough on it, Kate Bosworth had chosen a bad line for the lois, he should be a hard writer writer, but in this movie he looked more like a school girl. The plan was weak and predictable (WOW, He is actually giving the child, who would think of it ....) and acting it was bad. This movie has one good thing that goes to it, and its name is Kevin Spacey. His Lex Luthor exhibition was brilliant but even could not save this film. What this movie needed was "lois and clark" (except Kevin Spacey of course) and different stories. I watched this film after watching "mountains have eyes" and I couldn't learn that there were more bad movies there.
