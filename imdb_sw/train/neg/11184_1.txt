This is a terrible film. I just write this so that some people somewhere might stop looking at it. If I have stopped one person for losing some of their precious life to watch this film I will die with pleasure. It is impossible, although since these stars Al Pacino had been deceived into thinking that at any time something interesting would happen. Then the attributes are enclosed, and I realized that I was completely corrupted by looking for this unsustainable shade. I can't believe that this film has succeeded as high as in IMDb (more than 5 stars when I last saw voting). What? Are you polling people? </> <br /> Please, please, not look at this film!
