I have nothing contrary to the flick of fast-fast fast, but this scientist of Stephen King-derived nonsense is also very clean-beaten, bright and modern. The plan, about a new boy boy in a small town who is "Sleepwalker" - a cross between a vampire and waswolf - and who gives the blood of female girls, begs for the most extraordinary treatment. This stimulation is given a non-color look and feel, and for any difficult situation. The children are predicted and bold, but with great is Alice Kridge as the mother of a boy; Kridge, from "Ghost Story", has never been opened by female-female female, and is a great loss that has not been used. Its performance is bright and bright, and provides a hint that "Sleepwalkers" can be a better film with a different focus and bright direction. It is very high and commercialized, with a distinctive voice that emerges from a great surprise to play and perform. Stephen King is emerging in the cameo, as well as directors of real life John Landis and Tobe Hooper. * 1/2 from ****
