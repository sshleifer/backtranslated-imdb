Black and white film. Nice picture. Trusted characters. <br /> <br /> It's just bad. <br /> <br /> I lost another perfect evening to watch another film that has been labeled as "worthy" and "very good." There is a good acting here and the back of the plot is good (more should be done with this) but it is very slow to grow and never continues. It is based entirely on sex without much love and much needed dirt. More can be done with the main characters. If you're looking for something to watch and your family is not a movie and if it's not a problem to stay. Although this film is only a long over 1 inch depth!
