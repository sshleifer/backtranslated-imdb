It was done in 2007 and the CG is bad for the film that took place in 1998. In one part of the film there is a motion of stopping a dinosaur shot which really looks good, but this only makes the job of a very amateur looking at CG even worse . <br /> <br /> Writing, acting, leading and everything else in this film is awesome. This is as bad as, if not worse than Raptor Island and 100 million BC ... pure crap! Again, as with other movies, the only awesome part of this film is that it has been made real and now appears on the sci-fi center. I still can't understand how they somehow get people who have the skills to work in these movies and somehow make them scared like everyone else in the film. For those who do not know, a clear poster is definitely a shock in its review ... or she is one of the people who worked on this film.
