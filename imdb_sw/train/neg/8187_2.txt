I came into this movie trying to be the truth of God. And it was. In fact I was sorry for the star striker - Kathy Bates was an amazing actress ... before making this film - Vince Vaughn and Paul Giamatti were disappointing as usual but Miranda Richardson could not put in one of the most beautiful performances I know and love. Fred's father, played by Trevor Peacock (Vicar's Dibley fame, among others), had one line. The plan was possible and everywhere, and humor was missing. (However, there was one part of the film where Santa comes home to the Jewish family ... which made me laugh just because their words were normal) Do not see this movie unless your only way to have a head collision with the train (actually - maybe the train would be better ...)
