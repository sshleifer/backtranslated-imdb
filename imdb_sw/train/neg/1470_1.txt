I was looking on our DVD tower last night for something to look at. We were among the NetFlix emails and it was a quiet night night. I used one that I had never heard before and realized it had been given from a friend. From the jacket, it seemed like a burst of "Big Chill" but, with all the cast star, felt it could be worth looking at. The boy was wrong !!! It was not just like "Big Chill," it was a deficit close to behavior and behavior. Bill Paxton's publisher was a copy of William Hurt ("where have you been at all" role) - warnings of the trophies and, see, and behold, he sits behind keeping the old (cabin / camp). Kimberly Williams = Meg Tilly; eyeball Matt Craven = Jeff Goldblum etc., etc. I found myself wondering why I look at these people. There was a development of the character is not enough for me to get any interest in them. How did "Unca Lou" get even these characters after 20 years? Plus was not even surprising, except when Perkins fell, fell 'fell' from the first morning bed, it was a sign and I missed it. After that, I asked my wife, "Are there any interesting characters in this film? Are you sleeping there?" He answered, "No, I still think ... No, no one can imagine."
