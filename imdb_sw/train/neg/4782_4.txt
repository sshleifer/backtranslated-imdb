Viewed 1: 12/24/2009? 4 out of 10 (Dir-Robert Ellis Miller): The emotional Christmas chill is not quite enough to describe how the real story happened in this true prison experience trying to find work for his family to make Christmas happen to them. Three children in the family fled home to Washington D.C. ask US President, Herbert Hoover. This journey provides stories such as their good conversation with hobo and puppeteer, which makes stories like a kind of Disney "animal run" movie and it is not quite recommended here. At last, no explanation was made about how the President helped the family and this is a great thing of the movie, in my opinion. Movie finally brings tears, but it takes too long to achieve this. Movie should not be the original movie TV (according to IMD) but it has definitely fade-outs that make it look this way ?? so I don't know their information is correct. For all, this is a simple movie (which can be more complicated) and fun Christmas-like stories but blandly played and without a lot of substances.
