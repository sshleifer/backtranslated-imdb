Often a couple involved in the wrong (long term) - in Huston movies: "African Queen" "Heaven knows Mr. Allison" "Heavenly roots" "Misfits" ... "Rabbi and geisha" (see head) Another good example, to say. It seems that the Japanese things were continuing at the time as working as "Sayonara" "the world of Suzie Wong" and "August's coffee" is a witness. Huston's efforts could be worse than this bad (except "Susie" maybe) .John Wayne is very good at Ford, in Huston he has been like a cow in a Chinese shop. His Japanese career is quite bland. great (cholera epidemic) does not save the film from quite tolerance. Only those who are very interested in the work of each Huston need to choose this, among all its other nearby movies.
