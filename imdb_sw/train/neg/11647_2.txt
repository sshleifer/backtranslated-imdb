The CRIME BOSS is headed by Alberto De Martino; The Italian crime game published part of Hamburg, Germany. Forgotten movie easily. Even in spite of a good tracking vehicle tracking, this looks like a wood almost without regard. The new Don takes a strong family of Mafia and finds himself fighting against his own life. Written laws and code of Mafia code are difficult to rely on especially when millions of dollars are struggling. Violence and abuse produce the same for return. This can not be put on the shelves and the real epics of the gangster. Just watching the film brings car rental records. Even the American American actor Telly Savalas can not add a balance to this game of crime. Antonio Sabato also star with: Paola Tedesco, Guido Lollobrigida, Serio Tramonti and Piero Morgia.
