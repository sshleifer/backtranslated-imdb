Many fans of fear seem to love Scarecrows, so I will not be very popular by saying that I have seen it boring. The idea behind him was amazing, but it seems very entertaining. I think the main problem is that it's all darkened. Sometimes the horror movies put in the dark can work (such as Humongous), but Scarecrows are in the dark for the entire film. Many times it is difficult to know what is happening, and although some shots of scarecrows were creepy, most were hard even to see. If a smaller lighting was used, it would probably be better. It is not many films that link death to my knowledge, away from the Night Scarecrow Night, which is better. I would recommend that on Scarecrows any day.
