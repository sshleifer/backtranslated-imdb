It seems Hollywood is just giving money to anyone who has a camera with the ability to talk. This film had a negative idea. The search was terrible, it cannot be seen, and the story full of holes. Script? who needs a script? I was surprised that the movies were not as dirty as I thought it would be, however I've got enough shots of T&A to give me a lifetime. The movie was like listening to 19-year-old racer street and ADD (who decided to buy a car instead of going to college) to tell a story. By being a bad scripted, I thought two brothers in the film were first lovers. The events of the racetrack, as well as the female actress in the film continued to make me think of Herbie: Fully Loaded. This is a kind of film what Grindhouse emerged after ... just authors thought they were bad.
