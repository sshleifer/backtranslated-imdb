Myths are slow and slightly stupid. Greta Garbo does not look very good and I did not understand the half of the remarks because of its emphasis, which was spreading to this role. Melvyn Douglas, at the same time, has a common role of variable and Constance Bennett is just so-so except for its sound, which was funny. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Roland Young had the best role in the film. I would have had more lines, if it was lost in the second half of the story. Also, it was interesting to see Ruth Gordon very young. I only saw him in the role of playing that he played from '60 to' 80 years and lost an old woman. The way of wisdom, the best part could be a few last moments when we see a wonderful man doing amazing things on skis, pretending that Douglas falls under the slope. That was an amazing and interesting picture. Overall, I can see where this film - the last of Garbo - was not a successful box-office. It's a very drag, twisted and advanced about fraud. It's a furious story. Garbo knew it, too, and called it quits.
