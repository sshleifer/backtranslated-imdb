I decided to look at this because it was chosen for Oscar this year. I think many people here I really wanted to love this film, but when I was tired and desperate. The first part was the same but the rest of the film's shaky camera is offensive. I think the main reason for making the film and putting it to Oscar is this: <br /> <br /> US "military" (people, who make money on war) quickly need excuses or The war in Iraq to merge something (type) patriotic. <br /> <br /> Why are these "heroic" efforts of the director and the main character of the _inpire_ viewers with the idea of ​​"war-like-drug"? .. Please, come! what it carried! <br /> <br /> Look at this to get the idea of ​​how low academy could fall ...
