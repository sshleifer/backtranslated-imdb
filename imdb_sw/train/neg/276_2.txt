The characters are beaten and predictable, and everyone is clean or white or white. Acting is also solved to be bad in a pleasant way, on-top. It is twice a disappointment if you are a fan of Bette Davis, because its character is not the usual character of Bette-Davis normal; he finds only in large quantities. Overall, neither my wife nor I have seen a movie to be exciting, moving or quite enjoyable.
