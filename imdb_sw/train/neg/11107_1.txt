This was a bad film. There was no line of any story. At the top, when they could not explain blood and gore (only a good part) ... they gave us a few visitors! I hate when directors (or whatever) run out of thought and then blame visitors! Watch this movie if you would like. But don't tell them I don't warn you. Two things: how could Vinny say "welcome" when he had no tongue? Mr. Jones had no greater responsibility. The second thing that was pointing to me, why were we shown Vinny Jones's boils and he restrained them and put them in a blue liquid, then these have no more responsibility. Why not? I do not like to be shown anything and that you have nothing to do with the story line. In short. Bad story. I can't waste my time - I would like to look at Mirror instead.
