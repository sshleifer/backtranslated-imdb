Decrease Plan, if it can be called a plot, has two positive events. One close to the beginning - one end. Together these events include perhaps 5% of the total movie time. Everything (and I mean _everything_) in the middle is basically the efforts of the director to fill a minute. I love exciting movies, I love dark movies and I am not interested in false events - but if you expect me to sit for 60 minutes of hazy / dark events (literally) and NO story stories you have something to come. Rosario Dawson, one of my dear allies has lost here. And no, he can't be naked, even in the NC-17 version, I seen. If you have a couple of hours to throw and want to look at "Descent", take a replacement - maybe you will have more interesting dreams.
