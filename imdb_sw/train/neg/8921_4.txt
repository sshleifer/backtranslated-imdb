The Scrooge African and American American cluster in the modern, struggling city has been revealed, but nothing else in this film. Here, Mrs Scrooge is a troubled bank who uses the benefits of employees and customers in the area where she lives. There is no doubt about the good intentions of the people involved. Part of the problem is that the root of the story does not translate well into the context of this film, and the script fails to work on the update. Also, the frequent message of sharing and giving is repeated, the audience is exhausted before the movie ends. This is a message of message that doesn't know when to stop. In the title of the head, Cicely Tyson talented offers better performance, and sometimes the lines are difficult to understand. Charles Dickens's book has been changed many times, it is difficult to solve it in a way that makes it clean and important, despite its very important message.
