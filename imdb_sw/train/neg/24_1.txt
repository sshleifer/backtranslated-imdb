I have to congratulate the genius who endorsed this. Edward Furlong, you're not as good as you think of a partner, you can't grab every piece of cheap amateur cotton, which is the only right thing to have bucks. <br /> <br /> Experience is bad, and I mean BAD. Anyone with a camera will get the same results, or better. Acting, then just say: don't go to the supermarket supermarket. They good comes with a degree or, at least, have little experience! Director .. Mr. Jon Keeyes, please search for your purpose in life, as the director you inspire. Your direction is poor, all horns are broken (not in a good way), the lines look like they are reading out the toilet paper, and the music of the damn. And don't go to the author or, by the way. Making a film is not like serving on coffee, it requires skill and skill, things that I doubt will certainly find. Instead of making a badass film, you should take this picture back and wait 'until something good comes. Or just go to work on the booth. You will be less anxious and will save the film operators of the money and the bad night. <br /> <br /> voting: 1/10 (my first)
