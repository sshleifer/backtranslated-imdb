The "Diary of Addict Sex" is an exciting attempt in the whole game on forced sex. Perhaps the scandal of the film, this flick is a stylish shot and good cast and little goes to it. Under the bottom, "Diary ..." would have us believe that our addict's sexual behavior has a slick wife in the world, a stable infant side who have nothing better than to drop their panties for her in her whim, and no work in spite of being restaurateur. For the best, this flick may be a good game. In the worst, soft cheaper. "Diary ..." is not with no middle. This is for dumpster. (D-)
