Steps, abuse, sex and bad language are things that characters make during the entire movie. And everything they do is done without cause. Mark L. Lester is (un) known for his stupid movies (without reason) (Commando, The Base). The story is strange but stupid. The characters play their very stupid characters ... I don't know they are stupid but I mean they are the worst actors. It is another budget under the unknown B of the known B. If you have seen something like the Delta Force Operation, the park, the Patriot, Sanctuary or something like these bad films from the same type than Egypt ... do not ... provides 1 and a half out of 5.
