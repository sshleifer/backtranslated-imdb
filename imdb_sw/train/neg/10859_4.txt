This is one of many B movies that have been placed as a film film in the hope of producing some interest in something that does not matter. All aspects of the film, script, acting, direction - are mediocre. Acting with three leads is wooden. I think John Dall was going to go to a cinema business but then someone realized that he had a small talent and he ended up working on TV. Lee J Cobb who usually angry can not rise on the poor script and poor direction. Jane Wyatt should be a fatale of women but she comes anywhere near to influence the audience. The movie has two more amazing cars that I have ever seen, one of which John Dall goes after Lee J Cobb is very strange. The DVD transfer is typical of Alpha.
