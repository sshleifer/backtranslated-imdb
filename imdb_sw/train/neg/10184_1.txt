For months I've heard about this small movie and now I have seen it. I think it is good, how many old-age directors are making movies where they combine the creative ideas of other people to make their own joke. Military, Swingblade, each of the millions Blair Witch parodies come to mind. If all these directors want a foot in the Hollywood door then they are doing the right thing and they should keep it because mixing the plot details is how Hollywood makes a film. How many times have you heard the words, "Is the House of Animals Meet Back?" "It's a Street Street Address that meets the Society of the Dead Scholars"; or "Shakespeare in Love meets Star Wars"? I remember when independent films meant nature and they don't care about safe and predictable.
