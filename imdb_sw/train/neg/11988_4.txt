I came from this film and the feeling that it would be very good. Instead of what is supposed to be a foster story, the time of fighting for the boy for living in the wilderness, comes as a National Geographic document meets the games of Columbia. The movie begins with Brian (Jared Rushton) preparing for a flight with a plane to see his father. Her mother voluntarily gives her a curious choice as a wardrobe to go (what is wrong with a Rubik's cube?), She doesn't know how much she will soon need.

This is the only source of tension the film producers would do well to explore rather than spend more time on events that happened before Brian started his journey.
