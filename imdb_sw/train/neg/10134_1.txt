Steven Seagal's movies have never been the Oscar material but for the release of each it may become worse and worse. This begins with Seagal taking over with the FBI because he killed a few people 'in defense' he was a military squad so he was rescued from jail to save the stolen plane of Stephanie that will be used by "bad English villain" of cliche 'that Hollywood is widely considered and including these days. It should say the film has a awesome dialog which is almost always delivered by a topping hefty of cheese and lack of acting talents. The story is not interesting and there are groups that are not very good and are not worth anything in the story, the film characters generally like the 'lesbian' interaction between the two main women in the cast just for the titles to get the audience and yet not to mention just confused because it doesn't mean what happened when it didn't need. <br /> <br /> For a short time a bad script and bad conversation, has been sent by lower administrators, with boring and sometimes badly interesting events, and the non-existent parts that serve almost and impossible to make the movie even worse . <br /> <br /> Save 98 minutes of your life and give this miss, even if you are a fan of a Seagal fan.
