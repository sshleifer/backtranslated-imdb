Don't make a mistake - I love David Suchet as Poirot. I like series as movies but already enough again: Death on the Nile. Everyone has done this! We know who is dying. We know why it dies. We know who the killer. We know how it was done. So I say ready! Mr. Suchet could use this amazing talent on another Agatha Christie novel. I will say that acting with all actors were good. The sets were strict and true. I loved David Soul but I wondered how he looked 'bad'. I hope he doesn't look that way in 'real' life! I honestly can't remember from other movies if that end was the same. Somehow I don't think so. I thought it was a rather brilliant touch if Mr. Christie wrote it that way. I would very much have that end and stop off the prison!
