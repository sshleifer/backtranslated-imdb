Some people don't like animation. Personally, I think the animation was very strange when this movie was done. There's a lot of cartoons that I just like. My problems with this movie is not an animation, but basically it's how it's built. All characters are just ... well, goofy. And for this film, it should not be. Apparently, everyone in the LOTR has difficulty breathing (for the first time.) The only way they did was generally angry. My two sisters and I laughed through many films. I think if many people saw this before seeing those new, they didn't go. I am glad I used this and did not buy it. There are small movies that give me a headache. This was one of them. However, this is not the worst movie I've ever seen, though it comes up. Or down there, depending on your view.
