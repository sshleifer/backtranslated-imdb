This was the first movie of Ewan McGregor which I saw out of Star Wars. Since then I have been a big fan of Ewan McGregor but I still can't bring myself to forgive this film. <br /> <br /> My sister has always been a big fan of Jane Austen and because of it, I have been led by various scholars, Emma being one of them. I've seen them to be angry, stupid and terrible. However, after looking at this awful session, I had to admit that the original Emma was happy and pleasant. Ewan McGregor serves the purpose of this film after hitting and strengthening part of Frank Churchill. Gweneth Paltrow is ignorant in the old sense of ignorance and the rest of the film is not thought and foolish. <br /> <br /> My recommendations to anyone who is fascinated by the English game ... see nature. If you are a fan of Ewan McGregor ... you believe me, by jumping this film, did not miss anything but five minutes with him in a silly hat and a bad haircut.
