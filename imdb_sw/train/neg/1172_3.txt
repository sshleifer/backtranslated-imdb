Every time a movie comes along and hits me down and reminds me that my taste in movies that I want to look at is not always wrong. I usually would not stay away from such things, but I was reviewed by some interesting reviews with the parents of Rohmer. There is an original and exciting innovation in the production where Rohmer essentially gives administrators a digital background behind the French drought. It goes soon and is almost as attractive as looking at the colored colors in the color and the location of the number. What we left with a boring and stuffy film about scholars in the 18th century France. There are no interesting or compassionate characters. That step is very lighter, the conversation is difficult, and insisting it is a clear concept of foreign to Rohmer, that I ended up regardless of who the head rolled, who was who, or what the devil revolution was supposed to be around. The movie would be very profitable due to a particular state of built-in emotion and music logo (there are some good classical music used to end at the end). In spite of being "talky", the film plays as a silent film, with the worst films for it, an improper and unpopular film of interesting subjects. Most of the wise French historians will have nothing to take from this film, since the measure is seen to beat events from a new horn (Lady is English and king). Otherwise, avoid this yawner at all costs unless you are experiencing sleep (I used twice).
