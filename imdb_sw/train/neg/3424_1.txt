You will never see a film or still know that Jerk Too is a catastrophe. The question is not, "How is it done," because if you lose money to anyone and tell them to make a film, they will do it. <br /> <br /> The question is "Why, why, Martin Martin allowed it to be made?" I think he needed money to fight the scandal and it was determined that he did not give anything. He knew that this good would be very frightening, that without boasting, he could not count it as a salary as income. The only way this safe way is not to be embarrassed is to have Carl Gottlieb and Steve Martin to revive the nation's favorite black family. <br /> <br /> And "dcreasy2001" (is Mark Blankfield?): It is obviously clear that you worked on this film with some sadness, and the only way you can feel good about your inclusion is to be the only cheerleader sequel as the IMDb user feedback. I was praying for getting into the satire, but not, you would be working hard. Why not 10 stars?
