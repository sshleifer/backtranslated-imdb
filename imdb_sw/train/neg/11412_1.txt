This film is very bad, you can't imagine. Acting is terrible, even worse than in the third class of soap. It is a shame that this film was the most successful in the last 20 years in Switzerland. The cooperation between the soldiers did not make any sense. The story would have been given on the picture of the picture, the discussion was like wood like Treebeard and the holes of the plot were bigger than the black hole in the middle of our galaxy. But these days do not require much to meet the audience. Employees were good for the old Miss Swiss model and the main character was even hung (woah !!) and there was certainly a misuse of drugs. This is a real cool person! Especially for young people aged 12 and 13. But the media created the situation in witchcraft was not allowed to refuse the film because they used their group's dynamic to tell them that you are a nerd if you go with another 'sheep' and say. especially how it was when I was an army / so will I do when I had to go to the army. every step of the effort related to drugs and cold. And I don't think I like the army. I was there and I hated it but this film is worse than cleaning this toilet and brush teeth (which I had to do because I missed it) It is not necessary for every film to be modern. Sometimes you just want to have fun for a few hours and forget the problems and I think it's not a bad thing. But this kind of films impress young people with a good life that is really stupid and turns them into ignorance and ignorance. But since now my opinion is not so popular I will be silent now and suggest you avoid this flick fake at any cost and therefore save your wits! <br /> <br /> 2/10 <br /> (sorry for my bad English)
