This film proves that you cannot judge the movie with an amazing sketch on DVD. It also goes to show that you should learn more about the movie before buying (or get someone for Christmas). The beginning of this movie actually looks somewhat promising. Well, until you meet the characters. Sauce Jack (an old man from the bottom of the road) brings a college college book full of witches that he leaves in their haunted annual home (where the movie is being done). After that there is a drink, a fight, and a soft base of porn. Then the action of the movie finally happens after an hour. Overall, the end of Hallow was possible, you did not know, and remind you of a small sex image. This movie looks much better with a group of friends who have nothing better to do, for it is a nice movie. And for the first audience, it is a great pleasure to make predictions of dying people.
