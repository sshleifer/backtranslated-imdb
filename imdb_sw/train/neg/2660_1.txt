Lesson no matter, this is an amateur movie, of an exhibition - or one-quest that refers to as interesting and confident as a tool of a high school students full of "poems" of death. To be sure, it will bother the audience who are hell-focusing intimidated, but the success will be itself for themselves, not for the director. In fact getting under one's skin requires transparency, discipline, techniques, and talents, as well as eye and ear. Film has one photo animation, displayed as yet (and also used in video case), but without any leading development or dropping off. If the director had an eye, he would see it as possible to start a movie that is attractive - ie, the movie.
