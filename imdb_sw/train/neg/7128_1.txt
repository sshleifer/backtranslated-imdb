I am a dumber man for a DVD REDLINE rental. Chicago photos that made this stupid film have never paid Palisades Media Group to buy web ads on various automotive sites including mine ALEXA 16K level. They took me on the program and now I got 16,000 dollars and lost a lot of personal time (peter rapport of Palisades Media) you know who you are! <br /> <br /> Please don't hesitate or buy this movie !!! It stimulates people behind him are powerful artists. <br /> <br /> REDLINE has a cast of non-fans and poor! This is a Joke
