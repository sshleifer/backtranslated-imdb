Good folks, I had doubts on this film in the evening when I was writing paper. My professional expertise is the text of Anglo-Saxon, and I can say that no one has ever done that kind of respect. Icelandic "Beowulf and Grendel" is a little more hate I have seen, and I paid $ 3.00 for my copy. This version of Sci-Fi is sharing with Christopher Lambert version. Yuck. <br /> <br /> What did you like? CGI for one. Surprise bad. More importantly is loyalty to the story, not to mention the statement. I've been used to all and all the versions I saw. I was happy, of course, Peter
