This was the worst movies I saw on the WorldFest and also received the amount of future printing! I can only think it is receiving such recognition according to the number of actors known in the film. It's nice to see J.Beals but he's just in a movie for a few minutes. M.Parker is an excellent actor than the allowed part. Some actors are difficult to judge because the movie is ridiculous and predictable. The main character is non-hearing and thus generates a look. No deep emotional emotion in the story. A modern-day actor who is unable to find a job does not feel very sensitive to me. And do not develop troops. It feels like one of the most direct movies to the videos I saw after 90 years ... And it's not even good at those levels. <br /> <br />
