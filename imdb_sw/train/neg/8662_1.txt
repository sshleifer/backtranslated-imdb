What's a bad movie. I love flicks but I can't watch even half of the terrible characters, the characters of the card with special unusual effects. There is nothing liberating about this movie. The characters come from an endless supply of suicidal suicidal or suicidal thoughts, they don't know the sock puppets. The program is a formulaic, cut and set, the standard of run-amok drivel. Even CGI is awesome. You know it's bad when you can't even rely on the movie to give a good eye candy. There is no surprise here, just the same old man. Certainly this is one of the worst films made. Director Roger Corman should be hanged from the light of the light so that children can use him as a pinata.
