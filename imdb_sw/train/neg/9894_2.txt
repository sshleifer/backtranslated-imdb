I missed the beginning of this film, which could write why I didn't like it very much. On the other hand I have learned the collapse of the Roman republic for many years I know the story. Then again, that could also be because I didn't like this film. <br /> <br /> The movie has more accurate historical than additional. Although it is very accurate that I don't think they did an attempt to be right, in that case it can be forgiven. The amazing thing is that sometimes it goes to a great length to be a proper historical sign that is about to get confusing. If you cast the marriage of Antonius to Octavia, and then pushed aside two curtains later. Why even bring up if it does not work for conspiracy and Octavia has never been seen? And as Antonius calls for his real name (Marcus Antonius) in some cases, and with his wonderful English Mark Antony name in other scenes. Even though accurate history far, the film can still be a watch of entertainment if it was not for the woman who led it. There is no ounce of respect in it. He is a hysterical, wonderful, and can not completely control himself. Instead of being Cleopatra's clever and inclusive teacher returns to be a hysterical teenager and the worst case of PMS. 95% of it comes from a bad acting, but 5% also comes from poor text script. Too many stupid screens are written on the script. Sometimes it didn't look at Antonius and Cleopatra, it was looking at the new versions of Dawson and Joey from "Dawson's Creek". If you want to look something about this period, see ... nothing but this.
