"Bride" can only be a very unpopular and sad movie published in the 80s but, fortunately, has a small comparative features as a wonderful result, a lively music score and some of the most vicious choices. In fact the screenplay does not make one wise note, but who cares when Linda Blair (with an explosive hairstyle) shows another girl with bad powers and David Hasselhof shows a hunky photographer (who can't be seen) in a movie that has always been has a voodoo of blood, closed lips, has been banned, severely punched with a permanent but tune. Eight people who have no civilians gathered together on the island of a holiday off the coast of Massachusetts. The young couple is there to examine the dark history of the place; an unemployed family (with Linda Blair pregnant even if no one seems to be concerned about who and where they are) she opens a hotel with only a skilled female manufacturer who has labeled for casual sex. Are they forced to stay at night in the ramshackle hotel and then suddenly the original landlady? aging actor or something that always dresses black? begins to use them in different ways of thinking. Everything is somehow related to the sequence of intro shows a woman's suspect witch fly out of the window. However, the conspiracy is definitely of little importance in the franchise of Italian fears that began as an informal "wicked". The atmosphere is constantly separating from the effects of doing it is undoubtedly the best feature of the entire film. There is a great disgusting thing about looking at the unwary woman climbing down the chimney and waiting for the fried.
