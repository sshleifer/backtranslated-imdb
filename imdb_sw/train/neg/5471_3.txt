Tumi-ordinary garbage, this smutty 80 smutty is considered to be one of the "highlights" of the famous production label of Lloyd Kaufman, with "Avenger Toxic" released one year earlier. "The Toxic Savior" is better if you ask me, but this splatter-flick bridge is still endurable as well; make sure you leave your brain capacity at the door. Events are taking place in Tromaville, a small town boasting to be a chemical poisoning plant, and certainly not a lie. The safety precautions in the local nuclear power plant are small, say little (even Homer Simpson has never been alive) and toxic waste continue to the nearest secondary school. The first offender is an odd nerd, who begins to produce green stuff out of all his bones, but his death is thought to be an accident because he had no small parts of TWO microwave in his home! Oh, humanity! Shortly after, however, nuclear leaks also affect the crop field and something that begins to get aggressive. After smoking together at the party, a couple who are laughing at the school produce a big worm monster that sits on the floor and gives the problem of youth. "Nuke 'Em High" is a terrible low-of-the-record film, as well as a dumb chat that hurt your ears and the effects of renewal that provides a new meaning to the useless word. If you like to enjoy the faces of disintegration, break or split in half, this is definitely you must see! Unlike the so-called "Toxic Plumber", this film is very short and long-term where there is no significant thing being done, as for example when Chrissy and Warren are trying to think negatively with their hormones. Ineffective humor does not work as "Toxic Provider" and acting performances should not be forgiven. Just continue if you are a bright Troma-fanatic.
