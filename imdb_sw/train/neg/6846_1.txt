I am a great fan of Karishma Kapoor and Govinda. I watched this film after seeing Fiza, which was quite brilliant. There are films that are bad, and there are films that are missing *. but this film only takes biscuits. We were very angry that we had been locked out of paying our money to expect a good film. <br /> <br /> avoid at all costs, which do not care even taxes are. </ 1/1 / / 1/10
