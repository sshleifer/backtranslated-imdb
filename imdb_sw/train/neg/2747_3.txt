I knew it would, but I gave a tax for some laugh and maybe some fun no matter what. Anyone who has read some of my comments can see that I am very easy to please. In fact I didn't think I'd end up feeling this opposite. The plan is about the former dragons army led by a big snake that will destroy the world except some of the chosen heroes who have inherited a role can? have one and ?? a good dragon? or something? I don't know. It was very foolish, I was not worried to put a lot of effort in preventing it. <br /> <br /> It has a full-time story of ignorance and goofy concepts. Many events have only been heard easily and suddenly. I think there was a interference with the label or something because the biggest problem I have with the film is the fact that the story looks like it tries to be so grand and epic, but everything happens very fast and goes very fast. I feel like I have been hit by a million points of conspiracy and tracking action in one big ball. Film is like a punch in the face. It will not take much time to establish characters or game. Think of the trilogy of "Lord of Rings" in 90 minutes? You can have a great series of Epic wars, but there will be no building and you would like to care about the outcome of this war. That was the case with the dragon battle? 90 minutes I don't give a crap, waiting for it to be up. <br /> <br /> Fantastic CGI and some similar lead, but acting awesome, pacing speed, and dumb story made it very difficult to enjoy for any reason. Maybe I would have loved it when I was 6 years old.
