I have just returned from the film and I have been beaten completely. This movie is a totally shock for all mankind. The Theater I was in was perhaps with other people 4. This movie was suggested to me and I did not believe that this person liked it. I can't believe that any intelligent person would like. There was no plot PLOT AT ALL. It was a joke. How can you make a film without anything. This film only shows why Hollywood is being beaten. I can only watch the event of the "Movie Modern" industry and touch. The worst way for all the films, this is really a new "teen horror flicks" Grudge, Boogeyman, Ring, Saw series. It's all the trash. Don't help this type of hogwash!
