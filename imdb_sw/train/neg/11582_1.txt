I'm glad to see so many people here don't think a lot of this film, either. It has some great names in cast, but that's it. There is nothing else to suggest, except with a few beautiful women you can do in a thousand films. The story does not include anything but anonymous, self-reliant, cigarette, "characters" who all the critics seem like .... and most of the public cannot stand. <br /> <br /> Oklahoma's quotations are so fake is laughable, southern racial racist is right from Hollywood's Liberal 101 and sad story.
