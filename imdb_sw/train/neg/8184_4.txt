This is close to two films - one of learning and engaging, of stupid and clichéd. It is quite embarrassing that all the problems have not been done by writing, but based on how many B movies are written and produced, this is not unusual. It's a real shame, though, this can be a very good film. <br /> <br /> First is good. The movie is original and involves WWII-breakers code. This is very interesting and I liked to look at the man who led (Lee Bowman) through his money as a master-code-breaker. In fact, the first two-thirds of the film was very good. But now for the worst, the film went on very long and lost its steam for 50 minutes. In addition, Jean Rogers's role as "kooky partner" should be one of the worst written and misleading roles in film history! For every smart move made by Bowman, Rogers of the village then went into deleting things like some sort of “notable” help. If his role was written in mind, the whole film would have improved greatly! Instead, watching him, it's hard to understand how we won WWII !!
