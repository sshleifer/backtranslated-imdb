After seeing the "Victory of Love," I can only say this movie is ghastly, even a measure against the "standards" of historical time. It is usually all made and affected. This is what can be expected of the German 1930 propaganda. Unfortunately, the quality of the presentation, itself, is deceived and not available. It is also very ridiculous that even modern Germans should've left the exhibition to hold their nose. In a known form for its basic appeal, the lack of natural and unapologetic-headedness, this film is not even suitable as "bad." It would have improved significantly to achieve the situation!
