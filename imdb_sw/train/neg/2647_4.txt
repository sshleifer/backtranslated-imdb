I will say the same thing to Jeanette and Nelson - even when they are beaten in unhappy, unresponsive music, such as this, there is still a trunk in their eyes. Yes, chemistry between popular duo is there even the material is thin paper. Even when the logo is flawed, there is no one according to just interesting tunes. And even when the situation is impossible - yes, even for fantasy. The truth of telling him, he has more chemistry with Nelson than he has with her real life life Gene Raymond in SMILIN 'IN, which, however, was the most beautiful film. <br /> <br /> Sorry, I love Jeanette and Nelson as another fan, but this is less painful. Jeanette is more embarrassed in her number of "hep" by Binnie Barnes - and Nelson can only come up with an empty look when faced with the worst situation. One can only wonder what this was like in Broadway in 1938. Indeed, it must have more wit and fashion than it appeared in this MGM weak production. Edward Everett Horton is engaged in a role that no players can help can breathe any life in this mess. It is like an amateur night in the studio even with a few professionals who have worked among the support support. <br /> <br /> Connecting: The most amazing music of Rodgers and Hart. Can't recommend, even for MacDonald's and Eddy fans. And even if around Jeanette still explodes with its gossamer beauty, this film is a jaw-stop.
