When Rodney Dangerfield is on the roll, he is a hilarious master. In My Women 5, she is not on the roll. The time spent is far away, but it is the best thing to go to the film. Five women who play their games do not add up to one of them. This program is very weak. Even the premise is very weak; there are a few jokes about having many wives, but the situation is not associated with anything else in the movie. Most of the films can be played in the same way even if Rodney's character had only one wife, so it seems like a fantasy of an older person than an important part of the comedy. Fantasy of another old man: we should admit that the character of Rodney is a skier of attraction. <br /> <br /> Jerry Stiller seems to make a call in its place just to make a partner, and all the name executives should just have a desire to work. <br /> <br /> Unusual judgment for political accuracy later in the movie does nothing for the film. For those who like their proper political films, non-PC humor is still in the first place, and apologizing is still not sure. For those who hate to see a film on political legitimacy, PC buttons have just turned off. <br /> <br /> This should be a R-rated film that has been rated. There are some jokes of the racy, and the bedroom incidents would have made a television alarming 40 years ago, but that's about it. It is probably the most vulnerable people (deliveries). The DVD presents interviews where members are used to find the depth and importance in this film and in their roles. I kept asking myself if they were being involved or not taking them. They seem to be bad, but I kept thinking, "They must be young!" There is also a unique barrier that shows that since the movie is not really appropriate to call the Mormons or the Church of the Saints, somehow it is not about them. Never think that the film has a local religion in Utah, and it mentions Brigham Young. <br /> <br /> In short, My 5 boys were disappointed. I was hoping for Rodney on the roll, but the best I can say for the cinema is that Rodney was looking good for a boy who was striking 80 at that time.
