I've seen enough for both Richard in an interview and in the exhibition and enough for the poor Leon pigeonholed in these 50s / 60s music bio pics to know that Leon is not an appropriate actor for this role. Leon was the same as David Ruffin in Temptations, but he completely failed to capture the nature of Little Richard in this film. <br /> <br /> Actor Miguel Núñez who played Little Richard in "Why Fools Fall Love?" it was the most choice, after smelling off the power of a powerful but powerful musician. If the shows are not acceptable then the film will be too. And this is what happened here. Reduced or completely lost is LR's inays in homosexuality and voyeurism. What the "Experiments" did very well in enhancing the group's growing, warts and all, this film lacks with great score. What is happening with Robert Townsend director who started very well with "Shuffle's Hollywood"? He is a very intelligent, intelligent person but he has nothing to do with that first effort.
