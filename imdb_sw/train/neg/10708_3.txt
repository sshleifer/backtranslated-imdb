This movie was able to be very good, considering some of the plot elements borrowed from the executive of Sci-fi HIDDEN. And Dolph always gives an appeal on its obligations. But someone dropped the ball on this. <br /> <br /> Dolph has a player-kicking (!) Who goes to New York to find the key that opens the door under its monastery which has blocked the antichrist for 2000 years. He should fight minion, who is a soul that jumps from body to body such as HIDDEN and JASON CAN MAKE. Minion, usually, requires the key to allow the antichrist. Along with the trip, the angry archaeologist and with him and Dolph are driven by bodies with bodies. <br /> <br /> If I am making this sound entertainment, forget it. Stimulating is fast and stiff, small tasks do better, and fighting events have been done wrong. Dolph sleeps through his role and offers some of the worst talks of his work. <br /> <br /> The reason for the cheese grows at the end of the time when the minion army of nuns using the gun machine on the monastery, but some of this flick is snoozefest. It is not bad, I longed to love this.
