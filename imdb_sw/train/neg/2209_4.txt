If you read my "Dinoshark" review of SyFy, you know that I can understand the schlock of the low budget which these movies provided for television can provide. They are ignorant ... they are stupid ... but they are still very happy "bad, it's good" way. So, still guilty of hating (and proposing) hokey anonymous "Dinoshark", I sat watching "Hammerhead: Shark Frenzy", SyFy Original Movie on half-man, half-hammer-hammer monster awesome people on the island. With the incredible SyFy Channel catalog to create elements of the B-movie creation and cast including William Forsythe and Hunter Tylo, how can it go wrong? In fact, to my surprise, it certainly lacks the mark ... not to the extent, but enough to make me do not recommend. Why? Well, first of all, its titular monster, the hammer of a human hammer, takes behind the military hippopotamus that becomes actually the first mad film. Although the hammer tries to count the body, he (or whatever you call something) comes just before someone will face and leave automatically afterwards. Some of the movies are filling, beat our heroes against the previously mentioned soldiers. That, to me, is not just as compelling as watching a hammer to walk eating people! <br /> <br /> Please Read Full Review In My Blog: www.horrormoviejournal.blogspot.com
