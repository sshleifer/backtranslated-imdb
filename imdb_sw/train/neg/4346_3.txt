Why oh why people take good material and feel the need to change somehow? After reading a book about which this film is alleged to have been created a few years ago, I can say that there is little from the original book. I entered this film with low expectations - I knew it would have a telemovie crappy feel - but even fail to meet these. <br /> <br /> This is not a prequel - the only connection has an original name is a name. This is not the story of Carlito Brigante, it is a story of a completely different character who has been given the same name. They have completely lost in front of every fan of the Carlito Way out there; adding insults to beat Luis Guzman, who has an important character in the original movie, for a different role. What was so interesting that now this film has not been made another film will be made to deal with the original, unwanted material of Carlito's book - something I would like to see. I felt the same way on Chopper - they had four books with a fantastic non-fiction interview and they could make an enormous biography of the horrible horror of Australia, instead they made a ho-hum film about shock but an amazing blow a little time (although Eric Bana's performance had been shown). Now we can never see the original climb to Carlito and fall. The three stars are because, looking at it as a flick stand alone, not awesome - there are some decent displays (Jay Hernandez is not Carlito but can be good in other roles) and stories are not bad very much. Even Puffy Combs fits his role. But they do not fully understand the state of the madness at that time (I am a bit of a crime-free crime) - something that the original film and books were right (after being written by the attorney and then the current judge Edwin Torres). not a stand alone - maybe perhaps a desperate prequel ever done.
