This is probably the most exciting movie in history. I was looking at this film by the actress / director of Roman Polanski. I think I would see Amigos Three times than ever watching this film again. It went immediately from the DVD player directly into the trash. I apologize to those who seemed to have loved this movie however perhaps you like Coke too. I am losing to see why anyone would enjoy this film, it's slow, unknown and does not have a real plot. You are waiting for 105 minutes so the movie will be created. I understand this was done in 1976 but this was a bad television period. Thank you the disco god and the Third Company gone along with the stop glasses and Bay City Rollers. Oh well just my imagination.
