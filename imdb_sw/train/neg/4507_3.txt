Despite the overall interest of the wholesale and cost-effective production one is wondering how the director can make many cultural errors. Where is the JAPAN wardrobe and cultural consultants? It is not on the obvious charge. My Japanese friend laughed loudly for some of the cultural misconduct he hoped to appear before his eyes. In a later conversation he said, "Consider the Finnish director of filmmaking in Fnnish on the US civil war using the United Nations' UN actors as the Army and African Confederation Confederates. O'Hara in the period of hoop skirt missing hoop and hair games of the 1950s. Perhaps some people in Finland can realize that the skirt hoop was "missing hoop" or recognize hair Jane Mansfield hair, but Atlanta did not believe their eyes or ears ... and laugh at aisles ... good news and photography spoiled. <br /> <br /> So ... look at the Memoirs of Geisha was painful for anyone known and Japanese nuances culture, real geisha or Japanese dress, and That was the theme of the film! Hollywood is amazing in its myopic view of filming. I thought the "Samurai final" was a successful crown of how bad films are best on Japan can be. The Memoirs of Geisha are the best and worst disgrace at the same time.
