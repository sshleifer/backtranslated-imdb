Easily, deal with the adaptation of the Rebecca West book on the Captain to return from duty in WWII and his memory of immortality (now there is an original idea!). It seems he remembers the former Glenda Jackson but not the current wife Julie Christie, which should be enough to stop some of the emotional. So good soaper cast brings together Alan Bates's director and Alan Bridges and star star Jackson, Christie, Ann-Margret, and Ian Holm, but all burners down. There are a few good events (especially at any time in Jackson's screen), but Pridges' pacing is not good enough for the color of the film. For a long time on the shelf, "this army" is the best left forgotten. * 1/2 from ****
