I loved how this began, with special effects of honor especially for the 50-year film. There was a very interesting scenery. However, the films of early films and silent discussions like all men are trying to play with Anne Francis "Altaira Morbius.") This look at the '90s after a long absence, it was fun to see Francis again, the actor who has done A lot of television shows since this film was released .... and still works. It was also interesting to see Leslie Nielsen young ("Dr. John J. Adams"), whom I did not know if it was not sounding this sound / I was looking at half of this movie before the weight came too much and I had a strong desire to sleep. I appreciated them again to make this VHS tape in stereo. but it was a weak effort. That is one of the most registered films where the "elite" think is "heavy" and "stimulate the imagination." That doesn't mean. It seemed just "intelligent" because some of the films of the sci-fi 50s were stupid! <br /> Some as early events would have been shown well on the big screen, which I didn't have time to write this. Perhaps another look - this time on the transport of glass 2.35: 1 you would like to change this change.
