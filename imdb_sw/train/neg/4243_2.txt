The funniest part of this movie perhaps when our rescuers get their medals and plaques and whatnot. So the basic idea is, the police come to these groups for one million, but they are not strong because the criminals are just a bit. I think police ammo just binda's bounces. They decided to beat this film in a documentary and fake interview with all and seriously, what is wrong with these ones? They say if they had saturated newspapers. Well I accept, maybe it's still dangerous to be in the fire line, even when the situation is very profitable, but don't go to nuts. And why did hell take 44 minutes to solve everything? I would like to say that it is too long when you are around them and you are allowed to shoot. They are like 10 ft. Besides, they hit something completely. Then they go and buy more guns to boost their confidence. And then yes, there you are, one of the fighters blows a man. Bullet was probably selected by a lamp or object post. I had a good laugh I think.
