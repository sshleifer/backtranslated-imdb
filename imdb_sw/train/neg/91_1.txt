I lost this film about 3 years ago, and it is still happening in my mind as the worst movie made. I don't think I ever finished. It's worse than a home video released by a high school student. I remember they make flashback up to 1970 something and in flashback there was a man with polo shirt, oakley sunglasses and a new SUV, like Toyota Rav-4 or something (I remember). I don't understand how they could say that in 70 years. He may have a mobile phone too, I don't remember, It was just terrible. I went back to the video store and asked them why they take even the movie and if I could find the hour of my life back. To date it is the worst movie I saw, and I found some very good.
