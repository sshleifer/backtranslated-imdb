I should not start this movie, and stop watching after 3/4. I didn't really live. This film was disappointing because it would be better. It had a beautiful atmosphere, high sand and director, beautiful places. But the story of barsaaaad, the bad script. I listened to the southern speed of Kenneth Branagh - it was better than the script. The plan was stupid - led by the perpetrators of unethical and impossible ways. No one does like this out of Hollywood scripts.
