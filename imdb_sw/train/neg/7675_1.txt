Could it be that there are some movies that are not available? Answer: Yes, and this is one of them. After assisting the chairman of Uwe Boll's house, he has now set his eye less than a talent in the video game. Do they not know these? For anyone who can not understand, here is in the cities to block you: VIDO VIDEO DON'T MAKE MATERIALS! Acting here is, better, small. Design set with special effects are poor. Unlike the video game (which had its dreadful season) the film does not have the atmosphere of the expected penalty, no sense of danger or danger. Pacing and planning is confused with the paper in which the script is published above would best be used as a toilet paper. The great man is the director. Uwe Boll uses the camera for grace and knowledge of the monkey using color colors. Hackneyed zooms, swoops and pots are published in all of the dreary elements during predictability and leaving the anxiety and tired listeners. Why this person has been around the first-placed film that should be like one of the modern cinema. Avoid at all costs.
