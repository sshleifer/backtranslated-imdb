What? Have I ever seen the most amazing movie? I can imagine a lot that is similar to this, but no one can remove it. Release is every kind of terrible filled with flat discussion. I am ashamed of all the people involved in doing this. Everyone is wearing the issue of fear not created by the plot, but by realizing that this project could easily carry out their work. Even many of Diaz's gifts do not give you a good reason to deal with this. Avoid, it is obviously the style of films that Americans have not found. See the end result if you should, and you'll see what I'm talking about, but don't say I haven't told you ...
