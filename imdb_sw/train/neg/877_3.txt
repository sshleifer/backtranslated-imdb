I was surprised to see this film expecting a series of personal "personal worship" that shows a young boy's dream. "Personal Study II" does NOT have what to do with the head I say. It's just a flick of Cinemax's typical soft core that doesn't make changes in your life. There is only one hot flame on the ceiling but it is. I watched this long ago but I believe, this is just a normal boring base of flick. <br /> <br /> Women are hot but not enough to rent or buy a movie. My advice is to check this only if it climbs on the cable.
