Tell him I really need to get these good ideas with many people, which is also the main reason why I decide to watch this film. And after seeing it, I was desperate, and this comes from a boy who loves this kind of film. I wonder about this film completely - it's like a child's movie and weakness for any reason at all and it all involves small children insulting and swearing. I'm not quite right but this has gone too far in my account. Parallel: The story of two boys has been sent to a great deal of brotherhood for their unintelligent behavior. There they met some children with a boob of vanity and another is a medium shadow. His / her name is not actually connected to the story at all. They do not serve as an example or do anything but serve their time for what they have done. The story is very predictable (although expected) and humor is lame. And we've already seen the same characters (playing with Mc Lovin ') in many other movies (like Sasquatch Gang?). I think I laugh three times and almost fall asleep. <br /> <br /> Good cast was the same after all he is the one who produces the screenplay. And acting is so-like as you look at this type of film. And direction, what do you expect? This is the one who brought us the Summer Summer of Winter, and that movie also takes. But somehow he could bring a certain star to attract his bad movie. It does not seem to be a total but quite a waste of time. Only honey items appear to be the most beautiful part of the film. Can't see why I should recommend this to anyone. Is Pros: Elizabeth Bank? Featured top. Cons: Not funny, bad stories, dirt and children are not confused together. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3.5 / 10 (Grade: F)
