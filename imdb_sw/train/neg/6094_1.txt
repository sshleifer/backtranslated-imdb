I have had a lot of credibility to write this review for several reasons: <br /> <br /> 1) This is of course the worst films I've ever seen. 3) I was fortunate - I paid five pounds for that. I have seen it in 15 pounds. DON NOT IN THE FIELD OF FILIA! You will be very angry 4) There are many films out there in the form of horror that is not available equality (in my opinion) and give this film a higher score than they are criminals and the friends meets the tramp who promises the world - well, the magic power to be seen by everyone as someone else. Our hero turns into a little girl and joins his group - sitting seated, the child sitting. He kills them until he is found and found by the police. <br /> <br /> Why is it so bad? Start with acting is very bad. Another person compared it to school production. No, this is more serious than any act I have seen at school stage. I have bought several banned films from the company's DVDs and I have not been discouraged as I did. The same, acting is bad but the film can not provide in any other way. What was the point of making this film when no even any year! okay, no year. What else could the film like this offer? Mouse? No, none of any features! It is true this film may have some charm in its unique destruction but any buyer / viewer of this film should be advised that this film is just one of ten.
