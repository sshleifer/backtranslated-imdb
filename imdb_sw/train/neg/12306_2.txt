This film is a pure failure. I am a fan of Steve Martin, but even he can't store the idea of ​​exhaustion and the script of swiss cheese. Consider the "Police Academy 7" and use it for military skills. Yuck. I don't feel the other comments of the user appeared to be inferior to this movie received (and indeed it deserves!). It's very misleading. I have often seen this film dropped to $ 3.00 in a grocery store and now I know why. <br /> <br /> If I could get 90 minutes behind me ...
