Well I must say this perhaps the worst films I saw this year! The joke was so insignificant (didn't expect from PG film) (Rated PG in Canada) and was not funny! By throwing this great I at least expect some good acting but I even get it. I am a great fan of Rainn Wilson and this is the first time I have been very disappointed with his performance. Neither Luke Wilosn or the characters of Uma Thurman are very little and I really can be a little worried happened to one of them. I did not expect this as the past I loved other movies and this director (Six days, seven nights for example) This movie was not worth $ 10 it cost me and I strongly encourage you to see this movie. I'm sure you will be like I pray that this movie will pass.
