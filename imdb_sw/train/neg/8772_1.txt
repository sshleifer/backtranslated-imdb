There is nothing new for me to say: 4 hours of dying people often in one hill. Release was stellar, but unfortunately the producer / director / editor / God came down. He had to eat a pie of humility (if not for himself then for men who died in Kargil), recruited one of the brilliant voice directors, recruited a true composer, recruited a real editor, hired a woman who had no relationship with him in a manner. Some (and who seemed to have heard the bad version of the "Apocalypse Now" on the cheap Indian drug), employed a real professional staff, threw out all the flames and told the real story. Unfortunately he, as a youth of the Indian Army, made a terrible decision for his executives, and terrible for his listeners. We are all dead. <br /> <br /> Please don't do it again, sir! Sushma Kathmandu, Nepal <br /> ps: Sometimes the director of India decides to honor the Gurkha army, let me give more than one Nepali stand team. There are indeed many Nepali people working in Bombay - the last count was 40,000 to half a million.
