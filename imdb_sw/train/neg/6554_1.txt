I will not give you this film rating, not recommended. I just watched because I am a fan of Pfieffer. I love him and he can look at what he did. Even in this dud, he did not desire. Every area in which it is located, has set an observer to watch ... waiting for something to happen but nothing has done. It had other lines of the story but it stopped suddenly when it started. Some of the other characters were able but there was nothing. <br /> <br /> Pfieffer had 29 when he made this film and at its best time. The wardrobe and the set was amazingly beautiful. I can look beyond anything and I've never come up with a film that I can't find something to love about it, but this was dud. I don't understand. The worst thing about all, it had a great hanger at the end of the end. It had a final location that awakens you and say wow, this film eventually goes somewhere, then a credit card. Good sadness. I agree with the audit reports .99 would have bought 3 cans of cat food and watched my cat eating it would be more exciting. You said well. In fact, these views were more entertaining than the film because it makes it better. I lost 99 cents in this dud.dud.dud.
