Another church blows again. This is not a spoiler, because the end of REAL comes after researching people who brought this more long, pseudo-scientific infomercial ... Ramtha's School of Mwangaza. <br /> <br /> When any religion / philosophy needs to hide behind the OZ screen as deception, I walk away. Thank you Ramtha I watched a planned copy of this movie on the "friend" suggestions ... to lose valuable resources on this New Age lobotomizer may be bad. I can only hope that they “believe that they can walk on the water” enough to take the lead to the conclusion of "logic" ... in other words; walk, stop ... or fast :-) As a movie ... it should be a powerful "1" on the value of entertainment, especially by creating an incomplete character in the film history (fox photographer ... eeeeeek!) . If you should see this film, you borrow from one of the people who were guided by the mind who suggested.
