Whenever I make a bad list of the worst movies I've ever seen, this film is always about it. You don't have any redemption features. It took the act of love to stay all the way, and I would quickly shed my own blood rather than have to sit again. What is wrong with that? I would like to tell you the story of my journey going to see on the playground. <br /> <br /> I went to the midnight show, on Saturday night. I alone in the theater is myself, and a group of young, young, non-rebellious, sitting somewhere behind me. They were exposed out to have a good night on Saturday, and they came to this "comedy" for some laugh. Before the start of the film, during the preview, they were laughing and dancing and commenting positively. It was against the borders; if they continued their passion without a button in a real movie, I could say something, but I had a sense of tolerance and sympathy for them, and so let me. They sat when the movie started. Why do I tell you all this? Because you can judge these "demands" because of not just about me, but in this bunch of lines. At the time of the whole run of the film, not one person in the cutting theater. Not immediately. Not me, not the children of pride. Quietly, away from the sound of the voice. And when the film was finished and the lights came, we all, all of us, came out of the theater slowly, desperately, completely silent. It can be funeral. This was the effect that this "comedy" was produced. Not laughter, not fun, but absolutely DEPRESSION. It was a repressive, oppressive movie, and not too little to play. Preaching, defending, suppressing, but not funny. I found Mel Brooks' "Saddles strict" to be on the short Movie List of Funniest Ever. It still hits my mind that the gentleman may be responsible for perhaps the Best Love Story Ever. In short: If you feel very happy, make this film whirl; Otherwise, don't say I didn't warn them.
