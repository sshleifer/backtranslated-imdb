First, I realize that "1" rating should be stored for the worst worse. This movie gets it from me because, as one auditor shows, it's not bad in the way of identifying, on top that can allow you to have a comic value or devotion. It loses its score for every calculation. ** Have possible advisers ** Talks have never been. Continuing is deliberate. Daniel has finished speaking of his lost love, and with his last word flamenco players start. The shock of his name is (see? I did not even remember the name of his character, not leaving the name of the forgetful actor) when her husband (Baldwin) first tells her that her friend is evil. Car and motorcycle follow all the right things. Vegetable carts have gone. Cars are facing. Motorcycles are coming down the stairs. People almost have to hit, but surprisingly, no one. Oh, that's the same ... except for one person who has been wounded several times, it is obviously moving along the barriers and knife injuries, and the nearest car has not seen him. Hmmm. It is more amazing and more that movies like this can be done. There is great pressure on the film industry to make money, you would like to think that someone in Hollywood would think of making a good film to see. Now there is a novel idea. My opinion: don't see this film. Do not rent DVD. Don't look at the cable. There are many things you could do that would make them feel more satisfied.
