(aka: DEMONI III) It made Italian TV even though it has been hit in English and has never had the original DEMONS film. It had to have only the name, THE OGRE, how the director Lamberto Bava has given. The American family employs the Italian villa for summer. The woman (Virginia Bryant) has a common dream of herself as a little girl going down to the old wine room of this villa meeting with this cocoa structure put under the ceiling. It sells and is covered in cobwebs and has what looks like spiders or legs of insects depend on it. Reduces what looks like green. Of course the husband does not believe anything. The only villa is old and creaks and makes a noisy noise in the middle of the night and he should just ignore it. But OGRE itself looks at what looks like a kind of 16th Centaury costume and what it looks like the head of a wolf clinging to it with an aroma of orchids. The movies are not so bad and at least the conversation is half of the mind without stupid words that will bring them. There is no other true year except some of the bones that decompose in the basement dam which look like a bottom of the modern swimming pool. OGRE itself destroys only after being run by the family Jeep Cherokee. The DVD's Shriek DVD text I saw was no damage, and the photo taking black for a few seconds about half an hour in the film, conscious I hope Shriek has made a revision. Others include short interviews with Lamberto Bava where he describes how this was not a sequel, etc .. with other tractors on other DVDs of Shriek DVD. This is the most common things. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 <br /> <br />
