This movie was in a sci-fi 50-pack my friend got me for Christmas. It is similar to the first movie of Gozilla, and like that movie, it has scenes and American actors were introduced because there is no truth. One interesting thing about the events included is that there is a conflict of Cold War that was displayed between America and Russia. Like Godzilla, Gamera is awakened by an atomic explosion and widespread worldwide, with great attention to Tokyo because no monster movie has been completed except Tokyo is scored. All in all, this is a good movie. Some of the events associated with Gamera, especially Toly events, are very interesting and have special effects that were respectable at the time. If you like a great Japanese monster movie, you will get a kick out of this. I gave him 4 out of 10. If this was a Japanese version that was not recommended, I would probably have 5.
