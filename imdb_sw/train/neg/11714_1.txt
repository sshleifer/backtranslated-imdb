The United States seems to run the British police who all run around with weapons to the teeth and you know that CID officials change to uniform when they stop working and stop the bars! This should be one of the non-fiction movies and the worst “real” police of the UK that has ever been a non-profit society. I can see that Mr Snipes may have needed money to pay his tax bill but what he was good as Charles Dance was doing in it is a mystery. worse than the worst budget "B" film 50 years. At half and a half of suicide and when I will never return. Avoid as a real stress.
