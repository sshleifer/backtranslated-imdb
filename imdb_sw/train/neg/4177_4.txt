Movie second in box box. Originally named Bloodsuckers, this movie was average average. It's kinda boring in a certain place but there are some side effects of the year, but it's not even better yet. The film is done in 2210. Vampires have been taken over the whole world. The V-SAN (Vampire Sanitation) squad, which also has their spaceship and led by Churchill, who has been taken by vampires, gets a message from the World and team, created by Quintana (played by Natassia Malthe very), rookie officer Damian and The rebels Rosa and the Roman (Roman played by Aaron Pearl from Wrongly charged.) V-SAN later to meet the leader of the Muco Vampires, played by Michael Ironside from Total Recall. He has no plans to live in peace with men, for he has joined the world. Though this film was not a temporary waste, I will certainly be back in the DVD player anytime soon.
