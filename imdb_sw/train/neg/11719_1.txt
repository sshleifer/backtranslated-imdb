In the words of Charles Dance's character in this film, "Bollocks!" No plot, no development of character, and quite unknown. Full of things that are not being done in the real world (since the British police inspectors had weapons of arms in the shoulder holsters?). Full error (Bulgarian train in London?). Full of furious and fake debate. And the lead / destroy is the bad-kubbly hand shots hand-held camera which will add something to the film except the clear feeling of the seasickness; reduced-jump-reduced; no structure. Wesley Snipes' behavior doesn't have a sense - why should we care about what happens to him? One video? One of the soil!
