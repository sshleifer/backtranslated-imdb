Encouraged by positive comments on this film here I was expecting to watch this film. Bad error. I have seen the 950+ film and this is one of the worst - it's bad for almost every way: edit, approve, storyline, 'acting,' voice sound (just a film film - tune country - it is not available less than four times) . The movie looks cheaper and worse and more interesting. I have often been very happy to see the final features of the film. The only thing that prevents you from giving this mark is 1 Harvey Keitel - when this is far from its best performance at least seems to have little effort. One for Keitel's only concerns.
