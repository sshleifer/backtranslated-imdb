I stopped looking at the lost during this period because I thought the deaths of Ana-Lucia and Libby were unnecessary and very difficult. Then I found that they kept Libby almost to die in the next place! Gah! I can't use it. I liked to show this for the first season, but certainly decreased in the second season, I realized the religious error of Jack and Locke being pleased. Rodriguez's deaths & Watros' characters are the last leaves! I offer this section 4/10, for the end of my look for this old series organized by the Alias ​​J.J Newsletter. Abrams. I hope his success in the future will strengthen this.
