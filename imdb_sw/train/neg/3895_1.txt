Once some evil people made a film about a man who was hit on a space, thinks to go to Saturn, but just actually on pictures of solar stocks, and then he gets a nose, and before he knows, he's put in the head of the hospital blast The foot, and then the nurse overweight and the worst safe fit comes and is given to the guy, who think that melting all over the place but never seems to lose any mass, and then NASA, or at least one boy in NASA, gets angry about it and calls someone else to keep him down, but the boy who sent him to hunt the sponge should go home and have the first soup, and his rounded wife has forgotten the Workers, so he can't have crackers, and then he must go out and watch the guy mixed with the geiger counter, and that doesn't work really, so he just just follows the way of eating bodies, and then there is something about sheriff, and two bad people in lemon sand, and they have with a cleaver of meat, d some kind of industrial plant and security security guards, and because I can't tell you how the film ends, I can say Jonathan Demme is somewhere with someone with a bad name of Burr DeBenning, and if there is any right in the world everyone who is connected to this film died a destructive death, large and was unable to make more movies, and the world lived HAPPILY IN - ENDA!
