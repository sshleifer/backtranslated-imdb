'Chance' is a great mistake to see. You can know Emile Ardolino's director from 'Dirty Dancing' and 'Sister Act' and expects something interesting from him. But I think I must worry you. He made a real, bad movie. <br /> <br /> According to Christopher McDonald's story dies to reburn as a child. The child grows Robert Downey Jr, and Jr returns to his old town where he meets his old daughter, Mary Stuart Masterson (hard, hu?). They love each other. Then it appears Jr's former wife, Pastor of Cybill, and Jr likes and him too. I think I've never said that she loves Ryan O'Neil. <br /> <br /> In one of his first roles Robert Downey Jr on his worst. Strikes Michael J Fox. After the “Day of the Day” Pastor confirms that he does not deserve to work on the film. <br /> <br /> However, there is one thing this unwanted comedy can be used: if you fight sleep.
