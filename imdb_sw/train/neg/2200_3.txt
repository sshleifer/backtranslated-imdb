I love bad shark movies. I really do. I laugh at them. and the scifi station had their marathon, it reached the Prime Minister of their original picture, hammerhead: frenzy shark. based on the preview, it seemed like it would be quite interesting. basically the remake of a creature of benchley, in fact. was set up to show the shark attack 3: logo, which is a shark movie hilarity for the best. I had a feeling; I was ready to go. bring up, hammer-mad-scientist-man! oh, god, it was that the film is not recommended. It's wrong, wrong, wrong. <br /> <br /> sick. it continues. It's hit. This is a theoretical reproduction for the worst, my friends. when a girl with drugs had been released out of the animation stopped and connected to the table crying her head because the shark-man of the fetus mix "a completely" scientist is placed in his stomach wants OUT ... Jesus monkeys. that's what I'm going to hit. <br /> <br /> That's really how the plot works: hmmm, thought the mad scientist. My child died of cancer, but I raised him by combining his dna with a shark hammer, because the papa does not live with cancer and other hammers producing through placenta. oh, look! be amphibious to be! I have created a second transformation of the community! I know! let's get a breed! but he found if all the shark genes did not make my baby blood; instead of infecting the hot children I continue to send in his small jungle paradise, he continues to eat. but see this out! among the lost people who, through a great loss, ended up on my research island, is a woman whose child had done before she died! I bet he will do HER! all of this causes a very touching and heart-friendly fellowship: woman: want to make me? mad scientist: no. he is. (shows the opposing person of the shark in the tank) how pleasing. Do not see this MOVIE. forever.
