Oh, Sam Mraovich, we know you tried so much. This is your magnum opus, a white model for some of us that you certainly have the value of being selected at the Art Arts and Science Academy (as you say on your network of 1998). Alas, it is better to remain silent and think fools than to talk and remove all doubt. For Ben & Arthur, you're doing just that. It seems to have been gathered with a lack of teaching or education, the screenplay of the film leads us to a very strange way for every new location. It is this excuse of stories that can also be a good partner of the film. Starting tepidly, the sex characters of romantic sex Ben and Arthur are trying to get married, going so far to fly the whole country to do so, in the shade of the very beautiful palm trees of Vermont. But, all this reinforcement is just leading to BLOOD. Then more BLOOD, and more and more BLOOD. I mean, there must be at least $ 20 in the preparation of artificial blood in the last third of this film. It is all of its films. From sound to music editing, which has one of the fuzzy guns made on the keyboard, it's amazing that the film even holds together in any media you look at. It is a shame then that some of the most beautiful amateur performances disappear here. <br /> <br /> No matter, Sam. I am sure you have created five figures on this flick on rent or anything that leads to poor people (such as myself) to see this film. Unfortunately, we do not laugh with you.
