Well, anyone who can honestly say that this film was Good or even Good is either a fraud or knows the Director, Author and Manufacturers and tries to add buzz to this film. I watched the film because my friend did the job and it was awesome. I am an actor and I have worked in the industry for a while now on a great film and even independent and this movie has hit me. The reason for it is very difficult is because this film was obviously different from the "Mouse and Men" and should be prosecuted because it is excited as a horror of the story. In the industry in which Hollywood seems to be the primary destruction ... for someone to take a classic book with the film "Mouse and Men" and destroy it with new bugs to spin me very much. Actors, accents, discussions and recipes were amateurish and writing was bad. I mean if you are going to take a new spin on the existing story make sure it is better or better than the original to make the new spin correct. Didn't like this movie completely.
