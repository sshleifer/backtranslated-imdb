This film was a pure pain. Sitting at the theater for x-amount of minutes, I was surprised when the film begins. All Setups are set; A common story of love, the characters should eliminate their short publications, the villain should turn, but no one has ever started. When things happened, I was very tired and the supplies were not quite effective. In cases requiring strong tension and construction, it seemed like the required columns were cut. Kid items should not be so. Children's movies can be like riveting and participating as adults. The excuse, "hey, for the children," is the cow. I will take "Sword in the stone" any day. This was bad. I feel that Disney will put anything in these days. And for children, 10 years I saw this and agree ... clean garbage.
