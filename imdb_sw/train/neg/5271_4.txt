The collision, the American family, the western holiday, discover the wonderful city of spirit in the middle of the desert. They do not know that this village was a test site for nuclear bombs, and the existence of death causes them. I usually love horrible films like this. "Cube", "Duel" and "Spielberg" Birds are good examples of movies that provide answers but still leave us and we want more. It seems, "Player" director / director Walter Klenhard was trying to do just that kind of film, and if he succeeded it for the viewer. I personally think he had half of the trip there, then the film dropped. <br /> <br /> All actors are just a "ho-hum" type. Not too bad but we as listeners never feel their feelings and they are responding to the situation in a wrong way. Does anyone else really walk out to explore amazing sounds? At least give them some kind of right to do it?!?!? <br /> <br /> In addition to films made for the film may be fairly high right. Klenhard Director should be praised for denying the desert conditions for everything provided and some of the circumstances were surprising. There is a real place in which two characters find the old nuclear test was sandy soaked with glasses away from the eye that could see. I wonder if that was true? Isn't a year to talk about, and 'creation'? Or what ever hell is after these people? You have never been shown, without mentioning that we have not even had a real clue about what they are (Mutants, Aliens, ghosts or old Indian evil spirits? Oh, really reduces for us!) Or where it comes from. <br /> <br /> There's a lot of clich√©s here, too. Why is it that cities-people in these types of films are really, really dumb? Why is there an old man who thinks it is things that turn out to be right? Why? Why? Why? How to find new conditions, folks! The "lack" tries to be different from the intellectual but ultimately fails because in many ways it is very popular for us directly-video feeders of fear. Hey, I've seen the worst movie, and disappearing is not bad, it's just too? Average. <br /> <br /> 4/10.
