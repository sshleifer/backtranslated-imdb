I saw this movie the other day in the school of the film school, and I did not see the movie Almodovar before but I looked forward to it. Unfortunately, it was a worthless film and only a couple of soup mixed with two hours of weight. The upper sores are a collection of random scenes that may work in their different movies but together they do not add up to any kind of absolute meaning. <br /> <br /> Or so I thought. Tomorrow, the second day, my professor of film spent all the time class explaining all the hidden films of the film, as how the mural depicting an unknown flamenco to the back of the queen's drag area is some kind of commentary on the lack of identity that Spain has The nation has developed under the fascist rule. Apparently, the whole film is faced with a limited view of knives and records like this. Great, but you know what? It is still a bad movie. It takes more depth and complexity to make a good film - you still need to give the audience a reason to keep attention, something to attract enough viewer to really care about all tricks. The upper sores give us a strange character, who can not beat but put them in a lot of common formats made from other movies, and Almodovar does not seem to make them make any kind of sure. What is the importance, for example, of the revelation of Hitchcocki's characteristic that occurs at the end of the film? Why is it even there? Just amazing us? <br /> <br /> There is one funny area that relates to news broadcasts. And that's it, that's the only time of entertainment. Other parts of the film are just a glimpse of the secular and invisible films just visible for showing us how smart Pedro Almodovar has. But no matter what the professor of my film says, it takes more than a personal fraud for the film to be good.
