As a fan of Eric Rohmer's study of the modern sex war, I had a strong desire to see "Lady and Duke (L'Anglaise et le duc)" for how he could treat men and women during the real war, the French Revolution. <br /> <br /> The movie looks good, and every area is made as a temporary painting, such as a table. And I expected to talk too much, like the Rohmer style. But maybe Rohmer was prevented by introducing a screenplay on a real woman's text why this seems to be like tocudrama version of "Pimpernel Scarlet." <br /> <br /> As bad as the excess of Robespierre et al, how about some recognize that the French kings had been destroyed by brats? I continued to brag: "Meat, we are poor / poor live in poverty;" you can also take tune from "Les Miz." I'm not all sympathetic as the main figure has to return to the center of his city and the country house to stay in front of the Revolution. At one time his maid says the pantry is clear but surely manages to keep a good repast. I did not know him, an English artist who rejects and defends his old and famous partner as he and the Revolution continue to take political perspective; I think I should feel more sympathetic than their political crimes, like the "Pimpernel Scarlet." Hey, the only reason he did not come home was his disgrace after the matter with the baby and Prince of Wales or someone. Normal times in the revolutionary period there are certain principles of ongoing change in relationships between men and women, but I have not seen here. I went to Herbert Marcuse's speech which concluded with Q & A long; The last question, from a member of the earliest listeners than we all of the acolytes, heck had gray, was "Why are fighters bad?" He was beaten by Marcuse not to respond to it seriously - but it was the only thing I remember from the whole evening. Rohmer shows that the revolutionary fighters are also bad and wasactic. <br /> <br /> (previously written 8/11/2002)
