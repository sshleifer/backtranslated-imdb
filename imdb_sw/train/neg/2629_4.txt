Hollow point is a good movie worth half-renting or if nothing else in a good time waster without thought required. There are mandatory and hammy explosions to act with pretty women. Well cast by Donald Sutherland, John Lithgow, and Tia Carrere good. This thrown together with a good touch makes it not a good movie but it's fun ... to one level up to ten
