In Hollywood 1930 and 1940, I think that every studio can do west, except the Warner bros. They often try, always have ignorance (except perhaps, because they died with their boots on - which is west of horses.) I have read that Humphrey Bogart, with James Cagney and a big cowboy hat on his head, he said he looked like mushrooms. True! Cagney and Bogart are also in the city, also XXe century is believed in western films. The story here did not worry, and did not help. Every 10 minutes, I think I can see Bogart and Cagney beat their small guns and put hands on a machine gun to stop off the black 1930 car.
