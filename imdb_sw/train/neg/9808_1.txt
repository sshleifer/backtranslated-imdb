The more evil I have ever seen. The story is about a group of young people who, for some unimportant reason, have high authority, and when they use a special device, they beat the wonderful pieces, which are badly planned. Acting when they are not in long-lasting suits is good. Certainly not good, but it's not the worst job I've ever seen. However, when wearing their suits, acting actors may go from the worst; much, worse. Animated idiots contain several hundred of unwanted arguments they do. Even when they talk they seem to be injured. Criminals are stupider than Rangers. Each part, some strong, ignorant people comes with a plan to destroy the Rangers. He / she then sends the power of visitors to live to attack the Rangers. Rangers then set up their 10-hour changing animation, then they destroy the aliens. Then, a miserable villain, which may be a village of weapons that is certainly seen by an act of evil, for a human being with booths that show obvious signs of mental loss. Power Rangers Fight the villain away, then the villain turns into Godzilla, as it is with rain or nuclear rains (yes, they fire nukes in creatures and creatures to turn into giants). Power Rangers spend 5 minutes to perform the sound of the voice and call their Zords which are clear fingers that show the producers had special effects on making them look real. Power Rangers to win, villain gets mad, all teaches "value" lesson, and the show ends. That's right. Twenty-five minutes of brain washing, fake kung fu fighting.
