This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen and I am 64 years old with a football player. I went to expect to see a football movie. About 10 minutes in it, I started to wonder how such a bad movie (especially acting) would come to the theater. Almost half of the way, I worried my husband that it was bad and he told me the truth behind the movie. Although I was a little guilty (and could see how others might be very uncomfortable if they were not Christians) when they were in a movie cinema, it was not a great deal. It was, however, a great deal to be under the same predictions with a false character and, above all, the quality of acting. It is a suitable movie for church entry but is displayed on a church hotel and not on the playground. Do I go to church? Yes. What? I want to go to church when I attend movies? No. I would recommend this movie? Absolutely not !!!
