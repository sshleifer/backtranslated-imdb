... and I found some evil. I have nothing good to say about this film. Acting is poor and Jennifer Tilly - as expected. Daryl Hannah is doing a good job, but there is nothing close to being able to save this film. The biggest file in this film is that the plot is very weak - although on the basis of a good premise - that the author decided for "ignorance ignorance of ignorance" to involve doubts. When all Daryl Hannah should make it hide, she runs out in front of her to follow it. The hospital area is amazing. Without revealing a lot of what goes through a plot, I think it would be difficult for a young woman to get pregnant from hospital unnoticed. Lame. It's too blind to <br /> <br /> Shut up some time and start another flick.
