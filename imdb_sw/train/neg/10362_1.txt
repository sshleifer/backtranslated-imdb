Disney? What happened? I just want the movie installed in 60 years, as the book was. And in fact I could deal with the special effects of cheap to save the budget based on more accurate ... I am happy that, perhaps, someone can be persuaded to read the books ... but, The Red Eyes can interact like IT? And what's going on with a volcanic shock? Where were you in the book? Peter Jackson! Save us !!!! Long ago (1978) I heard that there is a European version of this film. I am sure I would like to do it. I can only think it could be closer to real story than poor adaption. This movie needs to be X'd.
