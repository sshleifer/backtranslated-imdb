I enjoyed the opinion of the first auditor than I did the film when I saw it in the second theater in the early 80's. But to me, the cast was largely destroyed, their self-absorbed by masks, when the direction that I think is the most unusual, and photographed easily. The standard set down at the time was not meant, which means "not worth sitting at once". <br /> <br /> Still, I could also fly a chance to have a second look.
