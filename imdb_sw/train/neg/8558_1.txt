This film was very bad, and I even feel worried to call it a film. It is an example of a movie "mumblecore", with a zero plot and a group of the best mounted two small barriers around trying to "learn things out". I have tried to give a space of a mlecole, but it lets you be his most serious. <br /> <br /> I'm not equal to the movies, I enjoy the movie Dogme95, Idioterne is one of all my favorite films. So I don't care if the film is cheap for as long as there is nothing else (ANY). Everything in this film is wrong, acting, text (or all done?), direction, but most of all, on everything else, the camera function was clear and simple. The camera has never had any logic, there was no position. I had to admit that the person I heard there was an illusion in this film and so I thought it was even better if it was at least there was deception (yes I know, I am jerk). Surely thanks to the work of the crappy camera you never come to see anything, and the things you see, I NEED ME - you don't want to see. This film has made me want to vomit on many levels. Talks made me to vomit, the camera function made me vomit, but more idea that this film was proposed by other critics of the law, well now that more than anything makes me want to vomit.
