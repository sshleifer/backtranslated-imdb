To die hard Judy Garland fans only. There are two (2) numbers that are very good - one where they make numbers with an old cleaning woman (you have seen all the pictures), and very good numbers last. There are several cases where the lines are amazing. But, basically, the script is very bad and the film has been described that it's hard not to interfere in the inner awfulness. But it's worth 2.50 rental movie - just being ready to do it quickly.
