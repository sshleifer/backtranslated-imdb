this is a terrible, awesome movie !!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> The first of TOOO all long-term. The longest movie I saw. <br /> <br /> All stories have also been worse! <br /> If there are really many stories that the story line has been destroyed. The comedy was not Comedy !!!!! it was not surprising even ... this story is interesting and unhealthy that it does not matter whether the characters live or die .......... ... but my hopes have been hit in the first few minutes ...... <br /> <br /> The only right thing about this film is MUSIC ...... and clear Vidya Balan. she gives the best performance and stands between all the major actors ... she's just a new woman and still she shines and makes others look cast so Pathetic !!!!! Govinda and Blonde who play his love interests also helps to save this bad movie. Govinda fits perfectly in the role of taxi driver. and Blonde also provides a very good and consistent performance .... <br /> <br /> other good performers Ayesha Takiya is completely lost in this film! so it's priyanka !!!!!!!!! Akshay does his job well but it also appeared on top! Anil and Juhi are also completely lost ...... The only thing that has not been lost is Salman because they do not have a Talent that has already been lost !!!!!!!!! All over this is an incomplete movie and the Mishmashed screen and TOOO Masladar that the story story is made based on the comedy's stupid events. Imagine how stupid this movie is !!!!!! 3/10 is four hours long! Think and RETHINK before you go to the movies! best escape !!!!!
