The first house alone was a good film enough ... The customer was very similar, in a new environment. This is trying to be the original, and it achieves a certain level ... of course, the form is the same, so it is like watching the film for the third time and a slight change. The new logo is quite bad (although a new set of “set traps” was, if there is nothing else, interesting and distinctive), especially compared to the first big score, and a close-not-quite good-quality mark. It is (almost) makes for him by using some of the non-natural music, but it's not the same. The plan is fair, and is the original for the franchise, but it is still essentially the same movie as the first two, and the worst is the most irritating one of the 'terrible behaviors that seem to be good'. Acting is more interesting. Anime are more than caricatures. The new thieves are more entertaining than the former (and pointing to the spy elements, which are close to crime, due to a small amount of good spy there, and how few are very valuable). The fact that there are more of them (and therefore more traps) is an attemptless attempt to try to go one more than the first two films ... and it doesn't work. The idea behind the thieves and their mission is tad too ... adults and bad for children's films (and there was a sex joke or two, though not the first time in the series). It is also unnecessary difficult, as is the general plot. I could follow, but I'm sure the child can. Some displays are very explicit even though children can get it foolish. Animals are generally not exciting. There are a few brothers, which should mean that those there are getting more development, but they have a much lower personality than those mentioned above the first two films. All in all, it's not very good, or it is a look, unless you * like to see criminals get hurt in cartoon-y cruelty. I recommend this to the great fans of just a series. 3/10
