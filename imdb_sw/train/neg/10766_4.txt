Anyone who has seen the Children of Tammuz Children knows that this is a good director. Let's hope that it was not a case of many hands in a pot (Telefilm anyone?) And that was the case of jitters of the second element. The characters are automatically and more used. The state of the scenario is severe however it shows the Pacific Northwest beauty. <br /> <br /> The movie is good. Shot almost completely out, the pictures are crisp and beautiful. You can almost smell the wind through the leaves. It really is a sound as it comes - it lacks the heart.
