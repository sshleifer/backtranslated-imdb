I rented this on a DVD yesterday and I did not realize it was a "learning practice" type of movie, so I tried to watch an hour before hitting the Stop button. <br /> <br /> Even for the study of the theme character, I could not only get this film completely. Maybe it was my feelings in wanting to look at something else, or maybe I had other expectations, but putting it aside, I worked hard to continue to finish, but I gave. Workers played their roles well, but the international mix did not come together to keep my interests. About the most amazing thing was the sergeant gun was stolen and hurried to buy another, and the medicine built black to look like a police issue. I think this movie should be fair, "Who stole the guns of Sergeant?" The exhibition had been well done but by putting them together again I was robbed of any cooperation to look at me. Since I didn't finish watching I would like to say there is a right to rent this film. .. maybe. To me, it was a loss of good effort and watching. I'll let you try, but not one that I would suggest.
