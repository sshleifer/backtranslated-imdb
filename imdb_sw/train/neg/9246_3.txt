I refused to look at this when it happened at the beginning, keeping a record of the late, crying a series of 1960s by Mike Pratt and Kenneth Cope, but I can't resist the challenge. I had to know more. It is not quite remake, and more than knowledge than worship, this show does not know how to play with it, and it has been hit by young squares and cartoon sessions and characters. The three main characters were slightly more than the caricatures of actors, and Emilia Fox only can act (Bob Mortimer is painful for direct role). The support was just the peer-friends of Vic and Bob wishing to be part of the shock, and they know very well the situation to be persuasive. And CGI, although the effects cannot help to improve those who were found 30 years earlier, only criticized the viewer with the lights and the work of the camera, and did little to mask the poor quality of literature and discussion. All style with no substances. (And while the 1960s are displayed for a lot of time, this 'update' is now also dated, and 'Matrix' style fashions, should 'girl power' scenes, and under the tension of secrecy between two living leads.
