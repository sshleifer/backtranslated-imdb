Omen IV (1991) was the worst-to-T.V. movie. Since 80 years have ended, I think the executives tried meth (election medicine during the 90's) because there is no other reason to explain this efficiency. Why were they surprised to do this? T.v. movie? What did they remind you when this came to the mind board? What? They even think for a second that this movie would be infected like. Maybe you thought it could do it as a series? We can't know. But I know one thing. This movie was the main reason which I could not buy the trilogy of Omen. They should have hit several bucks instead of putting out this "disk". Omen IV is basically a reference to the American family of the first film. Instead of a baby snot nosed punk, we find a spiritual girl who is a total brat for everyone around him. If the family had a strong reproductive skill, then no demonic events that occurred in previous films have never occurred. These parents need to keep their feet down and make a real discipline! <br /> <br /> Not recommended, better to avoid at all costs!
