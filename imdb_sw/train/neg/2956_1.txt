Why did He think? File: Whoopi Goldberg with a soldier in the future who lives with a dinosaur talking (!) For a criminal case involving a man who wants to start another ice age. The wrongness of the tape is embarrassing and uncomfortable, the top concept in the search itself. Apparently this was the work of love for its director-author, Jonathan Betuel (who also served as one of the producers); sadly, the end result is anemic, being charitable. The only presence of Goldberg on the screens often can attract love and laughter regardless of how poor the script, but here he looks and you can see unpleasant results. NO STARS from ****
