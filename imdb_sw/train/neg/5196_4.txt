Although it is more polished than technology than the original film in the series, BULLDOG DRUMMOND ESCAPES, this is a weak riot in both the plot that is less exciting and the leading man who just don't have a charisma Ray Milland. It said, several actors and characters continue in their roles and manage to set the flag to fly. Also John Barrymore is a giant, passing through all through the film in various forms of hide. Yet it is another endless night for BD if he and his partners chase around trying to save the poor girl he hopes to marry. Symptoms are ignorant but often actors help them have fun.
