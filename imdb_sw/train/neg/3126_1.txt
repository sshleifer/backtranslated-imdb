Mr. VanHook took a good idea and laughed as soccer. Unfortunately, it did not make the goal. The historical lesson of giants is good, but pour it into goon milk and finish with a big cheese wheel. I say, make this wheel of reel and turn it on the rock. I couldn't even watch the entire film. That says a lot because I rarely goes away from any movie. I always love the opportunity of last minute redemption. It is impossible to redeem this thing. In fact, at least acting was good .... NOT! <br /> <br /> The only thing "fall" in this film is rating. 1/10 and enter the wrong number!
