Let's see, here is the "highlights" of the Brain Machine: 15 set up the shots of the pool and the house; Set up the shots of the nondescript office building; 5 count for the bland mechanic; 7 close-ups of terrible guards; and thousands of grandfathers of technology show us this is a top-tech attempt. Different banners have said about the difference between the 1972 copyright date and the release date released in the DVD of 1977. That is easy to explain. This dog is sitting on a shelf for five years, until someone breaks it, thinking it is well suited to the post-Watergate state of mistrust. Having seen the Brain Machine now, my only wonder is that it is completely released at all times!
