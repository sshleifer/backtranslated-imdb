Now in fact, the story of very weak - for the Walt Disney film all his litter. When the robinson appeared, all the movies around the place, I was exhausted how poor they were. It's like "alice in wonderland" is lost! It feels like they were short on some of the mashed garbage ideas together and try and get away with - and don't. After that, I sat there wanting to end. My younger brother lost half the way and was confused with the story. The characters are weak and after the robinsons appear to care about the end, you want the film just to finish. Her film to forget, and forget it quickly. If you have time to spare, don't waste this.
