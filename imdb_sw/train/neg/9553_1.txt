Not surprisingly this was released directly to the DVD here in Australia, there are no items to redeem. Talk was hokey, acting, evil with a hit script! Anyone thinks it would be a good idea to do good or follow up to the best movie of John Badham, Wargames from 80 years, well should be on something because it was a bad idea !! Amanda Walsh was as good as eye-eye candy / love, while Matt Lanter was as good as another great-way direction is about it. I would recommend Wargames: The Dead Code for anyone, see hackers or previous Wargames film - all is better than this piece of crap!
