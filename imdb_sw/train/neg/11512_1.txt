*** EFFECTS! SPOILERS IN WINNERS! *** <br /> <br /> This is looking for half autobiographical on what might happen to Madonna if she had ever been stranded on an abandoned island. There is no challenge for Madonna in this role, and it shows. She is just Madonna who plays Madonna, and can't even get that right. I know what you say, you say, "How do you know that this is Madonna is true, you have never met him!" Correct, I don't, but we all remember "Truth or Claim", aren't we? I know Kevin Costner does. You can think, in 2002, that Madonna can learn something, one way or another, from women of "crossover" who have also crossed the currency currency. Well, do you? Madonna has not received "Glitter"? Mariah Carey showed the world of film WHAT TO DO !!! Mariah strikes Madonna's fabric for the beauty of beauty, talent, presence of screens, charisma, reputation, calling it a name! All we see from this picture of Madonna's world is the only one. If there is one thing to say to Madonna, it's that she is consistent. When he was a MTV partner, he set the world of women's fashion behind 20 years. Now, in the film, he has placed women's role in film and society after 20 years, by stimulating all the hateful, accessible, non-tempered, women they have been claiming to be locked in them, the qualities that they have been trying so hard to prove in fact they do not. <br /> <br /> *** HERE ANYWHERE !!! Do not read anything more if you don't want to know ... *** <br /> <br /> Here is one good thing I will say about this film, and I was attracted to it. They did not go to "Hollywood Ending" - the attitude of Madonna alive. Typically, when Hollywood was over, Madonna's behavior would have been dead on the island, and her tolerant, oppressed, whipped man would be free and eventually sit down with a beautiful, dignified woman, who would be the opposite of his dead wife, and all both live happily every time. But in this crushing conclusion, he is saved, and once again, a good husband's husband is bound once again with his wife's wife, and her life will no longer be a living hell. > *** HERE IN ASAJI ***
