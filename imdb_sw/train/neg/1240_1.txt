I think everyone is completely broken with this sci-fi flick. For one thing, it was led by Tim Burton. Another thing, it's remake of what is supposed to be classic. I saw it boring, total, and ignorant. If you have seen it, you know what I'm saying. Almost everyone in Imdb says it is decorate with a boy, it's okay! If you don't, avoid it. It's snorer. 1 out of 10.
