I lost this movie today thinking it could be a good soccer movie, since I am a football player. Boy, I was not wrong. This movie is also a religious way to preach and is really untrue. This very beautiful movie says that if your Christian can find anything you want in life with ease, as being a football player! You can't be a football player for being a Christian and praying to God, you do it through practice and hard work. All you do is to pray to God and He will give you anything .... hire. That's not quite true, duh. I laughed several times because of this shame. The only interesting part was when they were ignorant (Shultz painter? No, dude crossing the Atlantic, etc. etc.) but this film was not very good. I don't recommend, especially if you're not a Christian, lol.
