I am very pleased with Lon Chaney, but to write the screen of this movie did not work for you. The story jumps around (I have learned since the film is not part), and the characters appear and disappear suddenly of offensive. Some of the headlines are good details (for example, "why, you're not a child again!" - cut back to pictures with a long stroke, slowly - "you are a woman!" Yes, we got it first time) A guide to talking which asks for information that has never been seen. (Let's listen to Luigi and his girlfriend's argument, please!) The program, which includes skillful desires (for example if not technically) was confused with the fact that it was difficult to check. On the author's loan, this issue was presented as a problem, and the May-December match was not shown as appropriate and beautiful Mary Pickford's films (e.g., "Daddy-Long-Legs"). Chaney gives a good performance, as usual, but I think she has been better targeted - managed a few times here, IMHO. I enjoyed a series of clown, and I was very interested in stunts. Loretta Young was beautiful, though she was too young. The film has its time, but so far, it is my image below Chaney.
