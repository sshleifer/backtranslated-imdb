What? This is a stupid movie? You bet! I couldn't find any time in this film which was interesting or scary. When stupid? Much. Stupid characters? You are a bet. Side effects? Everywhere! Rick Baker may have gone and done great things and good, this is not one of them. Oh well people gotta start somewhere. Dr. Ted Nelson is cheese. She is a whiny doctor I have ever seen. He has a man who is running away from Ventura County somewhere, he is not happy that his wife is pregnant (perhaps causing him 55 years and weighs 90 lbs) and no crackers found anywhere. Plus she has generally not-too help on blocking her wanting to get the astronaut Steve. And the local sheriff wants to know what is going on even if Mr. Nelson can't tell him anything. There are also some random characters who are beaten to a good level who meet with a melted person. Finally the movie approaches and out of the monster available on the garbage capacity to be fertilized. At the end it is only you need for a large part of MST.
