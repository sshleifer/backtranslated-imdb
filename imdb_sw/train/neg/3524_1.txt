This is one of the worst episodes of the film I have seen for a long time. It's too bad, that I don't know where to start, or even if it's worth it. The plan is a real problem, and I feel sorry for 'Sly' if it keeps good performance for its part. But that plot ... Oh dear oh dear. I especially love the way around the end can pop from the foot of the mountain to the top, while helicopters are on the way. Growing for a day or two take him every five minutes! I could continue: but it's not worth. In addition to the worst opening (which even five years could predict the consequences of) others are drivel. Sorry people, but this is about as bad as the film receives.
