Ok, where do we start with this small gem? Mutant Slugs begin to take over the small of New England (?). Only one person can stop them ... and that person ... is Mike Brady! Now, if that wasn't enough, keep looking. <br /> <br /> Images of slugs are what is known as stock photos. Regardless of the attacks of slugs or where, shoot one of the slugs holes around the place shown. Remember, this special shot takes at least half a movie. <br /> <br /> Acting in the movie hit down, drag out, steal your wallet, call your girl, kill your dog, BAD. I am sure there is much worse, but you will be very hard to find it. The only Gem was ... you discovered .... MIKE BRADY! He must have taken several night classes in YMCA, because he was the best in the group. <br /> <br /> As for fear? This film should not be taken seriously. No worries! They are slugs to cry loudly. The whole stages of growing can be avoided by a shaker or two salt. Just watch this film in MST3K mode, otherwise I can see the greatest damage to the brain.
