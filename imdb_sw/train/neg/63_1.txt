Holy string. This was a very bad film I had seen for a long time. All exhibitions are good, but no plot. True! No plot! The clowns group is talking about this and that is your film. Robert Duvall's candidate is a senile and continues to ask the same people the same witnesses. This gets him a direct answer. I am sure that this film reached up to six because people think they should love it. The most beautiful performances with the most famous and well-seen actors, but the real work is the real steam turd. Maybe, maybe that's a little deception since steam comes from a clean bunch looks like something going on and in this movie HAPPENS! Sack
