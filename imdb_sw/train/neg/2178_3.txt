I would like to enjoy this little more film has never been for Jason (Herb) Evers regularly connect the attempt. Most of the early Saba Samurai viewers accused Toshiro Mifune of failure. However, as more and more critics have found that the film saw it done deliberately. Jason Evers is clearly not Toshiro Mifune, and his failure is exactly the same. <br /> <br /> Most of the participants in B classic were best actors, under Evers and showgirls. If you are watching this film, you would have seen Evers shouting around each line, that's until he smoked and smoked his nose. <br /> <br /> Special effects were for courses in B movie like this. Considering, there is not much that appears in my mind as fantastically good or bad for this movie.
