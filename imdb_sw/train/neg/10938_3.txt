I did not have many expectations for entering this, but I have come to despair. This was my little Halestorm production which I have seen. I thought it should be comedy, but I just snickered at 3 or 4 jokes. Is it really a gag to see someone eating fat and falling constantly? What was the caregiver in Heaven? Fred Willar has been a collaborator and some of his partnership with Christopher Guest, but this has not worked. They should have spent all the budget for getting "known" executives appear in this because there was no budget lighting. It seemed to have been done with a video camera and many events were very dark. Does it really take a great film to show someone really shooting and making a basket, as opposed to cutting and editing the ball around it? I don't try to get worse for the bottom budget comedies, but if you want to see something extraordinary go to the real basketball game of the Church instead of this film.
