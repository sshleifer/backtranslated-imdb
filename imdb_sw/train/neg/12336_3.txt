I offer this five out of 10. All five points are Hendrix who offers a very good set of devices for his last day. Unfortunately the camera quality works and editing looks amazing! We have many Hendrix face bullets where he could do anything, taking money maybe? We don't see his hands on the guitar which is sure! Also we are given many shots of Hendrix from behind? There seems to have three cameras on Hendrix, but the foolish fools do all the work. The boy in front of Hendrix seems to be interested in walking his direction on the steps such as Hendrix on the guitar is simply crowded. While the back guy is attracting around in a few chicks in the mall than writing the amazing memory of the guitar work that comes out of the amps (sound recording is a good thanks to Wally Heider) Interspersed on the tracks are clips of lost pupils protest against Vietnam etc. of songs like Gun Gun, complete the desired film! If Hendrix lived even two more years Berkeley is one of the most unlikely events of the day until the official release of the official. One gem that has contain it is wonderful Johnny B Good but both in a beautiful visual document of a poor person and inferior to both Woodstock and Wight's Isle
