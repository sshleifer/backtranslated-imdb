This movie was a very bad movie made on the planet, I would like BARNEY more than this film. Photos of the film, half the film is animation, deaths of deaths, and above all, I was ready to announce the people who made this film! SEARCH FOR HOURS OF YOUR LIFE TO MAKE THE MOVIE. The only good part was when the film was on! This movie is 50 percent Jurassic park, 1 percent. Sabretooth, and 49.9 percent DUMB! Please do not waste your time watching this film, you will be disappointed. Want to know why this film comes? Well, the pan was hit, the graphics were beaten, the blood looked (i mean it) ketchup, people tried to clap, college students think there is all and they can stand for the animal. I mean, there was a 5 ft tiger running directly to a woman, she gives us a spear from 100 ft away! How can you do HIT IT! Acting was awesome too. Jurrasic Park is really a good movie, and this had to go and destroy it.
