"The 40-year-old girl" is in a world that I do not understand. The world where an electric shop owner can tell his master "f *** off" and advertise his asses videos in the shop and not available. The world where it's really funny to go drunk and smash in other people's cars. The world where it seems to be similar to the master of his attacking sex. The world is full of strong and reluctant tolerance of the minority of the tribe. And the world without any joke! I am totally disgusted by the musicians who seem to love this movie. I thought every scene was like a bad Saturday Saturday - not very funny to start, and put out all of the wise ideas. The case of chesting went further. Anime / Offline, aside from Carell, had the same information. And the romantic features were made entirely, especially where the Keener finds porn in Carell's apartment. That was just blind. And I have also found a series of "Aquarius" completely misleading and full. I hated hate to hate this movie!
