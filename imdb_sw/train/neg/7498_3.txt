Spike Lee has been in decline since its early success and this mess is not worth anything to help. I looked at me many times with the hope of a movie when it was over or reaching the stage. The first movie of the cast-white Lee is a great disappointment. <br /> <br /> What's the point? They Italian swear and as a funky sex, but not for their wives? If I wanted to see Scorsese, I'd go to Scorsese movie. The most powerful Godfather character adds only to discrimination. I have enjoyed several of Lee's films, especially "Do Something Right". This movie is a waste of time.
