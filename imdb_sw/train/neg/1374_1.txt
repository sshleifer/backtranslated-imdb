Man, this was hilarious. It should be under COMEDY. Or STUPID. It would have made you realize what a bunch of stank was very easy. Seriously? I want anyone associated with this film to be beaten, efficiently. For everyone who thinks to watch this "film", let's go over several points of the plot. Oh Wait. Nothing. There is really no plot. I think Casper Van Dien was bored, and decided to film something with some random, and with a miracle, somehow got a videotape. This movie is the worst movie of all time. Don't you believe? Go look. Doing so, man. I'm afraid of you. But be ready to beat your eyes out. If you can stay this way without hitting the cow, you are very strong and confident.
