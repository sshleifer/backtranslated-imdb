If you liked "Blair and" you would like this. It has the same function of the camera and voice function, and has a wrong plot and time to insist. It also has Tom Savini, so if you like "Dawn of the dead" of Romero or Tarantino and Rodriguez. He is an icon and a very good actor too. <br /> <br /> No, for weight. This movie is definitely a very popular movie I have seen for a long time, and I have seen quite a few movies - too bad. I can tell you that I have many movies of entertainment in some way, but this was just a waste of time. The only reason I made this film 2 instead of 1, was the honeycombs and the hot action with all the bright plastic teeth ... No, I'm just a boy. I must have missed before knocking "submit" on the vote form. Stay away, even though it has sexy girls with teeth on the lid!
