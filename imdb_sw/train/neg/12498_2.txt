This film has a very good kernel story. The work of the men and women of the Coast Guard, especially in the North Pacific, is a matter of heroes and stories. This film is facing a good story with the third end (no satisfactory), a vicious and trivial struggle of bar and two "romantic" relationships that look like fire. Scenes of the rescue are good - even if the computer generation is hokey and incompetent events - but the backstory is crippled and desperate. The cost is good - especially his hand does (see). Ashton Kutcher is flat but not terrible. The main female characters are directly. The best woman is one of the coastal beach coast in the rescue station and is in the camera for two minutes in the entire film. It can be the best film - and Costner requires one!
