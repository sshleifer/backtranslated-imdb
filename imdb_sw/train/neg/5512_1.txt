Keep the DVD of this flick in the capsule of the time, and it will definitely show for future generations a complete model of one that allows a small rating to 1 to 10-star rating. Bill Cosby and Ray Romano have been on - in ratings and tens of millions in annual revenues - along with television series'. However everyone was not successful in large screen offerings. This has also been true for other TV people - perhaps because many stories presented for two hours or so seem to be more suitable for a 10-minute or more skit, 22 minutes or 23 minutes of a minute-hour clock. <br /> <br /> This film, however, does not have one feature that will ensure two or three minutes on MAD TV, SNL, or anywhere else on screen or action. <br /> <br /> The start date is listed in 2002, but the release date - on DVD alone - is shown in 2004. It also took place shortly before the death of Rodney Dangerfield, so its single redemption value is that is offered to rent one hundred thousand dollars for its owners. I've never heard of it, but I got time to turn on my set, and I really was attracted to it. Other films are so bad that they have a high level of reverse - too bad that you can move back to 9 or 10. "The 9th outdoor program" is the best example - and Bruce Jenner / Village People Defining, "Can't Stop Music , "is another. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately this flick is located around a short time even there. Even though Rodney's original work (with some of his fellow members) was not available with "Citizen Kane" or "Casablanca," there was a lot of time for humor and a story that gave at least the interest. > <br /> Unfortunately, this theme does not seem to have one or two minutes of such material.
