I'm not from America and I know what 'Wife' wife is. When the show came out of that name I was delighted to see a short time of sexuality from the app. But what I found was the true ignorance of exploitation. I was abused by the title of the head, no adult content, no dirt, even dirty talk (stolen for a long time throwing the Hallmark center and I think they edited / discussed out the contents to make it better). The edition that gives a picture of the current family of the American / western family, the most scarce people, black youth, and their young people to exploit. In each of its two parts / two (more precisely) they were chosen to live in each other at home and re-share the family regularly with their new administration. Sometimes it changes to good or worse. In the last part every mother is brought by her husband and attempts to accomplish what they have done every day for the family. It is part of the breastfeeding program that each competitor fights their rights. I was fascinated by all of this rather than seeing the positive aspects of adult sexuality. I mean who is making this plan, more than the one who gave the name "Transforming Wife"; it is best called "Mother of Change". All in all distorts all the things that have a real wife of the wife stands! Converting Wife = Average Achievement Achievements.
