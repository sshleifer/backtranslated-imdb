Vic (Richard Dreyfuss) is the master of the attack, leaving the mental institution, returning to his world of bandits. How can the director be thrown by Richard Dreyfuss, Ellen Barkin, Jeff Goldblum, Diane Lane (very good), Gabriel Byrne, Gregory Hines, Kyle MacLachlan, Burt Reynolds, Billy Idol and waste time? This film is a comedy that is not pleasant, with stars in cast. My vote is four. Title (Brazil): 'Prazer em Matar-te!' ('Love to kill you!') <br /> <br />
