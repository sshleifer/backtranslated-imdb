You all know the story of "Hamlet". I do. Well, the phrase "that is or not" words (not the speech itself) has been struck down many times that are not very interesting (in fact, not bigger to start with). In fact, I find "Hamlet" a nice but very great game. None of the best Shakespeare: "Julius Caesar" and "Romeo & Juliet" are ten times better, and "The Nightmare of Midsummer Night" and "Othello" is not too back. "Macbeth (knock your table, away from its makers, puck will make corrections, OW!)" It's not bad either. There are many more who are better than this with Shakespeare. I'm not going to comment too much on the film, rather than distributing the MST3K part of the most horrible. OK. . . Mike and Bots win the card game, get the movie pick. . . they ask "Hamlet", Pearl sends this, yadda yadda yadda. . . and to prepare for the most powerful Sci-Fi MST3K section (of course, I haven't seen any of the CC). When "D Children's Blood" makes a comment that the horrible situation, being not a real movie, instead of randomly, printed-together (I remind you of the Mike line from "Future War": "Maybe this is anthology of short movies, non-conspiracy "), SOL Made lots of good cracks. Can't say right here. <br /> <br /> Posts fall flat, military groups (usually) more suitable, and when the movie itself (which is not bad) is actually BETTER (I mean, like the best movie, not like camping, like "Prince of Space ") than the MST3K version, you know the show must be bad. I laughed (last time I noticed it was several months ago), oh, maybe eight or nine times. I tried and tried AND BEING good - but I just can't. It's just a regular line, as "Mr. Boss of Queen Dilbert!" (and at that time is the funniest line of that period, well, ahem) - and sometimes, I mean every ten minutes or so-maybe I even beat. The second time I tried to look at it, I didn't even try to laugh at a few jokes I had got funny before, leaving just forty minutes before. <br /> <br /> Movie is not bad; it's just the German version of Hamlet. Vendors are enough, and although dubbing is not much bigger, that's not the reason to hate this film. <br /> <br /> Four stars for "Hamlet"; THREE, that's three for MST3K version. <br /> <br /> PS: Why, MST3K!
