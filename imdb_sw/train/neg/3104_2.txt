I have done a few reviews on IMD and this film is unique because I haven't seen the whole film. It was so stupid and unwanted that I could just sit this way - though I tried it. The main problem of this with any movie Mel Brooks will call "Mel quotient". In other words, its best movie, under it you can see in the film. Think about it - Manufacturers and Young Frankenstein were good movies and was very difficult in them. But, films like Life Stinks and Space Balls are full of Mel and are good movies (yes, I wasn't like space balls - but this is not a place to talk about). <br /> <br /> Second, away from cancer, rectal and retarding of the mind, I can imagine a subject less funny than housing. This is just a refugee of comedy. Think about it, people. Status of FUNNIEST (?) In the movie Mel has whoopee and Leslie Ann Warren at dumpster !! And this is funny in what way?
