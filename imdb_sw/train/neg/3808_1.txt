WARNING! This review will show the end of the film, "Scoop." If you don't want to know how the film is approaching, do not read this review! "Scoop" is bad to think "Annie Hall" was powerful. It gets one star because you see the naked chest of Hugh Jackman. That's the only thing "Scoop" is going for it. Woody Allen's misogyny, and its fixation on young women enough, at the moment, being his grandson, has caused any ability to make movies can have been at any time. The plan seems to be promising: the spirit, Ian McShane, guides the headman, Scarlett Johansson, to investigate whether or not the English Lord, Hugh Jackman, not the famous Tarot Card of prostitution. Witch, Woody Allen, helps the girl. <br /> <br /> Of course promising, the movie is not quite good charm, or humor, or atmosphere. It is an amazing effort, an amateur effort for someone who has done even one film, never think of several. Allen may have had a stroke that has gone against the media. Many are being done by the fact that unlike its previous films, Woody Allen, who is now a Septuagenarian, has already allowed a young man to lead a girl. <br /> <br /> Not so. In fact, the plot is being built in such a way that the girl does not get someone. There is an early location where Johansson, because there is no film basis, allows himself to be laid, and built, with a strong, old director. "Release" is a conflict of what is happening. It's "slam, bam, I need to go" kind of time. It has no connection with any plot, and eliminates Johansson in the eye of the viewer. Why did Allen add an unnecessary location to the movie? Because it shows a strong director - like Allen - to have sex with female leadership. Allen gets her cake and eat, too. <br /> <br /> Johansson is not yet an actor. She does not know how to order the screen except to wear up, less cutting up. Follows Allen in several instances, and that looks just wonderful and sad. It does not benefit that his character is written as a doll who cannot work without a spirit, or an old man and under a good witch, tell him what to do all the time. <br /> <br /> She is close to half a half of Jackman, and she comes as a great presence of screens on their photos together. <br /> <br /> Members of the audience who disagree with the breast deserve better in their heroes, and Jackman deserves to be better, too - a script that offers some heroine intelligence and organization, and an actor who can convey those qualities. <br /> <br> Hugh Jackman is similar to being deceived by the script. Allen seems unable to stand that Jackman is very good and beautiful, and so gives Jackman anything to say or do. As Johansson, it is used only for its good. This is a shame, because, as Jackman has shown in any number of production, from "Oklahoma" and "X Men," he can act. <br /> <br /> Here is a great twist program - Jackman, suave, charming English Lord, really a killer. So, although the movies says it's about letting someone else, except Allen, find a girl, they don't have anyone. Jackman, a man who has been loving love, is a man who killed a prostitute. Good, Woody. The best way to punish your heroine is not more than your touch. Allen refuses his heroine of his own presence, too, to kill her character, a witch, and stop Scarlett Johansson all alone at the end of the film. Remember the last: in my investigation, not one member of the audience laughing at any time during the film. Always a bad sign when the film is announced as a comedy.
