How an experienced director of Altman can expect us to want to spend time with, or take care of what is happening, a leadership character who is neurotic, whiner, jerk without the characteristics of redemption - that's the main puzzle about this very frustrating work. A large piece of garbage. In addition to this respiratory error, the plot line requires a large collection to follow. Establishing that the behavior of Branagh goes into it is definitely starting from the beginning that we have been involved in questioning whether the author and director lost respect for their audience. This last issue is the basis of the film: it represents independent freedom for the very contempt of taste, values, and minder's view. Very common to Mr. Altman. Patrick Watson
