I rented this on the DVD and I feel bad since Dawson and Lugacy are struggling with a DVD view. It is not a very bad movie, but it is one of those films that are needed to be a detailed view of human nature without realizing that its story is a common form. Plus, it's very simple on the issue in many ways, and the behavior of the characters often affects faith. I would like to say his movie that you would like to find something out if you do not have many movies / TV / documentation / life behind you (be honest, I found almost the same story similar to even awesome comics). Otherwise, its action has been done before and more with skill. And that's facing great trouble, which is true that it doesn't have a lot of cinema interest so instead of sure. It is coming to be a bland's general film that enables everything in the idea that the basic story will be surprising and compelling, and does not really pay.
