This film is a new effort to Stephanie Beaton and its new production company. Although it faces a few problems, as every low budget production makes, it is a good start for Mrs. Beaton and her company. The story is not very new made in the film like Burning and every Friday on 13th since 2nd. But, these displays come from the heart. Many of the major budget films have been on the way, and it's always good to see executives trying to destroy their tricks. The story deals with murder (and possible return) of the child who gave birth. Others have made a secret, but the problem of the event sends everyone in different ways in their lives. Ten years later, friends are killed directly by the terrible stalker known as "The Bagman". Who will live? You have to watch. <br /> <br /> If you are Roger Ebert or any number of critics, you may not worry. But if your taste runs more towards Joe Bob Briggs and you want to see a group of people respecting their trick, then look at "Bagman".
