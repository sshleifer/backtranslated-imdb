Flick the flick of a guy who wants a girl, a guy who lies to get closer to a girl, a husband who will find the best friend to help in a tragic way (comedus reliefus, no?) Help cheat a girl, etc. This has been done with death, and with special discrimination A few slots publications, done well. <br /> <br /> The stale approach aside, heads are interesting and there is a good time. Jonathon Schaech has done a better job, and his acting here was about to make a phone call. It's not a perfect waste, but nothing new here in this scenario.
