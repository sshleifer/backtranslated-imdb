I have indeed seen bad movies in my life, but this was very bad I was really angry at the theater. I wanted my money to return. I wrote to the director requesting him to return my film ticket, of course I did not receive a refund (or even answer) but it is something that is appropriate. At the rate of 1-10 I give this film -42. Why "Jeep" (Chevy Blazer ??) stop running from hit by bat? Why voted "Jeep" (Chevy Blazer ?????) and bat in the first place instead of cutting the bum skull? The plan was narrow, a full-blown movie, and some parts of it did not make any sense.
