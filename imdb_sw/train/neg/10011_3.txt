This film is about escorting men to take part in the investigation of the deaths that occurred in the wake of the women's powerful men. I thought "Walker" would be exciting and engaging, but I wasn't right. Stimulating it is bitter and very fast, even after 40 minutes of film nothing happens too much. By and large, the first hour can be closed for ten minutes. That's slow. The fact that you have no fans or works of work increases weight. It's almost surprising that even the move scenes are clear and without feeling. Maybe it is because of the upper lip of a high social class? It is regrettable that "Walker" becomes a boring aggressive, despite a strong cast. Blaming on poor plot and worse pacing.
