There was no original idea in this story. Themes were deleted from various sources; Few are the Fourth Gate, In the mouth of the Mad (another film of Isremala), and Gonga. It even went away and had a glittering circle of damn from Pete and used it as a name of the film. The voice of Cody Carpenter was planted from Suspiria. Hope no one will oppose this opinion by hitting the word HOMAGE around. Yes, I noticed that the theater was playing Argento's Deep Red. Claiming cult would have coppy out. This was down-to-barrel. Throw pictures and "disturbing" pictures inside the pot does not make a good film awesome. Karemala used to know that. He should get lost in access or access the time machine.
