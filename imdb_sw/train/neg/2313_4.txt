Shintar√¥ Katsu got tons of popularity playing a strange character, Zatoichi. Zatoichi film had a strange and unpredictable concept - a blind young man is the largest planner in Japan and uses every movie to make a mistake and resist the penalty for the perpetrators. He is a good player and the movie is exciting and addictive (I have seen every movie). It was because of this I saw the final phase of the series of Hanzo's Razor, as I thought it would be the same .... and the boy I had missed! It shows that Hanzo films are very sex-oriented and they also encourage rape of "eligible women". You see, Hanzo is a police from Mayji and they take the women often and question them with severely disturbing and "iron penetration". How his member became strong is something you should see to believe, but certainly not to squeamish. Overall, I can only recommend anyone who sees these violent and negative movies. However, thanks to other views, I see that it is still very popular ... and that's very good. With some of the incredible anti-fighting events, the film is just like brain pollution - and I would like to think how films can contribute to violence towards women.
