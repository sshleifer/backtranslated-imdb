I have seen many flicking moments of all my time, all of them are very bad, but there is not even the depth of what this piece of trash is coming to. This film made me angry and angry as I watched it as I tried to stretch my head around what this film was about. Now, after seeing it, I understand - what kind of what was going on and why, but the film itself is just too much fun to look at. Yes, there are cultural instances of freedom of violence, some of them that show understanding of the minds of its characters ("The main way is my ... ME!"), And enough weakness to keep us from "conspiracy", but it will still leave feeling this film alone and was taken advantageous, like a puppy who would no longer want to be left in the box on the side of the road.
