I remember watching BSG experiments. I can explain that night exactly. I remember what I was sitting on. The view was magic. It came alive. I enjoyed the first two years of BSG. I enjoyed the third part of the year, and I looked every part of the fourth year, quite honestly in the great hope that somehow it would turn out. Indeed, you didn't. I watched the Caprica experiment and I enjoyed it. There was hope for something good here. Then I started looking at regular intervals, and getting more and more. It is very clear, too unpredictable. It reminds me of the political political accuracy of its final failure, Truth. Most of his work on the DS9 was good. While considering BSG in a planned way, it was good. This was actually really early when they more or less follow the example of episodes set by BSG series first. When they left there after meeting with Admiral Cain and Pegasus, they all went to the pot. It was like he wrote all the parts of the show without knowing where he was going. Maybe it will improve. Maybe it was just a few of the original events. But I am very, very scared.
