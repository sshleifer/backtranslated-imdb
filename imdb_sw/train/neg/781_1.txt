This version was awesome. For George one is not funny, and his children are brobby little brats. She also treats her mother with disrespect. Like Spain, I miss so much with this show and how characters are displayed. It is something that does not work. At once, I want to see something original. What makes this show funny when other shows have done several times? I thought ABC would have his feelings and smoked this piece of rubbish, but sadly, we will need this stomach until "fly shark". In my opinion, they have already done.
