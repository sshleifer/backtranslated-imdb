Is it unfortunate that Orca took place two years after Jaws? Orca is not particularly "dirty crack" but it is obvious that it tried to benefit from the success of Jaws. First of all Orca in my opinion was a bad movie, not terrible but really not good, average for the best. The plan is silent whale (orca) after seeing his partner and his unborn calf was killed and the fisherman wants to take revenge. I couldn't stand watching this film again. The trend of this film is poor and compared to Jaws looks like a director, producers, and writers were almost unable to. <br /> <br /> As for acting, it was very moderate and believed, however real characters are not too small. The effects were appropriate for his time and the images of the whale were seen good. Violence is confused, losing blood, and is not recommended for the most intelligent people. Music has passed and loud sounds, turn off sound effects and pull another time. I hated the way of spreading the whales of the whales (the whales are not just one male and one as shown in Orca). In general this movie was bad / bad in my opinion, because of the reasons mentioned above. Some people may know this film more because of the concept of revenge between animals and humans so I can't move this movie and I can understand why other people might like it. <br /> <br /> My rating: 3.5 / 10 (but for its possible concept 5/10)
