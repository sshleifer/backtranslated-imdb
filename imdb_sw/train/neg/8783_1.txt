I don't think I have been so much entangled with the great deviation of the film throughout my life as I was leaving this piece. RIGHTS in it makes any sense. no one is clever or thinks well. due to the lack of truly amazing time it often uses the general trick of the mistake where it creates the music before the character do something like opening the door or push aside the curtain and then nothing there. That's right to do once, maybe, but I've been counted three times. there are things that were struck because no clear, characters, half-story lines .... characters were not well developed for ALL. The latter is .. bad. bad, bad, bad, everything, every part, of this film is awesome. and I'm here to warn you all of that.
