This basic foundation of the film is a political cartoon. I think for those who do not know about the realities of this army is probably a "good feel" film on gender equality. In fact the latest expert said: "it enables women to know that they can do whatever they want to do." What claptrap! No one, a man or woman can do whatever they want to, and unfortunately Demi Moore "breaks" a SEAL week in Hell in the first week of 27 weeks BUD / S for a few sessions in the local practice and his only desire that SEAL will not just so. There is an average decline in 80 percent in what is known as a military training program - those who voluntarily emerge, cannot compete on physical level, suffer physical injuries during training or cannot handle psychological abuse. I have never been over the humidity of the designated message, required of this film. In the real world, Demi cannot last 24 hours in this physical and permanent training. Only those who want to do so will not do it. Skip this film as a wish you want, and better use your time to read "Elite Warrior" by Dick Couch (Crown, New York 2001) for the best explanation of what's going on in this tutorial. Call alarm, Demi! <br /> <br />
