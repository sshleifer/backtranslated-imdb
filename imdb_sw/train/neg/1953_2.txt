The first part of this new show was today, and it was terrible. Not only Shaggy has a new voice voice that has listened to his line of suffering, but it is far from the original concept and animation style that is not known as 'Scooby-Doo'. Even back in the dark days when Fred and Velma were gone and Scooby's Scrappy nephew was present, the team still solved the secret. This new version replaces Shaggy and Scooby are fighting with James Bond super-villain type and his farmers when they live in a house. There is not even a van called 'The Mystery Machine' (and the teaser of the next section that pledged a robot type of transformer type did not easily mind me). How can someone take Scooby Doo and do this? The scenario gets two stages with two scenarios involving a whole group of Scooby Doo, who all speak with the right voice except Shaggy, and yet I'm very kind.
