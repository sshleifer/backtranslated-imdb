As a 10-year-old, I liked "love conquers all" philosophy of 70s sitcom "Bridget Loves Bernie." I understood the conflict, which was about the sexual problems between the Jewish cab drivers (David Birney) and the Irish Catholic teacher (Meredith Baxter) and all of the parents' sets (Harold J. Stone and Mrs Osterwald as Bernie's parents , Audra Lindley and David Doyle as Bridget's parents who have the marriage issues of female partners. <br /> <br /> Watching the show now and years of personal life experience, I wonder that the show was even successful for one, however, a very planned season. Designed by the former television reporter Bernard Slade, who a few years after the cancellation of the show will write effective play "Time Lapse, Next Year", "Bridget Loves Bernie" was a very light, high comedy that fell under its airy weight. br /> <br /> It did not deny the real life chemistry between Birney and Baxter. But, in later years, all actors have shown that they are the best actors in other projects (Birney in his short term in "St Other" and Baxter in "Family" and "Family Relations"). Here, they were trying to breathe life in a show that needed sharp edge of the comic gritter, which could have more detailed problems with a very controversial issue. The show showed on Saturday night between the CBS electric stations two: "All in the Family" and "Mary Tyler Moore". All of these exhibitions were prudent, surprising and sharp enough (more than the former) which took care of the situation and characters. "Bridget Loves Bernie" was not very smart and had some of the regular chuckles. <br /> <br /> This was another example of a show that really was not as good as I remembered.
