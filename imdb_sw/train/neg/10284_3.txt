After seeing people behind Sun I think I expected the evolution in style & techniques that resemble a large scale of this movie. I was also keen to see someone making a difficult account of the facts based on what happened at this time known by the Japanese, but not so. This resembles a movie in the middle of mid-European Europe of Coconut Experiment from 70s - e.g. SS Experimental SS etc. (perhaps more like Women sent to Special Part). It certainly has the highest scope and many people around it, but it comes into an affordable device that has no innocent actors falling down with the sound of ridiculously artificial weapons, chosen and constantly 'terrible' sequence. The proven facts of the documentation are linked to the events so hackneyed that even these actual images have been stolen from the bulk of their power. Check out the 4th Holocaust Center (recently done), as of 1 No 2006) for a real warranty of war on the battlefield (with the best effectiveness of real video usage). This is the kind of treatment Nanjing fears deserve, not this waste of hackneyed exploitation (the best movie exploitation of better use of the disrespect of stock photography would be good, but again this is not even a good movie exploitation). Rating: 3 (5 as exploitation, 1 as medical subject).
