This movie was awesome. I swear that they did not even write a script they put on all the square out. Ice-T was angry as hell. * SPOILERS Phht more as a reason not to watch * They sit and eat breakfast for 20 minutes. He coulda has been long gone. The soil was hard it would almost be impossible to track with the dog out. And when the ICE-T is on the Hill and it uses the Spaz-15 SHOTGUN attack as a sniper gun (and then reduces the tree with eight beds? It would take a 1000 shell to cut the tree into size.) be correct in 100yards. And they saw meditation. What showed the light? I didn't see the scope on that. Also when he was shot in the stomach and continued, that was lost he could be killed there. PlusThe end where he stuffs rock or cigarette in the guys barrel. It didn't hit and kill him. Bullet still would fire to kill Ice T but destroy the barrel.
