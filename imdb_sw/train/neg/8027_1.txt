I watched this film. Until the end. And that wasn't easy. It's too bad, portrayed bad and almost everything was stolen from the "District District Project" which you can't believe the creators take this big. Even hard to believe, how this "product" has made on VHS and DVD. So, if you want to see a horrible movie, just look "Dial", but if you want to laugh loudly and have a good time, look at some kids riding through trees shouting to each other and showing that they cannot, look at the dark area.
