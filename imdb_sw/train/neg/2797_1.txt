I am a great fan of kind of fear! I LOVE the horror / slasher / gore flicks of all kinds. Some of my favorites are "good" bad terrible flicks. But these movies have NOTHING to assure you to see! I don't want to spend a lot of time talking about everything that is not missing. <br /> <br /> Script is bad. Acting is bad. FX is not even worth discussing. "Put" is absolutely JOKE! Unfortunately I think there might be a real potential in several executives, but this car left them to work with !!! It is worth saying I have seen it for "free" & feel stolen !! When you would like to watch this look would be better to use your cat's cat.
