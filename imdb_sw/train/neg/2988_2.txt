First I enjoyed the Zombi 2 and Lucio Fulci. This film was garbage. I couldn't stand to look at it. The story of the story was a joke, acting was a joke, and the fact that Zombi 3 is not related to Zombi 2 is even more joke. <br /> <br /> Jump from Voodoo to DEATH People BACK TO LIFE. Whatever, this film is not worth $ 1.00 is the cost of rental. I enjoyed lucio fulci movies but this was awesome. If Zombi 3 is an indicator of how Zombi 4 and 5 will think I'm going to laugh. <br /> <br /> Zombi 2 is a wonderful flick.
