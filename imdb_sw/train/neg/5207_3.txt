Anemic comedy-drama, a happy thing, that seemed to fight with Cher as a housewife who makes a little friend and man who is employed to kill her husband. Chazz Palminteri, like a hired gun and talks, changed the screenplay from his own play, with an amazing conversation with the back and forth conversations that quickly blows eyes and ear. The dark wind depends on the whole project, and the director Paul Mazursky can not find Cher out of his constant funk (unknown). Despite all the top talent (including Robert De Niro as one of the producers), "Faithful" is a fraud, without a guarantee of stories and characters who have never lived. * 1/2 from ****
