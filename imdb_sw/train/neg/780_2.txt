Show this is bad. What? How does George need the death of his funny mother? Show this is awesome. Parents are very obvious and children should be taken care of children. The daughter is a witch with a b and a child is a perfect brat. George is not funny, especially when he says his great and awesome brand of Spanglish. Ernie is a failure, but at least I have been beaten several times, but to a great extent how interesting. George's mother, Benny, in a rough, despicable attitude. Indeed, her husband has left her, but how anyone can laugh in the way he treated George as a child is more than me. What? Can someone tell me how big George's head is? It's not even big! I have moved from characters because they are so bad and it will take me hours to write to me, in fact, you don't care. I care to tell anyone who looks at this and is surprised if they want to look at this show, or this is an unfavorable excuse for the sitcom, and it's not worth your time. I / I give 2 starts, because the wife is very interested.
