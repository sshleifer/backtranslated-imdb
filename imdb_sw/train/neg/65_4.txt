I have never quite a rating for Girls of Amati and I think I was really kind of giving 4 out of 10. What could be a fantastic story and actually a set of more or less dignitaries to be a farce in my eyes. There are many clich√©s in that flick, women's hair is very bad and most of the events are more unrealistic or fake appearance. There is no real interest in this film but a group of actors on acting on any limits that hurt. Not enough to be a comedy, it's also fake-sad to touch the real, so in my eyes is not just good. Watching that I couldn't believe how something like that on my TV set in my Swiss room. But maybe it was still the same and just lost in the translation? Who knows. Certainly one of the most unusual movies I have ever seen and this is certainly not in a good way! Sorry.
