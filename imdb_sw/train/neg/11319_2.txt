Vampire cyborgs dominate the world and use human blood as oil, however there will be a strong change in thanks to the admin of the amount (Kris Kristofferson) and a brave woman (Kathly Long) fighting Lance Henriksen and Gary Daniels (who play cyborgs in this movie The breach of all the questions left without the response to this terrible film, the poignant is the idea of â€‹â€‹who is to beat the country singer Kris Kristofferson as a cyborg warrior who can give as well as he gets. No, don't make me wrong I could see Kristofferson as a trilateral or something but not like cyborg. Surprisingly one suspect that this was written by Dolph Lundgren, however Lundgren must be wise to do so. However despite being thrown at risk, Kristofferson is more interesting about the movie. He gives more human performance then it's a long time for Kathy Long. (And Kristofferson plays a robot) despite miscasting, Kristofferson offers short-term interest. Henriksen Lance is slumming and Gary Daniels are passing but essentially the knights are fail to fail. You stand back in fear wondering who hell thought this was a good idea on the paper. (This is a movie where Kristofferson is broken by fighting robots in the sanda) The worst of all is approaching if it is good, with this thanks still not yet though I still have a dream of love in the possibility of the event. br /> <br /> * out of 4 (bad)
