Seeing this film, as I did for the first time on the Classic Turner (which lists as "Bad Woman"), can only add your thanks to the 1941 edition of Bogart-Astor. Ricardo Cortez must be paid for a smirk. I hope he remembered the dentist and his businessman Brylcreem in his will; they made him an actor. All women are good, but no better than that. Well, You Merkel is much better. More interesting is the "original" Joel Cairo and Mr. Gutman, who provides the most effective of individuals but not close to the least of their supporters in the roles, Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet. Humphrey Bogart and Mary Astor somehow took important seeds of their characters in remake; here, Sam Spade and Ruth Wonderley (!) can't. <br /> <br /> This movie is not ideal; is there as a piece of ham. Its main value today is as a reminder that good movies like '41 'Falcon' do not just do it. On a scale of 1 to 10 I am measuring 4, especially with camera work and support players.
