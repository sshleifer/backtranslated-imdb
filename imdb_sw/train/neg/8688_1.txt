If the only sex you have ever had with an animal animal, then the line of this film is still cheating. It is one of the most horrible movies I have had the pleasure to try and watch soon. I found a DVD standing next to my friend's house, and I did the sad mistake of not burning. <br /> <br /> I can't explain any details without damaging the movie because there is only 5 notes for this movie. Just try to think a person who makes a film about things on c-span just a false movie is 10 times less attractive than a good discussion on c-span. I think there is a plot somewhere in this movie, but I couldn't understand what I had just hit my eyes and sent them to Richard Gere.
