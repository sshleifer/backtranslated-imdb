For my life I can't understand the blind and dedicated to this movie totally unreliable ...... and I think I have the reputation of saying so .... I am a former soldier of special operation and 14 years "life" ... This movie it was totally impossible and written by a man who made a very small survey in life in the Army, in a fight or in a team or youth level. The three men of EOD focus on Bagdad for themselves? Find Real ... No chain commands ??? Find Real ... EOD cleaning buildings ??? Find Real .... EOD / Investigative Army / Sniper who has a good buck ???? Get Real .... Wait ... Kill me and kill a bad man then let two boys take me without a shot or hurt another? Get Real .... I took the civilian citizen of Iraq, when I had weapons 9 possession, going into another citizen's house, getting punk with his wife then returning to camp on foot in the middle of Bagdad at night without like if beginning or struggle? ?? Get Real ... <br /> <br /> There is absolutely no consideration of the military protocol {Army} and it is not exactly identical to any Army unit that I have encountered. They are generally not believed and do not accept that the men and women of EOD who oppose this poor film are not the wild adrenaline to seek wahoos but highly skilled professionals who work hard.
