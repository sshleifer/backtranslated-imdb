There were tragic events, which I have always loved more than a year, but otherwise this film was too weak. These are too many questions required without answers, and when they tried to explain anything in the film, it was still unknown. After watching this film I still seemed lost in many ways. It's a kind of reminder of Silent Hill a few years ago. The movie was also alive, but it is still better than this because it has tried to work and the story did it well. This, not so much. Acting in most places in the Release was decent, but the film has been caused over, and never gave you any kind of satisfying conclusion. As I said above, there were other strange events, but otherwise, this movie was a mess. Sorry, I can't recommend you.
