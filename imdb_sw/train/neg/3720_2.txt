What? This film is a joke? What is the comedy? Certainly not the most exciting thing? There is no suggestion that there is any deliberate humor, but very rarely acting badly, leading poor, and a terrible script had a loud laughing audience in the cinema. The plan is acceptable - a small artist who just promised to reach the top of the shot died and the killer continues for the wrong. The murderer sees young artists work portfolio he takes and decides to attend his work shows. In the exhibition the murderer meets with the sisters of the sister and they are going to fall in love. It is all very predictable and the end will not be anyone who tries as well as written. The film is especially interesting and near Vienna, Austria, and it shows what a beautiful city. Don't waste your time on this film though, unless you learn how to do, guide or write a film!
