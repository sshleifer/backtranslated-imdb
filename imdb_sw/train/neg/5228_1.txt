I saw this movie the other night. I can't even begin to describe how much this movie is going. Writing, sound of action, even soil. Horror, Horror, Horror. It's like watching 24 hours of C-Span for play. It doesn't just work. It falls fully on every possible place. Also, film animation is too low. I know that this is a film made by one person, but think that he can make a minute of 97 minutes, maybe he could make 1 second to play. <br /> <br /> This show can take a cake for the worst movie all the time. Yikes. It was very bad. If you are looking for a film that will make you laugh, keep it from this disgust. My advice: Don't give it even, or look at it. Your brain will be more than you.
