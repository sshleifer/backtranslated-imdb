This may be a stirring, worse and insignificant film I saw last year. The plan that meant to have some of the elements of philosophy reflected as the worst form of matrix, and a lot of clich√©s: soldiers alone wolves, look good, psychological disturbances, sleeping with his gun ... + a very good worker and shy , but a good scientist, adds 2 plot and you have me, Robot! I was very concerned with clear advertising of products like FedEx, Audi, talking etc. This movie prohibits business and may be more ad ad adventure which unfortunately not end after 30 sec. I can't recommend this to my worst enemy, if you have extra time, check out a good TV program instead or read a good book.
