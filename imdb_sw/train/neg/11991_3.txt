- Bad trophies: this movie is a real trick. Bad stunts for one thing, seemed so fake I thought this was "Twilight Zone". Posts are very suitable. One part of the movie thinks to take out his temper outside the window will make his life better. I want to know the casting director and if he was the principal because acting, even from adults was bad. Chapter kissing in this film also tried. This movie killed the book. The book was good. I am not very interested in this film. Not even for educational purposes. <br /> <br /> - Good Good: I don't know what I can tell the truth. There are some stressed areas that allow you to go, but they have been quickly hit by an unpleasant task and acting. <br /> <br /> - My decision: Don't look at it.
