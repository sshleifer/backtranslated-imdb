The forest is not just a daily slasher / cannibal fares backwoods, also has an impressive mix of common elements as well. The story is about two couples who grow in the forest on a camping trip. The cave cave, wooden planks and the spirits of his deceased wife and two children soon frighten them. There is something you don't see every slasher. Director Don Jones gets a "A" in a bid though the film itself is on a flat almost every level, acting is only a few exception to Jeanette Kelly who plays the dead wife of Woodsman (Michael Brody aka Gary Kent). <Br /> <br /> The movie opens with beautiful shots for the couple's travel through the valley and in the forest. They know very well that someone is stirring them up. Both are sent to the usual price of slasher. Our killer uses a hunting knife in the entire film, except during the flashback when he uses the handsaw tool, the pitch of the shape and the rust to send his girlfriend. <br /> <br /> The forest has a good story line but the movie just doesn't work together and I got it good boring and acting only of crappy. 4/10
