Larsen is in the form of a "Die Hard" complete with singlet and awesome muscles, I'm sure he can do well but he seems to be satisfied with grimace and lose through his part. <br /> <br /> Beautiful Erika is a decoration (even if it is fully dressed!) and shows some signs of "getting" to make the end. <br /> <br /> SFX is actually a poor CGI and steals from other movies. Shooters are sad - they deserve a team of <br /> Never deserve to see Perlman - AVOID
