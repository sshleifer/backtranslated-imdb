There are many negative comments on "Stay away, Joe" here I can just sit quietly and allow this evil to happen. Here's the side you didn't feel yet. Elvis Presley's movies are my pleasure for a simple reason: it's a perfect film for a happy relax because I have to think when I look at them. That means I am not worried about losing a difficult plot because they don't have the correct plot to start with. I can only cut my shoes, grab the beer, sit back, change my brain and enjoy all the total damage and easy tunes to go rock rock numbers from ten years to all over. In my books "Stay away, Joe" definitely falls into "very bad is good" - the group. Now if you are like me and appreciate the "trash value", this is the last experience of the 1960s. At the end you are amazed at all the new levels of ignorance you don't know if you laugh or cry. In short: I love it because it is very amusing that once it was a generation that actually made a film like this. I am still going to give 1 out of 10 though - once it hits down 100 it will be the usual instant movie.
