Franco Rossi of 1985 at the sixth Italian Italian Quo Vadis series is a very curious animal, creating the ancient Roman world of influence in the face of true truth (a few long shots, no big city city), but playing A very low game for ancient literary and historical literature that history always loses back. The turn-around structure (a lot of one place being smitten through a voice on the letter) and a lack of piracy makes a complete six-hour version of what you want and cancel, and certainly often decreases, but it has something going on. The two main forces are characterized by Petronius (the grateful person called Frederic Forrest, whose own voice would have led to his conversation) as a man who had spent a long time looking for a wise way to live a court life that could not be impressed, and Klaus Maria Brandauer take a unique on Nero as a wannabe actor whose every move and action is calculated on how his 'audience' received. Elsewhere, Max Von Sydow appears briefly in a few cases, given the amazing and realistic moving area here he meets a child trying to leave Rome. It is a kind of thing that the show can do and more, but it seems often to flatten all the emotional, impulsive or exciting possibilities under low-key direction. Unfortunately Francesco Quinn makes an unidentified unknown hero, including the walls and coming down under the Roman officer rather than the quiet, uninvited young man who works in one office like you who never said in office associations - you know, who you think is called Dave or something like that. The deficit of the budget is very visible when the encounter with the time of time for Christians and Ursus war and the cow is a very low base that passes over before you just show a sudden loss of interest and suddenly end. It is not a trip I can specify, I am afraid, but if you are in the forefront is one is not completely free of charge.
