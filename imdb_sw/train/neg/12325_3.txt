I remember that show. I still remember that kick kick ass song "American People Funniest." It should certainly contain the name of the bad American or unhappy people or the disgusting people. Dave could not save this show and could not be Bob Saget or the AFV forces that came later. Jackalope groups were few and yes Dave can make the most beautiful sound that was better than Bob. But this show went to hell because of the video videos that were presented. It was also developed as a kind of different display of stars with disability stars including Twins Twins. The AFV Plus was in it a great pre-start catching evil as a newborn as a winner. Did I advertise the videos that were interesting and blurred? But still the theme of the theme is!
