Ivan (Valeri Nikolayev) is a bitter, ignorant journalist who examines without being explained. He travels to this little town where it is said to be a witch (Ita Ever) threatens the community. <br /> Suddenly he returns to the demon and kills him, and the city is wondering who killed the woman ... who I think was a witch but I don't know at all. Ivan is now followed by his spirit, or something, and he needs to have faith, or something, to beat him. <br /> <br /> I hate Christian movies. Often filled with lazy actors, stupid storyline and minimal impact. Not to mention that this is not just a Christian film ... but also a visitor too. The sound actor for Ivan made this film more interesting than awesome, because it is high and itself. You can't miss a lot for missing this film.
