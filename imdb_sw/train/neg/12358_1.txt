Demi Moore's behavior in the film was chosen by SEAL because of its looks. That was a bad start with the movie decreased from there. The plot was not quite possible. The desire to do so in the military unit is not enough. This film does not influence the woman's ability to perform the required tasks. Trying to pretend that women and men are the same as insulting to everyone's mind. What is the difference between sex is what makes life interesting.
