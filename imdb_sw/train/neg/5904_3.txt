With the success of the run of the "Army of God", every Mormon camera appears to try to make a film now. In the recent case "Other Heavens", this is nothing. The film, while not good, was quite good. "Ward Singles", however, is not. Telling the story of a young boy, left by Mormon returned to a special life, the writing and shooting style of "Ward Singles" is, for many ways, similar to the 80's comedy "Ferris Bueller's day. Off ". However, the similarities there end there. While "Ferris Bueller" was an exciting, original, and well-acting (such as stupid comedies like this is all the time), "Ward Singles" is quite the opposite. It tries to be very funny. However, 90 percent of the gags fall flat or are a play and joke that you probably heard a million times before. Some 10% seem to be healed to fill the time. And acting, when it's not bad, it's scary better. Besides, if you don't have Mormon yourself, or too much, known by the Mormon culture, you can't find anything at all. Although "the Army of God" and "Other Heavens" were appealing to various audiences, both inside and outside the Mormon church, this film is very obvious in the inner joke, and even if you find it, it's just not funny.
