When the film is independent and not counted, such as Hamiltons, I expected out of the ordinary, to stop the violence of your heart. I know that good movies are not always bloody and violent, but I read the review, I visited the website, and I assured my friends a few dollars to pay $ 9.50 to see this very bad movie with me. While there is a festival called Horrorfest, I expect fear, not Dawsons Creek and incestuous undertones. My hopes were the lowest of the film, but a few prospects were in the film was shot at the once I saw that the hour had passed before we saw the first drop of blood from a certain finger. There were many holes of the plot and very left for thought. I'm sorry to see the Eyes of Joy. I think there may be more violence and get into the film than Hamiltons!
