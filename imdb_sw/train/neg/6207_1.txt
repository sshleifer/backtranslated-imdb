What this film will do is to call the emotional rape to the viewer. The movie allegedly was caused entirely among critics in Cannes, but for me the last area was just a terrible attempt to the new director to get himself noticed. It is not possible to talk in the discussion on the issue of abuse, drug abuse or the destruction of young people (or any other matter, for that matter). The main character of the main character from good, but the worried boy with a sharp visit is almost unavailable, while the rape area (that is the anti-fraud, the most prevalence of rape scene from "color" The orange clock ") can not consider and I reject the views on its values ​​of beauty. There are other things the artist should not do to achieve his goal. At least in my opinion. Try to close: exciting for violence, violation and not working at your time. See "orange clock" or "Le pianiste" instead.
