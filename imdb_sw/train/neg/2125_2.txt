If I didn't have to watch this for work reasons I have never done it for the first 10 minutes. And yet I admit I quickly sent through a section. The '63 version of the film was bigger for each side. Yes, I've read this is the most loyal to the original play, but it is wise for the author to change the script in '63! Approaching, it is easy, songs in this version and not on the film are boring and unimportant. The "Children" version in the '63 version was very surprising and true for the sarcastic parents' humor. In this version Kim is a very old way, Conrad is * quite awesome * seeing (when someone has finished his shirt away from him I hide for shame ... the director of this version does not know what sexy is.) This conrad cannot speak, can not sing (can not even sit in the tune) and it's just ignore it. If Elvis Presley had been like that his job would have been up before starting. In the case of other actors, well I continued to wait for Alexander to fall as played by Daly worked as a Momma. See Stapleton's performance in the film version to see the role that was well done by someone who understands during comic. This TV version is nothing but a waste of anyone.
