Tobe Hooper has made good movies so I was sure this can't be BAD. I've never read any reviews and tried to try to watch this non-engaging film. Sometimes this made me laugh, sometimes I was about to sleep, sometimes I did close to Hooper. <br /> <br /> I cast this 3/10 vote for its "fear" of 1990 - -movie and many interesting or amazing things happened there. In the movie I had thought of something like "can not ONLY add more items in this film ..." but they did. Some of these say this is some kind of clone of Firestarter but really it's' t. It depends on the idea but that all. This is a mixture of fear, comedy, fantastic religion / stuff of god, funny Gore, easy effects, drama, bad act, fantastic script and more. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * + When a mother asks her child after birth, both husband and wife are burning and it is a SPIRIT. The government sells one thing and lets this child live among other people and ... after years x this child has grown up and knows he is born because and who can burn things with his mind. Then everything may be something that is not credible to define anything and. Well, when the Government recognizes "right now it can put that hot fire to work" they take to a local hospital where it is a strong nuclear poison to use this person. they could kill him, he can't take him away! .. and foot, I think that that enough to tell, I promise there are 100 more amazing things in this movie. Even if you want a good laugh look this. Gosh.
