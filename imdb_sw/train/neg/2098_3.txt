I was hoping for some sort of comprehensive information on Apollo's message 11 and what I found was an interview interview with the best Buzz Aldrin Gene Krantz and other people involved in the mission, linked to the sound of more hyper-predicting sensationalizing - more in bad culture most of the television production. If you can cut a voice-tone and change the change of plan for a good guarantee of how people can overcome obstacles to achieve a common goal then this would be good - but I feel lost 45 minutes of my life while watching The program of 60 minutes. I want back those minutes.
