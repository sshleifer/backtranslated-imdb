I watched this film on the Sneak Preview and I am glad I did not pay. This movie is just disgusting. Its full of dick and fart jokes and is not recommended in the order of action (such as shooting at "Little Germany"). I made a small list of things I enjoyed in the film and much that I did not agree. Dave Foley's penis. 2. Fart joke. The Poop Joke. 4. Dude was pussy. 5. No Gary Coleman. 6. Recognition 7. Also laughs Bush. We are paid for. 8. Dude has red hair. 9. Plot. 10. The murder of 11 children. Be Boll was in it. 12. Many of the cast were just wrong and out there. <br /> <br /> Now (fewer) beautiful <br /> <br /> 1. Dude uses cats as a silencer like in the game. 2. Publish more. 3. Crotchy did return (and came of the postal author) 4. Uhm .. I don't need to pay. 5. There are a few "what time" ef / boll did again. He made another fun game for film success. Kudos to you, Mr Boll. 2/10
