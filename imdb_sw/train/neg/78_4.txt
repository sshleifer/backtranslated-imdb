The worst of mice and killaby was with me and certainly did not have any relationship with the story ... It's something that I would do my first year at the film school. Very sad. Additionally, the story seems to be because there is no clear ... there were just a lot of things there that was not connected to the story, which makes it feel that the creative team doesn't know what they were doing, or just that it should be short. .. which would be a blessing, not a crime. Since I just checked all the pieces so far for the last week ... I would like to say that this was so bad, and I wanted to warn others not to start with this.
