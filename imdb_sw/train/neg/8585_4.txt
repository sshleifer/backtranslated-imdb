Well, I think you'll have one to say "The King has no clothes." When I saw this show listed on PBS last night I was hoping and worried. I liked "Morse" (even going up to buy a full DVD) and noticed that, when I always loved Kevin Whately's Sgt. Lewis character, show YAS John Thaw, period! After looking at the new "Inspector Lewis" as it is here, I am completely convinced that it's ok ... What is good (even though it seems to be bad (both young and also fat), but just do not have a charisma to carry the show as did And for his "Fox" Fox, well ... maybe the audience here from England can understand what he says, but I for one more could not. \ T it's that I've lost James Grout. Sorry to say that they should have left "Morse" to relax in peace.
