I've found this film in the 'fear' section of my video shop. That seems to mean if many zombie movies have their place there. From the triero of 'Dead' trilogy up to '28 days later.' However, when you look at it, you can quickly see what this film is true. <br /> <br /> It is really a music video that goes faster and gets more and more. There is no fear here. Only half of the effective ways that are rapidly growing because they continue ... and the last ... and the last ... and soon you get the impression maybe you are a DVD player accidentally back to 3 minutes, but no, this is how they did movies. It's compassionate. I think anyone can get better use for 7 million dollars in the film industry than to make this nose. Although some 360 ​​effects were cold, but again, they were about to be used and began to stir because it was the same stunt consistently consistently, just with different characteristics. <br /> <br /> It is also what is quite amazing is photography from the arcade game. I played a game. It uses. Why did they put it here? O that is true, this is not a film but a music video, and it's poor at that time. Rated R: A lot of violence / gore, and dirt
