That's the head to be, however. <br /> <br /> This movie combines guns, bombs, and unintentional killings to make one film "action" movie. Let me move in a series of questions: type of response to address. <br /> <br /> What's happening in the movie? People die. <br /> <br /> What! Yes. <br /> <br /> What is the plot about? What is the plot? <br /> <br /> What! What is the movie looking for to do? Kill is the only solution. What is it like? It is greatly corrupted by the behavior on their lives. <br /> <br /> What! Is there something good about this movie? Yes. I am sure they used good Panavision cameras for photography. If you like regular killings and greed, then watch the film. If you are being ignored by less "less" entertainment, then "Those Men" don't get you. To get it, the program asks, the characters are not interested in their time, the storyline can be quite resistant, and nothing is relevant together. <br /> <br /> This proves one thing: executives, directors, and anyone who helped to make this film truly "Made".
