This litter of garbage on television is one of the most dirty tricks of god that ever hit Australian television. Housewives are quick, uncomfortable, say unwise and are taken on the basis that you will likely try to kill them if you should live with them. In addition to I think Big Brother is declining the western community, showing how we as a society are on steep slopes to be brain-dead morons. What happened to the television that did not aim for the traditional religion of the community as listeners? This cannot be counted as entertainment. I think it's true that Channel Ten can remove your spirit. What happened to Rove McManus who was once a decent player and, once going to Channel 10, was very bad. With the exception of the Simpsons which has been made very intelligent.
