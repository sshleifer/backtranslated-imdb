please save your money and go see something else. This movie was this piece of crap. I didn't want to go, but I was so I thought I would laugh at once, NOPE. not a single laugh, it was terrible! chris kattan will never find the role of comedy after this and "night in roxbury." This movie is quite obvious, it does not humor even at all, and repeats over and over again. listen to me, and disappear away from this movie possible!
