I bought this DVD without any prior memory but John Huston's names, Raquel Welch, Mae West and Farrah Fawcett on his lid. I saw the Brazilian head is very proud, but I decided to look at expecting to see a funny comedy maybe like "Switch". Yet a non-fiction story is bad and hard described. Myron Breckinridge (Rex Reed) has been presented to surgery to change her sex in Copenhagen and returns to Hollywood saying she will be Myra Breckinridge (Raquel Welch) and claim half of her uncle's uncle Buck Loner (John Huston). In these days, Myra and his wife Myron have destroyed a young couple in his uncle's school and kinky sex. At some point, the screenplay caused was so confused that I believe the whole story was just a Myron mind trip from accidents. Unfortunately the beauty of Raquel Welch and Farrah Fawcett are not enough to hold this flick. My vote is three. Title (Brazil): "Homem & Mulher At√© Certo Ponto" ("Man & Woman to Sure")
