Obviously when you give an actor enough money they will do anything. I don't know how much of John Rys-Daves he got, but the money he gave for him should go to his fans as an apology for even the ROTTEN film. Special effects were worse then the effects from the 1950s of B and the lost act were worse. How acting acting was the child gave the second best performance in my opinion. The English had been so caught up and I think no one can say even English who can remember how the words should hear rather than remember the script and try to make all their "life like" and realities.
