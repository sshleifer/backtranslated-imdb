At first we find the beginning of the secret council of some kind. It all looks very promising to get going. For some of the most common inputs, the secret gets more interesting for a minute. The main character that looks like a good bloke faces trouble because of its financial claim has the right (try) and other things. You are witnessing very much and want to know what is going on. Usually a person in his condition will have several options. Somehow do not have those options. In this film it just appears to have one solution even when it is obviously not his fault. Out of blue she meets the characters who talk about the church, prayer and God. And it gives the answer to her trouble. It should be apparent at a certain time in the movie what this solution is. Now let me say that there is nothing wrong with this message. Since it is always necessary. But it was important to hide this message. This aspect of religion has led to my experience. When the message is good, it can easily avoid the fact that in real life it needs to happen to solve the issues presented on this film. The secret given to us is never available. Instead you are faced with dealing with other topics that essentially does not relate to the plot. Don't show it because of Malcolm Mcdowell. A talented actor once is enough, but if you look closely you will see that it's not so bad. In fact he must be desperate for money. Otherwise it would have belonged to the actor of his caliber working in a film like this.
