This film seemed promising but it was very bad. The cluster was O.K, but the plot itself was bad. The actors tried well with small devices, but they could not raise on the meaning of this college film. Jason Schwartzman was once again irritable - even more than in Rushmore, the rest were beaten were not the event. Exhibitions that should be fun have turned off to be set by young children. It is looking for a Road / American Pie Journey but fails to defeat on all levels. Total waste of all time.
