Well, it was fun ... except for fun. <br /> <br /> It is my second second favorite even now, I thought it was worse than 'Lazarus' and 'Ghost in the Machine'. <Br /> <br /> Let's start with good. The teaser, it was incredibly well and also emotionally. Being a good lover of the animal I was, it was a pleasure to see many beautiful animals during this period. But there are all effects, and you believe I have a lot of that. Little was wise, so were the animals being taken by strangers and instructed? whaaa ??? The conversation was also very serious. There were two or two suggested lines. It is very bad, having too many dead animals was very unhappy with me. At the end ... what is the point? all died too much. We did not learn anything, we were not welcomed, and I could not even find the death of Sophia sad ... just very exciting <br /> <br /> * stars. embarrassed because the 2nd Season did very well.
