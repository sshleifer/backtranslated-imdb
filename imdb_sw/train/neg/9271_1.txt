For a few few felt here celebrating this film FINDA. I know it's under people's opinion at the end of the day, but anyone with more brain cells can see that this is a general waste. It is therefore not appropriate to be part of this franchise. I can only assume those who say how great this is friends and someone involved in the film and are trying to give their job push. Lack of all means, do not connect people by saying otherwise. The story of the story is the weak rehash of the previous keys, the script is the same. The attempt to hide the natural deficiency by using the girl instead (WOW!) Do not hide the creators of the film without any thought, and there is a sad lack of a terrible fear. Absolutely no features of redemption, absolute turd. I have been awarded this one chancers score for that we had to get someone to finance this piece. They should have more effort in it than they did in film making. Shame.
