If this can be tested 0, it will be. From the proud woods that act at the fastest rate, the plodding speed, the angle of puerile exploitation and the pseudolesbian characteristics of the sophomoric supplement was added only to sad viewers, this is a film tragedy. <br /> <br /> is predictable, since the beginning one is quite sure what will happen to all the characters and how the plot will begin. From the start of the horrible, unmistakable and uncomfortable end, every single presence in this film has been lost, and every scrap of talent was trapped in this turkey. If you want to look at something as long as you end up with many new barriers, look at one of Ilsa's films. At least they are impartial and high on what they are trying to do. How the worst thing that can be counted on 5 is a miracle of how people who have no taste or awareness levels can sometimes come together for the most amazing reason. It doesn't matter, it's not interesting, and above all it doesn't wake up in any word. It is in my opinion, the crime; it is a crime that a very serious and sufficient piece of garbage that has been conceived and given resources to be present, and even more tragedy that is still protected by other innocent observers. Even the stability of Elvira and hateful ways can reduce the spirit of this terrible sadness of the film. Avoid at all costs.
