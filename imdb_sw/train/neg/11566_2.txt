Maybe I couldn't find a menu option for DVD to PLOT: ON OFF. To clear, the default is OFF. When the last attributes started around, I couldn't believe it was. As our poor actor, but good, I felt used, dirty, cheap. I feel like a "Roosevelt Democrat", but it would have a little more insight than a trick. Of course, the problem can be with me. I find that many others seem to find meaning or messages in this picture. Alas, it's not me. The only thing that has protected him from giving this "1" was a good, human and vegetable environment.
