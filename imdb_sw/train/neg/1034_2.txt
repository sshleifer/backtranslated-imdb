After the success of Scooby-Doo, You where, you decided to give Scooby and Shaggy their own show. But unfortunately, they added a new character that has destroyed the success of Scooby-Doo forever. They made a new show with a new name, Scooby and Scrappy-Doo. It was Scrappy-Doo which made this show a complete failure, perhaps for adults and children together. Scrappy was a stupid puppy who was ready to beat a man up. Scooby and Shaggy were afraid of criminals, and were also trying to stop him. Scooby-Doo do not need young children of immunization. If they wanted Scooby-Doo to be more successful, they should have been killed or not thought of Scrappy. This was just the poor, maybe your children would love it!
