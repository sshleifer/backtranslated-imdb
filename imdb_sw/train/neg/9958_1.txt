If it is quite simple, regressive, self-indulgent, anti-activation, anti-civil juvenile referral appeal to you, then this is the best film. It is well documented, and is often discussed with the power of the hand camera, this is a world-wide film, Manichean words: all adults (especially teachers, parents, priests and doctors) have no sense and comfort, and monsters enemies for the worst. Just avoiding the fear of civilization in general is a lot of first-sounding (yawn) and regression of children (literally) in the role of caves in the forest, and utopia take the form of rave party - again, in the wood (natural ...). It shows all the weaknesses of the first film, and much more.
