The film shows Salma Hayek and Colin Farrell, two respected and talented actors, seem to be a great idea. Independent films look better. This College will control under content that allows executives and authors and more creative director. But then why is this film bland? He asks dust. This video takes the right away from the bat that we invest so much for the characters. No one has been given a story behind, so we don't know why the characters do as they do. The description of physical and emotional scars has been left behind, if you are still left at the end of this film. I told a friend that I went to see this film, and that I thought it was bad. His question: "Even Colin Farrell can save it?" My answer: "Even Colin Farrell's ass couldn't save it."
