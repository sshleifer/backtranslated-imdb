Also known for different forms as "House of Exorcism," this mess <br /> <br /> small film takes seriously if you kill any value of entertainment <br /> <br /> nothing. <br /> <br>> The spare plan involves European tourism Elke Sommer with a position of <br /> <br /> space to play with Telly Savalas, who looks like a devil / devil fresco in the square. Sommer is given a trip on a home / house / wonder / wonder in the country, where Savalas comes to split around. There, she has missed a woman who has been dead for a long time, and the actual opera's show of soap begins. The blind man who was blind of the house was related to the dead woman, who was the knife / child of the matriarch. Couples who gave Sommer a trip? Well, the woman sweeps the motorcycle, uh, "behind the seat of a seat! / <br />," and the man knows and doesn't care. Finally, many of the cast are killed, Sommer is drug addicts and robberies, <br /> <br /> run away, and the viewer is taken to the top of the empty board. must be similar to empty empty shacks. <br /> <br /> The alternative to this, "House of Exorcism," has scenes <br /> <br /> added to involve the priest. <br /> <br /> The VHS text of this, from the Elite Entertainment, is clear glass and <br /> <br /> letterboxed. There are "extra" after last features; excluding sex <br /> <br /> and wind events. <br /> <br /> The direction of Mario Bava is fast and angry, but its screenplay is <br /> <br /> worse. There are semi-structured ideas, abandoned settings, and / or <br /> something extraordinary that doesn't do anything more than passing this object / something <br /> in a certain direction. You have life like dummies for <br /> <br /> funeral exercises, blind mother does not blindly blind, <br /> and Savalas are given the same color that she had "Kojak," (who <br />) <br /> haunts of, child?) <br /> <br /> The project looks like they had two names of the name, then wrote a <br /> <br /> quick document, something that happens on Hollywood's event. every day <br /> <br /> now. Savalas seems to be completely lost, releasing its lines / knots, and wanting his character not to die in "Dirty <br /> Dozen." Sommer surrounds and screams and drastically declines, but his character is empty, I use the word "character" for free. The only thing we know about it is its name. <br /> <br /> This is a fantastic film, and your answers can rely on <br /> <br /> how you are in Eurohorror, and Kojak. I for a person can not get something to complete "Lisa and the devil." <br /> <br /> This is not appropriate, and including additional bonus at the end of VHS <br /> <br /> copy, has physical abuse, sexual abuse, power / <br> <br> /> year, female weaknesses, male pollution, sexual content, and adult status /
