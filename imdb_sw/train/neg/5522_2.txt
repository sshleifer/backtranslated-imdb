I have been looking for good words to describe this film. At first I was interested in just jumping for the most important things, as the film did not revive the eligible views. However, I left, wondering how to describe such things and feel the challenge presented by the question: "What can a person say about the film?" Mabuzi? No, not garbage, garbage can be restored to something important. The greenhouse? No, green gas, greenhouse gas helps plants grow big and healthy. Finally, I hit "It's not bad," the rework of the words "Not right" used sometimes in theoretical physics to describe the theory that will not be innocent and not even correct. That is, Georgia's rule: It's not bad even.
