This movie has lost me with RPG (cross-propelled grenade). It was like a man cut and photographed from Robocop. I half expected Beowulf to say, "I LIKE IT!" I looked at this because I love Chris Bruno from the "Death Zone" TV show and made part of it. He chose an incredible emphasis, but at least put it firmly to the entire movie - unlike all its costs. They continued to get into every kind of speech from ancient English to modern English, sometimes in the same sentence. <br /> <br /> There are many comments already about how this movie is different from source materials. However, even for themselves, the plot of this film is not good. It's just boring, which even the low budget does not excuse. Having a low budget means that you need at least to have a good story, talk and act with respect. These things are not expensive. Instead, they spent their money on the CGI half of the ass and a decent dress and put. <br /> <br /> Life is too short to watch this film.
