***** Warning: May be a SPOILERS ********* My biggest problem with this movie is how self-reliant and self-female wife is !! After having one night stand with the psychological slimy she is struck by him. He calls him regularly and threatens him and even sends a video of their night together. He is the followers of the most dangerous things. The problem is he only thinks he is dangerous to HER (and discloses his secrets). Not for the second time he had one thought of worrying for her husband! Did he even think that he might be in danger from this psychotic? Once she realized how she was in mind she would have to tell her husband regardless of the consequences. Maybe it wouldn't have a movie then there is really no however it is so different.
