Look at this with my girl after falling on it while hitting the way. <br /> <br /> I think we both expected some kind of a happy Christmas movie, but they were desperate. The actor playing the soldier, seems to have any feeling, his face looks similar, if he tries a Christmas tree, seeing a girl likes to kiss him with his girlfriend, or when he is happy with a girl he likes, he is a bad actor, and no one of us has done anything but to laugh at him. <br /> <br /> Then there is a beautiful girl's blond, blessed with the ability to count dot and cheat her lover, what it is! and his desire in life is to live with his parents and count more dots. So it's essentially a story about a guy without any feeling or feeling who falls to someone who calculates dots and cheats on his boyfriend, it's as far as possible that it's getting, and actually losing time, you can't get anything to look at this, rather than laugh laughing, because all is corny. I love him when his father says that he eats only French fries and not French wine, and all laughs, that's the view of this movie hillbilly approaching, moreover, if my dad was fighting me close, I would like to tell him something or not, but not our old army, no master, then let everyone pray for him. It is what the first blood would be, if John Rambo was burned as the world's largest wimp.
