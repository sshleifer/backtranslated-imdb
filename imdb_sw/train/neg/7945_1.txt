Movie breaks down the moral and ethical values ​​that it fails to form a related argument against the death penalty for any level. By submitting a legitimate execution of death as a last resort to apocalyptic humanitarian movie raises the murderer of the parent and the state of Christ's murder. Somehow, according to the plot, God is angry that the community has chosen to withdraw himself from a fan who was killed by his parents from the fire when they slept without defending themselves in their beds. Yet the same god is not angry with the murderer's actions. Leadership, a self-assuming woman, eventually gives her life in an unhealthy but unsuspecting effort to save the murdered murderer. In the other fibers of the unsuspecting conspiracy Jesus returns as an incompetent strike and frustration by marking God's wrath. The pre-eminence of Christ's Christ is not only to deceive him but to laugh at the Islamic beauty of all religions as well. He can not affect humanity for good and by unemotionally skates along life waiting to destroy his own. At the same time, with little help from Jesus, a pregnant woman emerging mentally sees herself capable of reproducing again in her new born child who somehow saves all people from the wrath of the Almighty. I also explained that as a statement supporting abortion at a certain level. This modern attempt to stimulate many religious themes in excitement cannot do any religious thing that I could easily interpret unless it was to laugh at people's faith. It brings many questions that he will never try to answer. It ignores the religious values ​​of its listeners when they try to show the version of their fulfillment. Silly
