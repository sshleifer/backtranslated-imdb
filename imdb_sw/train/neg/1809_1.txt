There is nothing that I hate more than bragging. Kevin Smith deserves to be closed with his fingers to encourage every white whiner in the middle of the class to make a movie about why they can't find. I am not a true knowledge and low budget production but when this writing is clear and when you close it burns my potatoes. The money placed within this can go to a hard-working film manufacturer who actually has the opportunity as John Gulager. If you look at the Project Greenlight you will immediately see a talented viewer who fights with the system. Anyone can grab a camera and make a photo that can't manage to say anything really, even a little. When will we be saved from Smithonites and Whedonettes of the world? The revolution cannot come soon. Go look at the first real effort by purchasing Desperado or finding Friends For Profits. Thank you and good day.
