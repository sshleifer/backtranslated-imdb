Drew Barrymore keeps seeing him changing-ego every city and it's really starting to be pain in the butt. <br /> <br /> After Dee lease flat from author hack, he will meet 'other Drew' to be more often. The dude author feels that it is his responsibility to beat 'Drew the real' due to his sleep, so he does what he can to help with a quick trick. It is not very interesting, and even terrible, but Drew is sexy as usual, especially when it gives a group of workers to the finger finger construction ... Yeah Drew, that's hot! The best view can be where Drew injured his real mother, Jaid, with a big kitchen knife ... hmmm ... and what was your day?
