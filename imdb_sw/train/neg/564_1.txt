Manufacturers made a big mistake casting Mark Lester, who could not make or sing, in the title of the head. In addition to the very "acting acting", singing to Lester should be mentioned by the girl. I don't know why they missed him, since there will be many boys who could play the best part and make their own singing too. Shani Wallis was too old to play Nancy, who just needed to have 16. The West End version is now better than any movie every way. Ross McCormack is the most beautiful of Dodger of all time and he is certainly very much looking than the Wild Jack ever was. It was clear political to send this old Oscari music after the tragic events of 1968.
