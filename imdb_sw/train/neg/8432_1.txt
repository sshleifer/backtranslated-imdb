Leave them to scholars like Ventura Pons, the director of Spain, to persuade them about his country to grant this inappropriate films. The sad state of the film industry in the country is a product of trying to make film out of thin material. Many of the pictures made in Spain fall under two categories: those about the Spanish Civil War, who like to present past history as the authors feel the same. Other types of films show the viewer and many free sex because 'creators' have no interest to say. When the film opens, we find a look on the pen's pen as he tries to wipe it and put it on one of the pieces on the ceremony. Later, Sandra will show her all that has been given to the audience to please. The story of Pere's visit to Sandra, a married woman who seems to have a happy marriage, is a lie from the beginning. Our goal is only to watch the original movie, the best and Mr.. Pons, "Amic / Amat", but alas, has no connection with the aggression we watch for this project. In addition to comments submitted to the IMD, all negative votes come from the Spanish audience, which speak loudly from them!
