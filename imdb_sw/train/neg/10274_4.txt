In Texas, seven friends meet on a bar to celebrate Halloween night before going to a party. At the same time, they call the American radio to pirate dream for fun and acknowledge their inner fears. The main killer, who listens to their covenants, makes their disaster real, killing each of them in a sad way. "American dream" is a low-budget movie that has a start of horror: without any preliminary details, a woman kills two couples in a camping area alone, if it's Friday, 13. Then, the story changes on the bar, where seven friends celebrate Halloween. From this time, the story has great potential, and an unknown throw has a very good performance, and also show good breasts and naked bodies, as usual in this type of C. Production. However, the end of the screenplay does not provide any definition of common killings and interested in the behavior of nurse Jane Toppan, with the feeling that the budget has completed before the completion of the shot. With the best start and conclusion, this wonderful story can be a good budget for a small film. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Agonia" ("Pain")
