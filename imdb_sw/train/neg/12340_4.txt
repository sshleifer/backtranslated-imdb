"Transylvania 6-5000" is a trivial but frequent and pleasant way of mid-80 of fear and several common names in cast and a few of the realistic cancellation opportunities in the script. The journalist of the tabloid two newspaper, was sent very much, against their will, to Transylvania to make a story about the alleged return of mad scientist Frankenstein. There are some of the smallest items and details of the left and right discoveries in the film, like a little guillotine for boiled eggs and tubes that are used to put in cream and sugar on the breakfast table. The best of the film, however, is not as successful as it should and should be, with jokes and conditions of illness that are in many ways. The production of Roger Corman "Transylvania Twist", which came four years after this, is a lot of funnier and was proposed more. This film mainly includes Universal's early 30 years, so make sure you have seen those if you want to know small gags and memories. There is a good original twist showing that the behavior of Frankenstein continues only as an evil-looking scientist when entering his laboratory. It is also revealed that he is more than Father Damien type of Messiah who is concerned only with the situation of the exiled monsters. Michael Richards, a young boy who plays Kramer in Seinfeld, a star as a psychological pastor who appears and disappears at the wrong time. I am sure that John Turturro's behavior in "Mr. Acts" was guided by the role of Richards here.
