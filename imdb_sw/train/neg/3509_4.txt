Somewhere within this film is half an hour from Twilight area trying to emerge. Although the cube was made, it has been made well, claustrophobic and mind-engaging, I'm afraid of Cypher is bloated, stimulating the rehash of several well-restricted themes that just do not add up to the volume, especially if you've seen almost any other half way through sci-fi The film before. It will be able to restore the way through its 95 minutes at the end of the end. No characters break, and for the film made in 2002 technology is true. It is difficult to connect this exhausted and non-transferable film by the Cube director. It's not a bad film, but it's definitely not good. When you look at the grass growing and drawing dry and bored with your rods then all the way to watch this film, but other activities will probably show more.
