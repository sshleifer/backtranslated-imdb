The movie was watchable when Nicolson was a screens. However, I had to fight against losing from weight when the film depends on Meryl Streep carrying scenes without Jack; he was like bland as possible. The relationship between the characters was not specified; These characters have been shown before - and better. It felt like a real-life-real-life situation: 90% of everyday life is boring, and it is not recommended to write up or look. Why Ephron felt his life and relationship with Carl Bernstein was interesting enough to write about running me. He probably wrote as a cure - for many authors, to keep part from their lives on paper is cathartic. Good: but then why anyone in Hollywood felt this story was worth imitating still a mystery to me.
