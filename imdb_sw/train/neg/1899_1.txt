I looked at this because I thought there would be a lot of cars chased by cool cars to reach. I think I was lying. This movie is very boring. The movie comes to Kip Raines (Giovanni Ribisi) sitting out of the sale of Porsche's sale to see if they have the right car. When they prove that it is correct, Kip gets the brick out of the trunk and wipe it on the window, losing it. He gets Porsche when his friend gets the keys. They start the car and stop at night. They put it in the warehouse after the police have been followed. Therefore, all employees search for all vehicles and go their own different ways. Then, we get a picture of Memphis Raines. He gives a little speech to a group of children in a kart. Then, he faces Atlee Jackson (Will Patton). Atlee tells Memphis that his brother Kip is in the deep * bleep *. Memphis is known as one of the most famous car dealers in Los Angeles. Memphis leads to junkyard and meets Raymond Calitri (Christopher Ecclesten). This threatens to kill Kip if Memphis does not provide 50 cars in 72. hours. out. The last 12 hours of the film are desired! <br /> <br /> 2. Cars: You see maybe 10 out of 50 cars like film ads. So, where are the other 40 cars? Why can't we see them? <br /> <br /> 3. The Chase: The chase at the end of the movie was joke. It was not the only solution. <br /> <br /> 4. Dogs: Place bats in the movie, dogs eat burgers and swallows three keys too. This is impossible. Keys opened open. The keys could seriously damage dog disease, stomach, and intestinal dogs. Boys suggest to give the dog's laxatives to help him. This can't work. Dogs will get a lot of disease but there are no keys. It was expressed in Jackass after Ryan Dunne stuck a toy car up his rectum. Take laxatives, lots of diarrhea, but no car. Same case with dog. <br /> <br /> 5. The Cop During Chase: Eleanor declines for a few minutes, Nicholas Cage tries to start the car. You see the police cruiser behind him who doesn't look at his car completely. But, when Nicholas Cage started the engine again, a police officer scratched his head right, he saw a car, and immediately began to dismiss him. It's stupid. So, when he heard the engine started, and saw the car, he knew it was a car he was looking for. How does he know that the car is the same? He only sees his back. Overall, movies are awesome. No action. There are very few cars. The movie is stupid. I've never seen it before but I planned. I offer this 1 star of 10 stars. Get Fast and Furi instead.
