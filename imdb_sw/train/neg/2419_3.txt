I just give this three because it accomplished what my friends and I hope would do: welcome. I was not stupid enough to hire these ideas to be a zombie film up there and loved Romero or Fulci, but what I rented for was laughter. If you are looking for a film for amusement, or a film to stimulate your head to shame, go ahead. This is perfect for young people - "The Secret of Theater Science", but only the lowest is that it is bad, it worries itself. I, personally, I think it's a shame to explain this to any other Hollywood title that we can know, because when the film gets like this, it has its own kind.
