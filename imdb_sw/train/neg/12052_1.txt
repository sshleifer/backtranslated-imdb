What happens when you give a free person just enough money to put a trap on the mouse and watch him scream? Homeless people respond to anyone. They do not have mortgages, tax payments or idiot heads. Homeless people are not worried about IRS or performance audits or credit card payments. But, give them enough money to rent an apartment and buy a car and, suddenly, should be concerned about entering the race of the mouse, buying gas for transport, paying insurance on their car, and working for someone else. They have the opportunity to be "productive citizens." This film was almost as impossible as the film could be. It is the way of the rich and middle sheep to say "behold what happens when you try to help the poor?" and proves great pride. Why is it not a film that asks him, "What happens when you remove everything rich?"
