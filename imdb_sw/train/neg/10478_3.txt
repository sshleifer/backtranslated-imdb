I look honestly this movie as another serious attempt to the Swedish Movie industry. The first 30 minutes of the movie are a little funny but then when they change their role in society (men doing what women do and women do what men do usually) the movie falls. Be boring and not quite funny. They allow many things without definition and the end of the movie is predictable. I did not like the way as Angel Roberto played with his little character. I went to the movie theater you'd like to see a good job but I just got desperate. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie.
