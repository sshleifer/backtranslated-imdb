This film drives a thin line between satire and silliness. While the bridge system that does not have the law can promote the harmony of marriage, it certainly cannot develop a winning grade, so satire hasn't worked for me. But there were other interesting things, especially with a great bridge between Paul Lukas and Ferdinand Gottschalk near the end of the film. It is treated as much as the match of the contest competition. Not only the field of competitions placed in the square as a boxing ring, there is a referee fighting between the fighters, and the radio player Roscoe Karns offers an unusual conversation on events. One time even writes "One ... Two ... Three ... Four ..." as that the four diamond attempts was a hit scene. And people had joined their radio for all, a common event of the match matches. The damage was very good. Unfortunately, a few of the participants offer a comedy needed to develop a planned satire. Paul Lukas do not have many opportunities for comedy and are miscast; Lot Loretta Young and comic ordinary Frank McHugh were not given good lines; Glenda Farrell has a comic mix as a forgetful striker at the beginning of the film, but he disappears after that. It's losing talent!
