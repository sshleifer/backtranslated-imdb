My husband is a big fan of Robin Williams. I also love him, but he has often found that he should "cling to what he does better" and look at the comedic roles. My thoughts were confirmed by this film. I was very tired on the whole film. The story was predictable. I realize it was inspired by a true story. But, I think that there may be doubts or selfishness even when maintaining truth in the story. There are no well-designed characters. There was a side story about the main character and his partner. This relationship could explore further. Even more importantly, though, it would be a thorough investigation of the "boy" mother. His psychological profile would be interesting to enter. In fact he has a long history that was not affected but by the most advanced way. If my husband was not a big fan of Williams, we would have left it 20 minutes. I still can't get my $ 20 or 2 hours back.
