I love movies, and I will watch any film by the way, so we can have a chance. I can finally say that I've got movies I can't see all the way. Acting is very stale and monotone, CGI looks like a computer geek made it in its mother's basement with a small app, and ..... long long scenes just ... walk !!! With this movie is HOURS HOURS LONG !!! I did not even have 15 minutes until I gave the DVD. Exhibitions and visitors are very short. Ummm, instead of mentioning this "world war", it calls this "Long Walk". This will cost 5 million dollars to make! What? They spend money, a wonderful opening song? Oh, but with a positive note, one area you need to check is when the first visitors start to kill people. That's hilarious, not because people die, but because when they turn to the bones, they still run for 20 seconds later. <br /> So .... as I said, if you're a fan of ignore, movies, non-low, here is one of the DVD collection. But I didn't write this to you, I wrote this to billions of billions of other people who would hate this film. It's not worth your time or money money Just get the Steven Spielberg version, not all good, but it's 10 times better than this! <br /> <br /> I offer this BIG, FAT ZERO out of 10.
