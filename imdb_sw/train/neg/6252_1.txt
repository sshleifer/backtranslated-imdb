Ronald Reagan and a group of US troops in the North POW camp in Korea. They are being persecuted ... We learn North American Communists are bad people ... We learn the American beards grow very slowly during the days of persecution ... \ t . It was the area where Mr. Reagan came from telling Communists that they were on their side. Then, he asks for a bottle of brandy. Then, with cold-cold stones, takes a drunk friend, Dewey Martin, to get sulfur to treat Mr. Martin's hangover. Of course, North American Communists are as dumb as they come. Therefore, a drunker prevents the guards when Reagan goes to get something from the drawer, which is close to the empty boxes. I'm sure boxes had to have something; but, in fact, Reagan makes them tremble enough to show that they are empty. Ya gotta laugh! I think "The War of the War" will specifically invoke families and friends of those who did his job - otherwise, it is a waste of.
