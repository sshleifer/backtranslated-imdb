In short: <br /> <br /> Spike Lee is very clear in his mind. He thinks about the color, color, media and hegemony, the use of humanity and ethnicity, religion, sex, 'hetero-sexism', the politics of drug abuse etc. etcâ€¦ himself is great. I think it is a blessing that more and more people choose to carefully examine the basics of our daily life; the quiet and invisible power that guides our communities. However, just because Lee does films does not make him a good film player. What comes in the "Jungle Fever" is a high awareness of these social and political forces. This is exactly the result of two major failures: <br /> <br /> first, Lee is just trying hard. He seems to be working hard to address every political / social information he can think of within 90mins. And, as a result, the final result seems to be confused and ignored because it does not allow time to develop characters who can completely fill out the ideas they hope to submit. And so he overcomes the exercises and we are witnessing with quick testimonies and very tight negotiations. The end result has been done too much and true. Secondly, by trying to provide information on many types of social work, it seems that there is no actual interpretation of the social / political issues presented. What comes up is the puddle of regurgitated non-mind. You feel that he bought a basic textbook based on the basic text and published on all 500 pages. of the film manufacturer. We cannot isolate the work, and allow it to talk itself. It does not act like a piece of art or a political argument. Though I still accept Lee bringing these important issues, I must say: <br /> <br /> Two below.
