I am so excited and surprised that there is so much interest in this film! Jack Frost was my introduction to the film produced and distributed by A-pix entertainment, and without exception, everything that this company deals with is clean! First, and this is very important, you never expect this film! Why you? Unlike many other interesting movies, this does not make me deliberate. I can just get on how fake snowman is, why it's always shown briefly, how it moves is the best! This movie is a better Waaaaaaaaaaay than a piece of Michael Keaton piece, becuz made also a good film, and this version is as bad as this.
