They cannot get stupider than this film related to the lost 3 people who are trying to capture the spirit of college during the annual spring breaks in many high-school schools. The problem is that those who are lost are trying to do this 15 years after their college years when one is given a look at the daughter of the senator's daughter adorned for being the second president. The problem is that she is nothing but the so-called, but of course comes out of all of that. Girls go through drinking alcohol, playing foreign and other trivial things. It can't get worse than this bad film.
