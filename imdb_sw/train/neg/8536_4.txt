This is a typical production of Steele because two people who have experienced some type of tragedy can join together despite odds. I can't call him a spoiler because anyone who has read Steele's novel knows how they all live. If you do not want to know more about the plot, do not read. Gilbert's character, Ophelia, is a woman of French beauty who lost her husband and son in an accident. Gilbert needs to stop making a film where he needs to be feeling because he, otherwise good performers, can not pull any kind of inspiration. Brad Johnson, also the best actors, is Matt, who saves from a very serious divorce. He is gentle, persuasive and compelling in this role. The two meets on the beach through his daughter, Pip, and earlier, Ophelia accuses Matt of being just a molester child because he spoke to the child and the child. They all become friends after this period and then couples love. Chemistry between the two guidelines is not good, although the two talents of these people are not, in my opinion, the question. They made the achievements they had with a predictable plot and a script that has limits on enough conditions. Two people meet, a tragedy, a great tragedy, a mystery is revealed, another catastrophe, and then it meets. I wish there is more than that, but there is brief. I wanted to have fun, and I got this. About the type of romantic films, this cannot be remembered. "Mystery Secret" and Janine Turner is the largest (not the Steele book), like some of the original Steele books that became the film.
