This film was essentially Velvet Goldmine if the fifth party writers kept it and made it.v. movie. The film doesn't have what Velvet Goldmine had a good job, writing, and basically everything else. The film had the worst text I saw since Wild Wild West. It's obviously interesting to attract. I know vh 1 has been a household name behind the music show. which is better than all that would work if it was behind music music but it didn't feel flat on the face.
