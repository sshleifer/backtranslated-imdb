See the life of the vagabond in the French social barriers, in a meaningless life, purpose or direction. I looked at this because of all the stellar reviews, but I'm afraid I should miss something. Mona's character has little or no time when it comes through life that is bad for people, get up and contribute anything to anyone's life. Not interesting or exciting. She is worthless. I have seen and known enough people like that: there is no secret to what they are doing. They are just lazy bum. I don't want Mona here anywhere near me, since she seems to steal anything that is not nails and leave her friends. Surely he is enigmatic - because there is nothing to him. Plenty of junkies, winos and bums I found it enigmatic; I don't want to see a film about them either. There is probably something there that I missed. Otherwise I think that all comments are from people who do anything done by the French director of art is a top art.
