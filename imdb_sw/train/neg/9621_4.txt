I was dead to see this once I saw a fan of MEATBALLS ridiculous and sharing that was to be the best satire ever. What attention to the priority for satire - the variety is complete. Unfortunately, the finished product (if I think all involved can realize) is a list of lost opportunities, not-for-the-show (with thanks!) Very few hilarious, b inspired. Janeane Galanga, who is very aggressive, looks very bad here, probably because she is so hard trying to make her a good job. David Hyde Pierce is just a sad look, trying to be hard to be funny and looking like Castro nerd. Molly Shannon is just funny to see that it makes you laugh, but somehow part of it fails a snowball in a hysterical thing. Paul Rudd had a good character of the boy and was sexy as hell, other people are also funny (those nerdier). I think the problem is the only director can not move objects together at the right speed. He begins to get very dirty, and that puts a monotone. But when he leaves the most popular things (the drug chain is the second funniest time that I have had throughout the year in the cinema, the first one comes to the films: Andrea Martin in ALL IN GUY complaining about the movie IN & OUT), it's easy very much. I wanted this movie to work very badly, but it didn't. Clothes and styling for 1981 are 99.9% PERFECT, with very few tracks used also are perfect. This is approaching as the wrong part of MAD TV, completed with more interactive artwork.
