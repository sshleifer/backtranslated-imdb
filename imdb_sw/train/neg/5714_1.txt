I have seen beautiful Korean movies including exciting games and movies with overtone black, but this takes. The director appears to be a fool, who came to find someone to produce a junk. Movie does not value any kind of entertainment and is not even recommended. I can't trust someone who made a similar film. Even though acting is the same, the line of the story and feelings leave it bad. I'm sure, I won't see any movies of this director. There is no point in making movies, and quite frustrated with having an exciting time. All this shows scenes with psychopath losing reels and bad shooting scenes and showing more blood and violence thinking that makes it exciting. It is a very sad movie and I highly recommend to fly all the movies of this kind.
