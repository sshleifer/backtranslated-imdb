I really enjoyed a man named Horse when it was released in 1970, but the Return was played as the last time. Everything about it - the budget, script, conspiracy, casting, and act - was inferior to the original. Gale Sondergaard as a Elk Woman, an Old Man of the Yellow tribe, does not see anything like Hindi, and not half of the other "Indians," who were played by Italy, Mexican, and Latinos with a cheap price. And an old man who played the director acted more like an old fat squaw than a sharp leader of the heroes. He even used a bow as a woman! Finally, Richard Harris, who did a very good job in nature, seems to be hitting this time around. I think he can not resist the usual charge which he gained by overturning his role as a horse. To be the same, there is a certain time of interest in the film, such as the progressive horse of the purification of "getting his vision" and connecting the Yellow Hands against their Indian enemies and white attackers, but in general, Return is incompatible, stretch, and predictable - such as many sequels.
