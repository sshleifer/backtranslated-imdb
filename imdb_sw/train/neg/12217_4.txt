If the low budget documents go, you will often find that you get what you pay for, and just let me say, I did not pay more for "Frightworld" ... <br /> <br /> Author / Director: David R. Williams brings us the story of The left amusement park, surrounded by the spirit of the assassin's murderer. It is not a bad premise, but it is given to the bevy of low-budget errors. The function of the camera tries to be open to its audience, using it constantly quickly reduced to the fact that they have nothing to be awesome or terrifying to show us. This becomes quite clear on the bat, as we are brought to the killer-that, and soon realize that (acting) is the worst thing that happens ... After a series series series series we are restored in modern times, still acting yet its okay. "Frightworld" produces unique exclusive displays when displaying the environment from within a fun house, but for a very long race, it can not save the film from the bottom of the bottom of the hell. There is an abnormal weakness, but not many for a year, which is usually a grace saving for these types of movies. The B-worst movies can get something of interest here, otherwise, don't use a lot of money.
