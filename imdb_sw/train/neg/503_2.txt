After the first release of the best names for Eurotrash, the CAPS have been able to hit under a barrel with BLOODSUCKER WANTING DANCE. I have seen NO Bloodsuckers anywhere on this film. <br /> <br /> Stories are easy. Hidden numbers invite several actors to his castle for a little vacation. After some shenanigans of sex, girls are reduced directly. Who is the killer? Who knows? There are more red rains in this one than the domestic fish market on Friday. The speed is very interesting. Stories are silly and skin events are not all sad either. <br /> <br /> This offer has been lost.
