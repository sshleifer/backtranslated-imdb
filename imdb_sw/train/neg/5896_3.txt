One missed phone, other Asian fears from a mobile phone. Recently I have filmed the Korean fear of a mobile phone called "Pon". One lost phone was just as bad. Maybe cell phones are not afraid or something, but this argument was bad and drab. There is no tension or excitement for me, and the last monster had a sad and enough desire. The movie dragged quite a bit in different parts, and felt very long. It didn't put my mind on. It seems the phone is hard to make panic, it's as much as trying to try to pop the vending machine eerie. And it's reasonable to compare this with "Ring", it seems every movie Asia scared compared to it and so far I haven't seen any that measure in at least. To be afraid of directors - take a hook call as a terrible tool.
