There is no single place of honor. Amy Adams gives one of the worst displays all the time. Confirmation that you can start anywhere. The boy plays Sebastian gets, too. He even looks like Ryan Phillipe. More like Joshua Jackson. The other two girls are awesome, too. <br /> <br /> Then the discussion also explodes. Sebastian (About having three): If you like to beat them ... <br /> <br /> Virgin Girl: Who says you can't beat him 'em? Lama. <br /> <br /> The end contradicts the whole nature of nature. In the first film, it is clear that Kathryn and Sebastian did not have sex. One of the reasons Sebastian wanted Kathryn is wrong, away from the fact that she played with Sarah Michelle Gellar, was that she was "the only girl who could not kill him". He was a player who loved to play with him. The fact that he never gave her added need. Then at P.O.S. this, it means that she can be with him, with the girl on the side. When? And we don't even see sex, either. It means, not just stupid, useless, and oppressive, but useless. <br /> <br /> And in the first place, Kathryn refuses Sebastian because he loved love, and made him an adult. Even though he won the bet, it reduced his chances. Then in this dread, he loses NA falls in love. So he does not screw "lost", just lost the perfect? Another thing: It is said that Sebastian has never liked in love, why do you call it the Virgin Girl? Then, at the end, the girl's girlfriend is suddenly given to a lesbian lover of Kathryn (dun dun dun) and, as I said, they go to the three best ones. Foolish. <br /> <br /> There are other obstacles to the plot. Does the author even see the first film? A 5-year-old child can describe his things outside. After an exciting, Sebastian is having sex with a blonde virgin, destroying her innocent innocence behind a lime while Kathryn and Virgin Girl turned out to be a lesbian in Lame Gango's Twist Twist sitting, listening, and smile for evil within the camera. <br /> <br /> Last ... <br /> <br /> See Sebastian that the ass of the ass was in the first he could make an interesting film. I think all it took to do a little Sebastian bad was the third and two hot girls. Interesting.
