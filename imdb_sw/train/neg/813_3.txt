One of the greatest that emerges from me is that they say Zues takes orders of DUTCH. But he speaks German to him. From 2 it is quite different, such as saying "well takes French orders" and starts speaking Spanish. James Belushi gives more sense of being a comedy actor not a little detective. The role does not work with him, even if you make it a comedy. <br /> <br /> For many kinds / predictable items. Normal views or events. If you don't watch those things I think it might be a good film to watch if it's on TV. But I can not recommend rental.
