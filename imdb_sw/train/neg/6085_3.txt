In this potboiler derived from the paranoia, the war hero of the journalist guides hindersome, corporate fraud employees, supporters of UFO debunkers, and the guests of silence, dancing. (Although they have the ability to control the mind and the objects from the remote, it takes three of them to work on the control panel of these two buttons.) Script to run from event to event, leaving the puzzler is many. Why did visitors hide dogs? Why are they hurrying soldiers and radios when they are running an empty disposal site? And what of the value of their horn cheese triggers the wrong photographer instead of his model? Ask people want to know! Author of the author Mario Gariazzo seems to reflect his lesson by running the fack of UFO-themed layers as he did the Double Classics feature. (The fast installing screen boasts that it depends on the actual events ... as "the 9th arrangement!") Others may feel burned by a sudden finale, but still should appeal to the plot of the plot.
