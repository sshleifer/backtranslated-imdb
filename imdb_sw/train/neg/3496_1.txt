I remember my parents didn't understand Saturday Night Live when I was 15 years old. They also didn't understand Rock n Roll and many other things. Now that I am approaching their age, I still remember, and seeing I understand many things my children like. But this is sad. I can't say I have seen anything for Sarah except for a few appearance here and there. They were wise. I don't see anything special. But this show is too far under what I expected from him. Writing to IMDb made it sound as likely. So, just so, I started looking at the first part. I ended up half way. Something else is better that. Jokes that have a 5 year old age presented to an adult plan. Yes, Sarah, this old man has moved to stop you. I just can't believe that someone actually sponsored this desire for comedy. The only good thing I can say is that there are sooooo many bad jokes imposed here, saving other performances from that shame.
