I finished checking the tenants and my close friends who just hired a movie based on the appearance of Snoop Dogg (their favorite fetish) on the lid. Understandably, I didn't expect much. I thought the movie would include a common column of character associated with Snoop Dogg often seen in rap rap videos. However, my generalization was for many parts wrong. Unfortunately, this did not make the film better. Many could describe the film as a dark game, where I would describe it as a dark-drawn game. The film describes the story of two hard-working writers (Dylan McDermott and Snoop Dogg) who are trying to create their own different stations. Their counterfeit life is completed with an impossible but very effective and neurotic. This friendship walks through the entire film as a wild-coaster which many are given by Snoop's character - to remember someone who has a serious disorder of a person's disorder. And although the movie is a drama, acting - which has a bad and bad sound - from Snoop and the company was more interesting than anything else. I can't recommend this movie to those who are paying attention to this damage because this has a lot of conversations and many conversations after that. There are some conflicts of concern, but even they are included with more conversations. Finally, however, he flew to me with a sudden surprise. It was a little lost, somewhat unexpectedly and a perfect way to close the required film to stop. While looking at the finishing features I could not help but the image of the thinking director, "O God, how hell will end this snoozer." By the way, the director focused on the precautions and deceptions leading up to the peak - all that is more visible than Waldo on a crowded roadway with nothing but black mats.
