The best thing about camping films is generally that you know what to expect. It's like watching a match against a professional or opera's day of soap or a show of Jerry Springer: you can quickly follow the plot of skimpy, identify the characters of the paperwork, and look at the satisfaction when all the fleshflies are fulfilled. However, sometimes the director does something that is impossible. It can be something stupid, or something heavy, or something good. Director Makinen is up there with the best directors of the camp, and this is his best movie. <br /> <br /> In Yon saalistajat, everything seems to be together. There is nothing good about it, but it still manages to be perfect cohesion. No once the movie declines - the flowing point and the punch will continue to come. The worst thing is that there is no sense of time: other characters seem to take months to do something while other characters have just spent an hour on the bar. This is because of the Finnish summer when the sun is not good, so you do not experience the day to turn to night. <br /> <br /> Finally: there's a plot, there, somewhere. You need to watch the film three times before you realize, though.
