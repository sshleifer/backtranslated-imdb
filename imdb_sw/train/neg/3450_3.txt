The person here actually compared this film to other ways up to High Day. Now that's a real stretch! I am a great fan of Sinatra including its job responsibilities but maybe the only person who could play this part would be Don Knotts. First, as someone said, Sinatra do not just build for Western wannabe bad. He is also 'less' at this time in his life. Perhaps he was on the same height and said Audie Murphy, but Murphy had to build a pretty solid. Sinatra comes as a little child talking who no one should take seriously. <br /> <br /> Stories are not suitable for work and is not really good. I do not want to destroy it but I think the end and how the townspeople respond to this story have no meaning. Another thing, these people always allow themselves to be completely possessors and 'bad guy'. This is only a small town, so I can't find a destination or do not know why people will allow themselves to be led that way. There is a 'love interest' in the story and if I followed it well, he was angry when the main character refused to accept who was another bad person even to kill him. Now there is true love for you. 'Stand up! Tell your name to kill you! 'LOL. Stop, you kill me. Unfortunately, the film is not enough and no matter how they tried this story, there was no logical way to follow others except on the desired waste. Want to know why not on the video and never show it on TV? Critics seemed to be in the day of 1956 and were correct - this movie is very bad. I would almost bet bet Sinatra paid someone with deep detail as much as possible. <br /> <br /> Want to see a beautiful Western where the city stands on a bad person? Try the tension in the Table Table, or in the Gunpoint - two really, the West West and the thing. Johnny Concho is Johnny Stinko. Frank, you were the greatest singer ever - but he wasn't in the film like this.
