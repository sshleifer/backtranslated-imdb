I longed to like this western, becoming a fan of the type and fan of "Bill Bill," "Bill Bill Hickok," and "Calamity Jane," all of which are in this story! Add a Gary Cooper mix as a leading actor, and it seemed to be good. <br /> <br /> The problem was ...... it was not. I found myself looking at me just 40 minutes in this, being bored. Jean Arthur's character was awesome and James Ellison did not look like he did not like "Bill Bill." Cooper was not able, either, and the sound of wood also. This was several years before he hit his goal as an actor. In short, the western column of the shot. Take a pass and look at another eater because most of 'em were better than this.
