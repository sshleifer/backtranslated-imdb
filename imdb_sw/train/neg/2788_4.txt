Much has been written on the Red Rain, visible "key player" of the movie bio, however I'm here to tell you that the movie is not recommended high quality. First, we might find one thing directly Prince is a good musician and Music is one place where Rain Purple is increasing. Even the scores are tested, and if this was shot as a concert film would be a good experience unfortunately not and also the film has some problems. The first thing is a bad job / writing, the behavior of the Prince "Kid" is supposed to come as some kind of surprising to the mystery of a few words unfortunately this comes just like corny and incensere. A good attitude of isolation should at least have some time to talk, unfortunately the character of the Prince rarely has more than a few words of dialog in the film and it is hard to believe that he would find a girl this way. Everything seems a little bit here, which is embarrassing because you can say this is a character that has a serious conflict and does not live very hard, but we can't be allowed to get into it. The amazing feature of this film is how much of this happens at the festival. The life of Prince and Morris seems to take the back seat for the exhibition here, which I think is important from a business perspective, but it is stimulating to have a 2-hour movie where it seems half of it takes place in action, especially when the background information when they pushed aside for him. Therefore count: This is not a very good movie.
