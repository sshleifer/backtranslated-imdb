First of all, I was also waiting for another hero - a wonderful work of art for a practical form. I just saw the parts of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, but I can think it is better than HoFD. The basic things from the hero are found in the HoFD: Great themes, movie shows, and genuinely What is wrong? What begins with the political ambassadors of love in the story of love. Worse, it is a soap opera-like triangle of love. You have three characters who, I think, fall in love for each other - for no good reason. This contemporary falls off after an escape from prison (I slept over forty minutes in it). It's almost like they changed the authors at that time. The relic of the movie is about how the character is "like wind." Ick. Also, you should actually stretch your suspension in unbelief to believe the fragments. This is not unique to this kind, but since the story is weak, you can't wait for action, and then, when the fighting comes out, it was not true. Origin stimulates, but then this movie comes out of gas.
