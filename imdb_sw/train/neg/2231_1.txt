All I can say after looking at Snitch'd is please please Mr. Cahill. It is clear that you are not aware of what you are doing about movies. If you insist on making movies about boxes I encourage you to do research. It's comical to watch movies with the wonderful gangbangers that even the most sad sounds when they say. <br /> <br /> Laughing part when Mr. Cahill go to school with just 3 students and keep kick their kick in kung fu style. This movie was hard as after a special school. Who had the idea of ​​wearing a hat that says where a certain bark from? I suspect the real gangbangers do not wear a cloak demanding in the group. That would be stupid to comply with new rules that increase the length of prison if someone is a link. <br /> <br /> Snitch'd is a movie WORST gangbanger ever made.
