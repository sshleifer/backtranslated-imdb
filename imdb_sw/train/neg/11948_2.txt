Serious damage to the classic. It is not written to convince you why Maria should develop compassion for Bates. He can be strong until they play to play with him, but he has not yet helped with his actions. (invite the visitor to compare the stay alone with him until the modernization of the infection, tell the beautiful girl of his mental issues, lying on knives, etc ...) This, with his previous knowledge should keep Maria feel very much about her, but this is somehow not only so that they can play 'destructive-identity-killers-game later. Which itself is also worried: 'So-and-so is a real killer - with him too - too! There were many barriers to scoring stories on the screen when the story did not need to expand. It was good to see Perkins overturning its popular place again, but that's about just a little pleasure to have. It is definitely not a patch on Hitchcock, and if you do not intend to try even closer then you should not have any difficulty.
