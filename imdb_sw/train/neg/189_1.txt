This movie has beautiful surroundings. Unfortunately it has no plot. To have a plot there must be a crisis. This movie did not have. It spent two hours painting a beautiful area and failed to do any work in it. The picture tries to be artistic but can't pay attention to the basics of telling stories. If you like the picture of Montana and flying fishing you will find some value in this film does not expect stories. No one.
