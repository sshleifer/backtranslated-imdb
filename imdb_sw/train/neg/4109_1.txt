It can only be described as bad. It's bad to start and then it gets even worse. When you start looking at him because it is impossible to believe it can be bad - but don't be afraid because it does. Another unregistered script for the ass of the ass for children who do not have the previous stars of the film. It is difficult to determine if the script is worse than acting or if the lead is worse than both. For the hero - well he locks everyone including one area where he hits the hair of life out of toughness by turning the door of the wardrobe and beating the window with it. And in another area it gets thrown through the window and fall to 20ft on cement - it has not hit - then it rises immediately and gets caught on baddies. This is a false movie. Lucky gave only $ 1 to hire.
