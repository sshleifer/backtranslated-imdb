This was one of the most stupid and wrong movies I have seen for so long. I've never loved Spike Lee, but I think I would like to give this test: a bad mistake. The movie is required to show how the Son of Sam real life lives killed the neighborhood in the summer of 1977; what really made it was around many awesome characters that I urge anyone who cares about such as their drug problems, marital problems, and so on, etc.. The events that show murder are just that, and no more; Shoot and then come back to Saturday Night Fever! What even more ignorance is the choice of Spike Lee displayed as a journalist in the movie: Spike, my faith, you are not a Hitchcock, dropping out of movies, makes it even worse. The silly part was supposed to be a dog talking in a goofy voice, displayed in the area before it was supposed to be shot? Spike, what would you be thinking when you did this film? I don't think it's my guess. People who think they will see crime act, get my advice and don't waste your time or money. You are the best look at Jerry Springer in this case! Waste of the film, I gave 1 out of 10: very bad.
