It was a disappointment to see this DVD after many years. For me the main problem is an unsuitable script. Though some of these are witches and kidnappers, quite a bit of dull, unfunny and infinite. Many of the gags sit there, with a spark and power. <br /> <br /> Out of the cast, Mae West and Rachel Welch come well. Roger Herren's role in Rusty shines (very bad did not make more films). But for my money, there is just a lot of John Huston, and Rex Reed poor is not available to fight. His behavior seems to have been closed close, looking for what he is doing in this film. <br /> <br /> The importance of the user should comment as public comment on this piece. The origin of the Vidal provided a much greater loss. Even the "classic" films made a lot. All in a small effort, and not likely to get better in time.
