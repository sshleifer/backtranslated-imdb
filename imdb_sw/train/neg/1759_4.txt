This effort was like a movie of a glitzy movie ... I don't remember this given in the movie ... If so, you must die quickly. Watching the DVD, in the comfort of our bedroom, it was obvious this film meant not more ... Ed Lauter professional art and greedy streak? It's a fun thing that must be ... I haven't seen Ed since "Yard Longest" ... Everyone else pretty much acted in numbers, moved by Baldwin, except for Pompeo ... He had zero charisma and seemed to sleep on the photo The more ... the daughter of Pompeo had one direction ... played every scene as a small puppy loved ... slow line delivery of any 3 years I have seen yet ... <br /> <br /> From scenes to give her a wife my head and pain head ... very fast cut and angle-bashing ... If you're going to shoot the scene after Barcelona, ​​you might want a few WIDE shots to use the beauty of your back, right? The whole story was pretty implausible and fetched-fetched, but hey, we liked better than "Water Life ..."
