I expected to enjoy a romantic comedy if I was with Hip Hop, but I was disappointed in many levels. First of all, the story is so bad that it makes it difficult. Second, put, acting and stories are not true or reliable. Third, there are many black black players to choose from these procedures. How about some nature? Thirdly, there were very few Hip Hop songs played humbly - if available. No visible middle. In general, the film was a great disappointment, but the style of editing was very interesting and almost made the film worthy.
