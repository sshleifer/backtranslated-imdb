That's really a wonderful movie ... First, we have an old American elder trying to return to an actor (or something), and this seems to be the only responsibility he got (which I know yet) - and for good reason. While removing an adequate responsibility to keep interest, it is bland instead of flat performance. Secondly, we have a work of eternal effect that has been used in the film !!! I have not given birth. This alone makes the film look great, but in such a terrible way. hehe And third, when we have to be backed up correctly (including a chick needed!), a bad story, and cool pictures; negotiations, combating events associated with gymnastics (hilarious!), and the overall implementation of the plot is weakened. This movie would have been very difficult as a TV movie (the worst Fox was not around 1985). It is one of the worst movies, but you can't resist the look and even enjoy once you use it, especially now that it has found a perfect home for ever on television and cable.
