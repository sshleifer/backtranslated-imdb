I chose "Dead Creatures" because I thought it was a movie of zombies like "28 days" or so ... but not all. It's not even a terrible movie. Nothing happens, except for a group of women who seem to be infected with a strange virus that makes him eat human flesh so that he can live. <br /> <br /> The program provides a series of disgusting events of destruction. <br /> <br /> * My rate: 2/10 <br /> ------------------ -------------- ---
