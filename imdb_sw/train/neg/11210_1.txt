I read the story of John Everingham years ago in Digest Reader, and I remember thinking what a great movie would do. And maybe it would have been Michael Landon never got his hands on it. Besides I'm concerned, Landon was one of the worst executives in the world, and its artistic license continued on, similar to its killing of a series of "Little House" is evidence. Acting, for lack of a good word, is anger, responsive to the screen, and there is almost a pan of the Landon that should be allowed. <br /> <br /> This movie shows the story of Everingham as "Little House In Prairie" shows books are "primary" on. It's just another car to show you the terrible hair of Landons.
