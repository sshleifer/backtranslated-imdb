Very implausible, unreliable, and unknown Spanish production on ... well, I would like to see how close I am. The movie opens and a woman with one sheep killed by a little girl. Then she asks her partner to take her somewhere on her holiday. He calls work and claims that he loses his holiday time and says he will pay for this. What is involved in the assumption of anyone at the end of the film, because a boy, a good photographer, explorer Patty Shepard, the queen of Spanish fear films appears, taking a bikini up for a while to get a picture, ask him out of food by day, and then to his work Witches Mountain - because again we never experienced. Before you go, Patty should be standing with the house with a loud voice, "eerie" sounds a voice in the ears of our hero. Again, this is never explained. The film continues to leave these two in the inn, go to the mountain, and finally realize why the mountain is called Witches Mountain. You know, there are several elements of this film that make it better than bad films. It has at least, some character actors are very good (especially the homeowner of the deaf and the old woman), the guidelines are at least enough, and the peak - though totally unacceptable - are choreographed well (literally) and witches in white and hair brassieres long black. It doesn't mean any though, and that's a great detractor to me. I could watch the movie once ten and still don't know more now than I did after the first look. That's a big problem. The Witches Mountain is a curious film from a long time of cheap films, the European atmosphere that is locked for a decade. If you can get more from me than I, your best strength.
