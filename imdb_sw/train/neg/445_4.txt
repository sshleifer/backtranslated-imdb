One thing that bothered me about this film (and not in a good way) is that Nathan Stoltzfus, who appears to be a great historian on Rosenstrasse's topic, was one of the historians working on this film, considering how many real events were changed or not ignored. Another expert said that von Trotta said he did not mean to Lena on the bed of Goebbels, but in that case, why did he pay for every feeling that had been done? Why not show other possible reasons for the release of mens, such as the tragedy of Stalingrad, or the fear of the Nazis that international media, in Berlin, would find out about the protests. Also, why did the whole story play the second fiddle for the weak story of family relationships that have been done regularly? Certainly something amazing like this can carry its own history! In places, it was like the film had two lines of story that actually seemed to be the same. Overall, this film has failed in its goal, which was based on an unknown act of opposition, which is a shame, because it has done well, it can have a great impact.
