Okay, I've been a big fan of Black for a long time and was a DISGUSTED after seeing this film. Let's say the name problems ... First this film has a large number of employees similar to the first two. It has also been called the Teacher for the original Black Stallion. Why is it that they cannot find the name of the devil's right or its name? In Black Stallion Return, we learn Sagr was a mother of Black CHESTNUT and in this film she is a gray name Jenny?!?!?!?! WTF? And it was set in Africa in 1946 and 1947 ... I could have been bad but the first was put in the 1940s and when the ship lost. The time line does not hear the voice at all. Also, as a flat, there is a friesian at the beginning of a movie that is supposed to be the father of Shetan ... on a visible statement seems to be gelding. Ben Ishaak is the only character remaining even to make this film seem to be related to the previous two in any way. It may be a good family film for some but it is my great passion for the movie of the year.
