I loved the first movie "Azumi". I've seen Mrs. Ueto at various TV shows and I found my right part of the samurai and ninja flicks. I should say that this film was much weaker than I expected. <br /> <br /> Due to the beat of the film and introduce "Azumi", they should be able to work better with this film, but instead it was slow, plodding in part, and filtered by very poor, not The power, and the actions of wood. When they had difficulty with the first film, they did it in a free and weak way. In "Azumi", the title of the title is the best of the best group of murderers. In "Azumi 2" it seems somewhat less and less attractive. <br /> <br /> That's not to say it was a total loss. There were few cases of fighting with some of the top characters. Unfortunately, the movie is generally faced from the simple fact that Shusuke Kaneko and Yoshiaki Kawajiri are not Ryuhei Kitamura and Isao Kiriyama. The last two seized "manga" to feel in their screenplay when old never "got it."
