Al Pacino? Kim Basinger? No Leoni? Ryan O'Neal? Richard Schiff? My mouth watered. I have left everything to watch this film on Cable. 30 minutes I had trouble staying awake. 60 minutes inside and I hit the record button and slept. It finished watching the next morning. It should not be worried. It is a loss of cast by an idea that can be an interesting story of "Day in Life ..." Take your sleep if you have and look at this film. I assure you at least an hour and a half of the sleepless sleep. Discussion discussion. Sustainability does not exist. The camera function can be done by hand held Super 8 and looks better. <br /> <br /> This movie was a general catastrophe.
