This is not a comedy around everything, but it's very DULL. Indeed it laughs, and it destroys its good production standards. There is one minute hurting to the end, while Fu Manchu gives her an elxir measure for "nemesis" and tells him that "you have become my worthy enemy, and now we can start again". The situation, however, with Burt Kwouk's amusing entertainment at the beginning, is the only memorable part of the movie. (* 1/2)
