The case is a good part of the movie but alone is not recommended for the purchase price. I expected "According to the true story" movie just get shot on the video home podge-podge of the wrong shot clips tied with pathetic acting and non-related slaughter houses scenes. Video clips had many recurring features that were probably used to extend the length of the feature instead of effects. I started this review before I was half through the movie and waited until it was just over if it had a better end but, down and see it was even worse. If I could write any low score it would be negative ten. Learn from my mistake and save money and your time with this.
