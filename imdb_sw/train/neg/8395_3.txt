- The film traders are shooting the movie of horror in the old house, supposedly cursed where over the years, seven people have died in secret. One of the employees finds an old story book and looks like it would be full to use in some of the events of their worship in their movie. It is said that this booklet is written better than the script they use. But if the book is read, the grave out there suddenly comes to life. Now the staff and staff are faced with real risk. - IMD sets the duration of 90 minutes. For the first 60 minutes, nothing happens. Too much time is spent on a movie in the movie. What? Should we be afraid of the terrible movie in which they are shooting? We know that their movie is not "real". These threats do not work. There are very few things to enjoy about the Seventh House Corpses. Acting is angry. Most of these "executives" will have trouble making playing primary school. Score is awesome. It is a very reminiscent of the 70s television series and provides any situation. Speaking about the sky, more than a short time at the end of the film, nobody speaks. The way of character is all but not. Even in the film, you expect the characters to have a certain character. Here, I think I remember one event that behavior did not choose a non-existent approach to them. And finally, there are those first 60 minutes of the movie I mentioned. What? Can you say BORING? I have not tested the Seventh House Corpses because of the events where the movie (perhaps by accident) actually works. My two desires are beginning and end. The opening of the opening title provides the deaths of the previous seven owners and may be a model of the movie. And, the last events on a large staircase as a dangerous zombie film workers are somewhat effective (what pass the adoption). In general, this time is not enough to make this beautiful movie.
