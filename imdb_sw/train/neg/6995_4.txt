How many people who say this is far more than the Romero version is very small (judging by their other publications). What we are here is dirty, full-filled, gory and "Whoopee" video has filled the MTV 2 hour video. Voting edit, function of pop-video camera, "cool" music blah blah blah <br /> <br /> In fact not bad compared to other recent remakes (Chainsaw murder is a total disaster) ... good good to act all around, quite predictable for "who will die almost" pieces and total money in Dawn Of The Dead name which will generate a lot of income alone with original fans who go and see out of curiosity ... <br /> <br /> Isn't the remakes of classics getting your nerves? Can't come with something original? Why remake Dawn Of The Dead? Things that made the original special (the central part of the children think it is very interesting should be slow to show how you get everything you want is still unhappy) does not exist. This is an increasingly simple, clear and simple step. More quickly. If you are getting into action (and like this, the 2004 version has been done well), certainly for anyone who likes little substances for their film ... prepare yourself (again) ... / br >> Look at the movies over the next few years when we get A series of Godfather and everyone's fashion photo model at the moment, and Star Wars liberates, and all children say how the new version is the best miles past version is slow and boring and catches the camera for more than 5 seconds ... <br> /> <br /> Not bad, but for 10 years they will continue to discuss the version of Romero, not this pap
