In 2000 when it was near, the daughter accepted by King Kong continued and announced her announcement of tears at the end. When Miss Winfrey was breaking, I was laughing and screaming as a wild Indian from the west. <br /> Why does Oprah do? she takes the famous people, and puts them on her show. what kind of famous people? people who have suffered (like him, unless these people have lost more than their virginity) have suffered a wretched (true story), lost feet (a true story, see the end of the verse), and marital abuse (especially for counting). and somehow comes to the show and tell their story, as if we didn't hear before tons and tones of times (Bethany Hamilton, I've heard your story about losing hand to shark since one day, which was October 31, 2003. don't tell you you don't have a hard feeling. ) But the most important thing about Oprah was Michael Jackson's interview in 1993, after being charged as a molester child. sadly, Mr. Jackson is dead. but one incident said about Michael's own life, something that most people did not know about then. <br /> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> The true influence comes from middle-aged women and soccer moms. They seem to think of him as Jesus personally sometimes. but all that I see in Oprah is the great ghetto woman who made it big, and shows how she works. I'm happy that it shows that he will come soon. we need good television programs.
