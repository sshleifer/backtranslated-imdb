This film has a special place in my heart as the worst movie I saw. It's about fun like working hard manual and abdominal stomach. The movie starts bad (I would rate the first few minutes of the 1/10 film) and then get the worst step, a minute for a minute. The only way to measure all the time will be some kind of rotation with a negative number that is up to ninety minutes, long. Unfunny is not a real word but describes humor in this video. Somehow the video will even make good kids, hiding women and sex seem to be worried and worried. This movie is amazingly bad. I would like to say it would be better to close the TITANIC theme to play regularly and to Buscemi's behavior from ESCAPE FROM LA droning on your ear than to watch this film. Sequels are not nearly as bad. If you have to rent a Troma film, find Tromeo and Juliette or Fight Shock. I would like to look at the five of Tony Little back behind to see the CLASS of NUKEM HIGH again. Do not make a mistake, it took some kind of criminal skills to make this movie awesome and if the movie deserved a prize for being bad, this is what.
