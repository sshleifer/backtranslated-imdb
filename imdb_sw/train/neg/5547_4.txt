ZOMBIES (2 external stars 5) No, this is not a grandfather lost to the history of George A. Romero zombie flicks. This is a potboiler under the budget in 1936 which appears to be very cool for the audience of time ... but it seems to be common to these days. There is really a very beautiful place at the beginning of a soldier to run his pistol into a nearby zombie soldier approaching ... and almost a shot goes into the open chest of one of them. The effect seems to be fake today but in 1936 I am sure he had an audience using. The story involves finding the secret of mind control ... by creating an unprecedented zombie army ... but later as a way of character to win a woman he loves. The movie is not recommended one hour long but it goes to the speed of the snail so it seems the height of the element, you believe! There really isn't much to recommend ... you can find amusement from the faked studio of the "wading" star via "rock". The latter is amazing ... so I would say the movie fits to see at least once. More likely you will see as an additional feature for the cheapest "4 movies on 1 DVD" to assemble on Wal-Mart for five buchu. Hey, it's worth the money ...
