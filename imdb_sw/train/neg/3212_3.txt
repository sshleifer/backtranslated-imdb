I am a great fan of a series of comic book, but this film fell under my expectations. I expected the Heavy Metal 2000 to feel ..... moving slowly, bad conversation, lots of blood ... but this was worse than something I could think. <br /> <br /> The line of the plot is the same as comic, but very good points to stop there. The characters do not have the energy or spirit that attracted my attention to the comic series. The movie only covers a small part of the comic, and the parts used are slower and boring than later parts. The view in the film is about non-trivial events rather than the most interesting plot of the comic book. And the right people who work on this project, would be amazing. Sadly, it was not that way, so now there is another bad movie that few will see and even a few will like. My text will surely collect dust for years until finally it throws it out.
