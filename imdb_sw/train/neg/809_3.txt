I expected a little thing from "K-911", I mean it looked like a good movie that I could enter. I always loved comedy movies of dogs. But it looks like it was supposed to be a movie of Jame, not Jerry Lee. The plan was very good and the two interests of love had no chemistry to begin. Not to mention that James appeared to have a sexual perspective in the movie even though the author was not going in the same direction. James just took me away more than half of the film. Dogs were real stars and that's very sad that they shone out actors. So, I'm glad I'm not just the IMDb who admits that this was a good stupid movie. But hopefully, James will know who is his brother Jim who was talented, no fault, but not everyone can be their brother of stars. Do you want Ashlee Simpson to take that advice? : D <br /> 3/3
