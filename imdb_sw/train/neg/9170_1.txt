The question, when someone sees this bad movie, is not necessary, "How is this movie done?" or even, "Why did I see this bad thing in the first place?" but, "What have I learned from this experience?" Here's what you learn: <br /> <br /> - Just because the "rules" of movies fear that listing and satirized too many times over the past ten years doesn't mean someone can't go ahead and make a movie that uses ALL of them, without pleasing to humor or anger. <br /> <br /> - If your movie should be defined as ** free of charge ** according to the video game, you have problems with the script. . The black character may always die first, but the Asian character does not always know kung-fu <br /> <br /> - When you can be proud that figured out how to make a "Matrix effect" on the budget, which doesn't mean you should use it again and again the nail advertisement <br /> <br /> - .. to be Ron Howard's no guarantees responsibility responsibilities <br /> <br /> - Each area does not edit together, just use some show from video game, no one will notice . If your cousin rap-metal band offers you write your film topics for free, decently decline. <br /> <br /> - Zombie movies are not many people kill zombies. They are on zombies kill people, preferably in the worst way possible. That's what makes them scary /. White people who can pay $ 1600 get rave deserved death <br /> <br /> - If you find an old book, it will tell you. everything you need to know. Anything else you will learn in your own verses after someone asks, "What was it?" or, "Where are we?" <br /> <br /> - Bare breasts are not afraid movie cure / <br /> -. A helicopter boom shot with a licensed program to Sega magically transforms your film from the "student film" to "large release label". Try it! Just because you can name all-three "Living Hai" movies, that doesn't make you George Romero. Or even Paul W. S. Anderson. <br /> <br /> I've seen the worst movies, but just because I've got "Mortal Kombat: Annihilation."
