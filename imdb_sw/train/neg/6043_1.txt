you have to see my views on many films under Evren Buyruk .. I have to give some comments on a film that is not even worth speaking even though. This film is two hours of the attitude of Dafoe drinking yourself - almost real - to death . The only surprise in this film is that he did not have enough signs or skills to be surprised. It was a bad, sad waste of time. <br /> <br /> Willem Dafoe is an excellent actor. Peter Stormare is an excellent actor. But this film just played. Slowly does not make a bad movie, it was very bad. The artwork mixed with artistic ramblings of an intimate detail of the namorphic does not relate to each other in a meaningful way except to show a certain year which is shown in several ways, eventually at the end. I am very excited about the artistic vision, but as a entertainment, it puts me to sleep. (To a great extent, I slept and I had to watch the film again - which was the most horrible.) I usually don't like to make a negative view or comment on the work of others, even when they are finished, but this film is a bit. It is so bad that these chief executives were ashamed of this final outcome.
