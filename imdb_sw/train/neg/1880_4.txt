Despite being a big fan of Fred Astaire movies and Ginger Rogers, it was not until 6 years ago that I first saw 'Follow Fleet'. I knew all songs from the old record of Astaire / Rogers (yes, vinyl) but it doesn't know anything of the plot. Unfortunately, when the songs are attracted to the behavior of Ginger Rogers are beautiful and wonderful, you can't be like 'Baker Baker'. While trying to make her long-term partner, she continues to sabotages her work. Her character does not have the usual sense of humor of the other actors of Astaire film. <br /> <br /> You should watch the songs and the great pipe of the solo tube with Ginger Rogers.
