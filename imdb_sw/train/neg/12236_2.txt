Just this should not be done. Possible and clichéd. In the screen of the screen that has made the first "My Girl" very attractive is not available here, and acting in general is beaten and forced. Writing also leaves a lot of recommendations, some 'unrecognized' verses such as “enjoying bad habits” are just amazing. Where "My Girl" convinced a real sense of sadness and some time of real pleasure, such as many sequels "My Girl 2" tries to restore these feelings produced by the audience, and fails to disappoint. Maybe I get hard on this film because of how it was first big, but honestly testifies to the quality of nature and the type of drivel this phase of high service. Surely this comes closer to the "Son of the mask" as being one of the worst sequels at all. In all these cases, the old words are true; "if you do not break, do not destroy it".
