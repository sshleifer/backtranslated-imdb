Written by the best McGovern and directed by this film Frears was a little disappointing. It seemed very short. It took a long time to create the atmosphere of Hovis, and laugh at the Catholic demands. Then very quickly you have retired and intellectuals, and a terrible conclusion. <br /> <br /> My wife still thought Liam was good.
