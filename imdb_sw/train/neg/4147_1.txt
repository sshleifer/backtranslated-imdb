I am a bright fan of awesome movies, whatever cheesy and low right of ignorance is my game. So imagine my spirit I went to the local rent store, and found Vampires vs Zombies. The name is just entertainment, you know that no one in the world can pull something like that, it just must be bad. <br /> <br /> And the boy, it's BAD. After watching this fear-ific film, I did not have words, in fact. I and my pal were out without saying a word for every minute, all of us thinking about the future of our life after watching this film. I broke silently with words, "... dude .... What?" Yes, I am a fun person. <br /> <br /> Here's a quick 'review road' Plot; No, however, forever, always in "WTF" mode. Characteristics; No development, forgetting. Music; Worse than porn. Vampires; Vampires? Zombies; Zombies Its? > Everyone should see this film, honestly, is very bad to see again. So make yourself a permit, watch and see Depression.
