Anyone who wrote this script of this film should not work for Hollywood at all (even live there), and those executives need to find another job. The most horrible hour and a few minutes of my life ... and I kept looking to look like it would be better than that, unfortunately for me was not. <br /> <br /> Even at the end, credit I worry. I think there were not many people behind the film so they had to download the credit slowly ... slowly. <br /> <br /> This movie is definitely great "How Not Doing Movie" guide. Not bad I can give 0.
