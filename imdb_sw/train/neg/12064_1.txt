This is one of the most horrible films I have ever seen, since it is so bad God, John Carradine has a limited screen time. All characters are boring, and the story is awesome, as well as I could see two twists in last summer miles away! Setting a good and angry house would certainly have helped if it was not so very interesting, and no one-rooted habit of either, plus I hope it makes a way down to 100, because it deserves to be there in my opinion. When John Carradine finally shows at the end, it is a very good place but it is already too late, and sometimes the screens he had was in photography, as well as the unique event in the film is when the character receives his hiped face by bees as it was bad. I have found this in the free DVD setup called Back From the Grave and everyone struggles in my opinion, with this fortune it was installed in the set I bought otherwise I would like to wipe out the window! This is one of the most horrible films I have ever seen, since it is absolutely a god, John Carradine has a limited time screens, and I say avoid as a blow! You don't want to go through suffering. The direction is quite awesome! Carl Monson is doing a terrible thing! work here, and do everything looking cheaper, losing its ability to do at least the sky and just put the film at incredibly lightly speed. Work is very bad. John Carradine is good at its location, but others then he is difficult in other films then flashback scenes. (Carradine is born !!). Merry Anders triumphs here as much as Laura, for he did not influence even me. Ivy Bethune is the same, and is somewhat creepy, but also affected, she had a creepy smile at the end though. The rest of the cast, I did not have enough attention, if I had many problems to enter, but all were very bad. In general please try this, It's not worth it! BOMB out of 5
