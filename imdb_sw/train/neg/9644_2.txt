First thing first. In this first kind of film what you need is a good music, and that's where Mr. Shankar and his party fail. <br /> <br /> The music is completely open and worthless. On the other hand AJAY DEVGAN, WHO has removed 'A' from its spelling, did a good job but did not use it for the wrongly hit movies like this. <br /> <br /> ASIN is like a doll that is used to despise the public, although she is good looking but her role in the movie is playing, in fact she is playing a rock member port and I don't think any rock port that there is a dancer as a member of band. <br /> <br /> in this shell shell this movie is a piece of crap piece of *** t. see if you want to mislead.
