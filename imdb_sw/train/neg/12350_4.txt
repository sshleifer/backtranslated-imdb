Hmmm ... where to start? What? The great actor like Demi Moore is involved in the trick? "First blood" can be counted as a cow t t but this kind of lie is only rambo and tits, sure. Of course if you are interested in a trick (Demi Moore just wants to prove that a woman can be part of the NAVY Seal) which is a shadow of stupidity that I can imagine, you will say "GI Jane" is a great movie. Just the performance from Viggo Mortensen made this film bear but hell, I can imagine Demi Moore being Rambo (especially not at the end, free, 30 minutes). Ridley Scott does not deserve credit for making the same film that comes to the same right women, it is just a non-brain propaganda to the US army and making it more attractive to leaving Moore in it. Bad movies.
