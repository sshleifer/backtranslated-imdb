I, how powerful have fallen. Kim Basinger is a good actor but he was obviously declining when he took this position. This film is bad for one particular reason: it ceases in logic. It seems like one of those movies that could be approved by its conspiracy holes as it would have been in the 80's and 90s but only in 2008 it seems only stupid. This is the worst excitement that I have ever seen and have seen the Bones and Bricks. <br /> <br /> The story of the story Della (Kim Basinger) is just getting from buying gifts in gold stores is disturbed by a gang of robbers who end up killing a soldier that helped him. Since then he is chased by these stupid goons through the abandoned road and he removes them directly from the toolbar full of tools. Many things differ from this film. As I said this film on the logic on both sides and except Kim Basinger, the actor has been done on bad TV. Hell, this pseudo thriller has been made to bad TV. How he kills each of these political political strokes (1 Waauria, 1 Puerto Rico, 1 Asia and 1 All American Americans are coming along with a woman's Caucasia woman. Isn't it just to love America?) It is laughable for a mistake. The way he killed a Puerto Rico man made me laugh hysterically. The sexual part and the main hoodlum was out in the left field which makes you shake your head in shame. I only recommend to the movie lovers and no one else. Anybody else especially Kim Basinger's fans will do well with this flick. You don't want to see an actress in this bad movie now you do? Of course no. You were warned.
