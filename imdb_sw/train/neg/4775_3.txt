What a complete waste of time. The movie begins as an attachment to the series of Saw, but for the worst. Melissa Joan Hart is quite awesome. The latter is ignorant and the story does not include, not the surprise of the plot and only the worst. I liked some characters and I was hoping everything to be bound together at the end. It doesn't just give. It is a total of "Wrestler" which can not do a good job. I can't believe I spent time watching this. It is not “happy” as some people put it. The boy in the mask catches people who are connected and enable them to count it. Connecting is stretch and must shoot the main actor first.
