This third Darkman was obviously better than the second, but still worse than the original movie. What made this better than D2 was the fact that Guy Mbaya had been changed and Durant did not come back. Additionally there was a sense of character development when it came to the bad family of the young and Darkman himself. This has made my heart soft and I gave this flick as 4/10, ie ** / *****.
