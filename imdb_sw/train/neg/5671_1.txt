If you would like to see the animals cooked on the skin, their heads were beaten, the clans of the dogs have destroyed my men blowing on them, then this is for you! But if you're normal, and you don't need to see a real picture of animal cruelty, go through this one. This film tries to shock the viewer, and it certainly does not. For animals at the beginning, and the killing of children in the movie (fake at least) it was enough to unlock it. The picture should not be allowed in a terrible movie. to warn these types of rubbish films for people to win; t be surprised by it. As a very horror fan, this has turned my stomach. The entire movie sent by employees needs their heads to be selected.
