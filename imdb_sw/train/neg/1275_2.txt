This is a bad movie. All three stories are linked to the hypnotist line of mental surgery that is not needed and all stories are bad. The first is about a wolf and a certain woman, there are some things that do not care, but the hypnotism thing does it. The second thing, with Bill Paxton as bad as a spiritual partner should not be viewed by anyone. The last, sadly better is almost incomprehensible which I think makes it better than other trash.
