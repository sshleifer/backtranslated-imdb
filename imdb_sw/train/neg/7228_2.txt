Good: <br /> <br /> The color scheme is effective. Good clothes. Production of the maximum set. Detailed buildings of CGI and cars. The worst! CGI executives seem to be worse than video games from a few years ago. Logic caused. The big pyramid shows and nobody is screaming, no one asks them? And there is no explanation of why god Horus was even thrown out, nor was there any reason why he should do something as small as the impregn Jill? Ugly: <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Mystery. Many unnecessary publications and many ideas that are not fully understood. The discussion was somewhat for some points. Common characters and events that are not needed. The weak characters. Jill is supposed to be this secret, but it seems that he was just a secret to the author. There is nothing to him. He is unhappy and loves to watch. He has no substance, no texture. His character does not have the characteristics of redemption. In fact, there is no single character in the entire film that has any purpose, any goals (rather than one obvious Horus), any incentive. They are weak and miserable. No columns - key to write screen. Horus will not be alive, but, a great deal, he is a bad man. One cannot even know if Horus or Jill is the main character. That is the problem: giving half of the film to each character means the author does not fully comply with one character, never brings one to fruition. They are a paper cut card that circles and talks and they have nothing but explore the well-designed pieces. Director of the first time pacing. Decrease, slow, slow. I'm still watching the film as I write this. I can't pay attention because it is boring. Everything is flat. Even the action is not interesting because it is temporary and sometimes not recommended. <br /> <br /> Total: <br /> <br /> Not applicable hour. Threadbare's story, the promotion of lower characters, the CGI of Corny does not keep good production.
