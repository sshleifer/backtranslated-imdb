I do not give many credence to the theory of the AIDS plot but it is social interesting to see it done. In the early years of AIDS, suffering and paranoia of fear and death often produce such a fantasase. This was especially true in the world of the world's radical and romantic world of San Francisco. The city, known for its beauty, has been rarely seen in this film. Feelings of darkness and destruction surround the area. When work and conspiracy cannot say that they are fully carried out in the cultural and emotional environment of the darkest darkness at least partly destroys the film. True, I have seen the most spectacular performance of Irit Levi as a Jewish pastor, ignorant (?) Of the police. Surprising, though not a lobby. Important things: The use of a very effective painous Turandot film is an effective motif and there is quietly happened with an iconic artist, Ron Athey.
