Resnais, wow! The artist who brought us to Hiroshima Mon Amour takes the challenge of making the 1930 French music in powerful colors. The opening of the old roles, made was a good touch. Then the opening of the camera opens (such as old hand belts) on black and white dishes. The camera returns (or rather, over), suddenly shows us the amazing elegant colors of the prestigious table set for the tea party. This is all in the first 60 seconds. <br /> <br /> Then music begins. Instead of banal and forgetful collaborations with the unresponsive girls of three girls who refuse the impression of the film (and yes, I speak French, so I can't blame it on the headings). The characters are outside the door and are replaced by many people who enter the song even more to forget. Then they leave, and eventually Audrey Tautou is seen and we hear our first conversation about 15 minutes on the film. <br /> <br /> I do not know what Resnais aims to begin with such destruction of time and music cacophony. But the impact on the viewer is to make you want to blow the skittles on the screens and the wind. I endured. It didn't get much better. I'll tell you why. There is absolutely no skill and any characters. We can't even see their faces half a while (as Resnais seems to be very keen to show off the expensive cost of caring about real people in front of the camera). People are stepping off and leaving as far as the moths next to the lights, and we listeners cannot focus on anyone or plot. It's like you should take every part of the Brady Valley and reinforce the movie for 2 hours. One thing that has watched him as long as I did (1 hour) is that I watched the camera, lighting and environment all the way it was, I agree, better. But is that enough to hold your attention for 2 hours? Not me. Maybe tomorrow I'll try to look at the end. Aw, who am I doing. I have the most important things to do. I'm sure you do too. Skip this.
