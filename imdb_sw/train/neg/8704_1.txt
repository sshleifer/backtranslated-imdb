In general I like dinosaur movies but this is pure skin. No script, no discussion, does not apply. And the brave Colonel Rance tries to show that it is tough and thus blowing his mouth identical to the brother of the twin's twist to the Police Academy. So this was a complete waste of time (fortunately not to lose money as I saw the film on TV). And I certainly can't understand 7 people who did sh sh. T 10. They should beat joked. My advice, if you see this head running!
