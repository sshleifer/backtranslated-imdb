I found myself in this movie, at least at the beginning, and any loan I give to this film, is Lacey Chabert, was wonderful! But that's where. I seem to be very good at knowing who the killer is, and I love when the movie can hit me completely, but I felt out and converted, they all the time leading you in one direction and then suddenly decided to go in a completely different direction at the end, they had no feeling anyway , that did not cheat writing and bad plans, one did not really think! I heard the movie would have been better if they had come to the point of guiding, they also seemed to have no answer, why Jane (maria) burned the professor's house. <br /> <br /> It is a great pity if I felt like starting a good movie.
