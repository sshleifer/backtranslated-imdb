Let me first say that I love Western stories and Civil War. I also see John Ford as a good director. I also have the same impression of the capacity of the acting John Wayne & William Holden. I can't remember if I saw this film when it first came out in 1959. Last night it was the first time I saw it since then. <br /> <br /> According to my 4 rating, one can say I did not like the movie. <br /> <br /> Now I will try to say some of its limitations. </ <John Lee Mahin who wrote screens from Harold Sinclair's novel, was a very talented writer and wrote a lot of good scripts, this script is well written and not very focused. They say the state of Andersonville prison, During the movie Andersonville was not working. They also use guns that were not used at the time. <br /> <br /> John Ford was leading the film for more than 40 years & won Oscars 4. He should be sick when doing it. It could have been this film in the south and east and not in Monument Valley. Normally he had a stock company of the players he used almost all his film, MOST were lost at this time. At this time only a small cowboy cowboy Hoot Gibson & Ken Curtiss are responsible and of course Anna Lee has a small role. There were no other faces known except for 3 stars (see below) Mr. Fords stock company made over his classic film were; Forgets here. We are now the main star John Wayne & William Holden. Duke must also be ill, appeared out of this place. This kind of role usually fits his style perfectly, was just enough here. Wiliam Holden did the best she could, but there was no good place as it was. <br /> Needed to be a film actor in this type of film. Here in his first major role (second film) is Constance Towers, a very good man, but not a real actor, He still has responsibilities on television. Let me have mercy and say he has had a long career, more than his direction than making a talent. Also in the caas as a servant of Ms Towers is tennis tennis Althea Gibson.I like to cling to tennis. All production loans were far from the standard of other Ford videos. A few military songs that are considered by the horse of the demonstration, are not quite good. Work events were good but they came to the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Ratings * 1/2 * (out of 4) 47 points (out of 100) IMDb 4 (out of 10)
