Very bad movies. Say damage to time. <br /> <br /> background music is so great that you can't understand the speech. Well if you listen carefully, whatever they say is certainly not known. <br /> <br /> The camera function is bad, editing does not exist, the background color provides a headache, the action is shoddy, unknown conversation, working is bad and well Kareena was looked like a winner, now looked like a wrestler hungry. Hell can be a little less but you can't find grace. <br /> <br /> After spending three hours watching the movie I like to love, but this film can't allow even that fun. <br /> <br /> If you want to suffer yourself, keep checking this.
