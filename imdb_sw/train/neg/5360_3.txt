"Nada" was an improper follow-up "Les Noces Rouges" which, by hindsight, appears now as the last beautiful movie of the golden era of Chabrol (1967-1973) "Nada" is the first attempt of Chabrol in a completely political movie, His original work "Rouges Noces" also had political elements but was more exciting psychological and casual look for the community in the French regions. "Nada" includes terrorists, ambassadors, take hostage, bloodshed, not actually Chabrol's field.To give a typical film gives a revolutionary film: Duchaussoy alone, who had already played with the director, and Maurice Garrel faced .Viviane Romance, one of Duvivier actors ("La Belle Equipe" "Panique"), lost as madam (Gabrielle). Italian actors (Fabio Testi, Lou Castel) are bad. It is "Nada" this is the second period of good inspiration for Chabrol .It will be "Violette Nozi√®res" before being again on its game.
