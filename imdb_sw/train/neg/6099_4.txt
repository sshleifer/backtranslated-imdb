This was a lively exciting movie I saw amongst the classic Turner Classic movies. When the film came out because of the very powerful Technicolor, the film itself was not moving and sometimes the conspiracy seemed to be very good - if this was done for class use and focus on the overall audience focus. In particular, how often I hated in the films mentioned - as the characters spoke to him, they often said "Clara Barton" instead of "maam", "Miss Barton" or "Clara". Also, one patient who was ill said that he was "Johnny Reb, A Confederate Rebel, ..." - almost as if he was a cartoon character Mojo Jojo from Powerpuff Girls. It was time to write for a long time. It was interesting to see John Hamilton (later, "Perry White" at the SUPERMAN TV festival) on the beard as President Garfield. Yep - it's him under the beard.
