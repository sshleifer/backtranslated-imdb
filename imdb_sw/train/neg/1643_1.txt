"Obstacle" is one of the worst films of all time. It is, a piece of hate that hated me forcing me to stay in the theater more than any 2000 movie, rather than perhaps "Grinch." It is not, if people have called it, a picture of modern understanding. That would be a small film called "Higher Honesty." Though the film was honest and sympathetic, "they were beaten" is hate, pride, misanthropic poisoning of the cinema. Avoid this as many events, unless you want to see how bad "comedy" can get.
