I don't know a lot about making movies, but beautiful movies say a certain story ... your characters should start and complete their journey. In From End to Brooklyn they may, but not in any satisfactory way, and I don't mean to end up happy, only ANY end up. <br /> <br /> Last Exit Brooklyn, setting 1952 Brooklyn at the very strongest strike of brutality, puts a number of keys to the story in motion. Many involve some of the most unrelated characters ever walking on the screen screen. But the last edition in Brooklyn could not bring these stories to any conclusion ... it leaves some of them blowing without end, or striking through a wonderful stratosphere at the end of "art". for sure, and some trophies. The worst transvestite behavior (a key character in the film), facing a car and killed. And that's for him in the film .... he went well, removed from everyone's memory .. and effect from his friends, enemies, lovers .... nothing. <br /> <br /> In another foolish thread, clueless, and the leader of the homosexual strike, after the rejection of employment, his gay, and found by neighboring robbers, gets knees. The closure of the war shows the streets of Brooklyn, and the roads are very similar to the Nazi death camps ... and the area around you continues to ... and the camera pans under the body of the work leader, and he has been crucified. .... ppppuuuulllleeeeeez. And of course it is for him too .... brain causes ..... go. Under the bottom .... no matter what the pastors said in 1989 about this film ... this movie is a piece of sludge. Avoid. And if you predict it, it is eligible for NC-17 for a large amount of physical, emotional and sexual violence ... don't enable young people to look at them.
