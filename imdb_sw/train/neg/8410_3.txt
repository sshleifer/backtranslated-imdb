This movie is flash and no spirit. The executives placed a lot of interest in the number, but often these were not connected to the film and felt like music videos to stand up. And no effort has been made to make the numbers sound as it is in front of you, each looks like coming from the label, basically sucking all life from the songs. Apart from the exhibition all the exhibitions were lightweight and not made, especially Hudson, who basically plays the same anger, "power" (he is stubborn and selfish) the black woman we have seen earlier. There was no depth of character, nor any woman is leading. Although I think the movie wants us to believe that Hudson's behavior is struggling because of its weight, it is really a refusal to do her to do the best for the team that is troubling her, and the end of the film is completely useless. The Hudson Academy Award is a joke, there was no justice. While he was singing, he gave the impression (although it was often misled, but this was an error of the author / director), but when he was just doing, he did nothing to the old written character. Eddie Murphy's behavior is the only one with arc, and he did a good job, but Oscar still does not deserve it. The only actor who brought something to the roll was Danny Glover, who took a small, insignificant character and did the real thing in it. There is nothing here to swallow your teeth, no drama or heart, or even laugh. The placement of musical numbers was so bad that sometimes the film seemed to be the most beautiful of music rather than one; Hudson numbers oppose other girls are too long if they could no longer pass the skirt of Family Guy. The movie does not know what it is about, and I felt tortured by the last few minutes. It's a great waste of time, and in fact it's the worst films I saw in '06, and nothing last year was actually a start.
