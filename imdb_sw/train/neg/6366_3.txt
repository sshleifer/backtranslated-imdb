There is not one thing to redeem in this film. The girl and I all like filming. Specific fighting items (Bloodsport and Kickboxer were amazing), but this film was not entertaining. The five minutes of action followed twenty minutes of speaking with "angry" face words. The great hero is the attitude of concern who has seen the war and so he has to look carefully at all times. The army has destroyed its intestine movement on completing its fighting tactics. Music is not good either. They are fighting the rap and hip-hop style of the road, because these are rodents. Another sound of sound is a natural natural sound on small budget dramas. <br /> <br /> Everything about this movie is a B-classic style. The characters provide their line as reading from cue cards and the line itself should put fire and left to the fire on the evil street of Hollywood. The film is called "Honor," but it was not polite to make this film. It was just losing money, and using it wisely is something that I think is respected. <br /> <br /> Go see Felon instead. Combat cases are more realistic.
