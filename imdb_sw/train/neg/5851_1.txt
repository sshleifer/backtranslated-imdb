I am convinced that Jigsaw was a hip even then, all the LSD themes married to the mystery of the murder are a clear attempt to grab the audience of the contemporary youth without any understanding of the six-year tournament. The editing feature, Jigsaw is experiencing a lot of problems, including destructive efficiency, quiet and planned conversations, LSD flashbacks for a long time even after closure at home for the first 60 seconds, failing to create any real doubts even although the real plot is, on paper, a big car to do just that, and the end of which is angry and predictable (not to mention the memory of a lot of bad television shows) that the peak is actually the anti-climax. If it is the best movie, we can stop unbelief over a few things that could help to enjoy, but weaknesses are too fierce to serve only those who are not able to stop. I saw Jigsaw on television and it is clear at the end of the night television television means filling the air space and passing the time to kill someone's sleep instead of anything anyone should look for. For better, three out of 10.
