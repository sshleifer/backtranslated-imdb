When I saw this film first I thought it would be a good film of sasquatch. Usually when you have these types of movies there is a total of ONE sasquatch, but in this there is what? 7 or 10 of them? The work was good, the plot was the same, I liked the events where sasquatch kills a few victims, a good job of the camera. I expected to be a gory film but it was very small. This movie was better than Sasquatch. The SCI-FI center needs to make more films of sasquatch, which means I loved Sasquatch Mountain, Abominibal was not good, the one I look at is right, but the Sasquatch movie was not, but I don't look so I would like to come back on track. This movie is good for the afternoon Saterday afternoon, but at any time, no.
