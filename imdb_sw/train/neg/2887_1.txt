I just watched this film today and not just, it's awesome and horrible but it seems like the director just got a few friends together to make a film about a sick person. I also think that this film looks for video video and vivid image view of the image. Thank you the heavens I work on the video store and I didn't have to pay because this film is crap x infinity..HUSUUUUU OR A MOVIE HU! You would like to have a good time to watch the Dude Which car is more than this piece! And that doesn't say much for that movie. <br /> <br /> Acting is lousy and the movie is very unknown. I was watching this film and I wanted to commit suicide when and behind the film. I went home and threw it after watching this dirty film, then I took and lit my clothes. If I had half of the mind I would like to take a movie out there and want it also to cause a person not to be under it ... well maybe the members of Al Queda. of the officers .... just make it as an orange clock work, and then give them a cheese head so that you look at it regularly.
