I have changed the 700 club only once and accepted only some of the text made - I am one of the many believers who are considered free to many Christians and conservative and many non-Christians. I blow my mind, and usually not rep. or dem. - I don't believe the 700 club tells people what to believe, but it represents many older Christians who grew up in a very conservative environment. I think most people don't understand what it says in the 700 club. I think the people of 700 clubs love to love Jesus but are very busy trying to make people vote correctly that they forgot to show love to certain people and promote peace as Jesus did. Please do not judge Jesus based on ignorant people who believe in him and not be as ignorant and our views on them. Why are people so intimate?
