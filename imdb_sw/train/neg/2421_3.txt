and the attempt of this ABC family of blockbuster to hit "cheap and a dozen" comes the amount of damage to corny talks, unknown copper lines, and come to cheesy. And about two good actors among the most want-to-be, this movie was a great disappointment. It is a Hollywood-wannabe song of a ready plot. Then, because they needed many executives, that meant they could be more intelligent. So acting was not five stars. The plan moved very fast, and the deviation was bad and there was a terrible time. The collection of characters and "last relations" were also mushy and clich√©d to me. Keep yourself and hire something better.
