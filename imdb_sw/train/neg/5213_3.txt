As others have said, this film is similar to FLY (two versions) and a small flick of the Flick ALTERED STATES. The main difference is that the two movies were well done by people who knew what they were doing and pleased. METAMORPHOSIS did not have these benefits. METAMORPHOSIS is a fascinating story of fantasy science that had inaccurate and ineffective people. * Stories follows the scientist Dr. Peter Houseman (Gene LeBrock), a man who strives to work on the genetic therapy of aging and death. While the university is working to threaten to cut money, she decides to replace the anti-aging serum in it. As a result, Dr Houseman uses another part of the movie to turn slowly into a lizard. And yes, looking at a good doctor through the process of being a lizard is great fun. In fact it's so bad that it's good. Some lines are normal: "WHAT IS?" "Emergency ... from the past!" Most of the reviews that I have read this step on how stupid and ignorant the last five minutes of this film are. I will go ahead and destroy it: a good doctor goes from a semi-half man, half a lizard's effort to be what appears to be a man in a Godzilla rejected dress, where police finally seek him. In the last area, a child who feels like a little lizard who claims that he will never die, and the film heroine, Sally Donnelly (Catherine Baranov) decides that the little fool is the last body of Dr. Houseman. Then the camera gives us near the face of the fool; this is, I think, the way of director to show us that the fool is bad. Yes, it's a sudden, but I fell on laughter so I can't complain. I watched this film because it was part of the Chilling Classics 50 Movie Megapack which I bought. I am sure many of those who read this did the same thing, if 50 packs are the only way to see this film on DVD. If you have played a set of boxes and didn't watch this movie yet, it is really worth your time, even if I have destroyed the last one. It can also be easy to get this film online free of charge.
