In general I do not like the films led by Sydney Pollack ("Firm" as much of discrimination) and have never been a fan of Robert Redford either. Still, I thought "Three days of Condor" should be good because of the number of praise views that it received. Although the movie is very interesting for the eye and Max von Sydow does well as a professional singer, I have seen the whole thing has broken the heart. The film confirms the state of paranoid, but everything is destroyed by the soil plot that does not seem to have any feeling. The movie also has one of the exciting breaks that I have ever seen the viewer on the air. And what can you say about the amazing romance between Redford and Dunaway? I would love to watch any Hitchcock film five times in a row than to go through this piece again.
