After finally viewing this film in full, I am fully convinced of the service that has received from critics and users of the same network. What? Is the West more than ever? No, I can't say that. But "the end of the US West", the words I saw used for more time? Not near. Trying to tell him a story like this requires believing people who are talking to a reliable conversation, and a discussion in this film is between hackneyed and clich√©d which I've ever seen. Movie can be tested in groaners per minute; as it is, how often is an actor or actor forced by a script to say something that no man can say in real life? There are many cases of this that are disturbing. The cheesy line comes to the waves; predictable, unusual, and often. If bad conversation hasn't helped you, then what about bad guns? Few Westerners can show you that a weapon shock does not really believe when you try to make it take you seriously. It's okay if there is a comic edge of a weapon such as Silverado, but in a very rocky stone stone that is very complicated and very difficult to leave this movie away from the Western list. At the end you redeem the director on this score, but at the time, I was very worried in the film that was more to save. <br /> <br /> In addition to these errors, I can say that the pictures are fantastic - a well-shot movie and all the landscape look great. Acting is taken, especially based on what they have been given to actors to work with. However, if you are looking for the western end of North America, make a permit - like to hire Unforgiven instead. Over 3 out of 10
