Are I wrong, or is the 2007 version of the original version? I need to ask because the DVD I just bought is one of the worst films I have ever seen ... worst, bad editing etcâ€¦ just a feature of "exploitation" here is how we were thrown for our money to buy this piece. No more than photographing the weight of the weight ... no real year, no horrible pictures, just the garbage dropped at an affordable price. If anyone wants to see the best movies and name artists, some slimy gore and good storyline ... get Baby Blood ... also done with a cheap but well-made budget ... with real stories too! I spit was losing money but I just put it to laughter .... it's sad! New comments ... September 3 ..... I will put this film ever because it's SOOOOO bad is almost good .... in a very bad way .... The worst work ever ... movie the modern trick!
