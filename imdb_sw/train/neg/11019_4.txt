Fred Olen Ray is a good director, even though B's directors are going, but 'Haunting Fear' is one of his best films. Yes, it asks a great story of Poe 'Buried' before, and yes, it faces a lot of variation, but it is also a good entertainment. Right King Brinke Stevens is better than usual as a good housewife, a fragile husband who is worthless (Jay Richardson) tries to remove him because he needs money to pay a gangster (played by Robert Quarry). Delia Sheppard, 90 years of low-core movies, provides excellent performance in the film as a slutty wife. You will also enjoy the small responsibilities made by Karen Black as a psychic, Robert Clarke as a doctor and Michael Berryman in a beautiful comeo in one of the best scenes. The end was not very meaningful!
