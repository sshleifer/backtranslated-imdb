I have finished watching this film and WOW was bad. In fact the only thing that kept me was that it was SO SOU very bad was a kind of entertainment. The action of the perpetrators is a hilarious, due to the very high way of the fall of the gun, for their bad practice (they were all the evildoers evicted out of the road, or were actually practitioners?), For the poor delivery of lines, for their trivial actions (If you try and hit someone through the door when they come in, surely the thing to do is to hit directly in the work shop!). This film should break down several records with rough lines written and delivered. <br /> <br /> The camera function was also bad - you can't see what's going on in combat events due to changing camera angles and shakiness. <Br /> <br /> I would like to vote "1" except that I do as Chiba and sidekick Sue Shihomi, and I was welcomed by several instances: 1) break the arm of the animal so that the bone crossed out of the skin (which has effects) 2) The King of Drugs eat the brown animal (monkey ??) for hacking off in the carcass and the meat cleaver 3) Sonny Chiba make some impromptu optical surgery for the guy and toes. > <br /> I am a big fan of Sonny Chiba but this is not recommended during anyone. I have seen about 7 or 8 films of his films and I have just concluded that it is the only one worth looking at (and it's good!) It is a series of Street Fighter, and the Death Death. I have also heard the Executor and Golgo 13 is good. I recommend fighting for those.
