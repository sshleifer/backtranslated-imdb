Maybe this is not fair, because I just made it almost half a movie. One of the few movies I couldn't watch because of decay. <br /> <br /> Acting is awesome, the function of the camera is awesome, the plot is ridiculous and the whole movie is just untrue and cheesy. For example - during the coke program, coke is considered only in the region - not an expert, but I think people put it in the package. <br /> <br /> They use the same sound effects whenever the punch is thrown (it is on the top of the 'crunching' sound and uses the toy guns and dubbed in sound effects.) The worst ever.
