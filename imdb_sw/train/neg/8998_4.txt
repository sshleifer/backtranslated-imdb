Stephen Feinberg, who played Proctologist and was one of the filmmakers, was lost at the beginning of 2006. I met Steve in Portland in 1993, was the last year when he told me that he was a former Hollywood writer, more active on TV promos. He asked me not to see the 'Tunnel Vision', but it was too late, I had seen it! Actually I had seen years before, when it was released. At that time I didn't think it was a bad movie. Yet to see if my adult opinion was different. Yes it's a little puerile as well as a date. Steve admitted it was not a very good movie. He said that he had only a little pride of the 'Artist Proctor'.
