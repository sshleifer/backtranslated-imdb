Why take a show that our millions we look and loved as children and make full joke? They ask why Hollywood does not make money. Because it provides garbage and pay a lot of money administrators to be garbage and ask us to pay $ 10 to see their trash. What the television version was, good people in bad situations where the beautiful IL boys come from above. It didn't go with the Wind but it was fun. This movie is trash! Hollywood can't come up with anything earlier so they can pick up something that was good and destroy for $$$$. I only hope that this film makes less than 10x than cost. The only person who is happy with this trick is the boys who had to run General General. The audience is victims. Do not see, see the reruns of the TV show instead. They still hold 20 years later.
