Why every director of fear wants to imitate "The Exorcist" is a complete riddle to me, as "classic" of William Friedkin is a very registered film and, in my opinion, not at all or terrifying. And yet here are you clean, Spanish this time, that predicts the story of a little girl who gets clean and turned against her family. Paul Naschy (who must agree to be very hot here) who has a respected priest who is welcomed by John Gibson because his sister Leila's behavior has changed since he met his new partner. For the first time the priest did not believe but when John's body was found with his neck standing, the spirit of Leila's spirit seems more ... "Exorcism" is not just an ordinary, it is also a very unpopular film! Here Naschy and Juan Bosch's director had a clear opportunity to make the religion of genius the filling of wounds and gore, and yet the result is a good and bloodless game that will almost put you to sleep! The last twenty minutes are at a certain time of the sky, though they are very stupid, and there is a lot of female and delicate female humor. The lack of budget is not a real excuse since Paul Naschy has already proved that he has enough ideas to make money shortages. This is a bad film, the end of the story. Other Europe is "Antichrist" and "More Door" and also exploits!
