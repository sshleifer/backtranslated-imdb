In 1925, friends Marie Marie Dressler (like Maggie Warren) and Polly Moran (like Lizzie Praskins) are managing their children's wedding, Anita Page (like Helen) and Norman Foster (like John). Before the ceremony, Mrs. Dressler returns to the administration of her small city bank on her son, Lord Foster. Six years later, the Great Depression brings the closure of many banks, and financial shortages. Foster Bank can survive, due to the wise plans of the mother of Dressler. But, Mrs. Moran is worried about her luck, and loudly claims complete removal. Others "Warren Bank" customers hear rant Moran, and start questioning their own solvens. Recently, the family is located in a financial crisis. The most important and financial film of Dressler said "Emma" was released earlier this year, and MGM had to get a new film dressler as soon as possible. The 1931 dressler's dress says, "Reducing" and "Politics" were still making a lot of money; and, Dressler was the 1932 US Tower # 1 Box Office Star, according to the list of industry level developed by Quigley Publications. "Welfare" certainly celebrated the state of Dressler, but the production seems unethical, and run. Sent well, considering. Careful attention in the direction and editing, and others take, would help? apparently, they needed in the squares for the holiday.
