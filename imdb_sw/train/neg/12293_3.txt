This only gets because the star David Hasselhoff. Well, then let me. Compared to the waste that call shocking nowadays, this film is not so bad. It has beautiful Leslie Cumming. He is very bright, but he can't talk very well. There is a large area with him when he is raped. She shows her good body. Linda Blair has nothing here like Hasselhoff. 3/10
