I was trembling to take my brothers on this film, if I didn't think it would be done well. Children, ages 6 and 10 were placed to see, so I gave. I must admit that it was not as bad as I thought, but it was still a great cry from the book. The movie seemed good and aware of 10 years old with a sense of humor. I found that the 6-year-old understood what was happening and was presenting a solution to the issues that had happened. Finally I had to explain that sometimes movies do not show the best solutions to problems because it is more fun to watch what happens if you make "stupid" choices or "stupid".
