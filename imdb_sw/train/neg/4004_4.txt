As a big fan or a series of Cracker, I've been waiting for 7 years to add next. This time I just fear it does not live to the story. Fitz returns to Manchester after 7 years for his daughter's wedding and is involved in the investigation of the murder he was a soldier, suffering from the backs of his duty trips in northern Ireland, continues to be killed. <br /> <br /> What I did not like about this part is the easiest way all installed and how fitz has caused the killer. It is all fats away. <br /> <br /> There are some good events at the feet of the flash from Northern Ireland which are the biggest hit.
