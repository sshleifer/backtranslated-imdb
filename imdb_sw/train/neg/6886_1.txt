John Heder was the worst in this film. I felt like I was looking at a religious religious practice for the first time in a student film. Anna Farris was a par for the course, not good, but not bad (with him is good). Dianne Keaton should be well known. Jeff Daniels was the only one to save grace in this film (though it was a bad sentence on his side too). <br /> <br /> For all, I would like to avoid this at all costs. I am so glad I didn't pay you to see it! John Heder will be held forever in the normal role of 'baby dorky,' except he works on SERIOUS in his acting chops.
