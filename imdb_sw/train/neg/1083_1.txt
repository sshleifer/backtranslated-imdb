This film is like a real life, which I mean - not much happens in 2 hours available or so, and not too much game plans or conspiracy is proved by casting too often (their absence because of the "experiment" lighting as mentioned by the reviewers many). <br /> <br /> Weight Weight. There is no great surprise that Altman helps this - it's a very popular executive (yes we all liked "Gosford Park", but "Pret A Porter" anyone? Kansas City? Dr. T. and Women Aaargh, but the fact that raw material is the story of John Grisham, and the best cast that you will see through the sleep of your insistence sleep - makes this the center of a bad film. And no, not "very bad is good". It is very bad.
