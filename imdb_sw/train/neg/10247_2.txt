This is one of the boring movies I have ever seen, those awesome. Christopher Lee is good but doesn't have a hard time in it, the only part is the opening part. Do not lose your head. "The End of the World" is the worst movie, I stopped watching it close to the end is bad, just for fans of filmmakers who have the brain to stand this desire.
