If you are looking at Corey's great comments here on IMDb, it appears there is a film called "Reload" in production (like June '08) where he plays a character called Sebastian Cole. <br /> <br /> First, What? The movie of the trick has ever been a series ... and second, Isn't Sebastian killed at the end of "Loaded"? I looked at this during the morning when I was fighting sleep, and so I was coming out and when it was. I'm sure I missed some points of the plot, but in general, it seemed to be very weak. The great performance was (for me) one of the most powerful parts of the film. I am also surprised by all the people commenting on the beautiful girls, since I thought executive play playing Brooke was pretty, but not unique.
