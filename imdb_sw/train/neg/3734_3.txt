True non-understandable chaos. Many things in the film seem more or less like 1987, but then there are just things that were just hit, like a police gun. And that car! The director appeared to have love with colored lights. Only the only known function is a girl who played Valerie, but since there is no list of cast, I do not know what executive it was. This is a missing value. Bridge: F
