The Haunting. Mark, of course. The original was a psychological psychological stimulus, and one that has improved on time. Compared to this remake of 1999, it is classic. There is no development of behavior here, only caricatures (slut, brain power, "I'm gonna get us outta here" colleagues, oh oh the sensual bookworm). But, to see if it was a bank on a specific effect that "star", I think the characters you can feel and are worried about the secondary. Unfortunately, the effects are broken. Mewing caves, doors to stretch, irritating children who cannot speak clearly ... and idiotically sappy end that it works to give you new age of butterflies and tablets. Disease taking my skittles mouth, thank you. Bruce Dern, I love you since "Cowboys". Leave.
