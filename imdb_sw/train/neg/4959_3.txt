Remember the beautiful show of animated batman from 90's? Which people thanked them? Can people of all ages know? The one who showed the batman as a real detective instead of the Hulk in the suit of the bat? Could the offender be involved? Who had the most committed criminals? Obviously, Warner Bros do not. So this has fallen. <br /> <br /> In fact, these people know anything about batman? What? Even look at the comic of the batman before? What? Know Batman's meaning to be 'detective'? Put together 2 tips will not make you a detective! That makes you a monkey of mind! <br /> <br /> This is a basic layout for a part: <br /> <br /> Penguin steals something. 'Unlock credit'. Batman gets the death of where. Batman goes there and gets trouble. Business. Batman finds the most obvious / stupid way. Penguin runs. Penguin makes something obvious again. Batman follows. They make kung-fu (for everyone, and I mean everyone knows kung-fu for some reason). Penguin's Punch of Batman. she get it knocked out. goes arkham. (Note: it is usually a different villain every part) <br /> <br /> Good as you have seen from there, Batman is not a big detective. "Joker lost this piece of candy cotton down, maybe he is in an old amusement garden!" Maybe perhaps, he was there 6 times ago. <br /> <br /> And I said this yet, everyone knows KUNG-FU! PUNUIN! where do they think? (perhaps because it is from people who made Jackie Chan animated series) <br /> <br /> What a real failure is that the show is just a step. No smarts. Nothing. If the batman needs to reflect, he will use technology, then make kung-fu. <br /> <br /> But let's, let's forget the criminals. Later, what is the caller without his own art gallery? <br /> <br /> Well first, I can say, kudos for nature. I don't think the batman media would have the opinion of the joker and the frightened monkey-locked man, like the emo, and the kid's toxicity (which is a kind of frustration when thinking about, not his sex means that his great power? ) <br /> <br /> What even more to decorate is that, each character is now 2-Dimensional, crookotypical crook. Crocodile wants to sink to Gotham for any reason. The Bat-man is a hungry and hungry scientist who is interested in bats for some undisclosed reason. <br /> <br /> Penguin just wants to steal everything. For no reason. <br /> <br /> remember the example here? <br /> <br /> But the complaint should be Mr Freeze. <br /> <br /> Do you remember Emmy's award winning 'Ice Heart' episode from Batman: Animated Series? He who gave Mr Freeze committed his wrong? What was the best time that was used in the stories on its backward story (mad scientist)? Who made him a victim, with a purpose? Hell, even Batman & Robin agreed that, using it as Mr Freezes originated in P.O.S. movie. Well this series says "F # ck that" and makes Mr Freeze a splendid jewelry decoration before his accident, with only wealth in his mind, then gets waves and gives him the ability to do cool things. Then he continues to steal the instruments without cause, while saying the sh sh like "Have a day of ice". <br /> <br /> Maybe they watched Batman & Robin after all. But hey, look at the bright side. This series makes you feel uncomfortable for criminals so it means you are a good person. Good for you.
