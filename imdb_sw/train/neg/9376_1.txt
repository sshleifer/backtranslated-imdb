when I watched this movie I was sick. I grew up with Pippi and every time it was a real pleasure. when my wife came to Sweden was looking at oldies and had a really good laugh. but this version of America should be called again and never displayed again. it is bad from the beginning to its end. Can they manage to make it so bad? well I think someone claims ha ha ha translation translation but have never been close to Pippi. this movie may not have been seen again and it has never been sent to ads. burn movie and save children. if you want to watch Pippi then look at the original film and look good. WE ARE PIPPI INGER NILSSON, Tami Erin you can not stand to be pippi .. Yes yes .. when reading "vendors" notes, "'destroying' surprises and stealing a viewer of doubts and enjoying the film. you are watching this movie for your own risk .. it's really a waste of time ...
