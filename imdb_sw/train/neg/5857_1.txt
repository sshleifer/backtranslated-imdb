WWF's 2001 series / It'll become one of the worst events in 2001. Perhaps its great flaw was the fact that it did not follow suit for the original Survivor 's series. There was only one match of a series of graduates. And the success story series continued for 45 minutes. In addition, anyone with brain work would know that it would end with the Rock against Austin and the existing Rock. And don't enter me to preview before the event. No matter who won it was obvious that no one would go to death ***. There was no need for that kind of useless. Whatever the story, it was just an event of fighting. And for all competitions: The first match was a Christian to protect his European name against Al Snow. It was a good match for fast and beautiful to see the heel winning match correctly. William Regal against the Rich was boring and we have seen 2 or three times before. The width of the Test was good but nothing big. The names of the steel lights of the match match were the best evening evening. Royal war continued for 10 minutes and no one cares who could win the first place. The women's position was not good. No, not a bit. The main event must be a match of hypocrisy in history. The Alliance lost but think what, after 5 months each Alliance star returned. The match itself was poor. The rock was removed 3 of them and Jericho was removed 2. The rock was also catching and doing its work there when the invasion started. Jerome was the one who risked all matches. If I wanted any 2 removal in advance to be it would be theirs. Everyone knew that Kane, Big Show and Undertaker were just falling guys. 7 match is not enough for the Survivor Series. If there is ever a success series is as bad as this again I will come
