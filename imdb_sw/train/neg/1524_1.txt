The words leave me. This film was very hard to watch and to turn it really I would not have done. Although I have tried to stay to the end until the last document I agree that I could not last more than an hour, so my opinion might be fair. However, this film will require a third of the most amazing in the history of film making to be reviewed which is nothing but wrong. <br /> <br /> Please do not look at any part of this film.
