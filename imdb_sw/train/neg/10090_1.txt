This movie is a joke. I mean "ha ha" a wonderful joke. Why? Because the only thing about redemption about this was the good noise I had found during nonsensical ignorance, eighty conspiracy and acting evil. Wow! <br /> <br /> Within this film there are many unanswered questions ... for example; why do these women become zombies and how? Why are there four black women who are the "guardians" of a zombie and are their purposes? Since when 6 people make the "nation" of zombies? And is the mascara of the black eye with "black" of anyone, anywhere? Even 2 years old? <br /> <br /> And the end; Why was this film made entirely? Why? why? why? No answer? That's what I thought. At the demand center they gave this opinion after the film: We apologize for this movie earlier "LOL. At least they had the skill to do so much!
