I read the other half of the user's comments on this board and it looks like the views are very different. I agree with those who found this film bad. It hurt me to write that since I would have this hope it would be good, or I had no trouble seeing it the other day. I would like to support indie movies, especially if they are gay-themed, but this film is very close to you. Those who walked out, as I thought to do after three minutes, probably didn't mind to run $ 11.00, or just consider that it didn't go anywhere, quickly, and not going to improve. Maybe I hope a little more than they ... however or they did not pay to enter the first place. <br /> <br /> Logan is bored. He is klutz. He is gay. I'm okay with that. The problem is that because the main character in the movie is bored doesn't mean that the movie about him should be boring too! There is no end to this child just as close as the load of cleaning, restarting everything that you have already learned in the first place, and the second location, etc., etc. ... No one says anything even with a distance to understanding or funny or interesting. Probably more surprising is that I don't feel a little bit of sympathy for Logan. That is a great success. He did not grow, did not change, did not learn (no one to teach him anything), he did nothing, nor did the movies happen! The view after one event is not a film. Additionally, the head is completely meaningless. 1/10.
