In spite of being honored on the DVD cover I had borrowed, this film was disappointing. Yes, it is more true than other films of the show of the mud, patience and frustration of the collector, but unfortunately someone comes off and thinks it is ALL this movie. No plot and talk is monotonous. It is not that a good war video needs to have a battlefield every five minutes. One of the best films of World War II, "Twelve O'Clock High," has a very small step. But it spends a terrible discussion and psychological tension. In addition to "G.I's Story" Joe is a small part of the war (titled "The City of Inquiry" on DVD) which takes place in Italy. It is certainly one of the most fighting events and influential any movie of war. But alas, all the film should not only look at this display. Another exit is Pvt. Dondaro, played by Wally Cassell, who is meant to be "romeo" but comes off. For comparison, Sgt. Warnicki is a kind person, if it's wrong. As he says to Capt Walker (Mitchum) while volunteering for another patrol: "Every step forward is a step closer ... go home." But that last step? a single patrol? leads him on the brink of the mind. The worst of the film does not do the right to touch the other better. As for the appearance of Meredith's Pyle ... it is unrelated practically.
