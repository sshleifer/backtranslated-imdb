I hate it to rain on the parade (even as much as this) but from the very first place, you can tell this film would be exactly the same. It's a real shame, as I like Martin Freeman and Danny dyer. I was wondering about how they could combine in the film together, but with my frustration, they had no place together! I think I need to repeat this - two leading administrators (who stand on the side of advertising advertising and DVD devices) did not have one place together! They didn't talk and never seen on the screen at the same time. Welcome about this bad calculation for the movie. False advertising. The talk was painful, every one character in the movie was untrue, and no one-like. These events were strangled, the plot was stuck, the joke was thin, Freeman tried to be very hard (and played by the poor Tim from the Office), nobody liked it, and worse, some of the characters were so angry that almost moved me out because I can't focus on looking, or listening again. <br /> <br /> This low-budget stinker was a failure of epic. Even Danny Dyer could not impose humor and charm in this, but the blessing, he tried. What a waste of time. <br /> <br /> How anyone can measure this movie as 'ten stars' is more than me. Ten stars? Seriously? Come .... I can't even give some ten stars, as ten stars indicate that the film was perfect. This film was far away, almost opposite, meaning it was almost entirely. See if you like, but if you see a lot of movies, and look at a lot of good movies, your review will look like me. </ 1/1 / / 1/10
