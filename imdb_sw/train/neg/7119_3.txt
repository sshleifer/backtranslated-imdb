* SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> I am sure when this was released in 1958 it was right for its time. Then the film was slowed down to allow the audience to follow and analyze the story. Here one enters the house owned by his last wife who died secretly with his new wife. Mickey gardener (played by Alex Nicol, who also led the film) is actually an unknown character. She gets a skull to tell Jenni to be in trouble, because she knew there was evil in the death of the first wife. He cannot tell Jenni directly what happened, so he tries to shock him with a skull. Jenni, we also see, saw her parents die, leading to a life-threatening mental illness. As many listeners today, I've pacing that very little to my taste. But if you would like a fearless speed without a lot of gore, this film is for you. <br /> <br />
