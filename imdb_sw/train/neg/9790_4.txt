At least less than ten years old will remain committed. Eleanor (Geena Davis) and Fred (Hugh Laurie) Few, a good couple of good people decided to bring home from a young orphan to their child George (Johnathan Lipnicki). They come home with a wonderful new brother ... bright wearing a little mouse called Stuart (shown by Michael J. Fox). Yes, the mouse. Stuart is happy that he has seen the meaning of the property even if it is in a vast world with his new family of Snowbell sheep (shown by Nathan Lane). Stuart includes the experience of family loyalty and general friendship. George finally admits his younger brother when the dapper wearing Stuart saves the embarrassment in the fashion boat race. Also in jail: Julia Sweeney, Harold Gould, Estelle Getty and Jeffery Jones. And the sounds of: Chaz Palminteri, Bruno Kirby and Jennifer Tilly.
