Where to start? The special effects should be called special defects, when the director shouted "action" I think he also showed the executives to do the worst work they thought. Perhaps he was angry with the producers and wanted to make sure that they would not be able to get one percent out of their investment and that the work would be a case study of how to make a movie. Or perhaps he hated the school of art and wanted to become a accountant but his family did not allow him. The only thing that is sure that anyone who uses it in the future is because he has a love for her (so his procedures went through the window) or because he changed his name and deleted all previous memories.
