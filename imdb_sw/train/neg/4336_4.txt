I watched this film and the original carlitos back to Carlitos. The difference between the two is disgusting. Now I know that people will say that prequel was made to a small budget but didn't have anything to do with a bad script. Now maybe it's just me, but I always thought that prequel was made to introduce another movie, a star of star stars and maybe fill a bit about life that we don't know. Raising Power is the only movie that has the name of Carlito. There must be fewer characters from the original film, the latter does not make sense about nature. At the end of this movie he takes away his beautiful heart but how do we find him in prison on the next movie? And the woman is not even the woman who speaks like her love alone. I would like to say the movie is very happy with its soul, and a few good bits but it takes time to be held until the older brother. Don't stop at night waiting to see this, see once before if you need to hit.
