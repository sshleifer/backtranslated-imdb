This is one of the most irritating, uninterested movies I have ever had to stay. Every time it began to look like it might be good, out come more sepia drop flashbacks, followed by idiocy paranoid attacking as a social definition. The main character, Maddox, is an observer, he would be a rebel who lives in a house without a parent or responsibility. All support is easier and more attractive, but unfortunately it has never been done. Neither do we know the behavior of John Stanton allegedly ignoring Maddox to commit acts of rebellion. At one time, I thought "Aha! Maddox is just a nuts and secretly makes all communications from Stanton's psychiatric patient. Now we find somewhere!" but of course, that's approaching that not the whole movie becomes meaningful, both from Maddox view and viewer. Where is Ferris Bueller where we need?
