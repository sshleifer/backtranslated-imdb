This film should be only 10 minutes. I mean there is really just 10 minutes worth of watchable content in this matter (I even hesitate to call it movie). The opening of the film was somehow promising. If the film begins with a personal opinion, you reduce your hands and stay bright with more photos from Cohen's life. Well, Nick's Cave has a good job for one of the most popular Cohen songs. The length of the cave's performance makes you even more willing to see more of Cohen whose words and words are already persuaded you. But if it turns out the Pango's performance is just the beginning of a very long-spectacular show for a real group of those who don't even have a little attraction to put your seat. What do I think the film manufacturer thinks? shots around five minutes of wanting to become singers in a fake festival in Australia !!! What does a filmmaker think of despising the audience by adding "artificial clapping" to these endless displays. The movie is a perfect torture that shows you very little of what you came to see. There is no single photo of Cohen. In fact, except for a few pictures of his first days as a singer / poet absolutely nothing! If you add all the minutes that Cohen speaks, it will even reach 10 minutes. If you have ever lost your money on this film, don't be! just throw in the trash and at least save your time.
