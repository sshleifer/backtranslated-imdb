"Secretary" is one of those cheesy, cliched, "exciting" that one is under the watch on Sunday afternoon, when nothing is over. When a conspiracy (a captive woman was envious of all who succeeded in her in the office and decides to do anything she could stop) could be one of the kind, I realized losing countless programs, maybe taken from other TV movies that I had under the same reason. Do something worse, I wasn't wild on the cast. Mel Harris is one of those actors who appear in many television movies as either "mother" or some kind of "victim" of play or evil, that one must see the kind of life that leads. In this, she gets fun to play mother and victim of psychologist Sheila Kelly, who was not a very good choice as a villain. While Sheila Kelly has done a good job of working (Singles, Breaking In, and I think, the Law and Procedures), she is also attracted to a television line of roles, and this only increases. For others, I have no clear records, so they must say something. This will do on the Internet (I think it's where I got it), but 't bother looking at it, unless you are too tired in words. Not that will make them more excited ...
