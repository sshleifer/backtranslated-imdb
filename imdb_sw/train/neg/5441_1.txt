In all the movies I saw, this, Rage, should be one of the worst. Trends, DOING, develop, change in script-scripts and conversations make me cry for pain. "How can anyone come with something that they liked?" Gary Busey knows his "B" films, but this is a "W" movie. (W = desired) <br /> <br /> Take an example: about two FBI and local law enforcement around the trailer house and the jeep visitors. In the jeep it is MA and "confused" why all the fighters are involved. In the second battles the gun is going on, MA is killed directly. The explosion of cops away in jeep and gary and company to destroy off them. Robbers fall like dominoes and jeep and Gary drives around circles and is not hit by one shot / pellet. MA is killed and the gary seems to have seen-damn that the guy is tough. The truth is a miracle, not since the six shooter held a 300 shot has had a miracle.
