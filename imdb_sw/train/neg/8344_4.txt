After reading all the rave reviews about this film and a few who give it. I finally decided to throw in my precious cents. I agree with many for sure that if you were not for Lauren Lewis and Chris Ferry would have been a disaster. Published in Mariette OH. north of the Dogpatch where all real talent fled south to I-77 years ago, at least as far as the gas tank will allow. I get a chuckle from the inspectors who subtly claim that the cerebrate is slightly better than most by claiming they followed the plot without inkling of chaos. This story of the Muslim Crook is like an old record and enter into it. If the United States I understand the problems of Ind Indians of the movie should deal with them. Romania's trip would have canceled the budget for sure. Lets her face of all this film is a loop loop of Claire at the oil station, Claire along the road, Claire under the bleachers, Claire at home, Claire in cornfield, Claire at school. Claire here and Claire there. It was almost a mixture and would if it were not the best performers in cast. Josh and Jeff make life but don't write two page script and turn it into an hour, twenty rotation. Before you write another screenplay about dreams ghosts watching a period or two of Ghost Whisperer or something and get a little background. All those who were beaten except those mentioned above and others participated in their first and last film. Also, there is the appearance of co-director Jeff as he is in all his films. Such as Alfred Hitchcock, eh? One film was going on so that Cameraman appeared to have a revision in Lauren Lewis' derri√®re. Well, and all irony now satisfied I still propose a film for fear buff just to see this actor for the childhood of his career (I hope) and that Chris Ferry has strengthened as a worthwhile villain look.
