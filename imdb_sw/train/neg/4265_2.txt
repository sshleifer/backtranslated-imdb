I am a great fan of the heroes of the hero. Some of my favorites are Braveheart, Troy, Samurai's ultimate and Gladiator. And after watching Mongol, which is quite surprising, and which I recommend very much, I had great expectations from the film Sergei Bodrov. But it was terrible, bad, even pathetic is not a strong word in this case. The whole movie I was waiting for something exciting would happen, but it didn't, then I was at least expecting a great epic battle at the end, but even that was a great disappointment, some walking randomly, blowing a sword ... There are many movies of hero, this not one of them.
