I am afraid that I disagree with many. I saw Spike Lee soon becoming wee bit boring! Although he was trying something different, that is not just the memory of the rise and fall of the killer, I think it works very well. <br /> <br /> There is very little truth - Vinny (John Leguizamo) and Dionna's (Mira Sorvino), Ritchie's (Adrien Brody) life and then local mafia type. The story is good, but ultimately it's all you have - stories 2 or 3. And the powerful killer might be Mr Lee didn't put more on the side of the film? > <br /> <br /> There are some good points though. All events and murders of 'Sam Sam' David Berkowitz look very good (color spreading etc. etc.) and acting is very good around. Overall I heard that different stories will be used well for themselves or others without killing. It was not just enough to end. <br /> <br />
