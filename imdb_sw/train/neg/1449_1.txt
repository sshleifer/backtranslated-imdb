First, before you read more, you must understand that it is not neo-Nazi, I am trying to understand correctly Hitler to be sure no one like him take power again. <br /> <br /> I found this series and found it bad. I mean, okay, it's interesting to look at, but is it true? I wanted answers and I've got one: absolutely not. First, Hitler was not angry all his life, the series shows Hitler angry, even when he is a child. Secondly, Hitler did not want to treat his daughter, in fact, very likely that Hitler, in fact, was a homosexual and fought his whole life to overcome this secret. Third, people will hate me but it is true: Hitler was charming. How do you think he was able to get authority if he was hateful and bad? Because he was so beautiful. That is a common experience I had in the interviews of people living near or far away from him (of course, not the Jews). not quite a charm, you wrong. If you think so, you will leave people like him taking power in the country and you don't want it. If you understand how Hitler could get into power, and stop thinking that it was just bad, you would be able to get risky politicians like him (of course, remember he was chosen) and leave the theme before delay. <Br> Life is important to protect, this series is just bad to show us the truth, if we continue to see such Hitler, another will be done as the first did.
