William Cooke and Paul Talbot share the director / author of credit for this recreational budget about three boys blowing out into the forests and their fearsome magazines. The feet are facing fire and school gun and return ... and the city of Rufph (Gunnar Hansen ... of Leatherface's name) walks and makes four stories of the year for the return of food and hot fire. br>> One story is the old "Hook", two young men on the line of partner attacked by a demented killer and hook in hand. Another story has a few of tokers that need to count some of the weeds. They miss on a boy who knows a boy with # # t. When they had smoked a few pockets of their skin began to turn gray and green before they burst and fall. One of the best stories is about the unhappy person coming home for Christmas, who can't wait for her mother to die and enjoy telling her nephew and nephew about Satan Claus. The fourth story of the fire of the fire is a greedy ship that climbs on the beach on the empty chest and ends up being driven out by the zombies. <br /> <br /> Not a large budget of special effects, CAMPFIRE TALES gets the point around and really would be worse. Little Corny, but enjoyable to watch except for marine stories. Acting is based on not deserving reward. Cast members include: Tres Holton, Courtney Ballard, H. Ray York, Johnny Tamblyn, Walter Kaufmann, Kevin Draine, David Avin and Paul Kaufmann.
