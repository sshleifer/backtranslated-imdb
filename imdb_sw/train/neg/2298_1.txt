Here are some examples of Pat Robertsons largely demanded "a good track record" on predictions <br /> <br /> In his highly commented version of the January 2 edition of the Christian Broadcasting Network of The 700 Club, when he predicted that there would be a "major terrorist attack" and "massacre" in the US in the "second half" of 2007, hosting Pat Robertson boasted that he had "good track record" on early predictions. But the review of the New Year's New Year's Robertson forecasts undermines the claim. He predicted, for example, that: "President Bush will strengthen." WRONG <br /> * "The choice of the collapse will be unknown, but the outcome of the war and economic success will leave the Republican." WRONG <br /> * "The war of Iraq will reach the end of success. We will begin to pull out the soldiers before the end of this year." WRONG <br /> <br /> More, as the Associated Press newspaper of January 3 reported, Robertson has a history of predicting predictions: <br /> <br /> The player predicted January 2004 that President Bush could easily win new elections. Bush won 51 percent of the collapse, hitting democratic Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts. WRONG <br /> <br /> In 2005, Robertson predicted that Bush would have a victory after his victory in the second half. He said the recommendations for Social Security amendments would be approved by WRONG YET AGAIN! He says he speaks directly to God ... If so God has a sense of humor to look at Pat to make a fool again and again.
