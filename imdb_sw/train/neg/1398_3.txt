I bought this (it was only $ 3, right?) Under the title "Eyes Gray". The community to see Sherriff Roscoe in the non-DukesOfHazzard role had attracted me. As other critics warned, it is a very good story of the top secret government's attempt. <br /> <br /> And yes, there is a lot to set up shots, especially a house with a pool in front of him. Some of the characters and interiors are nondescript I think the concerned representatives we can forget who they are, so they restrict us and show the first out of the premises. In fact it's kinda funny. After a while the shot feels like a tv station identification mark, reminding us that we are looking for "Gray Matter". I also enjoyed two game calls. At one time the anger of an angry test insults the person concerned for calling him "Science b * tch!". It's just an insult. Several events later the different issue allows steam to combine about "scientific b ** tard!". It just looked very much to me. One day this film will disappear forever. Another age from now will be hard to find any copies. Almost if it has never happened. <br /> <br />
