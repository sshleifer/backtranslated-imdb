** 1/2 for this Diane Keaton farce. A person who should tell Mrs Keaton, enough with your philosophy of Annie Hall and hat. This looks very much for Keaton's daughter, Sara, dies in a traffic accident, when her boyfriend continues to live. <br /> <br /> Keaton, who could not be reached by phone for the first time, if she was in a sack with her pal and has canceled the phone, sadly new way for mourning. She returns to the summer area where all Sara's friends live. He cleans the house, sleeps for two days and then begins to reveal things that were better not to be revealed. It seems that good Sara slept with her girlfriend and husband who was eventually married. In addition, he gave thanks for the pregnancy for this person. We all set this journey of guilt. <br /> <br /> His only hope is to find the odd diary that Sara put. He also hopes that the boyfriend, Adam, who is a sports player, will not include all of this in another play. <br /> <br /> When the diary is available, it is written in Japanese. Sara had a Ph.D in this language. It is not good news for a mother when the diary stress is translated by Japanese cook in a Japanese restaurant. Normally, everything seems to connect well at the end. <br /> <br /> The name of this shmaltz comes from the Wizard of Oz. Every time Mom and Sarah could talk, they could say Dorothy. As if this is not enough, during this wonderful period of mourning, Keaton tells Adam to be another Woody Allen in his film, Interiors, where he tried to strengthen Ingmar Bergman. Mrs Keaton also tries to take medicine and a group. Come, people, can we believe that anyone with his real mind can mourn like this? It is really good for this film.
