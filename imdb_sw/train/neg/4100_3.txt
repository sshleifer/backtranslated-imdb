Little of the desperate film, I would say: the act was closed, somehow. In many cases, I was not able to feel that the face of the face was the same as the words spoken or intended in the area. The attitude of anger (or sad, happy, confused) should make the viewer believe that anger (or sadness, happiness, frustration). That doesn't happen here. <br /> <br /> Comments on authors think you already know the characters were correct. They do things and say things that come from anywhere: Andrew's behavior forbids his parents to send signals to each other during dinner; then blows and blows fire, telling his father "Don't hesitate, you f ***!". Maybe, if we would like to see prequel, we will understand where it happens, but there is no prequel, so we're in the sea because! One of the most unusual, strange things that Andrew is doing is going to an old stone stone, sitting down on the edge of "still water" down; then comes to his pocket and offers a packet of cigarettes and one lighting. He did this three times during the film; I think we should see this as another act of torture to be alone and angry? Maybe once, but three times? It may even be four times, I have lost count. <br /> <br /> Be honest, there is a fact that he has recently found that he has been taken; this happens very early in the film that does not mean any major changes that may occur because of this discovery. It is not clear whether this is why he is in pain or is about something else. I think there is a kind of Lynchi feel the film but the director of the first time really tries to measure such a mountain so early in his career?
