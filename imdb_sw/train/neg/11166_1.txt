I'm sure at the depth of Jack Blacks mind of Nacho Libre's character is quite hilarious but no. You can tell jacks with certain whales that provide friar, Mexico's red and wrestler dreams but this movie is a total misfire almost every single department. <br /> <br /> I just sat there by way of thinking more of the film "Should this be awesome" and "Is this a boy from the honest D right?". The fact is this film has NOTHING offer. ALL! It is a lousy script with crappy characters and characters with realistic direction. You will look at the endless time when you think something strange is going to happen but not just. I was striking for 10 minutes but of course it would have picked up. It was not. After 90 minutes I was difficult to stand and aneurism was painful. <br /> <br /> It's like, remember many years ago when you see anything with your fave actor in it, even some of them really early pap from before you become popular, and you will be really embarrassed that said the actor was actually in such a plop load. Well, it's like that. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed old Jack Black movies like Shallow Hall and I enjoy seeing Pick's Destiny but coming on someone. If you do this again Jack I'll come back there and hammer your knees or something. At least give you a good talk. I know it's a barrier but this is one of the worst movies I've seen and for many reasons ....
