The real film player and Bill Rebane who appeared to be the worst in his business in eight years. Three crackpot Million invited nine people to a remote hotel to compete in the last person's final winner who will be given $ 1 million while doing so. A series of bad sores are given to some visitors while others are involved in what many adults do under circumstances that can be found on the hotel bar. Many scenes are just a reason to focus on the camera on various parts of the female body including the number of opening dance which is the player of the American Bandstand meets with aerobics of full geriati and hookers. If there was any doubt that white people could not talk about this place the last nail in the coffin. Beware of underwear. This continues for forty-five minutes until Bill Rebane starts throwing darts in various twists and everything he hits becomes an inspiration for the next area to make this one aggressive mess. It's a game until it's not a game. Three old pieces are full of controls until they are out. The park is owned by an odd power until it becomes only props. They are dead until they are gone. Even the writer at the end answers that he does not know what hell was. I despise anyone to consider where Rebane was going this. Acting is a dinner restaurant instead of dinner. Most of the participants could return to their work day in the local Stuckey. I give a few points to the area where the yuppie wide opens the room and the bones are inside the skull itself. Let's see Gone Gone with Wind to do it! This collection of Chilling Classics is actually a fourth of me. Bane, Get! Like Rebane! I hate myself.
