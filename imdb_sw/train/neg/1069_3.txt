I saw this film at the AFI Dallas Festival. Many of the listeners, including my wife, enjoyed this drama, but I was not. It is a star Lucas Haas (Bricks, Alpha Dogs), Molly Parker (Kissing, Fifth Five, Hollywoodland) and Adam Scott (First Snow, Secret of School Arts). Director is Matt Bissonnette, who married Molly Parker. All three employees are doing a good job in this film about 3 friends, two marriages and third party loyalty. It all happens in the lake of the lake and looks amazing. The film wants to treat its subject as the first comedy and then the game, and I thought it needs to be another way around.
