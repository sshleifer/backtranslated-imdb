This film proves that the "business" of movies, or else, Hollywood films are in great crisis. There is no reason that this film would be made away from the fact that one expects success in the name of Shaquille. No worth mentioning a plot: it's a bit more surprising than a tip. Why else? Screen is much less, O'Neal is a bad actor but Francis Capra is worse. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/10.
