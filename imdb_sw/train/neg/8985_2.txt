Previous comments encouraged me to look at this when it showed on TCM, but it was a strong desire. Lupe Valdez is good, but doesn't get enough screen time. Frank Morgan and Eugene Palette are playing ordinary but promising people, but the script leaves them. The movie is approaching the character of Lee Tracy's character, who is better than silence, physically and bad jerk words. The effects of "public" are not well-thought and unreliable, making "shenanigans" looks like the bad news publications. And it proves that the character of Lupe Velez could fall for it. "Connecting" that is mentioned in another review should be independent of the viewer, since I did not even know the attempt was being made.
