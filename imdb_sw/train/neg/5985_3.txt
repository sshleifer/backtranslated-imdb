This film is just kids against bad type. Thunderbirds are just hook so that people can see it, but it's close to use. The fact that the action takes place on Tracy Island is just a way to pull the public. It was amazing to find out what the future observers of London would have as well as how the world is compared together. <br /> <br /> The best part of this film is some of the verses presented by Lady Penelope which is very interesting. These have provided light aid to those who hope to be restored to the TV series. When you say that it passes 90 or minute through 'fun' and so it can only be worth watching.
