Well ....... contrary to some of the previously written comments I must say that the only right thing about this film is the fact that one in it appeared as Jason Donavon that reminds me of my youth. I don't know how it got any win, and although I am sure the great effort made it had no fruit as the final result was one that screamed out of the soap of 90 soap. performance. It was unfortunately long and small squares were wrong .... for example .... like a good friend who slept with your old 6-year-old partner after just two weeks of breaks should be better than friends. It was all fantasy. It's just that! O, and the house of weird 90 / soft foundation of indie was numbing mind!
