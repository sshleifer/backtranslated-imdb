My famous quote from Crow was, when the car was leaving the rock, "The movie is very bad, even the car wants to escape!" <br /> <br /> This was the funniest movie I've ever seen. It was great out there to frighten you, which makes even fun! If it wasn't for Theater Theater I would not be here today! :-P
