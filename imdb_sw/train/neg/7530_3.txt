I found this movie to be boring, monotonous and quite uninteresting and fast, deep "upbeat" ended which was not true for the general story. Following these perpetrators through the weekend of bad events, bad habits and bad news is not my idea of ​​a visible, interesting and exhausted movie for its "single" theme and could not wait to stop - In fact I almost stopped nearly half way. The whole movie seemed just as useless and trembling, and the characters were in a large part of the oppression and unhappiness, although acting was good. A small passion with small appeal and a small appeal - sorry, but it didn't do it with me, and I love a beautiful, small film! This did not have a jell, although I kept looking at it hoping and believing that it would. I was desperate, especially after two local monitors put it on their "Best Year 10" list. I would like to highly recommend the "House of Sand" instead - now there is a beautiful film, small!
