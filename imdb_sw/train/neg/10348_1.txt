I was so happy to see that they had made a film from my book that I loved forever. I didn't know it was Disney until it was too late. I was surprised by many omissions of important parts of the story. It was like someone made a film from a 4 farmer book report on the novel. Meg did well at school and neither she nor her father didn't wear glasses. Mrs Murray (mother of Meg) was not shown as a scientist; they left the kitchen lab and switched it to the internet. And that's just the beginning. For half the movie I found myself saying on the screen, so much of the concern of other people who were watching movies that they didn't read the book. I'd like to have more thumbs so that I could give four thumbs down for this. The only good thing I can say is that for someone who has not read the book, this film is the same kinda.
