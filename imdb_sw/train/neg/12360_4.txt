Why someone will return to someone, who beat them in the teeth, not once, not twice, but for a regular. <br /> <br /> This film teaches us that to get love we must accept abuse (not just forgive, but fully accept). Gosh! No wonder that my first relationship lasted just ten years. In fact I did not accept my local watch. At the first time of Bucatinsky's text, there are many good things for this film; however, to justify the reconciliation of Eli and Tom, the development of more behavior would be appropriate. We never know the scientific eyes of Eli, in fact, we are guided that he is not a modern expert, although the emotional-emotional psychological problem appears very much.
