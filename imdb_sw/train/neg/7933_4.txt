I am a big fan of Randolph Scott, but this film is dud. The whole thing has been fake, fake, voice sounds, and real-back screens. It has the idea of ​​a plot that the screens of the screens are successfully tied to the script of the nitwit, which makes it impossible for viewers to be incorporated into action and really care about characters. Redirect is the foot of the foot, and it only enhances how bad the script is rather than helping improve. I have seen a lot of enjoyable "sound production" before, but this is not one of them. It all makes it to thank the gritty Scott / Boetticher films. <br /> <br /> Randolph Scott is made tanned, trim, and shines that a million dollars smile around. He is always pleased ... even in his worst films. Apart from Scott, another main reason I wanted to see this movie is due to how much I loved Mrs. Wymore in Errol Flynn's movie, "Rocky Mountian". In the "Man Back Guns", he is just fine, and you can tell him he is a good actor, but he was forced to say very good lines, and the prevention given by the director was very bad. I have seen Phil Carey only in the "Pacific Operation", and he plays the same character here ... the pride of pride that you want to blow into the consciousness. I think it proves that he is a good actor ... he made me move with him. There are some attempts to breathe on the comic aid that only prevents the film, in my opinion. Although there are many things to knock, I must say that I have enjoyed enjoying these two Spanish songs in mobile phones ... but why are we going to see Randolph Scott movies, right? There is definitely the Scottish movies out there, and this is certainly not interrupted, but it also certainly cannot be taken any more.
