I expected a movie similar to Deuce Bigalow, which I enjoyed. However, this dud seems to last forever. It is one of those flicks that enjoy a sad PG-13 placement when it doesn't make you a good child. Jokes are not just a face down or a f ** t joke, they are supporters, evil, and a lot of activities are not just bad taste but rather legal and ethical validity. Several events seem to have been cut off to get PG-13 testing ... very bad ... it might be playing more like a R-filmed movie if it's funny. not recommend this movie. It is a complete destruction of time ... and I am a film lover and ready to give almost everything to the shot. In 45 minutes, the movie felt like it should be dropped ... and the boy we were just ready. The latter is normal but does not salvage all of this tourist / tourist trap. 1/2 stars (good I saw as a freebie ... it would have endured the hard-earned green for this dive)
