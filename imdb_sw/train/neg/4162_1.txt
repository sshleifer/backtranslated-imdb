If you are very interested in the Evil Resident movie 2002, then you should just see it instead of right 2 hours you will never leave. I can't believe that no one has said that this film is just the cheapest cost of RE. First, the "power" of commando power is a unique protection for the center of a computer with an AI and a holographic estimate. With this "Hive" call you have a series of traps that are killed once a member of the squad. There is even a chess reference in code names, which are in RE conversation. Despite the fact that no zombies, "Rook", the movie nemesis, are some kind of living organism, a very colorful color depicting necrotic tissues, and many parts of cyborg as well as a super mutant of RE. So, a finger-finger to Mr. Richard Taylor for claiming any loan to this story. <br /> <br /> Their film directly, but the author got an idea to look at a bad resident I think.
