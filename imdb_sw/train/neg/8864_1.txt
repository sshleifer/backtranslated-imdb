After looking at this, I had lost a little respect for Christopher Lee (This is too late). This film was garbage. First, they tried to restore the end from the "mourning" for the first time, and make the best decisions. Then they try to turn into a sad excuse for the film's movie! The plot takes with the whole film is just AWFUL !!!! The brothers of the attackers werewolf from the first film (From his watch, it had enabled Dee Wallace Stone) team with Lee and another woman to destroy a group of waswolves, led by Sybil Danning, who seems to be naked at all. <br /> <br /> This is not appropriate even to rent (Unless you want to waste your time and money to view dirt.). Try to catch on the cable instead. It would be so cut off, it could actually be meaningful.
