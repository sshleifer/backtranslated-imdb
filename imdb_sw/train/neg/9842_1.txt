It seems everyone in this film builds Woody Allen. They beat and relax and strengthen more. It's just for DeNero fans! It tries to look like edgy and art - but it comes as far as look like a very, very low budget budget made by college students. The words that are often used in all films are "hum". The film takes the last seventy years / even seventy years earlier. If you like films that people talk about each other, bad lighting (even if for "art"), and makes you feel like you are sitting on a political burnout, then you can like this - but you need to be really bored . I have seen this CD in the bin of the dollar and now I know why.
