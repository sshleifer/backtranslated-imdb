Lesson Synopsis: When his wife, a journalist, has been kidnapped and replaced by a second android agent, secret service agent Eric Phillips seeks down and unlocks a program with a weapon contractor to create an army of androids that can not kill kill world leaders. <Br /> <br /> I didn't have much expectation when I first noticed this second for Richard Pepin's low budget sci-fi / action hybrid "Cyber ​​Tracker". The film was not unique, not to mention the clear brightness of both "Terminator" & "RoboCop". This end is the same as before, and a series of all the steps that open the film. There is a lot of explosion, heavy gun & a great bodycount, with some military art goes in honor of the film star, Don "Dragon" Wilson. The entire film looks like a series of work events put together with a small plot. On the front, Wilson is a bad actor. He really needs to transplant personality.
