In Dutu Blood was one of 60 films that created a new vision of violence in the Hollywood film industry. Capote included the phrase “novels” to describe the book that this film was taken, and the spirit of the form was done on the film script, which he wrote. In spite of the fact that we were well during the color film, Richard Brooks was chosen to present this film in black and white color to emphasize both the climax of the environment and the lack of stories. This is the first problem and the television reference - the error changes the story of the story. In addition, the filing of a film shot on TV reduces options for how shots are set and targeted. As a result, we lose a great collision that makes the second part of the original film (police interview, case, button, and execution) so claustrophobic. On a small screen, it is just another version of the Law and Stopping System. Hollywood's search for scripts comes back to successful movies at another age. Usually, that's a mistake, and this is not different. <br /> <br /> All characters are able. Script is the same. Direction does not get on the way. It's just that the film doesn't work as an original tool of precision. It does not accept the viewer within the crowding over Smith and Hickock that the original film mocks. At the end of the TV version, we are left with a feeling: "Ho hum, who cares?" See the original nature, on the big screen as you can, then watch the TV version just to understand why the first was the most important film in 1967. <br /> <br /> Can't hurt too on the line and read a little about Capote and the original book. It will help you understand the wonderful efforts that he has placed in these materials, and also some of the conflicts around the book and movie. I have just given this 4 because I keep down 3 rankings for real bombs - a kind that encourages you on being done
