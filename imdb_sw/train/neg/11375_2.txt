Are you talking to me? (1987) is a very bad movie that attracts the stars that I have never seen before or since the stars as a person from a neighbor who tries to become actors. He has a heavy jones for Driver Driver if he tries to use that shtick to make it. When he learns the hard reality of life, he does what everyone else does, changes his image! He goes from the good to refuse up to the surf on the night. His friend can't believe the change (but he thanks to Faith Ford and get a cool gig to pay). Can this small punk put its reputation on the road while hitting? <br /> <br /> This is a real-emerging movie that tries to insert more items immediately. The interesting idea that falls because of poor performance. Who knows, maybe someone will take the ball and run because the filmmakers have played the ball this time. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time with this movie. Unless you want to see the faith of Ford Ford and the little Bubba from the Gump Forest. <br /> <br /> xx
