I should spread this by saying that I am a fan of Dolph Lundgren. The person turns out some of the funniest pictures that are thought to be My favorite personal. * Spoiler * though nothing like a Dolph caller since the scripts aren't amazing to start with: the expelling area and a child with a disability carrying a pistol against a guy on a Harley with a small gun, through the highway hall and kid's success? Good game, Oscar goes to detention. Dolph, if you read this, thanks for laughing, old friend. <br /> <br /> In summary: a bad movie that is sure to laugh. I recommend to invite other friends for this and encourage them to stay that way. Hilarious.
