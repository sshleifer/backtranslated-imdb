I think this goes to prove that Joe Don Baker will do anything to buck. The idea of ​​the film was not very good to start with. This movie has many bad things about it I don't know where to start. Acting is awesome. Movie cinema is much smaller. The sound was very bad. Score is awesome. There is a reason why this movie ended in the Mystery of Secret Science 3000. They should have liked two go-go players. The last right would have been locked this stinker on the films outside Wichita and never let anyone see it again! 1 out of 10 is better than this is suited.
