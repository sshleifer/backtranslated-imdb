I bought this film for $ 5 in bin bargain at my local video store because only one, Chase Masterson, but I must have broken five, and was thrown into the toilet and beaten. The film is about a twenty bunch that witnessed in high school and reunited with the death of their friends, who were planted and walked in the forest and died. There is a problem with a reptilian monster is to hunt them down automatically. Acting is bad, these useless people seemed to disappear in the exhibition like 90210 and Dawsons Creek. This leadership was regulated by the age of twelve and the script was probably made at the age of thirteen. The whole set looks like a man's farm in Malibu. People here who thank this film are clearly friends of the director and / or actors. Avoid this garbage collection at all costs.
