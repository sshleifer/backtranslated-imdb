Steve Martin should stop trying to make the remedy of classic comedy. He is not good at this part. As a bad remake of Out Of Towners, this movie is located on its face. How anyone ever thought Steve Martin could even come close to the amazing performance of Jack Lemmon is more than me and it's similar to this film. Dan Ackroyd could play part of the best Bilko. Martin is good when he does his original characters but fails to sadly try to restore the classic work of others. It is a sad statement when the funniest part of the movie is available on the first line of credit when the movie is over. Verse "Manufacturers boldly disagree with the lack of cooperation with the United Nations" was close to the only line that made me laugh. If you want to see a real Bilko, get the original destination of Phil Silvers Show. Those who are assured are laughing, unlike this mistake that should not happen. I put this film in the same category as Lemmon classic above and remake of Psycho. None of them should happen.
