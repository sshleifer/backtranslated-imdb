You do not have a great need to set up this little review with the plot restriction. I mean it's a Shakespeare Hamlet for good? perhaps one of the ever known games written. I am not ashamed to admit that I have come to this version of Hamlet through many people on IMD? through the Secret Secret of Science 3000. When the show may not be better to use to judge the movie, in this case I can not think of trying to look without comedic quips. By word, this German, released by the TV-version of Hamlet is dreary. 152 minutes? No! It's so dark and sad that anything I want to spend about three hours on. How many times have I told you, but entertainment is something to me. And this slitter of hand is far from entertainment. I, however, will give several points to what I felt was a very good acting. The 3/10 voice about me right. <br /> <br /> I love to enjoy MST3K, their views did not help make Hamlet no longer interesting. There are few riffs here and there, but in general, Hamlet is just a bad movie for MST3K. Shakespeare is also talky to allow comedy to have any kind of rhythm or flow. As I am healed, I must give Hamlet 1/5 to the MST3K rating rating.
