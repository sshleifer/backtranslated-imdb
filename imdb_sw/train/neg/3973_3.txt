Working was weak, but in the flick of fear, I can live with that if the story is good. It was not. The initial event was a clear and clear way of using many children. Okay. Make haste to "this place" where they will recover emotionally. I would like the revelation of ghosts. Okay, cool - this will be an extraordinary story of kinda of fear, and things that have penetrated some parts of the world in ... where ever. Then the action begins to connect as three dog-headed dogs and birds - Is there a bad force trying to attack directly? Is there an evil force to try to attack them correctly - make people do bad things that they will not take? Oh, wait, no, maybe the whole area is some kind of intellectual room that can occur within the murder? Okay, hold it - maybe it's really just a little baby "Delbert" -style redneck boy who misses his mother and is some kind of spree as K-Tel Norman Bates knock off? Oh, yes - the most points: just away the Black character seems to be a grandson of our "Gang" pullman porter. Legs do it directly if he can give a crummy conversation, but the truth is, his purpose is "Y'all made betta get outa heah, Boss!" At least they wrote smart enough out of GTF there. Little and little girl being silent and pulled off was obviously creepy, as she was chick in the shower. That was just two of quite a few sweet remarks in this movie. The problem is that they are connected to the methods of resisting the disease, like biting steak, bite of chocolate and bite of Gummi. Each one is good for himself, but is confused? Blea! Such a possibility. Decreased.
