Although I recently have put this on my list of five worst films, I must say maybe not worse than hitting Reynolds in "Maddening" or any "See" dialog. However, it is a good nausea, even with sexy Drew Barrymore to play something of a fear-movie answer to Holly Golightly, moving from New York City to Los Angeles but he sought to be beaten and looked similar to murder. Poor Sally Kellerman, a great quirky actor in the 70's, has been reduced here for the support role, and George Newbern, who is Barrymore's leader, is the worst actor of sitcom, always standing to laugh after each row. The photo is a swill, but the Drew's blood area reflects, and the psychological identity (although it is outside the "Scooby Doo" section) is interesting. But if the last ... get real! Who should clean that? * from ****
