This film exposes events and special effects. It is very weak on the plot. A lot of computer chat was just a mumbo-jumbo. I looked at this because I was a great fan of the original War Games movie which was based on the reality of computers and real computer terms. This movie had nothing. Most of the computer events was not only impossible and non-real computers and networks, but only the lame. It is as written by a person without a real computer. Good game was blind and it was basically just a sporting game. No real hacking, so what was it? Modern was a horrible thing. False guidance.
