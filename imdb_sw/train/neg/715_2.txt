This seemed like a very interesting movie from the blurb. Nazi, magic, government conspiracy. I expected a lower edition of the Nazi budget for DaVinci or Boys from Brazil or even Shockwaves. Instead you find something completely different, more psychologically, something else about David Lynch. That was true together. But the way stories are told are just bad. <br /> <br /> Part of the problem is making. Andrienne Barbeau's behavior begins off moving forward to be concerned with fear. He does not do so well, even in his time, though he tried. Merits were thrown as a child thinks that this was a comedy. Many of the other actors also seemed to have thought this was a movie movie, or at least acted like it, rather than just being quirky. The only one I thought was well was a daughter, Siri Baruc. <br /> <br /> Another great place is moving. It starts off very slowly. So gradually you may be tempted to exit. But then you get compulsory for a time when you come to suicide with his daughter. But soon afterwards, all becomes a jumbled mess. Some of these were intended, but most of them were unnecessary, boring, and negative. <br /> <br /> The real problem, not just a good movie to watch. It is slow, lighter, no suitable characters. Use the photo and paste use. Some movies you see characters are tortured. In this, it is a viewer doing. It has a short time of creepy, especially the paintings of Nazi and credpy, but all the rest of the movies are just.
