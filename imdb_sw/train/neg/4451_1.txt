This film was looked like a fake like the Naked Gun (which had to be). Cases for sure: <br /> <br /> 1. To put a fake in the Roberts secretly takes the swimming lessons at the YWCA. After his "death" YWCA calls her husband working to give her hope. How did HELLO get her number of jobs? <br /> <br /> 2. Before you leave the city it rings its wedding ring in the toilet. Day or even a week later his hubby gets in John. What? Does this mean that the toilet was never closed? <br /> 3. There is no comment given on how she pays her mother service in the retirement home (for she did it behind her husband RICH back). 4. At the end of this stirring film Roberts testifies to her husband at home. Instead of running for his life he runs the kitchen instead of seeing if the cans are stacked for beauty.
