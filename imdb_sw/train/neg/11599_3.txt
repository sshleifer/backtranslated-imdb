The only thing that prevented this fate was that the general disaster was a stylish touch. Gift of Spoiler Alert) Death to the comic is a small incentive to the area in the Twilight Zone: Movie, which provides death to cartoon. This was still a good idea, especially looking at the ink making and the color being hit out. Additionally, there is another beautiful area with a demon scooter. Having said that, I was glad to have a cheap DVD in an export business shop, because this was very bad. I bought the "Salvation of the Spirit" at the same time and both movies were sad and regular realizations that you have been looking at. However, where "the salvation of the soul" has nothing to redeem, or to have any meaning, this at least had the most detailed details mentioned above. It's amazing, a DVD lets you go to '8' dreams where something really happens, which is the only way to look at this. Script between the creative time of the year is rather a failure. Over 3 out of 10.
