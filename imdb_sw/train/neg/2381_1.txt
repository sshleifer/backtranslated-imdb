I am not surprised that even cowgirls get blues like this movie is nothing to go. I expected something better from Uma Thurman, which is why I did my way through this experience in the first place. Bad movies and music just like the quality of redemption. It's just a shame that we can't give 0 out of 10 to this check. This movie deserves.
