I can't even believe that this show lasted as long as it did. I think it's all the parts of sleeping under America. Personally, as David Spade said, I liked to show this better when it had its original title - "Seinfeld". What bothers me about this show, far from the obvious, the basic meaning of "humor", and general smuttiness, is a way of careful events is the name. Excellent performances still wonder after watching many, like, "where Rob gets at stake", on "Dick Van Dyke Show", or "where Lucy and Ethel are working at the candy factory." In other words, it is an honor given to a great program with viewers. That the authors and producers of "Friends" would have an unacceptable hubris to actually mention events, themselves, in such a way, before anyone even had the opportunity to even see it a second time, speaks not only mediocrity and lack of original ideas in part of journalists, but, too, of the intelligence beaten to their audience. You read the comments of some of these people and you can only reach the conclusion that they live in Card-like Neverland, which is filled with greeting cards. What does friendship mean? I want to be a friend? I want to live in Manhattan? Get up. These people should work in coffee shops and seek work as actors, but somehow they can live in $ 4000 / mo. apartments? Get the truth. I am telling all of us who want to move to Manhattan and live an unfamiliar life with New York and Rosses and Monicas, good luck with all that. That New York does not exist for anyone making less than six figure. But, good luck with all that, however. Now, freeze and read Read.
