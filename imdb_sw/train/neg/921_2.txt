I lost this to see Vanesa Talor sometimes. He can act, but does not get a chance in this problem. The sequence of the opening is a comprehensive shot of mountain themes. It must be from the stock record, because the film is downloaded directly to video video. Production ethics makes _Blair Witch_ look professional. There is a very interesting image, but no other side effects are worth considering. This film is bad, but not amusingly so. The players would do well without mentioning on their trips.
