This movie is a perfect example of the best book destroyed by the film. Jacob Nimependa is probably the worst movie I saw. There is no storyline, squares lost, and editing is bad. At the top, the music is the same from the synthesizer and it looks very bad. The task of Bridget Fonda is decent, but everyone works is quite an amateur. I would like to give this film to a person who learns to be a producer as a research on how to produce a film as it is experiencing bad cutting events, changes and evil that should be beaten again! Read the book and don't waste your time with this film.
