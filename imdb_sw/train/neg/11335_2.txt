I recently watched Belle Epoque, thinking it would be strange as it was to win Oscar for the Best Foreign Language. I used to understand and predict the films. Perhaps the battle I had was that since the time the film was hit at the moment, the plot of the fall of the beautiful women and eventually the fall of the beautiful girl has been done many times. In addition to the plot predictions, some scenes in the film felt really out of place and storyline (eg a particular event at the wedding). Sometimes the film was to preach in his mind and the era of the Franco film set by the Church. The only thing that the film was going to was was during the clash, the environment, and the character of Violeta being a strong, self-reliant woman when women were not associated with these characteristics.
