Your first suggestion that this is a cheesy movie is that it was hit on the video, not the film. The story has ceased, and production is amazing for surprising. Remember, for example, that when a couple of heads are on a flight to Vermont, where they have gone to celebrate their association in a corporate celebration, a bird is shown to come to the airport surrounded by palms. Their celebration - in Vermont - takes place in the garden of tropical plants, including palms, which can not last five minutes in New England climate. On another flight journey, the image setup shows the flight of FedEx's cargo lifting. Maybe they could only travel in the steerage. For the plot, this movie hopes to believe that Victor, a sincere Christian brother of Arthur, has been removed from his church when the congregation learned that his BROTHER is gay. Not only, but the pastor finally puts Victor up and the man who was beaten with Ben and Arthur were killed "to erase their sinful souls." It seems no one in this church has ever heard of the Ten Commandments. Isn't it for Jamie Brett Gabel, who is amazing as amazing as Arthur, this movie had no features of redemption at all.
