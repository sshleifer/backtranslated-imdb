This movie was not bad but it was not very good. I am a great fan Toni Collette I think he's a good and talented actor. The movie starts on Robin Williams who is a writer and gets a book from a 14-year-old child. The book is big and can't believe the child wrote. Tone Collette has a child guardian who does not know if this child is true or does it. I am not a film damage but I will say this film is not afraid. Acting is very good and the performance of Toni Collette was amazing and also Robin Williams. <br /> <br /> The movie was a great disappointment in my opinion I would wait to come to DVD.
