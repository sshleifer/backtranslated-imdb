This is not one of these reviews about special effects or specific technologies, or being dated, the issues that only dorkiest people can talk to, but instead of commenting on the story of telling, which many of us are really interested in. <Br>> The program is about a combination of WWII members of Germany and Navy, and two citizens (hero and heroine), who hold together on the German U U boat and wind in the country's net of dinosaurs. <br /> <br /> The protests are not bad for film standards, and we know from the plot that the truth cannot be over. What films are needed are reliable and interesting characters, as well as certain factors in action. This video is not suitable for all. For a full length film, only 6 characters are given at any time, and 3 of them are not available. McClure's hero is more than "normal", and it doesn't mean much at any time. A woman seems to look at the answer of the riddle about the land of the dinosaurs they have entered, but the riddle is not a lot of riddle, and we can care less. <br /> <br /> Many failures in a film that would be better, even in its time.
