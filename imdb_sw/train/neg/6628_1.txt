If you go down to the bottom I would be happy. Seeing Sushmita Sen was good, and Nisha Kothari has a bright future but the producer and director has destroyed any fun with this story. Choice of horns, choosing lighting and everything that pleases them to try to remember what the story is. O, if songs and drums did not cause your ears to your head, first. The film could have been done twice for 1.25 hours, and it was very good, it looked like "Seven Samurai" but the director and writer did not go to the same direction, even if "urban capital" finally found their back and wanted to help. This movie fails in many levels: editing, writing, photography, fashion, lighting, script - any name of this film - it was BAD - maybe food from the pastor is also bad. I have not seen 6 years of watching Indian movies (sounds) seen something that has been done wrong.
