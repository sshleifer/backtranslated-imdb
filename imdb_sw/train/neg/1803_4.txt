Here is one of the short educational videos made to learn unknown people out there about the reality of life. At this time the target audience is sixteen girls, the reality of life is menstruation. This animation photo, created by Photos of Walt Disney, looks with another warranty from Kotex. It begins by describing how hormones grow and develop. With the help of animation and the female writer shows how the body, especially ovaries, stomach and vagina, works and why this all leads to menstruation. It's almost surprising, that the comic details here, how the sex issue is avoided. Even the word is never mentioned though "furtilized" will pass over once. I don't know why I saw this, but because it is one of the most common short films that can give you a sense of innocence, you would like to give an attempt.
