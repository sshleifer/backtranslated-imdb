This is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I don't care what critics say, it's bad. I think the problem is for Kundera novel. Not that it is not good at all; That is about 99% of his work, it is self-absorbed and removed. He seems to have a love for himself, his characters come as a spectacular, and his novels are generally misogynistic. I have read his many works (even his true social poetry) That is not very true - I don't know what it is. Characteristics (like independence) in his novels make the readings violent. In the film, all the things that I don't like about Kundera were honored. Maybe I lost something, but I don't think so. For a note, I cannot believe that this is a DVD of Criteria Collection. There is no way this movie is needed.
