Authors and producers give out a little bit of dampness. The author's guide is too bad, OR had a very bad idea, even they had to enter the disgusting place where a young woman defended on the back seat of the van, and then loses a load on the back car (mind you at least summarize this film ). We had been taken to one of the other women fleeing on one of her friends on the gunpoint, as well as many cases of vomiting of pictures; once it would have been completed ... we have a message! Surely this takes the humor of toilets on another level! If the script and acting were best then I could easily forget that I watched the film on the bottom budget video. This was the original story of the original, and the direction of cunning (solely) since we just got to take a view from within the van; so make it feel more realistic. We did not see in any other place, such as a shop or farm where several women were lost, and this could have a much needed tension. <br /> <br /> Script was strict. Verses like: 'I don't feel very good ... I want to go home' after one of the girls followed by psychopath; was raped with guns and ammunition, seemingly not cooked. <br /> <br /> Acting is diabolical (except for maniac). Do all 5 actors in this have learned to act by taking a course of communication during a long-term post strike! The voice was so bad that I could watch the whole film and the bottom heads. <br /> <br /> The director appeared to have a simple job in this. It seems that the only direction he had to give is: 'Girls shouting' <br /> <br /> AS AS FOR SCREAMING ...... If you look at this please make sure you have a paracetamol ready!
