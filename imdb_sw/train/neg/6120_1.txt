there are three types of bad films - non-cheap, boring, and inappropriate. The only worst movies are boring and inappropriate. <br /> <br /> The stimulating films are good, well, boring - if you go away quickly, you can sleep. inappropriate films really have their defenders; but the fact remains the aid of masturbatory for very sick. The only cheap films are fun, because filmmakers wanted to make their films deliberately, they went beyond their potential and resources available. Bo Derek is the most unusual and not available; fortunately, eventually the lack of money and skills to redeem him by making him seemingly cheaper too. This film is a hilarious and can be the last last funny-bad film ever made. <br /> <br /> I first saw this in the theater, God forgive me; I was laughing hard I was climbing my seat, and so did many viewers. It is clear that Derek and her husband's husband, pregnancy of this film as, for part, satire; unfortunately, it is not clear that there is no significant resource to remove it; Therefore, the aspect of 'satirical' comes as a feeling of a girl's girl of feeling a gay boy of a true gorshin of a fool in a batman trying to pretend she is a robin - it does not jump over our heads, you have no clue where any head human beings can be. On the other hand, there are some moments that you think is great in this film - it is supposed to be a film of action, remember - which is very strange, someone wondering if a man has been damaged by a man's eye. <br /> <br /> as Derek's misconduct to unfold his breast - I can't think a small picture of the dirt of the picture, he is very strange looking for the big shoulders, I can 'consider what man has ever seen in it. <br /> <br /> as to plot - as it is - well, not; Derek runs around Africa, and God knows only why. then his father - Harris - pretends to act in the show-puppal show-show, and of course there hunk'o'Tarzan which seems surprised from the advertising without knowing that the subject changed - perhaps because he didn't see the script - apparently no one has. <br /> <br /> The wrong camera function, good editing - if not by 3 chimp, the film could fail - <br /> <br /> as it is, is a real hoot.
