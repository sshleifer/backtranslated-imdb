Surely one of the worst movies I have ever seen! Acting, conversation, manuscript, sound, lighting, plot line. In fact I can't say anything positive about this, although I enjoy the films of Sweden. The events of fighting are so ridiculous that it is impossible to take it. And when the leadership behavior just comes to open his shirt, while shooting at the line bar, I don't know if it should be joke, or if someone thinks it is a link in a good film? Regina Lund is the only half-actor of nature, but disappears in the floods of laughable remarks and unreliable effects. It leaves you awesome that someone actually spent time with money on something like this ...
