The only good place about this film is a beautiful scenery. This movie was long and awesome. The minister should retire from the pulpit when his son Paul came out with the teachings he announced. How often can her boys take the name of the Lord free in this film from the Presbyterian origin? It's not the same. I loved Paul had broken the river without a boat at first to save us the story of silly, smirkish, Paul's self (Brad Pitt). So Norm becomes a teacher and Paul becomes a gambler who Norm wants to save but not so. Not very helpful. We see Europeans hated to stand by Paul because of his American girl. That is the only place that had interest and perhaps could be developed to be 'western'. We only see a city of sleep where two prime ministers have nothing to do but 1. Norm to chase a beautiful girl and deal with her family and 2.Paul makes dumb stories in a newspaper shop while riding her head and taking a lot of swigs and fasting many. I would like to watch a show about fishing that the film again â€” will never be.
