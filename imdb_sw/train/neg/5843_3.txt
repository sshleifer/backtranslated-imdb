Changed varieties start one Friday night in Los Angeles where Dr Irwin (Guy Vieg) and his Walter laboratory (Allen Lee Haff) burn midnight fat while trying to try a perfect new revolution called 'Rejenacyn'. If Walter's latest attempts failed to sink under the taps are leaking green green liquid into an apartment where the laboratory has been drinking ... Five Walter friends, Alicia (Leah Rown in very attractive clothing including boots some cool Gary (Richard Peterson), Burke (Derek Hofman), Frank (David Bradley) & Chelsea (Alexandra Townsend) decide that he has worked very hard and they need to walk so that they can plan to take him & share night nights. Robert Broughton) has been attacked and killed by the current homicidal mice in the apartment as Walter is hurting the recent serum group in the laboratory that comes out of the castle and is growing at an amazing rate. Walter's friends are turning away but can't leave when the mouse is still out so everyone helps to find him. All six can have a diet of mouse ... <br /> <br /> Also known as Rod type The modified entz is connected and guided by Miles Feldman & has a very limited recommendation. Script and producer Serge Rodnunsky are poor & with the shoddiness of general production as all the varied types are disabled. To start the habit is dumb, angry and clich√©d. Then there is an odd plot with a mad scientist, a created creature, the only place, a man beaten and defeated the end of the competition between the hero & monster. All here somewhere. Changed varieties are going faster for what is about the best thing I can say about it & thanks for not long-term. Basically it is your average movie run of the kill kill and not very good for it. <br /> <br /> The Feldman film director as a TV film and the whole thing is bland & forgettable when some of the special effects and attack events leave a lot of want. To start the CGI rats are the worst, the surveillance of the attack makes the jerky camera's hand movements and very quick editing to hide and hide the fact that all rats are sitting there. In various points in the selected Mouse Cave Mode need to shake because of the motion of the mouse but you can see all the mice sitting there as someone draws the dams on the screen. The biggest fight of the last mice seems poor if it is just a boy in a dodgy suit. No events, no tension or atmosphere and since time was under neon lights? There are one or two good bits of a year here, a man with a big hole that his face would be, there was a hand-fold, a lot of rats, a man with their eye left with a dead cat. <br /> <br /> Changed technologies are the lowest level. It takes place within one building, has the impact of cheap CGI and low production standards. Acting is not over the amount but not too bad to mention specific to Leah Rowan as Alicia as she is a bit of a child & makes the Altered Kinds just a little bit nicer & easy to look ... <br /> <br /> Changed types are not a good film very, really is very bad but I think you can do worse. It's not good but it can be worth checking if you don't need too much and don't have anything to do.
