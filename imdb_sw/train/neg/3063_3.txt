Images that magnify the hero mean. For example, Bonnie and Clyde honored powerful bank robbers and actually felt sympathy for them despite their evil deeds. Why? They were two people who got in depression when people were eager to live. <br /> <br /> This film does not contain any substance. The character of Viggo Mortensen recently emerges as a hero of people. Why? He is accustomed to the Idaho highway on the way to the hospital where his beaten wife has taken. Nobody bothers to understand why he tries to run everyone. If worse, when the diagnosis appears to be not a terrorist-red-neck, no one in the government wants to help him if they are trying to save their last back. <br /> <br /> Jason Priestley star star as a radio player who builds on stories with the help of our hero. <br /> <br /> Last not possible.
