Considering John Doe seems to have created the creator of Kyle XY I expected his experiment to be quite interesting. However I probably had too much expectations because I was so desperate for that. First they turned to the main character as an old man who had an idea of ​​something to show his amazing skills in front of the audience, in the public area. So after the area I began to worry that it was just entertainment. But the problem is that it was worse than no other characters were brought. They were very concerned about John Doe that made this story very bad. I was also disappointed by Dominic Purcell's performance because I did not believe John Doe's faith. Another problem is the story of the police. It seemed like already seen and it was not very good feeling. It leads us to the worst issue in the group, the structure of lessons. I was ready to see the packages coming one after another. <br /> <br /> Overall I was very disappointed with it and not suggesting to anyone. Considering how bad it was I understand better why the show has been removed. Somehow I have a feeling that it has lost its focus, develop characters to help the protagonist find his own identity. It is unfortunate because there is a possibility, as people who have met them at the club. The quality of production was also very good and correct. But I never know if it's best, maybe not, because I don't know the next section.
