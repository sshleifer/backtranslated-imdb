What's a bad film. Crashed. It was terrible. I don't know what to say about this film but DinoCrap, which I stole from one inspector and nail on his ass. AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! sigh .. Not Roger Corman which I hate, is this very bad movie of god. Well, really? But you can expect from films and computer graphics of Homoeric. Which is another thing, CGI screamed; I love this movie for dreadfully. This is undoubtedly the worst Roger Corman B-Movie, and maybe Gayest B-Movie too. It-is --- DINOCRAP! Sorry, I must suggest some nerds at this time. It's just a bad movie ... 0 / 1,000
