Boring, long, engaging, repeating, independent? This argument was seen as a bad date. Also, the focus of the school's exhausting school - using the heavy bullet of the firing that is facing so almost makes me cast? - it's always shouting that you noticed. Add the finnest of squares and almost no talk, and the film begins to feel like four epic hours about 30 minutes in. It gets worse: instead of conversations there are poorly recorded text and tips and songs that clearly show up the characters. Great opera music also. All curses to the director. <br /> <br /> All actors are quite good. The leading actor Miguel Angel Hoppe is particularly suitable for the art of the film. He and other actors have a very short time. Even these start getting boring after 5 minutes however, and someone wonders if the director tries to work on the porn function of Bel Ami. University of architecture as the Mexico City area is inspiring. How to come to universities in the US are bland (SFSU, UC, etc.)? But wait on the DVD on this film. Will you need to use the fast button? A lot.
