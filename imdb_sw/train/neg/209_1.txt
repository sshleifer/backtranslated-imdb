I can never stand a happy day after Chachi join the cast, so I knew I was in trouble when the best place in this movie was Scott Baio (skateboard after the scene!). Jodie Foster in his first "full" role returns to his normal academic performance but that is not the reason for this boring aggression. Two hours out of my life that I will never return! There are no interesting characters, amazing stories, interviews and horrible movies but the worst of all, I couldn't keep a little. California's story of the 1970s, where children are living a poor life and their parents are all lovers. Don't waste your time looking at this bad excuse for the movie.
