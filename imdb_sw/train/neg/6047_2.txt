What made the French relationship very similar was the relationship between Doyle (Hackman) and Russo (Scheider). In the tragedy led by Frankenheimer (who also brought us titles such as Raindeer Games and the Dr Moreau Island) the film focuses on Doyle and its unique vanity of catching Charnier (Rey). The fake idea that NYPD will allow Doyle to travel to Marseilles to get Pastor with the help of local French authorities is laughing loudly. I am wrong if I miss, but did not have a Charnier who escaped the city with 65 pounds of pure feeling! The value of the 32 million road but yes, send Doyle to look for this man, it was his weight after all. Please !!! The story was weak. Acting was a horrible (exclusively for hackman, who had played his part completely). The direction was on the place. Even cuts in the events were terrible. Are you gracious and look at the first phase twice and smell here.
