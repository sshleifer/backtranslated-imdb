I could not agree more with another auditor who described Jodorowsky. <br /> <br /> Barney seems to be a very frightening and realistic "wise content". He can produce candy-eye (and I like sweets), but his loyalty and the weakness of the art of the art eliminates all joy. I am afraid that most people do not succeed between the same (but actually just over) the works of Jodorowsky or even more filmmakers like Tarkovski or Kubrick (I like 2001 Odyssey and I've never bored through the last events ...) That kind of art as M. Barney makes it increasingly complicated and drives the viewers who could begin to get to the experimental movie. Common modern modern "modern" art. And watch his interview. I can only buy, sorry. And so boring. I've never been bored to see Alejandro Jodorowsky's films, while Drawing Drawing 9 was completely disappointed. Especially when it has given an opportunity to be something, actually tell something in an odd odd way (like beginning with a great drum of dedication and preparation of the ship going out.) It sells a "meeting" on the sea ... Ideas for stool The object of value (if it was painful) .. Those "various" pearls ... Everything can create a great surreal movie with some content but it was not. For some of the terrible terrible events of dressing up and artificial tea festivals ... Is it free and fine and philosophical philosophy but can not get it? I have a very good experience, but the whole movie was so interesting and engaging in something that made me physically ill. but this was only a stimulus in certain events - because it was fun and fake - so I had to witness long-term artistic incidents ... <br /> <br /> That kind of movies just kill art and spin. my view. <br /> <br /> I want more Jodorowsky !!!
