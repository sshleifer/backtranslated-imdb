Bad film films. I watched part of this on the TTV recently. My jaw dropped as I looked at the horrible pregnancy and listening to the voice of intellect. No one line from the master of one liner can come around and produce anything similar to chuckle. It was so bad to make me look for the body of Rodney Dangerfield, I beat and talked, "How can you?" I know many films are taking place quickly, and hope for money in the popularity of festivals or themes. But please, Hollywood, show little respect for your audience. It is sad and horrible that people were expected to pay to see the trophy. Under the cesspool, even on Sunday afternoon television.
