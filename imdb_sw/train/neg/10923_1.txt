A modern television show on the Egyptian curses issued to the United States in the 20 years of photography of the first DeMille of the Ten Commandments and which is revived when DeMille sets are revealed in the wilderness. The worst films I have seen for a long time. The question was a great film artists or when they were doing this film? If this is a bad movie of his worst laughably and a good film to take over his evil. If its comedy is very good but funny for all the bad reasons. You will laugh long and hard at this film, perhaps more than many other Hollywood "comedies".
