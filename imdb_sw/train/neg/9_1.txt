This is one of the dumbest films, I've ever seen. It stands next to all kinds of thriller and manages to delete all. <br /> <br /> No one good line or character in the whole mess. If there was a plot, it was after considering and even if the act was going, there was nothing good to say that the disease did not say. I honestly do not know how this kind of laziness is given and actually released, do you? Somebody is not at times thinking, 'Oh my god is a shite load' and call it a day. His plan like this has people illegally downloading, trailer looks like a completely different film, at least if you have prepared, you have not lost your time or money.
