In 1692 Salem, a child of deceitful deception on the slave's participation in witchcraft sends the whole community into chaos. The star star star Claudette Colbert and Fred MacMurray are not a burden, although it is not a clear example of infectious hysteria. He worked with three authors (Walter Ferris, Durward Grimstead, and Bradley King), the story of the story is rather interesting (especially coming out of Hollywood in 1937), though for anyone who has ever read Arthur Miller's "The Crucible", hoked-up melodrama on display here will not be allowed for too long. The biggest problem with photography can be attributed to the cast: Colbert and MacMurray are lovers of anti-patient who are prevented by hunting witch, MacMurray to be a very modern presence of this environment. * 1/2 from ****
