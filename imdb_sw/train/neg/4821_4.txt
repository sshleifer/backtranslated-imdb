Fiction film (lists according to the story although it has a "memory and" loan) about a group of scientists entering the wild of Canada to try and get Bigfoot. (They want to capture one and then hold the device track). Many scientific scientific sciences mixed in what is a red film of a group of people walking in the desert. There are several attempts to create tension and horror, but be completely honest there is nothing here to see out of some of the big looking shots of wilds. This is a perfect definition of the exploitation film, promising you very much, looking Bigfoot, but actually offers very little. Recommended for insomniacs only
