The final film of Ernst Lubitsch, completed by Otto Preminger after the long-term Lubitsch death during the production, is an act of modernization and silliness, romance and music, fantasy and costume dramatics. In the 19th century in Southeastern Europe, the Countess falls to his predecessor, the Hungarian rebel leader; he is assisted by his grandfather, whose image builds life. Betty Grable, in the long wig wig adorned with flowers, has never been more beautiful, and its songs are very beautiful. Unfortunately, this script (and Samson Raphaelson, taken from operetta by Rudolf Schanzer and E. Welisch) is faced with different ideas that fail to beat mesh - or interesting. The result is a good look, but it is not recommended. * 1/2 from ****
