Without one question of the most disgraceful of the 1970s, GAOTS seems to be true, really want to be something important. The fact of the truth is that you are not worth much in each level that one cannot help but laughs. To the despair of the features of Ingmar Bergman film, it follows the day of the desert couple in the desert ... walking through the shady, at the same time as the U. Berkeley Coffee. Almost every line of negotiation tarradiddle presented here is very bad ("I feel that life itself is composed of many small rooms like these pomegranates .... but it's good?") After what seems to be an eternity of anything happening (well. OK ... we are treated with some weakness and tepid soft sex scene, ultimately a very serious ethnic struggle associated with young Nam Namers who make a natural area and make some ballads of people very severe and acoustic guitar. Nothing is possible or interesting that happens in FILIA. I thought the picture of Larry Buchanan "Strawberries You Need Rain" was a weak example of Bergman's worship. "Gold apples" is everything wrong, but that caused by the default cause makes it remember. 1/10
