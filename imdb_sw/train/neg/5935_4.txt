The most sad thing about this "tax" is that almost all the singers (including Nick's amazing cave) seem to have missed any part of the cohen's lie that: by giving his line to the nearby wind, Cohen takes the full his poems, his rebellion, all his humanity, laughter and tears in one. To see some of those who give birth to perform the faces of torture, launches their delightful squeals in the patent quest to shout "I am a singer," is a real pain. It is the same feeling many of you probably had to listen to other awesome versions of simple songs such as "Think" Lennon. No, nothing is closer to the simplicity and transparency. If there is a type of art that does not need to be imitated, it is Cohen's art. The stripes on the road are seen as an immortal damage to the sex. In this Cohen tax I found myself suffering and suffering for the sad way of sadness and translated violently, all of them did not originally have the opposite of the master and, if actually told, a few of these singers seemed like they were are employed on a reserve storage show. It is Cohen giving them taxes for allowing them to sing his songs, in fact, not another way around: they may have been friends, or his daughter, he could have a compassionate heart and a gift. It is not bad in the family. Fortunately, but in the end, Cohen himself did his work of the "Glamorous Tower", but even the same flower was destroyed by the U2's unfamiliar history, all carrying words that inspire children during they visit their poor grandparents in the nursing home. <br /> <br /> Show sad, true, and sad if you love Cohen like me.
