I agree with many as not all Tom's original comments (bighouseaz@yahoo.com). The Zatoichi series is a study of good behavior as well as a fierce sword and excitement. I have seen Zatoichi 1-13,15,16; I believe 14 has not been removed from Zone 1 (usa). Zatoichi Outlaw was desperate. The story line was hard, and it seemed to be a hodgepodge of many ancient Zatoichi lines. One time, I was surprised if I had no idea of ​​the previous film Zatoichi. This movie was desperate because it began to rely on the effect (head, chopped legs, blood) and down on respect of Zatoichi's character. All previous films have succeeded according to the story and action, and won the following great without turning the effects. I just hope that the remaining Zatoichi films do not follow the trend. This is the first Zatoichi film from its studio. I highly recommend filing all previous films - and recommend them.
