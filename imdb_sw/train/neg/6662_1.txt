* Traders and hot fires were going before * <br /> <br /> When this show started first, I found it to be acceptable and fun. Usually Waddparents were a kind of cartoon that children and adults liked. It also had a high level with SpongeBob. But it began to fall because of the following follow-up butch Hartman and his team ran on the show. First, the toilet college is not all interesting. You can easily pull the laughter quickly from the little kiddie to the beat, but that's pretty much the only audience who would laugh at such a surprise. Then there is a kiddie joke. Lol we can see people in their underwear and we can see people dressing. LOLOLOL !!! I can just stop laughing in that same gay! Help me! But of course, this show can not absorb the worst if it was not the exhibition. What? Have you seen how the team showed Australians? They saw it not only, but the lovers of kangaroo, the boomerang-throwing players who live in the hot desert. But now ... What? The favorable favor of this WHY shows the truth comes with the greatest sound of all ... JUST BE DONE! The show always draws the same joke (most of them being unfunny) think it is a great thing ever! Cosmo is more than complain. I hated how they continued to mention "Super Toilet" (which also has a mixture of religious humor in it too) and Cosmo would be free. And who can forget the lamb's joke that every religious child in Dimmsdale could use in this e-mail period? You know, every single parent (don't know other parents say so) will say the word one chapter before breaking their child's room? Yes, it may be the first class of humor for other people, but it is pure to *** for others. <br /> <br /> If I am wrong, I believe Butch Hartman said something about completing the show. Thank you God! Everyone around my area says it is, like, a funniest show of Nickelodeon forever. I can't agree with that? I think it's another bunch of horses that we get on our cartoon stations every day, just worse.
