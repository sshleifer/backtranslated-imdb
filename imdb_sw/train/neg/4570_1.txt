If you're wondering who Ramtha * bleep is: "Ramtha is a 35,000-year-old hero who appeared in JZ Knight's kitchen in Tacoma, Washington in 1977. Knight claims that he is Ramtha. Ramtha and makes sessions that he makes to go to the trance and speaks the Hollywood of Elizabethan's English with the sound of the intestines, the sound of husky.At thousands of supporters and has made millions of dollars to do as Ramtha in the seminar ($ 1,000 crack) and at Ramtha School of Enlightenment, and from the region's sales, books, and equipment (Clark and Gallo 1993) He should have the authority to cheat.
