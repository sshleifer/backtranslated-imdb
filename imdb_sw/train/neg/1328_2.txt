This is a real stupid movie in the type of normal 80s: act of blowing. In this way it is similar to the rush hour but it is not quite good for the action, laughter and chemistry among the main characters of the film. It is obvious that I enjoy Jay Leno as standing and as a host of exhibition, but it can't do. He is angry when he tries to act hard - he can manage the trademark on his face saying his ranks, by the way, is not very funny. And seeing him running (even back there) is not pleasant. In addition, I feel that Pat Morita - at least at today's levels - does not give the correct political sense of Japanese. Do not even get me started about the story. I offer 2 out of 10.
