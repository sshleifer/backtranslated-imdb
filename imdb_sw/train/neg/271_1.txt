I can't believe how this shows the popular. I think it's a fast-sci-fi fan. I have read many sci-fi novels and have enjoyed many sci-fi movies and television shows. I can't even think this sci-fi really. Every part I sat was like blind, spilled under the Star Trek section, removing something that could make it exciting or exciting. It is basically a group of people standing near the fatigue of ARMY, talking about a boring thing, which regularly passes through Stargate and ends on a planet that looks like the world, and people who seem to hear just like human beings! It seemed a very low budget. All characters are forgetting pieces, and many attempts of humor fall flat. It reminds me when you see business with a famous runner in it, trying to be funny, but not. It's just sad. <br /> <br /> The movie was awesome too. There's a lot you can do with a portal through space, but everywhere ARMY people are going to be BORING! This does not explore ideas! I really thought the TV series "Nation of Guests" from a few years back (according to the Muslim Muslims film) was much better. The edition contained fine stories of stories and dignified characters. I was not crazy about the "Alien Nation", but compared to this inserted crap, it was good! <br /> <br /> Also, unlike the new series of "Battlestar Galactica", "Stargate" has published a look and feel of the crippled movie very close! They should have at least updated cheesy "toilet flushing" special effects of everyone passing through Stargate.
