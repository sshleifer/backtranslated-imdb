O my master. This movie ... It was awesome. I am a great fan of awesome movies. And often, the horrible movies people say are bad, I would. The actor who played 'Scarecrow' was amazing, I will say so. But this plot was bad. It didn't mean! It had many ways, and unwanted sex (and anti-sex) initiatives. I believe the director was trying to be 'terrible' or what, but just came bad. In order to add to a pile of stuck by running the race, the actors (rather than 'scarecrow') are bad, and I was so concerned about them that I had a little memory of who I was. In conclusion, this film made me sick. If you can avoid viewing this film in any way, please do.
