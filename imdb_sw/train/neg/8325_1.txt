I just saw this movie last night and, that someone who had a very low expectation to start with, was still desperate. The most serious error in this movie's disgust is that the main stage of the compound (the boy being awake during surgery), had nothing to do with the result. It would have been the same way no matter what. So, what was the matter of this? Who knows. Also, the doctor had 4 charges against him and did not think people would ask questions if the patient died on his table? Give me a break. Jessica Alba is very good and Christiansen is almost as bad. The whole thing was laughable from the beginning to the end. I am sure that if you could feel someone using your chest with your head, you would have more pain than that.
