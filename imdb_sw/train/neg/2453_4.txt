I might give this movie a high level before the trilogy of Peter Jackson occur, but see two of them in turn there is no comparison only. The motion of this film has fled, many important events from the book are left out, and there is a little progress. Animation is an amazing mix of traditional cartoon animations and actions made up, which I have found to be worried. And the disappointing thing about this film is that it breaks in the middle of the story and has never been finished. There are some good things - the things of war are exciting to watch, and the conversation follows the book very much by letter. Watch this one if you have a fast and can't spend 10 hours looking at a new trilogy. But if you haven't read the book you might be confused, because there is a lot of missing this edition. 4 out of 10.
