Bernard Rapp was lost last year and was a cultural journalist. Cinema was one of his great desires (he wrote a great film around the world) and was therefore bound to use the camera at least once in his life. But the films he left find a lukewarm review: "Tiré à Part" (1996) despite the exciting performance of Terence Stamp was very photographed in the exhibition of the actors, "Affaire De Goût" (2000) was another thing even though Bernard Giraudeau made the performance improperly, "Pas Si Grave" (2003) was another allowed by "Un Petit Jeu Sans" is as fun as its predecessors. Its comic capabilities are used by flimsy. And yet, the idea of ​​the beginning is to predict twirling, spiritual comedy. The couple held by Yvan Attal and Sandrine Kiberlain who invited their friends are actively moved into a house of spoil. In order to play with their visitors, they are making a part of the company together. And things don't work as planned because the announcement of their separation is not surprising. Two partners begin to reflect on the legality of their couple. Even with the most beautiful environment and trustworthy facilities that he was capable of, the incomprehensible Rapp recipes cannot manage to provide life for this game and unexpected results. The program tracks the pattern with the characters who have special jobs and masks that are exposed to who they are. The view or events of the comic often fall flat. Bad layout opens a little more films with this bad habit from Rapp to get a lot of trouble in a sudden. Even the real client of the client in the project is clear. They seem to be bored and repeating their writings than surviving, especially Sandrine Kiberlain. The audience soon caught in a serious problem. It is regrettable to say that Bernard's films have never lived for its purposes as "Un Petit Jeu sans Consquence" gives evidence.
