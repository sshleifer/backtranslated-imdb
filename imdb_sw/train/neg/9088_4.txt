It has been said several times - it's not too small for me - to look at Eric Rohmer's film is like to look at the gray color; it seems that Mr. Rohmer rejects this (refused, but then he would, he just loved) so much that his new movie, which could also be his last, inch Allah, installed too far in time that is like watching a woad dry. The amazing people who gave Vague Newle, Cahiers du Cinema have already called it one of the best films of 2007 to give you an idea. The fact is not about the Rohmer agenda so that in the 5th century France should have a single chate that will not be far away from the loire valley when only the other houses we see are the wrong wooden house. The story involves nymphs and pastors and as he often does Rohmer and the unknown who just came out so that the overall result was that the annual class of playing in Special Needs School was captured on film by accident. One is about to be tempted to say 'Rudi Godard, all is forgiven' but even this powerless production can not make me say those words.
