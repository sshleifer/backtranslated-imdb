He loved the original story, he had great expectations for the film (especially since Barker was engaging in him in an interview), finally saw it and what can I say? It was a total MESS! Turning over the place, the act was angry, flashy and choreography pictures were full of flat, empty and totally unimportant (what has a common music video technique as a slow-slow speed? vibe on some of MTV music videos Marilyn Manson / Smashing Pumpkins / Placebo. While some killings are pretty cool and brutal, some are just ridiculously laughable (first kill on a Japanese girl was hilarious and Ted Raimi death was just stupidly funny). It comes just everywhere with zero tension and insisting, moving to the original story and then returning to the finale which at the moment only feels to deal with even more damage. No explanation was made, I mean I knew what was happening only if I would like to read the story but for people who didn't even be confused even though sometimes I didn't know what you were going to and what you tried to do - it was going to have a false impression at all. God, I wanted to love this film if I am a big fan of Barker's work and I love story as it has great potential for a movie to lose, hell I was happy with some of Kitamura movies as fun but fun this film The only taken of amateurism and silliness from the beginning to the end - I was not worried about anyone or anything, anything ran away and cut off from the actual source, turning it into something completely different. In fact it was gory and Vinnie Jones played a good badass, but everything else around the place, more desperate. It was hit
