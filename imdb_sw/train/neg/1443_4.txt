Starting a little good: several times Swayze speaks Zulu to his friends or the language is heard among the tribes. That includes the largest, as usual viewers of American movies and UK think all people on this planet say English (just if you're one of them: none of them). But acting is a 'tenenkrommend' as we say in the Netherlands (it makes your fingers - and not a good way). I love Swayze but for this is bad. The muscles in his jaw make an extra time and he wonders the whole movie - one person must have told him it looks sandy. No Patrick: seems to have a compensation for lack of behavior. Alison Doody (Elizabeth) has decided in a fashionable style that is not found in the style of its employees. His acting party has locked that this film would have been installed in the current day. And not. Your frock was a clue, Alison. The best acting from the people from the African continent and the Onyulo side as Umbopa was the best. Clear, warm and characteristic, its performance is fun to watch. General: it is an yah-entertainment day. It's compassionate. It can be better. Sack director.
