I agree that although this story with Melville can only be unsuccessful, this is not a reliable test. Transfer the story in the 20th century only the anger of the original story of the mind and nature; maybe you have been able to transfer the UK, but it must be a piece of the period. Even our storyteller - owner - tells for flashback, return even more, somewhere near the 1800s. By the end of the 19th century, an incredible employee will be prepared without thought. And the 20th century? Come! Give me break break expletive! Even around 1800, such behavior does not work very well, because of the latter. And the end of the film? I don't know what, because I didn't have all the attention - I had to stop. This was like to put the "Cause Pathway" in Elizabethan England.
