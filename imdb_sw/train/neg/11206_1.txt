No one big fan of the Flashman newsletter Geroge Macdonald Fraser than me. <br /> I was surprised to see now that Richard Lester described the Royal Flash, as I also see that he has made three / four Watketeers and Fraser which I though has shown well. It is not the Royal Level. I was 12 years old when the film was released and could not be more enthusiastic since I had read all the Flashman papers published so far, and had been cut by Clockwork Orange and Malcolm MacDowel (still, but he was never given a chance after that. (I saw it again when I was 20 years old on TV and it looked bad) <br /> <br /> No strict conversation in books is transferred to the screen. The comedy of Flashman's character seemed to me to be mishandled in the same way as a person who could think of a group of high school students trying to understand. Stirring and fence was bad and destructive. Looking back with more mature eyes, the film has not been completed using the direct satire option of the original version of Zenda's original film. <br /> <br>> If you have read this book and I have not seen the film, I can only say that the film has had Flashman and Rudi von Starnberg become a fast and play game Rudi has explored: Russian roulette. Lovely violence of everything that these books say. <br /> <br /> My comment will be direct if I see a movie recently, but I'm glad I don't. If any chance Fraser has ever read this, I can only say I think he is a professional - perhaps the comic author of his generation, but, thanks to my appreciation of the work, it is hard to believe that he wrote The screenplay of this film, like that made all these bad films Roger Moore James Bond.
