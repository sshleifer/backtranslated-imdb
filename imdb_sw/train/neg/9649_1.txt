Who were they working for this? There was so much in this film that was hard to dig. From the time Arjun (Ajay Devgan) did not know he loves death to his father when he arrived in London with his uncle (played with Om Puri) just to hear him a minute later. The only problem with the theory is that anyone who has ever gone through London Heathrow knows that that day is impossible to pull and especially not in Hindi. But the trouble of the film does not stop there, there are two main issues (Salman Khan and Ajay Devgan) who pass as rock stars when they reach their dreams. I mean we saw the effectiveness came to Susan Boyle (a woman in the UK reaching her dreams after 50 years) but that was a common case. It was very difficult for me to stop my unbelief because I felt that the casting of Salman and Ajay was just pregnant. They could never dismiss Madhuri Dixit and Sridevi to take on the same roles and why we should be obliged to watch Ajay Devgan and Salman Khan (the best men in their 40 years) around very closely trying their self-20 years? Let's not even talk about a very independent actor on the screen today, Asin. This is his second film (which I have seen) and he has no hope as an actor, so he feels to him that he engages himself with a good look and focusing on the camera instead of performing good performance. It is hard to believe that he has reduced all other functions of the film so that the stars in this fluff and then become fluffy as an actor, there is nothing to write at home at all. And above all, the film just made. There is nothing special about it, expect me to predict everything of cliched that will happen in it.
