This movie shows a piece of animal life of the strangled animal and the skin to be cut off. I know these horrible things happening in the world, but I am looking at the movies according to the fact that what Im look is not happening on the screen. These parts of live animals are not intended to be in movies, it means to show people who belong to certain organizations to help bad things that people do other kinds. <br /> <br /> This should be banned and destroyed. I've contacted Netflix and other resources to share this film off the market! <br /> <br /> This movie should be removed from the public. The person who made this film needs psychological help.
