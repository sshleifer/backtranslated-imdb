Although this idea is more original than many Sci-Fi movies, the implementation is, as long as it does not exist. While the effects of female silence are not evil, and the character of the "Gun Nut" is located on an impressive, real drawing is seeing Morena Baccarin and Adam Baldwin gathered on small screens. I think it was an idea at all. They are doing better with what they have but "they should see" when I was in the first 40 minutes or so when the character of the Lord struck the Tomb Raider chair. Not on the movie screens I know but you can't deny the true beauty when you see it! And Adam Baldwin once again reduces as a boy you like to hate. If you just want to look at your favorite Firefly columns you have a good time and other low-down devices then this can be yours. If you want good and behavioral development then you are advised to look elsewhere.
