First technical review. Script is slow, in fact it's a 25-minute story that was beaten up to 1 40 min. Talk is flat and real one-dimensional. "Acting" is amazing, seemingly having school children raised from school to read a few verses from the idiot board. For "sure" all of the stories, namely "war is bad" (oh, there is a shock!) It really does not exist. Without the "amazing feeling" and getting great publicity "nobody will talk about this film. It is very bad to worry about the best things that this money would have continued. for them at least they were shot and made well when the camera trembled during two events in this! Read all other reviews - avoid at all costs and do not talk about it.
