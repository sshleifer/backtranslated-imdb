Who did the study of this film? It has been installed in Baghdad in 2004, however all soldiers wearing ACU and have a Universal Camouflage Pattern gear. No one wearing these items at 04. This film did not make sense, it has characters come and go without clarity, and people are doing things that are foolish that will never happen in real life. I realize it's a movie, but it's definitely trying to try something real. Fails to fail, but it tries. It is like a person who came with a random group of ideas, and gave them a swallow and swallowed the film. I will not recommend this film to anyone. I am still sure why I'm sitting all the way. GI Joe is one that made you think compared to this. KAA MBALI!
