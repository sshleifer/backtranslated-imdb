The production of TV at the start of 2000 was among the weak and the worst. Before marking as (Alias, Lost, Prison Break, Employee Workers, or Monk) TV did not hit the correct yet, which could focus on the audience's interest 2000s. The names (Hunter Relic), (Mutant X), (The World of the World), (Sheena), or even (Baywatch Hawaii) did not encourage you to watch and follow, or at least did not stimulate and attract all the time as before. (Special Unit 2) had no discrimination. In fact it's Men in Black meets Files Files X! (As if these were a special unit 1). But even according to this brilliant formula; did not work properly. It promised you; at that time there was an external monitoring of "normal" cases after ten years of multiple X files, so the natural spirit of covering them too (consider Mulder as a womanizer!). However (item 2) was not more powerful in this, or is the power when filling the Sci-Fi's show of comic. It was very ridiculous, where for instance every sexy state should turn into a disgusting thing. Enjoyed such a bad taste. (Michael Landes) was not charismatic and largely impossible as a player. Her chemistry and (Alexondra Lee), with any sexual orientation, was all black. Indeed the exhibition was looking for beauty but in general it was an unwanted task. It is clear that nothing is more interesting than its main idea. Among other tasks (Evan Katz) as a collaborator and producer as (Seven days) before or (24) this time must be low! In spite of a different personality, it has become the pride of ignorance for a lot of time. So if that had a purpose, then they made one of the most realistic! And indeed, it will be one of the most beautiful times to thank you for deleting the show after just 19 sessions!
