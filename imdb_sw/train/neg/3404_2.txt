I can't stuck this film for every technical technical f | u | c | k | u | p s, it will take two days to explain how anything is impossible even beyond. Some have described all ignorance already. From all of this, I could still have a kind of enjoyment, if only they didn't include all the maudlin, nausea, ignore, Disneyesque craping crap, which doesn't exist anywhere, but nowhere is in place, where a very small mistake can die of acute death. <br /> <br /> "Workers", with the real "astronaut" were guilty of putting all their evil in front of everything else. It is completely destroyed any value of production that would have left. I wonder that NASA will allow this waste so that many people can get the worst information about the most important thing for them. If you haven't seen this yet, keep anger. See Apollo 13 again. At least that he tried to be a real kind.
