I saw this film back (while working on a trailer for a film production company) and it was TERRIBLE. Hewitt is the best mediocre, Hopkins hits his performance in (but still drives off Hewitt in their events together) and Alec seems to be tired. Believe me about this: you should avoid this film as a blow if available. It seems to continue forever if the plot of fatigue continues to the snail's speed. It's unfunny without permanent, the movies are crappy and the direction is pedestrian. Alec Baldwin should go to the film school if he has a plan to lead again. In terms of his acting, his behavior is not quite possible, which makes it impossible to strengthen. Dan Ackroyd is pretty funny and amazing makeup of the jury near the end of the film is cute, but this film is just plain bad.
