This is not a stirring movie, the audience can sit on his favorite seat of this selfish character, Miles Berkowitz, a movie partner and actress here. The story of the story is simple: after divorce and ten years of unemployed work, the author plays it to want love in front of the camera. The first question is about how it really is all: what is written, what comes to chance? All answers, "yes" or "no" shows M.Berkowitz as a minimum human right. If you are looking for a lie about such love, I urge you to read some of the comic books of independence: Chester Brown, Joe Matt ... In addition to this, I felt I've heard much hearing against my country, France. I know the Americans say that French is proud (which can be true then), and, indeed, French (and the whole world) have a lot of complaints against America, but why do you hate it so much? Don't think I can't love this film just because of it however.
