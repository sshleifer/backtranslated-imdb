what you do never do waste your time on this useless. movie. Remake that was not required to be restored. Everyone who came from the reminder had the same opinion. The worst movie I saw. Save your time and money! Nicgolas Cage was running a bicycle under the mountains, swimming with water and running down the mountains when he was beaten by bees but still his suit was still fully wrapped in a white shirt until the last area. Even though the best hit by Ellen Bernstein and Cage acting was not as strange as the movie itself. It's amazing how good actors can make such bad movies. Don't get a copy of the first script. If you are still interested in watching the movies at a very short time waiting to come out of the DVD.
