I went without knowing anything about this movie and I came out in half an hour to know everything about it. It was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I am usually a good person but if someone told me they liked this film, maybe I would never talk to them again. Anyone who loves it in that way is most likely to have a lot of personality. I also include that they think they are very intelligent too, as the fart bags themselves make the sound of the movie. I know everyone has different types of humor, some people even go like me, but that's okay; I don't think this covers any humor though. This movie is as flat and lighter as the mind of Wes Anderson. Sign in and be ready to walk out; it's good to get your money too.
