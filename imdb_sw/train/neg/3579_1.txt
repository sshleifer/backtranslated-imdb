Once you have rented and watched this film several years ago, a friend and I decided to specify zero for the film level. There was nothing about the movie that could be done more than it was. To this day we continue to measure movies, even worse, to what better than "Lonely Women" they are. <br /> <br /> Long ago I saw an interview with Eleanor Perry, who wrote pictures for, among other things, "Last Summer" and "Diary of Mother's Mother," and said that she was asked to write screenplay for a book Harold Robbins "The Lonely Lady." He said he sent treatment and rejected because they didn't think he understood the problems of a female artist in Hollywood. Then he said "I think they have another person to write." The interview was done before the movie was released. He died in 1981, and I said the first thing he did when he came to heaven was personally grateful to God for saving him from participation in the results.
