"Crush" is fun enough 40-friends romantic friends flick for the first two-thirds or so, as it tries to be the Brit "Sex and City". I was very happy to turn around with a young striker whose character is not very good (come to think we didn't see his whole body of physical and Kenny Doughty is worth seeing more). They are making a big deal of a woman / woman older than what was done against it or "Sabrina" (or movies do not like it) or for it with Douglas / Zeta -Jones or Dion / Svengali Workers. <br /> <br /> All around Andie MacDowell as an old pat otherwise is a welcome family from games of britches and comedies, such as Chancellor Anna. <br /> <br /> The rotation plan to the end you feel very much machina. But it was not until finally that I realized what could be wrong. As with "Gender and City," the author / director is male, here the first lady Scotland John McKay, and I think she wanted to make a script about male males, maybe about them coming out related to their partners and work (characters are chief The school, the soldier and the doctor), which would have been the best and most interesting movie. The title of the film's work was "Sad F * Cker" which would have made an identical to gay "Broken Hearts Club" more open. <br /> <br /> (previously written 4/6/2002)
