Tony Scott destroys anything that might be a attraction to the clich√©d of Richard Kelly, wrong, screenplay overwrought. Domino Harvey (Kiera Knightley) was an example that descended and became a patron of virtue. This is his story ... "kind of". <br /> <br /> The problem with this garbage is that there is not a lot of stories all the time with Scott's extreme graphic stylization of each shooting actions as a way of distancing which makes us different from everything in life of Harvey. You don't care about Harvey. Knightley plays with him as a brutal, stupid person who did nothing to prove our dignity. He influences people who do not like and closes his clothes and carpets when the situation is needed, but not too small and certainly not the lowest influence, either. It is a boring film. It's a great voice, too, and locked by one of the most exciting music symbols I've heard for a long time. The last twenty minutes are running again to the peak of "Real Romance" of Scott and the Domino squad going to meet two sets of evil people who are wondering! surprise! - with the aim of shooting out each other on the casino of Las Vegas. Unfortunately, this exciting density is quite disturbed by Scott and becomes a nuisance of frustration, meaningless, in celluloid ignorance. This is not a piece of courage or measurement test; it is a failure of each level because it does not give us an entry point for life and the difficulty of its characters. Mickey Roarke looks good as a bustle hunter, but it disappears like "details" develops. Chris Walken returns in another embarrassment to come with Dabney Coleman, always stable, used under work. Do not lose the face of a multi-colored film, with gimmick-ridden. It is still a turd no matter how hard you beat it.
