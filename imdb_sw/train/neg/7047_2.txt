Warning: Neither Zeta-Jones nor McGregor do not have a great place if the poster believes. Their roles are really small. The film is a bad reminder between a proud player and a realistic actor, without realizing it. In particular I find it difficult to emphasize the main character, not to mention his screwball friends and sexually active partner. The program is very refreshing, and I have removed this after 2/3 - unfamiliar to me, if I want to finish what I start. Good order and beauty takes from 1 star to 2. <br /> <br /> 2/10
