* Show of observer * <br /> Firstly I beat this 2 movie out of 10. <br /> The view is good, but there are many stupid errors in the film, fail to do this game psyching that can be. First of all he has not fought alone. After the most amazing doubts from his mother (which cannot believe when a mother shows that she is a helper and love later in the movie) rape survivors are not alone. <br /> <br /> She is also a fool of pride always falling into the strange traps of Crew. <br /> <br /> His friends are very bad. What I see is amazing is that Ethan can't control the staff while changing its opinon. Ethan is the leader of the Workers (hey, even saying so) and people seem to think that someone else is jerk, but when Ethan changes his opinion he can't manage to convince even one person in Crew that he's right and that his old friend is right. Everyone just loves him ... why? Movie has no details. What? Has he ever been a leader? Remember the funny is that my boyfriend thought I was looking at Beverly Hills when he came in. Two characters from the same series of TV-success .... The cheapest way to get the audience?
