Eric Rohmer's 'Lady and Duke' is the basis of the English aristocrat magazine that lived through the French revolution. But it is planned, and its wonderful back, built back with a voice of speech. Additionally, this picture of this fearful age is practiced almost entirely when one removes the actual action; The person sees very little ordinary people in this film, and a bit of chaos, poverty and fear that happened away from the drawing rooms of the persecuted, but destroyed, trust classes. The result is very common, and ultimately not known about the forces that sometimes run the community with the brink of destruction; is a desperate film from a qualified director.
