Comedy refined, re--like revu which was originally a car showing a radio star at one time Jack Pearl but now it is better to remember as an American introduction to the Three Stooges. True, Larry, Curly and Moe are beaten with Comic Ted Healy as Ted Healy and Three Stooges. Although the hand that supports Jimmy Durante (who is completely lost on small devices) and ZaSu Pitts, the only film audience today is the carers of the ears, and they will not even have a lot of praise here. With a loud voice and patience, it shows how far Hollywood had to reach a certain modern standard. * 1/2 from ****
