Memoirs of Geisha is a good movie published, no doubt about it. And acting in general is the best, at least in a way that shows the characters as written. <br /> <br /> However, many small and big details are just _wrong_ just that it bothers me so much that he can enjoy it perfectly. A little explanation that shows the type of lack of sensitivity is one part (no this does not waste anything) where the Mameha hits a bell that depends on the door of the house where Sayuri lives, a snowy day. The bell he is shouting fuurin, or the wind - which is just left hanging out of the house in Japan in the summer! People in traditional Japanese houses did not have a door - they opened the door and announced themselves. (You may think this is a very trivial description, but I will be able to compare this to a video made on America where the Christmas string is on the door in July and no one thinks anything.) And even start to start on the most unpleasant hairstyles given to countries and geisha, which is mounted pan-Asia / Chinese / kung-fu-ish, and nothing like the real thing. I think this view of the fighter on culture who are trying to show it comes from a realistic view of people and situations. So, I think that under you you know about the Japanese culture and the world of geisha and worlds in Kyoto (which is "Miyako" is), then I think more you will enjoy this. In fact I think this movie would be much better ... as it is, it is another version of Hollywood's "Japanese Foreign".
