I was fascinated by Big Rig's comments and comments when they attended the SXSW Film Festival in Austin, TX. However, I was interested in getting chairs was just Big Big when it ended. Big Rig comprises several "big rig" drivers who offer offer products in the United States. The characters are all wonderful people, however the film writers have never dug into their complexity as people. Instead, artists such as maps in the film cause lead, but never do. For more, we are lost. We - listeners - may go anywhere and, like the direction of the story, goes somewhere but without guidance, location, or compound. Why are we here? Where are we? How did we get here? Describe the story is complicated by the directors on "humanizing" a group of people they see as "neglected" and "invisible" comes as unknown and angry. The problem here lies in the view of directors instead of truck drivers. Directors bring their own ideas about ignorance over motorists and then just edit the film to prove those ideas. In general, the story is not suitable for any tension, the film is too long (it should be a 15-minute sketch), the big question of "Why" is not answered, and the whole film is one part of the propaganda that sees nothing to continue "shine" (as directors claiming the outside world about people emerging.
