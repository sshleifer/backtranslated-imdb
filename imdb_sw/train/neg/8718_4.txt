The third part of the trilogy of "Carnosaur" comprises a group of Keystone Kops-quality military commandos trying to kill two Velociraptors and T-Rex. I give 4 due to the great mercy and my fellowship for dinosaurs. Movie is more obvious than trilogy, it certainly cannot be taken seriously. To a greater extent, however, to watch this film I can not help but see interesting comparisons between "Carnosaur" and "Xtro" trilogies. The first phase in both franchise is a dark film, which has been a tribal ritual, the second is "Alien" player, and the third is a language-in-cheek, close to the slapstick (if it is intentional or not) The movie that has you spinning on the floor laughter. Also, as the "Xtro" franchise, all the "Carnosaur" movies are not quite available. They carry the name of the franchise just beat interest in "sequels," I think. Obviously "Carnosaur" and "Xtro" have two different categories of production at work here, but if you have seen all three franchise movies you find yourself describing both back and middle between two.
