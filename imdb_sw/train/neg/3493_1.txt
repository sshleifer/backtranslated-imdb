I rarely write reviews to IMDb.com, but I feel compelled to warn viewers that this movie is awesome. Just awesome. I love Shaw movies (I do not hate.), And I had great expectations for this since I found it in the "10 Best Kung Fu / Martial Arts Movies" list. (Now I believe that those 10 best lists are all working to cut and set.) First of all, there is no action in the film. Most of the movies comes talking about the plot, which is surprising because it is thin for the best. And the action itself can be surprising back in 1978, but it is common to today's standards. Special warning for Netflix users: the DVD they ship is awesome; The picture is bad and even 16: 9 has been enhanced.
