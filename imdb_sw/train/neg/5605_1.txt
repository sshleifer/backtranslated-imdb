I was very disappointed with this film. I expected more of Thelma's film and Louise's female. Instead, women's prison refugees in this flick, did not trust anyone else. They were a great pack of hyenas, which they fought, crossed twice, and even committed rape of women against other women in the film. Instead of being thieves, stuck together To avoid escape and find hidden secrets, the saved women were very selfish and evil, trusting for a long time. These women were not free in good condition. They just became a small, dependent group, with no self-esteem, or each other. If you love the women's 70-year films, skip the bomb, and see The Great Texas Dynamite Chase, which star Claudia Jennings and Jocelyn Jones.
