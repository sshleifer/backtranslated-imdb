Well, I ordered this on my payment for every house because I was tired and needed laughter. I must admit, I did hate a few times, but I don't remember how they were. I don't understand why this film was made. It claims to be a comedy but largely, I do not see the singular penis, or a 70-year-old woman who is very happy. This film was trying to connect itself into recent years such as the American Pie and Road Trip, but failed to fail. It was a way to stir it out so much and it was beautiful. Also, why did Cameron Diaz put his name to this movie in the world? The only thing I liked about this film is when Dave and Angela were in the pond. I thought it was nice and fun and it was done well. Apart from this, avoid this film. 3/10
