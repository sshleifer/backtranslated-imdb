I personally hated this film because it was predictable, the characters were normal, and any idea was removed by "Cutting Cutting", and "Cadet Kelly". The main character is a snotty girl who gets transported to a place where she is not. The whole area hates him, and doing the worst thing there is a boy who seems to not like it (well duh the whole damn school can't stand). Surprisingly he finds a way to get in and make everyone love him with him, he finds a guy fall head on the heels with love with him. Then comes the choice, where you must ague between skate skate and hockey. He chooses hockey and then goes to the skating of the figures of the figure, and gets on the Olympic team. There is no real surprise there. All this movie was well predicted You knew what would happen before you saw it. That was so bad around the puked, and when I had finished watching it, I had a nausea and a shooting shock myself by looking at the trophy. Do not look at this unless you are less than ten, or actually you like medium movies.
