Watching the first 30 minutes of Sands of Oblivion gives me great hope. It seemed when I was in the cheap Mummy version. Establishing it was promising, in 1920 Cecil B. Demille makes its commands of the Ten Commandments. It seems to use the Egyptian realities for the movie they made they did the old and horrible (not always?). Identify what provided DeMille commands to set the entire set instead of normal opening exercises. Hope will be buried with them at all times. Then we switch up to the present day where the team tries to dig the site (the first film fault, but hey the cost of time is expensive and this is a movie Sci-Fi channel). The first exhibition of the Anubis monster is well done and is a dress that works hard and is not the usual effect of CG particles. Then the importance of the body begins. That's the movie that went south for me. The fact of the fact that people are dying in a bad and mysterious way finds surprises. Once you realize that the old evil has already been opened and is about to kill what the issue of the stock leads to man and woman do? They usually stop the "guy who knows the truth but never told anyone". After getting the important information they are copying with the partners on the digging site? No, they stand at the hotel for refreshing shelves and good conversation. Actually I'm not a very aggressive person but if I knew that demons from ancient Egypt was free to kill everyone in front and would come after me I would put a little in my action to solve the problem. After this middle and useless part goes around to destroy the monster of Anubis in the usual way, to run around the buggies of the dune and shoot with the rocket launcher while standing with a bunch of phosphorus bombs. For the Sci-Fi movie was on the most common trick they give, which doesn't say much. What bothers me is this could be a lot more if someone had written a good script for it.
