It's here. finally the movie comes out that I can honestly say it's worse than Larry cable cable: health inspector. However I am interested in hitting the wayan brothers (hilarious) to make more money than I did in my whole life on what is really one of the five worst films of all time, out of my fifth grade out of the romeo enrollment and Juliet. I mean why anyone will ever see this film unless they are paid to pay. Comedy is weak and all the joke away from the flimsy plot certainly clear in advertising. The last word is this movie was awesome for my horror. And the ads seemed to be promising ...
