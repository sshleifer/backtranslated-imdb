*** SPOILER *** Do not read this, if you think about watching the film, though it will be a waste of time. (By the way: the plot is predicting that it does not make any difference if you read this or not) It is worth it if you wonder if you will see "Coyote Ugly" or not: don't! It is not worth money for tickets or VHS / DVD. "Chick-Feel-Good-Flick" level, one can say. The secret itself is as deep as it can be, a ridiculous and unusual version of the American Way. A beautiful girl from a small town to be a great success in New York. A few attempts to give any film of failure, such as the "crash" of the father's accident, "problems" of Violet's relationship with her boyfriend, and so on. McNally (Director) tries to please the sympathy of the audience and sadness has no opportunity to succeed in this attempt due to a bad script and acting badly. Especially Piper Perabo fails to convince one of the "jersey" fear of singing in front of the audience. Just good (and quite interesting thing) about "Coyote Ugly" is John Goodman, who represents a small ray of hope for this film. I was very surprised, that Jerry Bruckheimer gave this film. First "Goed In 60 Seconds" and now this ... what happened to good movies like "The Rock" and "Con Air"? That was true of Bruckheimer. If you are looking for a high-quality film with women looking only to have the evening caused, you should go further and see "Charlie's Angel" (it's more interesting, entertaining and independent) than this flick. Two / two (3 out of 10).
