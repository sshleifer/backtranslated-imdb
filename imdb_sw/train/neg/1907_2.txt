The worst piece of garbage can be a racist, gender and homophobic all at once, while pretending to be very chic and modern. Atrocious displays, screens played by cliche, and boring patterns make this film clear. Two events were very sad - which Schaech hits his tongue after kissing with another person (may be general), and an area in which Eastwood is sought by a friend of Schaech, who pretends to be Russian. After leaving the room says "f ** guests of the king"! To a large extent being a cultural artist who has a dream to live in Paris !! Jonathon Schaech can be an actor who appears on the screen, and is looking for amazing. It is not embarrassing to learn more from working with gay gay gay Gregg Araki in the original film, and trying to salvage this film from a drop of gay and dwarf humor.
