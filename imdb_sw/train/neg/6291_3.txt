I recently had the pleasure of looking forward to looking at the Bachelor Party of fun, one of my new biographies, laughed until it hurt some kind of movies. So I wanted to see the player, hoping it would have the same match, but instead of the Bachelor Party 2: Last End is made by the American Pie generation where it doesn't matter to the purpose of the first film hole. Well, the first film has dirt, but it doesn't show in every single area. Also the plot is quite similar to the first, not always complained to me, but this may be a little more natural. The only thing is that I am glad that at least the original artists from nature appeared on this film, because it would be cheesy or look for a lie. <br /> <br /> Ron and Melinda are involved, after just 2 months of dating, everyone is against it. Melinda has a wealthy family, but they are very happy with Ron, and Melinda's brother, Todd is afraid that Ron will take his job. So it goes out at the weekend to Miami to the bachelor party and Todd will make sure that he will become a trap Ron in a picture that will make Melinda change his mind about marriage. Bachelor Degree 2: The final test consists of a couple laughing here and there, but above all they can't give what the first film was completed. These guys, friends of Ron, were much more concerned than, except for Seti, was kinda funny. The only characters who are better than Seth are Ron and Melinda, everyone else gets your nerves. Want to watch this movie? Just watch Girls Gone Wild, it's just one thing that doesn't try to pretend to be a film. Close to a Bachelor's Degree, that's a movie that will find you with tears of laughter. <br /> <br /> 3/10
