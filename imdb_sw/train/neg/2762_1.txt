... no one looks at the film. My husband and I went to see last night. It's just a small venue, but usually there is a decent amount of people there. Not this time! Only my husband and I showed the war of the dragon last night! Now we know why. The movie was one of the worst I ever seen. Yes, CG was good, but that's it. Acting, script & chat, lead, edit, etc. was bad-of God! Since we were alone in the room, we felt free to talk during the film. That is, we talked about how bad it was, to remind us of the Great Power Morphin Power, Godzilla, the Conflict of Death and Lord of Pete. It was as we expected to see Rita and Lord Zed to show them to the army of Sauron. <br /> <br /> Creatures were worried. You can not only set up dino / dragon forces / heavy load items with no definitions. The Lord of the ring has a whole spectrum of characters, but it starts and develops them on 3 movies, not an hour and a half. <br /> <br /> Change location is awesome. I don't sleep during the film, but though it was a very high plot, I found myself lost in the holes of the plot. The characters were of the American basketball, but they spoke around the broken English because of the written text wrong on the script. <br /> <br /> The last part that can redeem a certain value of the film ... failed. Ethan did not know when Sara died ... though he did not know for so long during this life anyways. He wasn't found to be very angry to leave "Mordor", not knowing where he was or how to return. We could not with God's love know where he was or how he got there or, but if he was not angry we should not be. Oh, and why is the dress that Sarah's spirit was wearing to look like a cousin from Queen Elizabeth? One more thing ... all the characters of the main 3 hero returned again to finish the job. Sarah finishes her work and goes to a future life. Jack does that too. Then why does Ethan decline? She is left alone, without a girl, without a map / campus / helicopter to help her return. What should he do? Send smoke signals? And if he comes home, does he return to his job? He should be given the same mercy to be killed outside the film which other heroes had. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time or money on this movie. We stayed only at the end because we could pay for it, but only those documents were beaten, while we were outside the door.
