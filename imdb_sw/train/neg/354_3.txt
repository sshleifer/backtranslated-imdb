Look carefully at the beauty of the talent put together to make this film: Connery, Fishburne, Capshaw, Harris, Underwood, Beatty, Thigpen, even come to Slezak, Lange, and Plimpton. Confirm, in spades, adage that beautiful cast can not store the bad script. The story line needs a lot of faith from the audience that its improper possibilities should be even higher than Hollywood levels. Not particularly original, and "misleading" is bright bright.
