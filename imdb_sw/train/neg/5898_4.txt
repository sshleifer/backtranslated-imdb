Basically, take the fancy of every movie of the air of fear of Asia and beat one and get this movie. A story may be like this: a group of college students receive emails from their phones that predict their deaths. There s *** continue with ghosts, which if you have seen the cinema spirit of Asia, it does not end now. This film was very sad because it is very clich√©d. It's the same brass, a different movie. It was very good. Unfortunately the executives are placed in the most advanced Gonga-esquire mode, so it's not something we haven't seen in the past. Two leading actions did not work well. <br /> <br /> Apart from the year, there is not much going on. We get a good sequence that includes a hand around the head (I don't know how to describe it), but it was cut off so you could see anything except the end result. You see blood on a regular basis, including a weapon with a zombie (which appears to be too cold I can add), but this film also has not lost blood. The scary of the film is few and it has spread out, and it's not a very frightening thing. You will find images of trophies sometimes, but it's not enough for me to think scary. It is not different from Ringu, Ju-On, or Dark Water, and none of those feared. That is the shortage of this (and many Asian films) is that if it does not commit guilt then it is not just good. <br /> <br /> Besides leading, Takashi Miike still did very well work. He seemed to be a little player in this movie compared to his previous movies, but he still shows his beautiful style that has been popular for. Many pictures were like Miike (including an area that had a bunch of deadly crocodiles), and 15 - 20 minutes last appeared over Miike then the remaining movie. However, the film is destructive to its unoriginality. <br /> <br /> I would like to recommend this only to people who are great on Asian horror movies (even if you, I can recommend the best) or great Miike fans. Warning for those who want to enter Miike, this is not his best work. <br /> <br /> I'm giving you 4 because it's normal. Maybe if this was released 4 or 5 years ago it could be worth the maximum. Also, I would like to b **** about the awesome Asian movies quickly. How to come as a movie of the fear of Asia is automatically suppose that good here (US)? The LOT of these movies is the same in Japan for what is shouting, urban cities, and I know what you did at the end of the summer was under 90 years. If you have seen one you have seen them all. And many of these movies depend on many ways of horror and pictures that if they do not make the events they did so it is not good, and nothing can change. Most of the Asian fear films should be more like a review of two Muslims, two fearless movies or scary, at least they have good stories, acting, manuals, movies, and much more to save. Two movies that are not just movies, but big movies in general. Most of Asia's fearful movies are needed to be like these instead of pictures, "The Spirit just wants to be found so they went around to kill people through their phone / video tape / house / electricity / water pipes / google search engine / vibrator / groceries / and so on.
