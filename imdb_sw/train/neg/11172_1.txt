The 2002 most popular "I Love the 80s" is not recommended is an unpleasant, arrogant, offensive and disgusting pop-culture show that was the first in a long line of endless television programs that ultimately described the end of VH1 , which was one time the only targeted music channel was left on TV! I was living for VH1 until winter or cold, I forgot what now, in 2002 when the trash like this began to appear for no reason at all. From the curiosity (I would like to think what you call) I decided that I would go ahead and look at it - see, however, the first night came even though the ads seemed like a complete trophy. At least I can honestly say that I was not disappointed with it because my expectations were clear under the lower level of start. The highlight of this show I found in the first 5 minutes was less than every year of the 1980s and what was large and unknown in nature (which was what I was expecting to see), but instead of an impromptu platform for all people killed by without the name of God-nameless to show where to think of their comedic skills * looks at the eyes ... more like its lack if you ask me! It is very easy now to see why no one has ever heard of any of these idiots before they appear on this show because they are all so unwanted so much and pathetic in their experiments in so-called "humor" that I could feel my intestines top and every line The rancid shot straight! In general, I have no difficulty saying that "I love 80 years" was / is the trash of the denominational bottom, and one of the main reasons why I almost never look at VH1 again.
