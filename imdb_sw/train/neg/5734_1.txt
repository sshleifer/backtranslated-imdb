This is a kind of film that is so bad that you can't stop watching because you keep telling yourself that 'it can't continue to be crappy to the end. It's just '. You know, 'worse than 4'-dirt bad type. <br /> <br /> I certainly think I've seen only one movie that was worse than this, and then we're talking about how you'd end up in hell by lying or watching the ball. ? Indeed with lots of lots. Well done? There is no way. <br /> <br /> Acting is worse and the whole line is cousy clich√©s. Same goes to a story story that includes only sex, blood and violence, like many movies of the year. <br /> <br /> If you hope to mix between the Killer Killer and August Low? keep looking. You will not find it in the Settings Settings.
