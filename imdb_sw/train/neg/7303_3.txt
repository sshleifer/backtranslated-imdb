Cabin's film is the first film directed by Eli Roth.Roth and Randy Pearlstein co wrote a script from the story of Roth.this a zombie film, which is widely claimed by George Romero and "old live movies", and the nature of Chainsaw Texas Massacrenot to mention "Sam" of Sam Ramie .There is nothing original here, and the story is not forcing. The work is on this type, it is only a story that fails. You see very much this film before and did well.having said that, after achieving commercial success, if not successful from this film, Roth decided to become a director and came out of a serious shock , meaning of the soul, meaningless (though it is more than a desire) who deals with Hostel.Roth should stop when he was behind.Cabin Fever is not a good film, however compared to Hostel is a work of art. mind) to persuade this person that the film is the worst choice job.as for Fever fever, a weak 3/10 for not as aby smal as hostel.
