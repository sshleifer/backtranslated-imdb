What else can you say about this film, but it is very clear. We have Louise and Adam West are the reasons for seeing this, but, they are, but their talents are destroyed in this junk. I think they used twice in some of Adam's events, like when he runs because you can't see his face. If Adam was embarrassed to have a dream of Zombie, think what he should be wondering about here? If it was before or after, I don't know, but, yet, Zombie Nightmare is a classic (see Secret Secretary Science Theater 3000 first and last) compared to this.Genge is very annoying and over-acting with some of the actors. Wild One Marlon Brando, of course.We look though. I hope he and Adam get good paycheck! Go!
