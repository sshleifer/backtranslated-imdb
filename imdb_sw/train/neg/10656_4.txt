What can I say? Movie Kamal Hassan scary. He does very well, but it is a bad story, with a terrible trend. In my opinion of the kind, the director Gautham Menon must stop leading. There are many problems in the movie. Besides, one can only believe how true that crime is. There was no performance in the film. Gautham is running out of the story. But Kamal Hassan and Jyothika do very well. Criminals seem to be bad, although their performance was not bad. I don't think this is a Sunday afternoon movie as Padayappa which you see and family. You can't get to sleep to see this movie !! However, Harris Jayaraj also did a great job, and that's why I have given this film 4 out of 10. Besides, cinema movies. In general, this is a bad, bad movie. Kamal Hassan, I think, should reject this film.
