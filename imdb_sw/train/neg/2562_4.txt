I would like to start by saying this movie has 1 amazing start at the beginning and the exchange between the author and George: Narrator: Huh? Wait a minute! Who are you? George: I have a new George. Studio does not cheaper to pay Brendan Fraser. Artist: How did you get that part? George: New George just lucky, I think. Sadly, that is the only part of the film in the entire movie. It was still enjoyable ... But again, I'm easily attracted to ... <br /> <br /> I can't say this is the worst movie I've ever seen (the header is going to the Movie very interesting ...), this movie is on the # 7 on my list below ... <br /> <br /> If your little child enjoys it, you will enjoy this film. If you are a film observer who wants a good, beautiful movie, You will be the end of shooting yourself half this way.
