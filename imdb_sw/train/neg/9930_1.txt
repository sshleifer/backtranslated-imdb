An unkind and sad-tempered transplant of Sheriff Bart from Mel Brooks' Blazing Saddles on his weekly sitcom, this is very bad as some people say it is! It is only a servant to remind the viewer of what is required of all this required comedy is intended to be a soup and how to refuse to laugh at the truth! <br /> <br /> However, it is very difficult to see Louis Gossett Jr. trying his ability to implement Little Cleavon. His embarrassment shows through each area. She was very funnier in the movie of HBO El Diablo than she was here in this slab of cheese! In fact the best and funniest thing about Black Black is the name of his horse!
