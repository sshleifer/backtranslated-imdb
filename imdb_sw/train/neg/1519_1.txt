I lasted only 15mins before self-care took me out of an empty brain entry that this film has caused and screamed back at the armored video store for carrying. <br /> <br /> Saying the movie was bad it would be a lost chance of using the words inserted by the characters from the top keys on my keyboard (just to put these clean comments). <br /> <br /> One to avoid. <br /> <br />
