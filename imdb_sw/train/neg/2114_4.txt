Just look at the set, staging and editing is easy to tell this project did not have the appropriate budget. Maybe Bela Lugosi means taking your thoughts away from such things. Little brides die on the altar after saying "I". Their corpses have been stolen by a doctor of the doctor of the doctor. Lorenz (Lugosi) and her older men are older (Elizabeth Russell) need a young man's needle to stay young forever ... ever good. The local local journalist (Luana Walters) knows that every lost bride was wearing the most common orchid on the altar; orchid which Dr Lorenz will be more knowledgeable. The modern fear of the movie storm makes a tour of real estate of Lorenz; especially for gray and shade of forest on the premises. Other players: Angelo Rossitto, Tristram Coffin, Minerva Urecal and Frank Moran.
