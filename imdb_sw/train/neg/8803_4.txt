I liked "Anchorman; The Legend of Ron Burgundy" and hoped this would be as funny, but alas, it was not. Some bits are better though. I thought the sports boy, Champ Kind, confessed his love to Ron Burgundy in a car filled with other members of the news team was hilarious. Everyone blames me and gets loud and finished Burgundy kisses that doesn't recognize either. But the whole story has no gel. It is an attempt to accept, however, to save unused bits from the first movie, including a whole plot about some of the local terrorists called "Alarm Clock". Maya Rudolph's Saturday Night Live is one of the members and has a few wonderful lines, but basically this non-used compound has good reason to be used in the first movie. Extra parts on this disc are very good, and most beautiful to be done in collaboration with lots of interesting votes, and faux explanations with Will Ferrell and "job producer" who Ferrell learns earlier was not part of any movie, shape or form . He returns he is a "only boy" who walked on the side of the recording studio and pretended to be a producer. It is a wonderful thing yet and it goes on for 10 or 15 minutes
