This film is just a shame. Orlando, Florida seems to be the most popular area of ​​the film (like Vancouver's rise to popularity). The brothers were shot in Central Florida and this short film was a bit of return to the area (which made a great deal with Indie Walking across Africa and a great HBO service from Earth to Moon). <br /> <br /> I'll try as much as possible. I think Orlando was a good place for a brother's film. It was able to provide a new spin on the craze of 'Boy Band'. After all, N'Sync and Backstreet Boys come from this area. But, Brother is probably missing because of the weak script. The two characters of the guide are flat and no closer development (part of this can be the actors of amatuer, but some of these are actually the script written). Also the problem is the choice of joke. Most congregations are repeating (they come out funny at first, but they become a little boring). Some events of the 'festival' occur badly (and many of these events also don't seem to transfer stories in any way). I was very optimistic about this, but woe to desperate efforts. I also have a good hope for a feature filled with this short. But I think the best thing for the film manufacturer John Figg is to move to different music (fast). Comedy is not his suit. But, it is not known that he is one of the most popular filmmakers in the Orlando area (it's just a shame that he is now a good, not popular). <br /> <br />
