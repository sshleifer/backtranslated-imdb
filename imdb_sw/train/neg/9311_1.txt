The cover on DVD and disk is amazing, you would think they made a film about a beautiful tooth off from a dark black color which is still a great idea, but this film actors are worse during Ben's performance in pearl port, a porn movie The better and better actors. I would be able to buy a DVD but by chance I used the first, conspiracy and script is also awesome, nothing seems to go together so the movie is never recommended. Poor tries to scare you by using flashback scenes is bad then those used in 80 sitcom shows and the end will leave you want to bang your bang against your home wall.
