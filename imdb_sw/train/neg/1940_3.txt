To write to journalists and required on the news officer concerned the media and the right uncle was ham-fisted and clich√© ridden. <br /> <br /> I can't say blame the executives, but certainly someone should say "Are you joking I cant say this!" The police, when the police perspective was sufficient, the media perspective and reputation had been overlooked by points that were unacceptable. I see that this was the production of co-HBO, if so then maybe the serehammer could be described by the light, it was the time of the press conference. there was no faithfulness and was not far from the truth. 40 minutes in the first place and I'm still trying to wait. <br /> <br /> Skip the Day of the Day. The 2008/9 production and these characters are much better and insist on even if crime is high. This story had an unforgettable time that could be described as impossible. <br /> <To the press officer to start a press conference without an investigating officer with a press release. <br /> <br /> so it is not possible to be like an amateur clock. I started looking for journalists called "Scoop" and Perry White to appear. I saw Hunter of 2009 before "five days" he did in Australia, not realizing it was prequel and he was expecting Bonneville and McTeer to move around again. The head is shaking too much.
