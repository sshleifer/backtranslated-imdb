For my life I cannot understand the good views on this piece. It was useless. Matthew Modine was a horrible shock like a woman who led. Gina Gershon, well, others have said that, but I will explain, why a stupid impression? Not suitable. And his work was very bad. I don't know if he was thrown by emotion, or what it is. There was no chemistry between these two. <br /> <br /> And the Modine girl was like and, suddenly she slides half the head of her mouth and acting through goofy? What? Where did it come from? I think we had to sympathize because we saw his marriage to the workaholic began to fall, but in fact, I wasn't worried about any of these people.
