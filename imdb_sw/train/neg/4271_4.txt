The most fun, it has been done many times before. Summary of the simple plan; The warrior Liotta faces Russell's wife, and tries to stop Kurt so that he can be with her. This is unpredictable, not even trying to make you think, conspiracy is a plot and no thinking outside the box here. I think then the only reason to look at it is to see how it goes, but nothing has been done before or the attraction. No actually say about this film, not too bad, but no good points either. Russell plays Russell and you know what you will find when you see him in the movie. Ditto Liotta. Stowe has a Cher-esque angry sound. I read a summary of the plot and could see the film on my head, it was obvious and basic. I looked at it and came before my eyes as I thought. I don't feel the tone of emotions inside. I have no feeling towards this film, it's like I've never even watched it. Considering this, is it a very cheap film? However, I will give you 3/10 for some reason.
