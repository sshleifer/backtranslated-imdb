The hearing of the clean-county county Jay Leno the words of four letters are the only thing to remember of this form of mismatched-police-partners caper. In the COURSE COLLISION, a team of fighters thought by the star and Pat Patita late track the stolen model of turbocharger (consider the lover lover Leno played hand in the plot?). They are both trying hard, they are actually doing, but Leno is not an actor and the external fish system is getting fast. The film carries a bit of '80s appeal, but its time should be very easy if it fills its time over 100 minutes running. Fans of the most talented comics of Leno will feel less; everyone will just be bored.
