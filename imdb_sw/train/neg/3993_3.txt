This movie was what I expected, not good, but also not bad. In my opinion PG13 movies are not awesome enough so that's why I already knew it would be bored in the whole film. Certainly there are some horrible things going on in the hotel room, but nothing we have seen. I think I didn't like it because I thought there was too much mix and turns happening; It has been old and repeat. I also did not know whether all Cusack items were in the room was real or not. No details of events occurred. The movie circles you and finally approaches you want to continue - because you are still waiting next to someone to tell you what the whole movie was. What I did is special effects. Other than that there was no great joy from them. Maybe it's just me but I thought this was less than average.
