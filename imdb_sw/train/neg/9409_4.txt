I loved this show! I think it was nothing wrong with that! It's just a few who don't beat anyone but just because the show doesn't suck! Some people just think this show is bad because of it. The story was beautiful and fun when other heroes seemed like the people of X, The Punisher, Daredevil and Iron Man! For the bad Sandman never seen but I kinda like it! Best of show ever! My favorite parts are: 1. Turning Point 2. Spider Wars 3. Hobgoblin 4. Costume Alien 5. Agenda Mutant was a shy look. And not like Morbius and Hydro Man. First Morbius absorbs plasma instead of blood and I do not like vampires. And it grieves me that he was close to the woman's 2nd season. Of course I must mention Hydro Man! He was awesome! I rather see Sandman! His last appearance was awesome. And I don't like the spider's man! But I think everything than this was bad!
