Words cannot begin to describe how blandly awesome this movie is. I wish it is "very bad is good," but it is not. It is good, it does not have life, and it breaks. It's too bad I can't even laugh. To deal with other posters, Anne-Marie Frigon is not a movie event. The only person who has a charismatic is a Brett Kelly director, who is a true statement about vanity, gave himself as a husband. Both appear as inbreeds, sisters and brothers. <br /> <br /> Gal, Sherry Thurig, is an observer. Contrary to Anne-Marie - interesting. This girl is long and willowy, and can act. Although you can tell him he holds back. All characters seem to have supported, especially supporters, Mark. I saw a small wood in the rainforest, but it's still better than Kelly. Why would Kelly make its participants stop? Is he really a bad director? Everyone else has described the story perfectly - no one. Children have been kidnapped by Kelly into the poo to solve the crime. I know how she felt in poo, how I felt after watching her film. Yes, I tried to get my money from the rental store. This is the best home movie left to be seen by the friends of the director (and if you look out, you will see those friends who gave the best film).
