Filmless boring film and Mercurio charismatic completely pass. Released for a minute on Thursday in one of the local movies and avoided by all residents of Sydney except me and four others BACK OF BEYOND is a project that appears to be composed by a producer looking for a fee. Local workers like John Polson and Terry Serio are more eligible (well Polson has worked for the director of strong attractions like SWIMFAN and hiding and searching) and Terry Serio seems to never find guernsey away from pork responsibilities. But Paul Mercurio must be one of Australia's exports on the screen. Such roles are great pain and film if this is losing talent and only time.
