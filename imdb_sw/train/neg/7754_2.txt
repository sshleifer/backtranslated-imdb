Traders will be in this. The movie would have been better if it had a different script, director, and CGI provider. Not right? The movie has a man starting his own park theme ... err ... zoo on a deserted island where people can see dinosaurs ... wrong ... Sabretooths and is called Jurra ... oops ... Primal Park. I am not interested in decreasing, because there are no natural ideas for these types of movies, but this one only looks at, and you say it. There is even the head of the "shadow on the object". Sabretooths, which are not sabretooths according to Mr. Primal Park (cats only former killers), are rather junky but the completion of the crown is one that I call "Sloggy". Because, after throwing one big cat, the hero is a little relaxing because there is only one left. Enter a feeder boy who says, And, we did three, three is a monster who pulls around his front legs. Great, groovy. A group of college students is also an island by hunting a sharp carpenter, there is an attempt to get into their meetings badly or kind (All drugs are required nickname). Of those who live, only one has completed their work, so I got that vote. Oh, we must "The Great Expert of the Afia" Clique is working and not one, but two of them! The death of Mr. Primal Park is the most unpleasant thing you will see in one of these films like the statue of the statue of the Sabbath (Sloggy's hospitality), reduces a few sizes, and places the man there. If I had just found it easy. I would like "Sabretooth" better than this to avoid.
