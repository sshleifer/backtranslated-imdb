What this stinkeroo turned out to be !!! One time, earlier in his career, Linda Darnell was one of my favorites - no big shakesho like Migizaji, but it's very good and pleasant (especially in the film as "Mark of Zorro" and "Blood and Sand") but when I saw this monstrosity , the memory of his golden days came quickly. The story is odd and incredible, acting second-rate, incorporated in support of failure. I can't think of any human performance and anyone compared to Tab Hunter, and Donald Gray had to be a very interesting person who could take it. It was added by this, it was a horrible picture (and not just talking about colors!) Everyone involved with this, must be afraid whenever you are shown.
