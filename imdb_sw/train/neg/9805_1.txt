I have never understood the popularity of the Power Rangers's Saban show which was only the second American standard proposed by the Japanese famous Japanese series of three decades ago! What was good about the Japanese version is completely lost in the US version, features, special effects, etc.. In fact most children will say that the power rangers are great but will not be correct. <Br /> <br /> I'm sure if they said Japanese, they will learn how much better than the American version. <br /> <br /> Power Rangers is quite bad, try Super Sentai instead! To search for the best show, try the Voltron The Third Dimension instead!
