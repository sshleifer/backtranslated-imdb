I am kinda decorated at DARK ANGEL. The movie seems to be a "love" tax for the largest pins of live - but there is a little "real" content that the film itself is not quite suitable. I can't see what is the inspiration or "sure" of this film - for there is very little news of the information presented in the details - so those who don't know a lot about Bettie can't know more after watching DARK ANGEL ... The film reports a few years ago of Bettie's work in the model of slavery. Nearly the whole film includes "new rules" of Bettie more "popular" pictures and pressures. These renewal instructions take up to 75% of the time films, and give a close insight into Bettie as a person. This film touches briefly on its short-term legal activities, and its subsequent decision after leaving the "business" and becoming a religion - but all of this is very good to be shown for long and enforced events ... ANGA ANGEL it is not a horrible film - no substance. Another problem is that the actors who play Bettie just resembles him in far shots - up-close is no-go. Another thing that was upsetting was that though Bettie made many stalks to make a model - the only weaknesses in the film was the shortest spot on the zoo at the end of the credit. The film itself is very evident budget, but what it does and can be put with the skill of the clothes within its limitations - so no gripes from me there. Acting is a good wooden and unknown from everyone involved. In fact - anything memorable about the entire film to me, he was seeing at the end of credit that the actors who played the real name of Irving Klaw is Dukey Flyswatter. There is no joke - check the list. It cannot say that I recommend this one very much unless you are Betty's perfect and you must have anything related to it. And if you're bad - then you need to seek treatment anyway ... 4/10
