My dear and I used this because we thought it might be good 'Halloween' to take. The killer scares the young, the white mask ... you get my drift. We were not dead! No pun is planned. We not only discovered one of the worst movies out there, but also that it is a tribal tribe! It is full of w / holes and is unwise. Leisure who plays Maddy is good, but that's about it. I give credit to that it is hit on a very low budget - I always help such movies. Not only this. <br /> <br /> This movie can be good to see if it's up or down; otherwise don't bother. Unless you want to lose your film privileges as I did!
