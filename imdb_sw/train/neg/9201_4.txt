This is the film that faces the D&D fears of 80 years (and even today). Fears are that people who play D & D (or any play for that matter) "will be included" and lose their ability to differentiate facts from fantasy (and continue to kill wrong, child sacrifice, suicide, etc.). Great movie for anyone who likes to blame social problems on non-living things, but anyone who has played a game of play, video game, or even worked in play will see this being insulting to their minds. It's for D&D what Wargames was for a computer. More like a movie, it just kinda uses.
