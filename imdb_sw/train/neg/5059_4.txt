If you want to see a film about two senseless characters, this is one. Acting is very good, both from John Cassavetes as a paranoid of a madman who, as the word goes, quite right to be out, and from Peter Falk as his closest friend who he returns for rescue. A big mistake, but since they are all gangs, and the ignorance of the destruction of the boot, it is difficult to determine who to strengthen for LESS. The author / director alone Elaine May could get away from this. I thought it was amazing that in a long interview with producer Michael Hausman included on the DVD, he said that the two stars had "different ideas" on the script, that the director was almost impossible to work with, that the director of the photograph was allegedly impossible made by him, that the workers were always angry about being kept around, and so on. This scenario of a very large family is exposed to the screen.
