I did not say that because the production standards were very low, but because they were made too much. Does the shot of the girl wash her hair on the ferry? What? Really we need to stay there to shoot more and watch him do it for 5 minutes in one spot? It was terrible, the lights were very bad. You can watch anything and when the characters talk, you may listen to what they have said. I watched the entire film? Of course I have not decreased significantly, and I do not want to hear anyone says I need to look at everything first to judge. This film was well done and implemented that even with self-esteem and low budget levels it is obvious. Bad movies ... don't waste any time unless you want to laugh good, but never because of the "funny" artists, it is because of the pain of production is.
