After seeing the contrary I had a great hope for Alive. The film details behind the DVD jacket appeared promising. Alive did not give. Promotional speed. Loads of capacity and beaten with cool pictures. The cluster was awesome but the benefits did not prevent it from building. It can do much more at the end. Most of the film is "sitting around". To make it clear, three of us were required to sit down and watch this film with a 50-minute mark we tried to do so to the end. Needed some terrible things. If you are looking for a Killer or War of different types then save yourself with the luggage.
