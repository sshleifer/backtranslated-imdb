I finished reading a book on the work of Anita Loos and pictures in TCM Magazine of MacDonald in her angel's costume looks great (attractive wings), so I thought I'd look at this movie. I have never heard the film before, so I had no previous ideas about it. You thought it had started with good and Eddy as a playboy and MacDonald as a secretary who does not exist. The area that he shows in the dressing clothing in his simple angels' clothing and a non-cooperative with wings that will not be above was beautiful. I had a movie when Eddy went to sleep and thought of him as a real angel. But after a while it began to fall for me. Eddy sits "asleep" for the whole movie, so it's all the dream. Whatever happens from there doesn't matter, because he just writes. It was all so beautiful and useless. I had to force it to stick to it. And the last number where MacDonald goes from the mobile number to the music number in a certain bad venue was quite clear. <br /> <br /> Is Eddy "liked" quickly and the original story continued, or was married, I think it would be more interesting. I wanted to see more of his true character. There were no music numbers available to call music. His songs were good, but the jitterbug number which MacDonald made was like nails on the board. And then with his voice of work. However, Eddy and MacDonald can still shine, show the real stars they were.
