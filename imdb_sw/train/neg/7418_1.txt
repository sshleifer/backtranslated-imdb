O god, it's a bad, horrible film. Given that the comments on the state of the community, it is just an example of the worst in the realities of the TV. Audience attendees with Jason Jones and Don McKellar are part of a more sensitive, written voice that probably means having a thought and understanding. Instead, this is a concern when talking to a camera and a written conversation by a man who has a love of cutting, a humorous speech that draws "meaning" of the film under the viewer of the viewer. Also, the certainty will be authors of the film: Long time it takes and the art of art is not the same as art. Neither are many ivory or logic are excluded because of ignorance. If anyone out there is willing to watch this film, please do not do it. Great. Please. You have the best things to do.
