Antonons movies were not well. What always wondered about them is that, instead of the beauty of plastic beauty, there is a safe and didactic "psychology" of characters and situations. Remember, for example, a conversation between the Mastroianni and the "evil capital" who wants to sing in "La Notte", or Monica Vitti laughing to farmers who are having sex in "La aventura", or Ferzetti giving a glass of ink at the end of the film. I've gone through "Zabriskie Point". In this film there are a lot of beautiful shots and elaborate on the office of Rod Taylor, roads and LA roads, advertising advertising, desert, etc., which shows the fascination of the author on his US journey, similar way than Wim Wenders years later. Unfortunately, there is a lot of clich√©s of the hippie-leftist that destroys the movie: - The boy leaves the meeting, steals the birds and jumps over the desert to pull out himself and get "something different". - Actors in gray suites say all the time about patience. - The girl looks at "something of women" in the swimming pool and leaves because she does not want to be like them. - Few middle-class fuel in the caravans say, in front of natural beauty, to build a hotel and earn a lot of money. - Last but not least, many couples who love love in the wilderness. Sama hippie! Sorry, today, the century century after the "La Aventura" revolution "we can see that the king is naked, and his films (except" Le amiche "and perhaps" Il grido ") are few only the consultants and the most common areas.
