This movie is not only suitable for time or money spent. Full of clich√©s and conspiracy that makes absolutely no meaning! I do not believe that many people have given this bad movie. <br /> <br /> If I could give this film zero, I would. IMDb bad does not allow it. The only reason I looked at because I went with a friend who wanted to see it. What is sad is that I have never had a good expectation from this film to start and yet I felt changing. Use my word, don't waste your $ 8 on this trash piece. The only entertainment I received from the film was the name of the directors. For all, it's not so much!
