It's not a bad movie, really, and Glenn and Keitel are the top characters. Additionally, they do the work accepted by the very weak script. The good condition is lush and the plot has an interesting effort. In addition, I explain why these actors and employees performed the film, are professionals and are paid. But I wonder why the studios spend time and money to make the film and then unlock it for the audience of theater games? Even if the film is a box-office flop, it certainly makes money. If you are a fan of Keitel or Glenn, rent a video or take it on TV, as it did. It is true, the movie will not help solve unary immigration with Mexico, but experience is much better than the rate of 90% TV Today's TV.
