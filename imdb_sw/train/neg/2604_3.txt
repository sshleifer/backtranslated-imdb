Doppelganger has its time, but it is few and in the middle. In fact, this is a mix of B pop-psych thriller, a story of spirit and fear. Drew Barrymore plays a young woman who is hated by the old demons (most of her family have been killed and was in one case at least, the main suspect), or has just had a very bad case of many problems? George Newbern is a new partner for his room, with many of his facilities on it. Newbern's behavior is very good, and she and Barrymore do a good job (though not very good). Short (at times) the awesome script and non-visual appearances seem to be connected to sink all the display in trouble. Leslie Hope's behavior is not memorable, but it is irritating that you want to forget him. Finally the plot includes being part of the button (one story is psychological originality, the other is a horrible spiritual) peak out of the worst pregnancy, acted and photographed that faces the most effective value of the film that was found earlier. Overall, the film feels about what it can expect to be the first result of M. Knight Shamalyan first class of film. Acting with the script for two guidelines is just good to make you look a little bit on them - at least until the film will be completely destroyed. <br /> <br /> My recommendations - send your doppelganger, but try the first-person meeting.
