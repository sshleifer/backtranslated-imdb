The third part of the "terrible film" and another boy in the planned house asks a "non-outdoor" observer and (unfortunately) gives us three stories to prove why. The first story involves young couples in a car accident that meets two psychologists. It leads up to two predictable twists. Still, it's fast (about 15 minutes), violence, positive and practical. Expected but enjoyable. The second involves a man running after stealing a large amount of money. His car is coming down, he has been attacked by a dog and is in a nearby clinic. VERY EXPOSURE, poorly done and very slow. Even for 30 minutes this is too long. Good work though. <br /> <br /> The third is just a terrible story. It involves a beautiful, lonely woman looking for Mr. Right. It has good setup plans, feel good enough and good sex area. But (again) unpredictable and even far too scary. <br /> <br /> Approaching very ridiculous. <br /> <br /> For all, first it is worth looking, but that's it. Dial for one then then life.
