In general, the highest and filled with more things than the swiss cheese has holes! Director and participant-writer says he wanted to combine forms - in this concert and drama. Well, here, mix these two like vinegar and oil. For boot, comedy is not very funny and young. Additionally, the film is not really true. Freedom is taken about the legal system in making French citizens against their will and the ease of drug abuse in the French Hospital. I watched this film on my great home screen and I found myself talking on the film to continue. Finally toward the end I served the last last speech one of the main characters makes the old boyfriend. At that time I was exhausted with the confusion of the deal that deals with a dead partner, an easy marriage with a former nutty partner. Sometimes the plot gives families of the two main characters and then goes back to one of them - either Ismael or especially Nora. For the impact of the audience, the view continues to change from Nora and Ismael, her former boyfriend wrapped up against her will in a psychiatric hospital. There are likely two potential films here that are not developed. Epilogue is not very good for many plots and it seems that the viewer believes Nora somehow will be happy though he has been given his life in real life space that corresponds to the position of the snow ball. Actors are doing good work and are fascinating, but this is not enough to overcome the negative mistakes of poor writing, editing and lack of consideration.
