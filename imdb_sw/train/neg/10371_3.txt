Or "Marlowe In the Sea". However, another former film has ridiculously overrated by Bogey. Similar talky, too. Bogey basically has similar characteristics in Marlow movies; always in control of the situation, never angry - no matter the danger, it calls women "small" and "ladies" and other trivial, it is "only male" ie male male in the movie (only male male alpha male) The head of the Gestapo - but he is just a male male), and - usually - every attractive young woman who comes her way can not resist her perfume and wants her penis within hours of their initial introduction. Clich√©s of all the characteristics here. Bogey is supposed to be one type of shock-of-reform as in "Casablanca", and usually he refuses money or other valuable items when it is available - but how does it face a hard cynic in it? It does not, so it can not be a shock; Hawks wanted both ways: a character that is a "special frost of the cynic" and it is still humanitarian. I don't think so ... Bacall does the first time, and there is not a lot of intervention, not all very interesting called "innuendo" to exchange it with Bogey; These talk silly sounds and standards today. "Just your mouth bag and urupe ...". The crap load ... He had 19 at this time it was done but it looks much greater, and it is not much worse than the female stars of that day. The face of the bony, with its strong features, does not exist anywhere near the brightness of the beauty of Havilland's beauty, the cutting of Myrna Loy, do not leave the heritage of Irene Dunne. Bacall was more suitable for playing hurricanes, not women-fatales. (In real life he is like his face: bitch Hollywood.) There is a place where Bacall breaks tears; is not suitable for his behavior. There are two or three bad music numbers - but my moving button was ready. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in reading my "biographies" of Bogart, Bacall, Huston, and other Hollywood people, contact me by email.
