I watched this film at 3 am, when I am very common to open the time of coming to the cinema. But I still think it was not good, this film was not quite good. The reason is why. It is not all good, and often the situation in it reminds the poor comedy 90 Chevy Chase. I mean, come, as a state of hand, and a poker situation among the servants ... This movie was completely open to the first foundation, and that's the same. But if I didn't see first before I saw this, it would be even more full. As the end, it came suddenly, and I felt like I had not closed what had happened ... Sebastian changed very suddenly, and this movie looked like it was just made to describe nr 1, and if no time or effort was used in doing anything else. The mark is the same as the first one, and it doesn't feel like a full film ... <br /> <br /> They should handle the situation with more style and class, but they didn't use it, and therefore, this movie turned out bad ...
