The directors refused the version, which I saw, was very long for this type of film. Almost two hours is a very long way. If you have a choice, certainly go to non-directors to cut. <br /> <br /> The main plot is not found at all, the movie has a large part of several scenes of murder, which are connected but the feeling is that they are only shown to fill the movie with the violence of the sponge. The connection was not disclosed to the last place and the lack of environment struck me long before being there. <br /> <br /> As a horrible movie does not work. You cannot get the feeling needed for characters due to the normal acting and general behavior (the character has been submitted, 15 minutes later the character has died). This photo power side is located in the splatter section.
