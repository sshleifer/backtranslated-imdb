What? What is in heaven? What are the birds? What is Superman? Then, no? It's TURTLE!!! See, that's what the Cold War is! No bad news only with other issues! Americans are attacking a Russian aircraft somewhere on the Artic district and a decline of the future explosion and activating the main prehistoric village called Gammera. He is not a friendly host because it leads to destroying everything and everyone on his way. The government negotiating finally decided to kill a bad bastard with a brand new and super-modern ice-bomb, but Gammera has another surprise in the store? Turtle's destruction can fly! At first this happens the result in a huge chain of chaos! Gammera is lying behind him unable to be attacked when suddenly a fire blows from his buttons and he skyrockets himself on the air. Can't you love it? Then there is also a very small plot about an angry child who can contact the telepathically leader, but that's not just enough. Rope jump, people! There is a little something to write about this Japanese effort (and America's restored) Sci-Fi, except that it is quite clear and quite amazing for scholars such as the original Godzilla and Animal from 20,000 Fathoms. The effects of the monster are the biggest hokey and, unlike the previously mentioned films, are never to create a blind environment. Responsible administrators like Brian Donlevy ("Quatermass Experimental") and Dick O'Neill ("Wolfen") seem to be unaware of what films they put up and even the original Japanese exhibition did not agree. Gammera's own themes and personal ones are rather cool, though, so they get one extra point for it.
