This is a Japanese film but there is quite a bit of English spoken here. It is a good, well-made film, which is a beautiful, beautiful Hawaiian. However, that is the only quality of redemption for me. The story was generally bad. Who wants to look at the sulk young woman for 90 percent of the film because her husband "pictures" is too old than she declared she was? In fact, that can be bummer ...... but get more! <br /> <br /> Only in the last 10 minutes he will make close-face and have fun with it. At that time, for many viewers, it was a little too late. We would like to sleep at that time.
