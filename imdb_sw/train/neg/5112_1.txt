Awwww .... yes, it is the heart of the heart and all that the unhappy family is taken by ABC / Sears and has their home "restored." That is where human appeal has ceased. I liked earlier during the flight, but now this show has become too many. Ten families needed can be given luxury homes with many family items for each family that each part of this shows splurges on. People in Habitat for Human beings should move their heads to unbelief. For example, is it important for a sixteen-year-old boy of sixteen to have a jacuzzi in his bedroom, or has a lost bed with hydraulics "Low Rider? What? Mother needs its importance, without running and losing the old pick-up truck to be restored and "pimped" with some of the best California uploads? A new person would work quite well, and perhaps with a third of the price. Do people need sixty-five plasma screens in each room? And then there is a question of who pays the property tax and the increase of bills. Even after zaniacs in "Makeover" leave, someone still has to get life. I assure the friendly people under the Social Services will see humor in all this great. <br /> <br /> This show is nothing more than a grabber ratings for ABC, and a bright business for its sponsors.
