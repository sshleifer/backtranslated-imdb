One part shows the idea of ​​"Woman's Terminator" very well: Karen Sheperd and another woman are trying to escape from the villain camp. Karen runs an armed soldier, who takes his gun, but after a few seconds he gives us and defeats him. Karen takes him in the balls, takes the gun and runs! Then again, when the film is directed by a military artist and written / produced by another member of his family, you know you should expect too much. Karen Sheperd and Jerry Trimble get an exciting booth to go early, and the film can be better if it had more focused on their love-hate relationship. But after 20 minutes they separate, and the film decreases by crawling, and even with a constant fight for things that happened, it is not worth the excitement. The end reduces Qissi's battle into the cave and Sheperd going to a dual-a-fight against Ashley Hayden on high speed, but the fight is intercut through which it breaks their flow and decreases their value. On the positive side, kudos for the expensive department to give Karen an opportunity to show a spectacular display in all the film! (* 1/2)
