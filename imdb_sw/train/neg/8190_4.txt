Take me: the form of Christmas painting of fatigue. Laughter is tired and talented behind it seems to be too. <br /> <br /> I like holidays such as a second person (even though I often have a bad blues for vacation), but it seems to be just giving us for a Holiday Holiday group that would be a bad movie every day of the year, but that does not make them a little painful during the season. If we had some of CLAUSE 's movies available (three and * gulp * still counting), who wants to see a film about her brother? In a conspiracy that would have been home and franchise of SANTA CLAUSE of Disney (secure regular humor and assistant "Little" of Santa wearing a short skirt), FRED CLAUS is the power of the same single roll in the next 116. Nick has a brother, but where does he go from there? <br /> <br /> It's a real shame. FRED CLAUS has been blessed with a cast that can be a fun comedy of Christmas time that may melt with snow, but it would be better than this. Vince Vaughn is your typical snob, but we are led to believe that it is actually a long lost brother of Santa who cannot grow (Paul Giamatti), who invites his good brother to visit. Mrs. Claus (Miranda Richardson) is reluctant, and worse, an effective professional (Kevin Spacey) has looked at the Christmas Father, and around him being bound. Ha! And I think who plays Santa's mother! Kathy Bates of course. Elizabeth Banks is the assistant of Santa Charlene, John Michael Higgins is one of the elves, and Rachel Wiesz has a partner of Fred! I don't know if I would like to say or move it. Here we have an excellent face to increase touch quality, but they have been given a very small way to work with. <br /> <br /> About humor, the best that FRED CLAUS could come up with Santa's brother to be contrary to the opposite of the story of DJ elf. I admit that I had a few minorities that included Fred attending group counseling for private brothers (where he joined Stephen Baldwin, Roger Clinton and Frank Stallone), but young people start and end up there. Worse, the movie is experiencing feelings that should make us "feel good" and teach us a lesson about "what Christmas means". It seems, what Christmas means to Hollywood is getting the amount of our money on Christmas shopping if they can. <br /> <br /> Rating: ** out of 5.
