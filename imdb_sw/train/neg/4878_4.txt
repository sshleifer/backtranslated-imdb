If you want to make a film like this, the threat is real. Don't move around your moby with the Bonzos group. There is no trust here. The program is small and impossible. Acting is worse. I thought I was looking at Arthur Lake (Dagwood) who was one of the worst actors in history, when I saw the main character. Oh well, for some time he should deal with music and get mad fighting. I don't care. What? There are all these long-term events set in this improper office (furniture made on card or masonite). People talk and pull and don't have anything. Many steps take place in a five-minute sequence. After that, it's up. Don't bother.
