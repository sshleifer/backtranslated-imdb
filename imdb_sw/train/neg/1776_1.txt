This film has its share of negative views and must agree with those who see it as one of the worst movies made. In fact, many films based on the actions of the King are very bad, but this goes beyond the worst in the horrible area. There is no time to hide in it unless you see that evil is frightened. It is an example of the King's garbage - false stories circulating that they had no meaning in the first place, mixed with the obvious and called "events" which are about surprising as the Playhouse of PeeWee (which, at least, are entertainment). It is full of ignorance, not less of Alice Krige's behavior. When it goes on the rampage and starts to attract as a villain in the old show of Batman TV, it's very strange to be ill. All people who had comeos in this (including John Landis) are lucky they still have a job. But the most amazing part should be the string of the string towards the end, which looks like cheap rubber clothes that are bought at K-mart. The best part of the movie is the appearance of real cats that are out making people in the film.
