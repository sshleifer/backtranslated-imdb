I usually have no problem with free filing, but this has misled me. They all did swear. For the entire film. (And, like someone else said, getting cancer) It was boring, running and engaging. I'd like If I were you. It is also not that I love films that, like many people who like it will want to 'look at life'. I like to eat a woman woman, and all that happens in that is that the burden of the Taiwan people leads their lives. But I was connected with them. I have never met anyone who has sworn as 'actors' in this film, and I was working on a construction site. So go figure. After saying that William H. Macy made me a grin. One time. <br /> <br /> 2/10. Avoid, unless you like to enjoy.
