The real embarrassment of the "congregation" is not to do evil, nor to the plan of improper injustice. The real embarrassment was that it was worse than the first series, although it had one major attraction: We were offended. I would like to see Laurel Takashima in the room with Susan Ivanova, even for just five minutes. He has that sarcasm, that is, the two rounds that are proposed and you like. Sadly, however, the experimental movie "Babylon 5" has a very incredible story involving murder. Patricia Tallman - who did not seriously return to the series until later - fortunately he got better with age like Lyta Alexander, who here is a little more than telepath, lighter. I'll leave you with one last thought - why Delenn looks like some sort of person-out frog man (though he is a woman)? Thank you heaven for the way that Minbari looked later in the show.
