You know the story. Little children alone in the forest, when BAM! Something that begins to refuse. This method does not exist. Then "unknown stars" are cut off, and their only help is a doctor / bike. <br /> <br /> Saying this movie was bad is losing, it's smut! Acting was terrible. Created with a lot of cheesy. And if all films do these days try to get you to stop by losing, which they don't! There is one bright spot for this film - the star who loved Maggie Grace as the female leadership.
