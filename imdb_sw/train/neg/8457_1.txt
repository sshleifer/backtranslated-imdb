I just watched this film because I was so impressed by Olivier Martinez in SWAT. But this is not SWAT. SWAT had a conspiracy with other competent characters and was wise. Bullfighter did not have these. I had to realize that it was impossible to be any good, after all, Michelle Forbes had the responsibility of the star always bad. <br /> <br /> One photo here called an unusual movie. Another called the worst movie ever. They both gave the movie on the loan very much. I am very happy to get from libraries for free, but I still feel reduced. IMDb needs to enter "0" in the "film" lots, just like this one.
