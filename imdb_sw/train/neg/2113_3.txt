The magicians die on the altar and their corpses are lost. No one knows why or who, but the journalist (Luana Walters) notes that every grandmother is wearing a strange orchid and is going to interview her creator, Dr Lorenz (Bela Lugosi). Now Dr. Lorenz is a ignorant scientist and other wonderful behaviors, including sleeping in the lids and incorporating his old wife (Elizabeth Russell) and young juices to take care of the younger. <br/> <br /> Impressive power and short time that should not get boring. Unfortunately, when it starts really well, it begins to remind you before half a half and it gets boring with its clich√©s and a predictable compound. There are good things about it - Bela Lugosi is so interesting and evil and it works with care; Elizabeth Russell is also good, suave, worried and very interesting calculation; and I am always a fan of Angelo Rossitto. Luana Walters also persuades the author here. <br /> <br /> Continues a bit of Gothic conditions and sets are beautiful. But in general, it could not manage to hold my interests through the whole picture, and therefore, I must give it wrong.
