The comparison between this film and 'Final Details' is made by others, but 'Chasers' is more than stretching the Interstate highway in Texas west. And if the desert landscape, there is nothing to distinguish, even the fact that a female prisoner is transported by two navy escort this time around. No one is healed come very well; with this cracked script that is not surprising. Dennis Hopper, director, can not provide many opportunities for this if he never writes memoir, I don't think.
