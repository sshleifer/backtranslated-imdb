This movie is another film of Christian propaganda in the line of Omega. Not that it is bad but in fact that many propaganda films offer sacrifices and facts of the message they want to give. If you are interested in the picture of the life-strokes of the street and the way the Gospel can change lives, perhaps you can enjoy this film. I say, forget your money and rent a Cross with a competitor or a mission. What will Christian leaders learn when people say bad things? It was amazing to see the criminals shown who are not allowed to swear (huh? The criminals say bad words?) And the flat characters that I cannot focus on. Also, it would be nice if the movie showed T&A Now that would be something that I would like to pay to see. Who was the head who compared this story of a small-movie movie with the Boondock Children and The Sting?
