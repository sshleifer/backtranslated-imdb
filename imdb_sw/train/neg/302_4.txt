I liked to love this film. I love the kenny hotz, and the spenny rice has a pleasant side to it. It's not that I love it altogether. Spenny destroys this movie. He should allow kenny and his girlfriend to fire the movie. <br /> <br /> However, it is boring away from the area with Roger Ebert in it. There are really not many celebrities in this movie, and many do not seem to say more than one line. In general this film was desperate. I would just like to see if you have got a DVD of Kenny season vs spenny (comes for free on 3 discs). Regardless of this production, it is still very excited to watch Papel Chase.
