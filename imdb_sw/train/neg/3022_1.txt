I was very excited about this film when I first saw the preview. I usually see this preview is good and I buy the movie completely. Something I tell you ... you know you look first. I am glad I did. Keira Knightley destroyed all future films for me and this role. In the movie 2 pirates when it came out I went to see it. All I saw was Domino Harvey and I hated him more. I think that it had to do with her hair and have a short cut to Domino. Who / Domino? Who is Domino Harvey? I still don't know or care. I don't know who was in real life or who was in this film. I was not worried about his behavior and even Keira getting naked horses did not do so worthy of the movie. The trend has never been missing. The writing was clear and unknown. Editing was awesome. I don't care as much as overuse his poor. There is a chance. Good models of fashion, MTV style, color editing (not sure if there is an official name) will be Fighting Club; just off my head. Even the enemy of the State had a similar style of editing. It was used for beauty and was not used as a string. I mean this is the same man who led the Top Football and Crimson Player. Tony Scott please give me my time back. I understand there are many people who loved this film. I think the idea that you will absolutely love this movie or totally hate it is a fair evaluation. In fact, I hate it.
