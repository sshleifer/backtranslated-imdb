Traders ... if something like that is possible ..... . . . . . As a fan of Robin Williams a powerful, I felt it necessary to buy this film as the first appearance on the screen. Wow ... I can't think a movie more-numbing movie. Basically, the movie takes one bad joke after the other that your uncle Artie would tell you after dinner and drama. Robin Williams has a lawyer at a skit of 30 seconds. <br /> <br /> I am all in humor, but this humor was not very humid, or caused ... There are no attributes of redemption for this film, except Robin Williams's staff, like me, who only have to possess every piece of film.
