This collection is worthy! I have hired, I think I would like to enjoy good fighting. This man was beaten! The rapid cuts of flashy, a very sad speaker, and their own struggles were radically changed and reduced (I think mainly on the fight against Jet Li in Fists of the story and fighting Jackie Chan from the master of drinking 2)> <br /> And it's what is involved with those on the street? What is "cool" about it? I've seen more interesting confrontations on the Martial Law! This is a collection of stupid cuts of ignorant people. <br /> <br /> You never bought this film! Don't encourage people who have made this trick do more than this trick! Instead, go buy the battlefields from the war and the fights in their glorious glory!
