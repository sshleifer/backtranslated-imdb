Sean, you know I think you're the world's best actor, but I can't thank you for this. Opposition is not your powerful suit. It is not all your mistakes. Some things were very difficult to understand. Alfred Lynch did a good job, but you have gotta wonderful where the lines came from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Once again, Sean ... I apologize.
