This is one of those movies with an amazing video box but it has a wired camera function and anonymous actors talking and a bad conversation. WCW (Tygres in WCW before closure) and he is a good actor. I love the low-budget films of those who are wrong because they enjoy watching but they are uninstalled not one of them. .
