I got this film in $ 5 in walmart. I would like to suggest watching this point. I might give one of my friends if I am angry with them and they want to face up to two hours. <br /> <br /> I looked at the lid and the summary and I thought it was a movie of war. I would like to know how this movie would be provoking before opening it. It was my fault to think of what was happening on this film. It's about a group of people from one camp to another. The pieces of digging make the soldiers very bad and the main character is trying to help people out of the fighting in Vietnam. Okay, here's my rant about this film: For me, this film is slow and hard to watch. It was just one of those movies that you enter and refuse to watch because you want to stop but you remain on the rope that can take up to the end. Not suitable. After the movie was on me through the back of my T.V because I was angry that I lost two hours of my life watching it, and another 10 minutes to write this review to warn people about it.
