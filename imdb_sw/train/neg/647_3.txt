Acting was bad with screens. It was well closed and it made you almost want to laugh at several instances of massacres. The latter was worse. Everyone continued to die, but somehow it made it seem like everything was so good! They did not give enough history about the teacher's intervention, etc.. Movie required a lot of time to perhaps develop a better story. The only reason I give this 3/10 is that I feel bad for small actors. They need to teach the best. They can make it a good film, but the screens and acting were badly defeated.
