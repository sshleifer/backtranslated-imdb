From the first time, this "thing" is a sharp chain of cuts in a very short time of the work of a blurry camera. When the general plot has all the potential for the exciting, the story is told very much that I can't buy it. From the middle of the film, the actions of the characters do not mean. Stop reading now to avoid SPOILERS. For example, Ed's idea to have Edna to make their coffee after his arm's hand is under his experience; it's just a stupid idea. Domino is not questioning the instructions of the pieces that he receives from Claremont Williams on connecting the phone to just break it; What? should not be a long accuser that Williams brings them into? Those FBI agents seem out of their mind to show up one helicopter for something that they have every reason to consider the mafia's shot-out. Besides, what they do to prevent information and leakage towards Cigliutti is very exciting for murder; it seems to me as to abandon right if that's how the FBI conducts investigation. In fact, they would have had a case that caused more than repair if they did like this. We see a car accident which would normally have been seriously injured if it had not been killed by many passengers but usually left them all in a few cases. On the contrary, the accident is immediately followed by Domino making love to Choco, which comes from a Domino perspective in no way off with the original events but by having a gold medication on the optic nerve. <br /> <br /> The entire series of events starting from the phone's Claremont Williams appears only to me if you want to be a razzle-dazzle great. This as well as the bad work of non-power cameras makes a piece I will try to call movies. Sorry for the lost efforts of chief executives, who have no questions.
