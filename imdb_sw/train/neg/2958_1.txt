This movie was awesome. It's more angry. I often join a group of friends and go to a movie store to get awesome movies for their comedic value. My friend suggested this, but when we look at it, people started to leave. I wanted to finish, so we could say that I was, but I couldn't. It's bad. The worst fears of running, dry. The main characters are the dinosaur klutz angry with Whoopi Goldberg. I would like to watch Watchmen Costener ten times than to see the part of this movie again. I think they are trying to deal with the discrimination of the dinosaur, but part of the movie which looks quite a dinosaur always hit things over with its tail, and then guffawing on it. It blows. Check if you are an eye specialist, otherwise, leave this alone.
