Go! ... I think. It's hard to say. It's hard to have a feeling about a non-emotional movie. This film is like fertilizer as the head of surgery. For settings, it has several stone columns, other stone stones, stone crosses and some stone actors. They have no feeling! The only thing that keeps this film is the fact that it is Hamlet, and Hamlet is a very written piece. Dubbing really isn't so bad though. The voices stood in a state of adversity, dilemma, dreary, the rest of the movie life released. I have seen this version of Hamlet at the Theater of Theater 3000 Theater Theater three times, and every three times, I was on the edge of the TV shutter, though it is MST 3K. The most productive drama production game.
