This movie is just awesome. John Ritter performed pratt falls, 75% of executives offer their lines if they were reading them from the cue card, bad editing, awesome sound mixing (conversation is difficult to take in places on the background noise), and the plot that really does go anywhere. I didn't think I would say this, but Dorothy Stratten is not the worst executive in this film. There are at least 3 other who exploit more. Patti Hansen provides his lines with Ben Stein's passion. I started to wonder if she was not dead. Even the children of Bogdanovich are bad (the oldest is read its lines from the cue card). This movie is very bad. There is a reason Bogdanovich could not get another project up to 4 years later. Please do not look at it. If you see it on your television list, disconnect your cable. If a friend shows you, consider your foolishness. If your wife wants to look at it, you are better looking for someone else's spirit. I would prefer to lift my eyes with the lawn arrows than to sit through this piece of rubbish again. If I could watch this film in one word, it would be: Suckotrocity
