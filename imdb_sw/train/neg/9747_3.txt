Ok first, this movie comes. But it chooses why. The suggestion that the machine has the ability to change the matter in energy, save it, and then use it and repeat it is an exciting thing. But that's far as they take this premise. Instead of focusing on what might happen if someone did this type of machine, they break something big. This can be a good premise. Live with the responsibility of this kind of power, and deal with the constant trials, ie the invisible person. But no. They break something damn. And Lembach wants to leave. So the doctor-jerry is engaged in it, and tries to transport himself. Just to have fun of his good but not dumb, secretary (duh). That will not happen if Lembach does not want to leave. So now he goes around the country to kill people because his small attempts have failed, and they did not want to give him money. Wah. Then make the movie worse, giving us a British connection between two skilled professionals to help her. Among their charity sessions, they make a half-half of the heart searching when it kills half of London. All of this would have been dropped by not breaking the damn machine, which had never occurred as Lembach did not stop. This film attempted to get a 2-star star for the effort, but it would be better if they did not break the demolition machine, and make a move to Lembach, trying again. Badn you Lembach !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
