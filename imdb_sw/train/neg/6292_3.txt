I wonder how much this movie actually relates to the movie 1984 "Bachelor Party", and star Tom Hanks. Is this a movie even a sequel official? This film does not exist in every department and you are more open without looking at it. <br /> <br /> For this movie comedy just isn't good or funny enough. Much depends on the evaluation of their behavior, but then the movie shows a good, original and wonderful time. <br /> <br /> Of course there is also a very small story now with the nude chest of film than the script pages. You keep waiting for things to get started. There is a main line of conspiracy in it somewhere but that one is very common and it is taken very badly on a film that feels more like something that is missing. I think there are even messages and moral stories in it somewhere but this is also very common and is not done in a film that doesn't work out. <br /> <br /> It is basically a comedy of young people, with sexual jokes and weaknesses, just without the boy's characters, which makes the story worse and less disappointing. The film makes a bad joke, which is lost for any type of film. I'm sorry to look at this. <br /> <br /> 3/10
