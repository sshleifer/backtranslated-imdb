Contrary to many other views on "Syriana" on the IMD web site, I and my family watched this film on a DVD home full time and space. In short, this was a film with a script whose author was very clever. Instead of trying to talk a difficult story through the intelligent and clear way, it was assumed that occasionally give us clear and not hard to connect with each other 30-second vignettes of different story lines from a dozen or so "story-lines" in the audience did perform exhibitions great and clear. No, sir, it's not good. What makes it to look for transparency is the full transparency, precision, plots and lines of stories - and attributes - beginning, middle, and end. <br /> <br /> This type of movie presentation - similar to the Dim Sum Experience in Chinese restaurant - is engaging in intellectual. Thank you for the good, then, for TV shows and a DVD movie star and the British movie of the 1940s and 1950s that the authors, director, and executives knew the value of telling stories, diction, and act that means something. This is one DVD that this family will no longer be.
