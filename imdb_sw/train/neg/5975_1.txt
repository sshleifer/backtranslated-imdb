I never wanted to see this film, then one day, for a joke I watched it to see how bad it was; my original comments were confirmed. <br /> <br /> For the predecessors I would like to interview the film politics. It hides behind the mask of women 'making it great in the city' but the only way that women can make it is by using their sex instead of their intelligence or knowledge. These women have nothing more. What? The smallest young girls are not allowed to succeed? This is not just the right wing of the film, there are hundreds of shots of American flags and big money wads. A good example of how the only power of the United States is innovation and anything of spiritual value, moral or artistic is not available even in this film. Money is shown as a special thing for young people. <br /> <br /> The bar administrator says that it does not allow drug users on its bar, and then goes to the poor taps of strong beer necks and then the neck of its employees and customers. Anyone who knows anything about drugs will know that alcohol can be dangerous as heroin and more dangerous than many legitimate drugs. <br /> <br /> And finally, why are the events in which leadership behavior is a sexual interest interest for the audience (when it gets stressed or with her partner) is her father always involved? We expect him to be stopped by the camera next to trouble his feet when he is a single phone for his father. He 'auctioned' his father as he 'auctioned' his lover. I see this extraordinary thing. In conclusion, this film is fornication, fascistic, humiliating to women and in fact, disturbing. But what else do you expect from Jerry Bruckhiemer?
