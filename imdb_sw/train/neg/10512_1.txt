I lost this flick for one reason Tom Savini, I respect his work but this was actually allowed, I was a horrible clich√©s, half of the film was naked women called "fallen angels" running around trying to frighten, oh and then there was a regular "Blair The wizard "black and white motion scenes scenes. Tom's character was very bad, a terrible script. And you should love these verses they use. "Is there anyone, who is out there, this is not interesting" No but your job was. I would like to give this flick 0! Oh the names of the characters. Judd, Molly, Ally, Emilio, but they came out of Anthony, The Breakfast Food Club reunited in the untouched forest.
