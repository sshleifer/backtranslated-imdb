You just saw the Chicago Film Festival - avoid all costs unless you have sleep problems. It is a full-featured film - it opens for a small quote from "Hiroshima mon amour" and all comes from there. Camera function - think of a child trying to imitate Wong Kar Wai. Mystery Line - Smokey Robinson and Miracles "Love I've seen In You was the Mirage" increased from 3 minutes to more than 2 hours but is full of repeat. By freezing the pain of this film and desks in the Methodist church my parent sent me when I was a child. I want 2+ hours of my life to be restored. The pastor of Julian Hernandez began to look at the view that the film was "controversial" - that's just true for the narcotic effect of the film.
